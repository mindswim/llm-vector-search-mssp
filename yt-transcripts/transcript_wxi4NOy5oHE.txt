00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:12.479
yeah who was your hot one who was your

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.400
hot tea we had a lady

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.960
that had giant tits but she must have

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.840
been she literally must have been 65 70

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.960
years old

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.199

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.280
what would you give to just titty [ __ ]

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.360
this lady oh none of us

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.360
were like seventh graders that's the

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.440
dark arts and that's when 9 11 happened

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.960
she was the lady who broke the news to

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.919
me about 9 11. no way giant tits lady

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:37.919

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.919
if a teacher it was hot i couldn't even

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:41.360
hear them when they were talking to me i

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.800
think that's one of the reasons why i

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.240
did why i had trouble learning it

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.720

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.079
like we wouldn't be able to handle it

00:12:02.079 --> 00:12:04.160

the yeah the ejaculate just

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.279

i remember he would put the marker on

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.720
the board and then walk

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.680

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.000
he wore the shortest shorts too he died

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.320

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.240
derek osner was his name or something

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.680

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.880
he died but

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.279
his son died too i'm pretty sure uh i

00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:42.399
don't want to say that but i'm pretty

00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:43.200
sure

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.519
and he had the biggest mustache like i

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:47.120
don't his words like i felt like his

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.279
words big mustache and he was talking

00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:52.480
bro his mustache came over both lips so

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.200
it was like

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.560
the words couldn't even some of the

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.839
words you just had to guess what they

00:12:57.839 --> 00:12:59.680
were people thought he was

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.959
some people thought he was black people

00:13:00.959 --> 00:13:03.839
didn't know what was going on

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.000
we just couldn't understand what he was

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
talking about it was crazy you know it

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.320
was just different times back then

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.160
it was different times

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.519
but yeah i've never really had an

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:16.399
experience really with an older woman so

00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:18.079
i i have not i haven't had that

00:13:18.079 --> 00:13:19.440
experience it's nice

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.519
is it you just let them go

00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:23.680
the dude i remember one time this one

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.680
girl was so hot i felt like i was afraid

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.440
to even go in the same room with her

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.399

00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:32.000
regular like

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.399
you know legally aged women it can get a

00:13:34.399 --> 00:13:35.760
little bit dicey but yeah i guess if you

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.279
have an older lady

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:39.040

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:49.840
that

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.200

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.039
you do it on the you audition on the

00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:55.919

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.559
also it's a lot smaller than you'd think

to do with epstein

00:33:26.559 --> 00:33:28.880

you never know bro there's a so much

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.440

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:41.840
gentleman and smear him

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.360
before the cancer like they weren't they

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.600
knew i wasn't like a conservative guy by

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.440
their standards yes i am of course but

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.960
they weren't like oh let's get this guy

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.440
because he likes trump it's like no i

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.120
literally auditioned with a joke about

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.679
trump dying right being funny

00:34:01.679 --> 00:34:02.480
right

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.440
so

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.799
go looking back do you feel like there

00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:05.679
was anything you could have done

00:34:05.679 --> 00:34:06.720
different or it was just this was the

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.919
way that this was gonna work out no

00:34:07.919 --> 00:34:09.919
matter what uh

00:34:09.919 --> 00:34:11.599
no i mean i definitely wouldn't have

00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:12.800
changed

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.359
what we did my our podcast

00:34:15.359 --> 00:34:17.520

got to new york right so

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.679
yeah it's interesting it's like

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:25.280
yeah that was just the way there was no

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.440
other way it probably could have gone no

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.720
was there a chance it would be less

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.720
funny if i was like pandering to try to

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:31.599

00:45:37.119 --> 00:45:39.119
big podcaster told me that he does it

00:45:39.119 --> 00:45:41.200

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.480
predator oh it broke my heart man when

his ass he legs up held his legs again

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.000
it was just

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.880
it was a lot for me to just take on

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.400
it's a lot

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.319
and i feel bad saying this in front of

riley over there i know

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.119

experience

00:46:32.319 --> 00:46:36.000

freak this is who he is this is the

00:46:57.599 --> 00:46:59.839
thing yeah this is we get to see this

00:46:59.839 --> 00:47:01.839
freak yeah yeah but then it's in your

00:47:01.839 --> 00:47:03.359
head when it's happening

00:47:03.359 --> 00:47:05.040
because like you see people like at any

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.480
show people talk to each other like

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.000
whisper at the table and then like are

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.040
you [ __ ] talking about me

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:10.560
[ __ ]

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.640
who are you i'm like you know

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:15.200

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.760
yeah so you'd be up there you just

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:21.359
you're in your head constantly oh and

00:47:21.359 --> 00:47:22.880
then sudden like you meet people that

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.599
are all you know comedians in new york

00:47:25.599 --> 00:47:27.119
and i'm like oh this [ __ ] hates me

00:47:29.359 --> 00:47:30.880
whatever

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:32.880
so it's just constant and nobody cares

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.400
no one else cares

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.480
it's just you right i wonder what most

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.319
people feel or think i guess you never

00:47:38.319 --> 00:47:40.319
know

00:47:40.319 --> 00:47:41.760
it's weird how

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.599
it's like yeah do people even really

00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:46.000
care it's almost like a lot of cancer

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.520
stuff it's not even a real thing it's

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.599
just it's no one cares no one really

00:47:49.599 --> 00:47:52.319
cared exactly what you said yeah no one

00:47:52.319 --> 00:47:53.440

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.440
i never once was confronted by one

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.359
person that cared really it was always

00:47:57.359 --> 00:47:59.119
just like well you should have been

00:47:59.119 --> 00:48:01.040

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.000
whatever

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.760

00:57:20.799 --> 00:57:22.400

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.240
be made

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.920
it's true they're kind of funny jokes i

00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:27.359
mean it's you don't think it's a funny

00:57:27.359 --> 00:57:29.040
joke but a squashing on a little caesars

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:30.079
pizza

00:57:30.079 --> 00:57:32.720
it's obviously a funny joke dude it is

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:34.960

00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:36.160

00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:37.599
right and this is the owner of little

00:57:37.599 --> 00:57:38.799
caesars

00:57:38.799 --> 00:57:41.839
holy [ __ ] dude he's got a roman haircut

00:57:41.839 --> 00:57:44.640

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.400
that's the drawing that's why bring up

00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:49.119
the drawing it is

00:57:49.119 --> 00:57:51.599
i think that is him

00:57:51.599 --> 00:57:54.599
wow

00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:56.559
i just

00:57:56.559 --> 00:57:59.119
i wonder so so look that's caesar's logo

00:57:59.119 --> 00:58:01.359
history if you wanted to be hateful you

00:58:01.359 --> 00:58:03.280
have to be creative if you want to but i

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:04.480
think yeah you got to do something

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.480
that's out of the box and that's going

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:07.839
to

00:58:07.839 --> 00:58:08.880
uh

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:10.799
and then once you're and then you i

00:58:10.799 --> 00:58:12.160
think you got a rap i think if you're

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:14.400
gonna go from having no

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.839
you need to have something to come back

00:58:15.839 --> 00:58:17.440
oh [ __ ] that guy does work at domino's

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:19.680
that is

00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:21.359
the guy we're talking about that is a

00:58:21.359 --> 00:58:22.720
chance he does

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:25.200
toss a [ __ ] symbol on a piece right

00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:27.280
but you don't do that well i would what

00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.799
i would do now is do something do

00:58:28.799 --> 00:58:29.839
something in the other direction you got

00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:31.280
to do a different type of symbol you

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:33.920
know i think you need to do like a mason

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:36.400
if they have a symbol you could do a

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.000
star david and send it to the people

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.480
that got the nazi pizza and make it up

00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:41.520
to him

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:45.280
you could do a um

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:48.640
i don't know what you could do it's kind

00:58:48.839 --> 00:58:51.680
of kind of the only symbol that's like a

00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:53.119
yeah like i remember when we were kids

00:58:53.119 --> 00:58:54.799
on a school bus we drew swastikas on

00:58:54.799 --> 00:58:56.960
some kid named scotty's t-shirt that's

00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:58.960
funny and he

00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:00.480
went into aftercare we didn't know the

00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:02.400
symbol meant or anything of course we'd

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:03.839
seen it on like pamphlets or whatever

00:59:03.839 --> 00:59:05.599
around town and

00:59:05.599 --> 00:59:07.920
and then we drew it on his shirt

00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:09.599
and then he had to wash the shirt right

00:59:09.599 --> 00:59:11.520
and so but he had to keep wearing it and

00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:13.280
so like it always had it on there a

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:15.839
little bit it was crazy man i drew a

00:59:15.839 --> 00:59:17.440
swastika on my friend's forehead once he

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:20.079
fell asleep no and he cried

00:59:20.079 --> 00:59:22.400
wow yeah that's that charles manson he

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.559
because he has one yeah

00:59:24.559 --> 00:59:25.839
yeah so i think you got to do something

00:59:25.839 --> 00:59:27.200
you got to wrap or do something i think

00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:29.119
to you got to really

00:59:29.119 --> 00:59:31.040
or come out of the closet via pizza you

00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:32.319
got to do something that's going to get

00:59:32.319 --> 00:59:34.000
you

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.200
that's going to get your name out there

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:37.040
so that's wild so you went from and then

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.040
suddenly people know your name yeah yeah

00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:40.079
yeah

00:59:40.079 --> 00:59:41.119
for sure

00:59:41.119 --> 00:59:43.119
is it weird when you see snl people

00:59:43.119 --> 00:59:45.839
around new york city yeah friends with

00:59:45.839 --> 00:59:48.799
like michael che right yeah

00:59:48.799 --> 00:59:51.040
did you ask any of them to put in a word

00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:52.400
for you no

00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.720
no i didn't ask no right

00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:56.640
what are they gonna do

00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:57.920
yeah and that's like a [ __ ] up thing

00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:59.839
to ask to be like hey risk will you risk

00:59:59.839 --> 01:00:03.359
something for me like i was just

01:00:03.359 --> 01:00:04.640
while it happened i was like oh i'm

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.720
fired for sure and then it just got

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:09.599
drawn out like i knew i was [ __ ] yeah

01:00:09.599 --> 01:00:10.960
because i think if they were mad about

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.640
that there's there's other stuff there's

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:15.359
a lot right like this is

01:00:15.359 --> 01:00:16.960
you know

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:20.559
do you think um

01:00:20.559 --> 01:00:23.040
do you think

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:26.319
that you would have fired you

01:00:26.839 --> 01:00:30.960
no but under the rules today's rules

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.200
yeah you have to right those are the

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.200
rules but if you want to you know what i

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.480
mean that's what i've always tried to

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:37.920
say like i didn't i don't

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:40.160
argue me getting fired right those are

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:42.319
today's rules if you want to talk about

01:00:42.319 --> 01:00:43.280
like

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.799
i would have to argue like we need to

01:00:44.799 --> 01:00:47.920
change the rules right you know yeah if

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.200
that makes sense i don't know if i'm

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.720
explaining that correctly yeah i think

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:54.319
so like the rules are what's

01:00:54.319 --> 01:00:56.480
i this might not be what's wrong the

01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:57.520
rules

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.520
there should be adjustment in the rules

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:00.799
yeah

01:01:00.799 --> 01:01:02.240
well it's so interesting when you take a

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:05.440
stand up from what's okay to be on stage

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.480
and then try to put it because you

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:08.079
weren't a sketch guy really are you one

01:01:08.079 --> 01:01:08.799
no

01:01:08.799 --> 01:01:10.640
no not really so you're in that space

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.079
suddenly

01:01:12.079 --> 01:01:14.319
and

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.640
do you feel like you were a good fit for

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:17.680
the show

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.200

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.680
i mean we made sketches and i did okay

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.520
in those yeah so i think i could have

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:27.280
and i think lauren saw that and he was

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.280

01:02:44.559 --> 01:02:45.920
cool one i talked to him for like an

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.559
hour no on the phone yeah wow that's

01:02:48.559 --> 01:02:49.520
crazy

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.200
yeah what does he say

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.280
he's another guy that's exactly who you

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.039
think he is you know yeah he was just

01:02:55.039 --> 01:02:57.280
like yeah

01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.559
i don't know i don't wanna i don't wanna

01:02:58.559 --> 01:03:00.640
put out the private right stuff but yeah

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.960
he was he was awesome

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.559
all that stuff all that stuff was cool

01:03:04.559 --> 01:03:06.880
there was cool stuff cool stuff happened

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.240
but it was again it was very surreal

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.160
like you'd i'd get off i'd be like holy

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.440
[ __ ] that's like

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.359
top five for me favorite comedians of

01:03:13.359 --> 01:03:15.280
all time just got i was just walking

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.359
around my backyard talking to him

01:03:17.359 --> 01:03:18.960
and then i come back inside to my shitty

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:20.079
apartment

01:03:20.079 --> 01:03:22.319
with my roommates with my 35 year old

01:03:22.319 --> 01:03:23.839
male roommates

01:03:23.839 --> 01:03:26.000
and i sit back down and turn the news on

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.400
it's like piece of [ __ ] shane gillis was

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.359
fired what a terrible person he is

01:03:31.359 --> 01:03:33.119
and i mean it was just very surreal so

01:03:33.119 --> 01:03:34.480
it was kind of like

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:37.359
i didn't even have time to be like sad

01:03:37.359 --> 01:03:38.319
it was just

01:03:38.319 --> 01:03:40.240
very stressful and like kind of funny

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.079
when i was just with my friends right

01:03:42.079 --> 01:03:43.200
you know

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.440
because they would just keep quoting and

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.200
they kept trying to get us in more

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:50.240
trouble by finding old quotes

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.599
and every once while they they would

01:03:51.599 --> 01:03:53.280
miss and they wouldn't be offensive and

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.960
it would just be funny

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.480
and they would publish them like a lady

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:57.760
from the new york times was like the

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.440
worst he called

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.599
civil women who fought in the civil war

01:04:01.599 --> 01:04:02.640
secretly

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.960
flat-chested [ __ ]

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:06.640
she like tweeted that

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.000
people were like this is pretty funny

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:08.370
stuff

01:04:08.370 --> 01:04:10.400
[Laughter]

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.960
she was like it's not funny

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.559
yeah they knew it it made me hate the

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:17.280
[ __ ] i hate journalists dude

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.039
la times in new york times it's the

01:04:19.039 --> 01:04:20.640
worst yeah it's like what are you doing

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.079
knock it off

01:04:22.079 --> 01:04:24.160
yeah why why are you trying to [ __ ]

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.599
somebody up

01:04:25.599 --> 01:04:26.880
i get it if you're doing it for like the

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.720
greater good if you're trying to like do

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:30.480
you feel like people are though that's

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:31.839
that i know that's the tough that's the

01:04:31.839 --> 01:04:34.160
tough part it's it's tough it's like

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.000
yeah are we aiming to do all this stuff

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.480
because we really like 50 years from now

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.640
you want everybody to not have any

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.640
judgments on each other or look at each

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:45.039
other in any

01:04:45.039 --> 01:04:46.319
because the sacrifice that in the

01:04:46.319 --> 01:04:49.200
meantime is humor a lot of times yeah

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.839
and humor is a risk like i always

01:04:51.839 --> 01:04:53.440
the thing that was always funniest to me

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.720
was

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.440
a telling a humor or being a doing a

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.599
humor when you

01:04:59.599 --> 01:05:01.520
write when it's not supposed to be done

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:04.480
like the guys are little caesars yeah

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:06.240
taking chances dude

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.319
yeah taking a chance yeah the guy they

01:05:08.319 --> 01:05:10.640
took they took a chance man they

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:13.280
somewhere he took a chance dude and they

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:15.520
are probably legends amongst their

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.280
friends they are probably

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:20.160
uh truthfully look never put a swastika

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:22.400
on a pizza right not advocating that

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:24.319
yeah they deserved to be fired yes

01:05:24.319 --> 01:05:26.160
that's a good cancel yep there's a good

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.240
cancel there yeah because it's dicey

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.240
you're using product to push your own

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.000
agenda

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.559
but those dudes are probably funny yeah

01:05:34.559 --> 01:05:36.400
there's no chance those dudes are not

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.280
funny

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.119
because they're not real nazis they're

01:05:39.119 --> 01:05:40.720
not right they were real nazis they're

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.880
not putting swastikas on pizzas

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:44.160
right they're doing other works they

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:46.720
understand how wildly funny it is for

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:50.720
somebody to open a pizza box

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.559
holy [ __ ]

01:05:52.559 --> 01:05:54.079
and here's the crazy they're willing to

01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:57.440
risk their careers now

01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.920
it's so funny i'm sorry the word careers

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.760
is awesome there's that little

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.520
word in there yeah but they're putting

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.119
it on the line that's true they're all

01:06:05.119 --> 01:06:06.960
in that's a good point like yo i'm

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.039
risking my little caesar's job

01:06:09.039 --> 01:06:10.960
this is going to be funny

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.440
it just blows up it's basically like

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.839
german roulette is what it is a little

01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:16.640
bit

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:19.280
uh you're right man so then the weird

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:21.039
part is the weird part sorry to keep

01:06:21.039 --> 01:06:22.480
cutting off but just

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:24.160
when they got home and seen that tweet

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.240
that lady that misty said or whatever

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.240
her name was it's like oh [ __ ] she's

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.079
pissed

01:06:30.079 --> 01:06:32.960
yeah we're in trouble dude

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:36.319
i wonder if they tried like 16 dude i

01:06:36.319 --> 01:06:37.680
wonder if they tried to blame it on the

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.839
delivery dude i bet they did

01:06:39.839 --> 01:06:41.920
i'd be [ __ ] scrambling to blame it on

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:44.079
anybody they probably had to interrogate

01:06:44.079 --> 01:06:45.760
them separate be like your boy snitched

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:46.960
we know

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.319
my boy would never snitch on the

01:06:48.319 --> 01:06:52.079
swastika pizza dude it wasn't us

01:06:52.079 --> 01:06:53.359
fight could you find out how old they

01:06:53.359 --> 01:06:54.799
were

01:06:54.799 --> 01:06:56.720
yeah get the culprits and a picture i'd

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.880
like to see these i want to see

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.559
i'm going to reserve some judgment until

01:07:00.559 --> 01:07:02.480
i say what if they're black

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.599
it's just like oh these guys are the

01:07:03.599 --> 01:07:05.119
best what if they're black and jewish

01:07:05.119 --> 01:07:06.640
and it was what if they're the owners of

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:09.039
the place and it was just a a plan to

01:07:09.039 --> 01:07:10.799
get the

01:07:10.799 --> 01:07:13.359
get some eyes on little caesars

01:07:13.359 --> 01:07:15.520
that happens all the time i think a lot

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:18.079
of us don't realize

01:07:18.079 --> 01:07:20.400
the way that publicity is used a lot of

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.920
times yes

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.680
you know like i felt mine with the snl

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.359
thing a lot that did get them a ton of

01:07:25.359 --> 01:07:26.880
publicity that was the first time people

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.799
were talking about them oh yeah for a

01:07:28.799 --> 01:07:30.319
long you know

01:07:30.319 --> 01:07:31.920
yeah i couldn't name a yeah i couldn't

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:33.839
really name a a sketch outside of that

01:07:33.839 --> 01:07:36.000
pete davidson chad when that even has

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.760
been going on in the past

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.119
few years i'm not a fan though i'm not

01:07:39.119 --> 01:07:40.799
like a big fan anyway no i'm a fan of

01:07:40.799 --> 01:07:42.079
some of the people i know that are on it

01:07:42.079 --> 01:07:45.200
that are really cool but

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.400
yeah you're a comedian it's not like

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:48.319
it's it's not designs snl is designed

01:07:48.319 --> 01:07:50.079
for like

01:07:50.079 --> 01:07:51.280
high schoolers

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.480
right it's probably yes that's great

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.240
that's what that's their target so like

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:55.440
that's why everybody's always like it

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:58.240
was great when i was in high school

01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.359
now

01:07:59.359 --> 01:08:00.319
you know

01:08:00.319 --> 01:08:01.680
i guess the thing that's interesting i

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:04.160
guess but you see guys like spade and

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.640
you see guys like kneeling you see like

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.400
norm mcdonald guys like that that went

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:09.520
through it

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:11.520
and chris rock you look at you're like

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.839
man these guys

01:08:13.839 --> 01:08:16.159
are still funny are still

01:08:16.159 --> 01:08:17.600
and their level of humor and their

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:20.159
ability to be funny in the spot is so

01:08:20.159 --> 01:08:21.839
much i feel like

01:08:21.839 --> 01:08:23.920
better than the ability of a lot of

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:26.159
people i know or myself or anyone these

01:08:26.159 --> 01:08:27.839
days it's just like

01:08:27.839 --> 01:08:29.759
i don't know if humor was just different

01:08:29.759 --> 01:08:30.960
than or if

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:32.319
i don't know they just seem so much

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:34.960
sharper yeah that's fair

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.880
but you're only seeing their sharpest

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.159
stuff that's a good point you know what

01:08:38.159 --> 01:08:40.159
i mean you're not seeing them

01:08:40.159 --> 01:08:44.000
i bet if you went to a comedy club in 95

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.679
well definitely not so rock rock would

01:08:45.679 --> 01:08:46.400
be

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.960
maybe destroying

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.159
i don't know if i define these

01:08:50.159 --> 01:08:53.279
characters but in 88

01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:56.080
maybe it wouldn't have been

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:57.839
yeah i think i've looked into this and

01:08:57.839 --> 01:08:59.839
actually talked about this question as

01:08:59.839 --> 01:09:02.080
well

01:09:02.239 --> 01:09:03.520
but they didn't

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:06.839
show the fellas

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.799
they admitted responsibility

01:09:10.799 --> 01:09:13.839
immediately terminated damn

01:09:13.839 --> 01:09:15.600
oh i loved making pizza man i used to

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.600
work at pizza yeah

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.920
it's a nice thing got it very nice yeah

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:21.679
it's just rewarding you get it it's a

01:09:21.679 --> 01:09:23.440
circle it's easy yeah there's a couple

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.199
shapes you put on you do this you do

01:09:25.199 --> 01:09:28.799
that boom yeah you give it to some dude

01:09:28.799 --> 01:09:30.480
[ __ ] someone up with you

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:32.319
people would lace him with drugs and i

01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:33.920
remember we'd send a dude out he was on

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.839

01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:37.359
to go deliver him and find out what

01:09:37.359 --> 01:09:39.440
happened oh it was crazy sometimes he

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:42.799
would find him just in his car somewhere

01:09:42.799 --> 01:09:43.839
we had a

01:09:43.839 --> 01:09:45.279
christian fellow that would go deliver

01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:47.040

you were like we were talking about the

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.239
holocaust again for some reason

01:12:30.239 --> 01:12:31.920
we were a little bit but we were talking

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.080
about oh cause we were talking about

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:36.719
hebrews nothing bad we i think we were

01:12:36.719 --> 01:12:37.760
with the jewish man we were just

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:41.120
discussing yeah how uh

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.360
and then you made a joke i hope we can

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.640
edit this right

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.159
if it's bad if you feel bad that i'm

01:12:46.159 --> 01:12:48.480
exposing a funny joke he made okay about

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.239
uh you like

01:12:50.239 --> 01:12:51.600
it's like you'd think there'd be more

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.520
there's incest in the jewish community

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.199
yeah and you're like that i think you

01:12:55.199 --> 01:12:57.600
were like yeah because of the holocaust

01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.280
yeah they were all

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.920
in the same space

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.280
yeah that's what i thought i didn't it

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.800
was very funny and then you were like

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:08.000
hitler how far did hitler live from the

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.679
holocaust

01:13:09.679 --> 01:13:12.239
yeah that's been [ __ ] me off all day

01:13:12.239 --> 01:13:15.199
really it's so funny

01:13:15.199 --> 01:13:17.360
thinking of him do you think hitler

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:20.719
commuted to do the holocaust i just like

01:13:20.719 --> 01:13:22.719
went to work

01:13:22.719 --> 01:13:24.159
i didn't know

01:13:24.159 --> 01:13:26.320
like he checked into an office i was

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:27.760
like all right things are this is good

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.520
this is what i planned

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:32.560
yeah i did i think yeah i always oh

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:33.679
because i grew up in the area of a lot

01:13:33.679 --> 01:13:35.120
of incest and so when you're around

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:37.040
incest you learn about other incest you

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.280
know you kind of you know water seeks

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.719
its own or whatever

01:13:40.719 --> 01:13:42.239
but

01:13:42.239 --> 01:13:43.520
so

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.920
ari manus who's my opener who's jewish

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:47.360
is always that's what we were chatting

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:48.640
about yeah he told me that a lot of

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.880
incest in the jewish communities because

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.880
or i always thought a lot of incest and

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:54.159
he said there's a lot of incest in

01:13:54.159 --> 01:13:56.159
jewish community yeah he said it so i

01:13:56.159 --> 01:13:57.840
always thought that

01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.760
it was because yeah like the holocaust

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:01.360
people are stuck together you have sex

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.679
with whoever is local to you yes you

01:14:03.679 --> 01:14:05.120
know which is the same reason that they

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:07.440
had incest in our community growing up

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.440
yeah or a lot of rural communities like

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:10.560
ireland

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.159
yeah people don't want to go that far to

01:14:12.159 --> 01:14:13.280
have sex

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.480
bottom line

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:16.080
it's sad to say

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.800
but if somebody you know but i think the

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.800
holocaust was maybe in the ghettos

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.080
before

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.840
but the holocaust i think they separated

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.679
men and women right and that's what he

01:14:25.679 --> 01:14:27.679
said and that shocked me

01:14:27.679 --> 01:14:28.640
but

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:31.440
because i've read uh

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.360
i don't know why it's so funny i'm sorry

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.120
no it's just saying the holocaust is a

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:37.280
place is very funny

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:39.280
just being like

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:43.360
i'd be like does he did he go to aids

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.840
it's not a the holocaust is a thing

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.440
yeah it's not a place because what was

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:50.000
that book i read oh sir

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.920
i don't remember it was it was freaking

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.679
good though but but it was about the

01:14:53.679 --> 01:14:57.040
holocaust did you stick your dick

01:14:57.199 --> 01:14:59.120
you're just reading night by eli weissel

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:02.480
just like oh [ __ ]

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:04.719
oh man i gotta are we allowed to tell

01:15:04.719 --> 01:15:05.840
these jokes

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.440
i think we're okay i'm saying it you're

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.600
not yeah and i don't think we're

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.280
nobody's saying anything bad we're with

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:12.880
jewish people we weren't we didn't say

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.880
anything bad and i i just that that's

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:16.960
something that i thought i didn't know

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.239
there's nothing wrong with not knowing

01:15:18.239 --> 01:15:20.800
something true um

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:21.600
but

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.040
yeah and then i didn't know like i

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:24.719
didn't know i never seen like the charts

01:15:24.719 --> 01:15:26.719
or anything like where did adolf hitler

01:15:26.719 --> 01:15:28.480
live at like that i always thought maybe

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:30.719
he lived

01:15:30.719 --> 01:15:32.239
like out front or something i guess i

01:15:32.239 --> 01:15:34.159
guess i equate it to like slavery or

01:15:34.159 --> 01:15:35.840
something you know not that it's the

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:37.360
same thing but i just equate it to like

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:40.000
a bad thing and then i think in my head

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
i'm thinking oh well the slave owner

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.400
probably lived on the edge of the i see

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:45.440
yes

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.880
in that case the comparison would be

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.640
like an ss guard

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:49.600
yeah

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:52.480
while the president

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:53.760
you know what i mean an ss guard would

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.840
be like a plantation owner right but the

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:56.800
president

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.239
he wasn't like

01:15:58.239 --> 01:15:59.840
coming down to plantations and being

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:01.280
like

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.199
my plan's working right right you know

01:16:03.199 --> 01:16:05.280
what i mean yeah i bet hitler definitely

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:06.880
went

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.080
that's crazy actually now you mentioned

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:10.560
it yes i bet he did go inspect

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.320
you're like nice

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:14.560
i can't believe it's worked that's crazy

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:16.640
this idea you know

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:18.400
it's crazy man

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:20.320
this is crazy when you put your mind to

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.159
something

01:16:22.159 --> 01:16:25.920
just to see it here brick and mortar

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.800
how do you think hitler was pumped

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.719
he was like holy [ __ ] man that's [ __ ]

01:16:30.719 --> 01:16:32.239
up do you think hillary was with his

01:16:32.239 --> 01:16:33.360
boys like every once in a while i gotta

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:35.040
just take a step back and be like we did

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:37.600
it you know

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:40.719
that's hilarious it sounds like a louis

01:16:40.719 --> 01:16:42.719
ck bid almost definitely

01:16:42.719 --> 01:16:44.400
hitler hitler killing him killing

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.320
himself reminds me of a

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.080
hitler just when he killed himself he

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:50.000
killed himself in a bunker did he with

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.880
all his boys wow and the soviets were

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:54.239
like in berlin and they were like oh

01:16:54.239 --> 01:16:55.280
they're about to get him he was he was

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:58.480
about to get caught and he was like

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.960
you're not gonna get me [ __ ]

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:02.960
and he killed himself

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.679
that's correct which is pretty funny

01:17:05.679 --> 01:17:06.800
wow

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:09.120
andy just he just said i'm done yeah at

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.560
the end he was like well you're not even

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:12.560
gonna get me you guys can't get me oh

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.960
it's so it's such a [ __ ] move

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.400
yeah but in his defense yeah he was

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:18.000
definitely gonna get [ __ ]

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.159
he was gonna get in trouble yeah at that

01:17:20.159 --> 01:17:22.239
point everyone was like oh

01:17:22.239 --> 01:17:24.800
yeah yeah yeah you do dude what the [ __ ]

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.400
did you do hitler

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.760
the whole world isn't it crazy how

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.760
nobody knew kind of what was going on

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:32.480
that's the craziest thing to me yeah

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.239
yeah you can't keep anything a secret

01:17:34.239 --> 01:17:36.719
now no you know you can't even keep a

01:17:36.719 --> 01:17:39.840
couple you can't even keep

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:41.600
you know actually some people could keep

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:43.360
a secret they had like that elizabeth

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:46.400
smart girl was locked up for like six

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.400
what's that about months kidnapped

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:49.840
people they had those people for eight

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.760
years in cleveland in the basement

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:53.360
that's crazy

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:54.400
but i guess you just don't know what

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:56.320
your neighbors are doing

01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:58.560
just being locked in a basement but it's

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.640
crazy [ __ ] years

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:02.640
there's some guy that locks you up what

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.719
did this guy ask us

01:18:04.719 --> 01:18:06.000
oh he wanted to know when this special

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.920
my special one's coming up mark norman's

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:09.199
had a great success with this especially

01:18:09.199 --> 01:18:11.520
on youtube yeah it's pretty cool yeah i

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.840
think that's that's a pretty reasonable

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:16.159
option yeah it's a yeah and if it

01:18:16.159 --> 01:18:18.159
doesn't work it's on you

01:18:18.159 --> 01:18:20.000
you know if i put it out and no one

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.840
likes it will you put it out in a full

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.360
segment or clips do you have any i'll

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:24.880
definitely put clips out yeah that's the

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:26.159
thing you got to put the whole thing out

01:18:26.159 --> 01:18:28.080
and then you put clips and all that

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:29.679
which you know it sucks to have to play

01:18:29.679 --> 01:18:32.000
the internet thing that game i'd much

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.080
rather have

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:36.560
like an hbo or a netflix make it

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:38.080
and that's it i don't have to do the

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.360
whole

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.960
because like right like schultz like

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.480
schultz talks about it i talked to sean

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:43.920
andrew schultz a lot about it because he

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.040
does it

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:46.960
you gotta if you're doing it on your own

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:48.480
like this is what he would say if you're

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.000
doing it on your own you have to be your

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.400
own marketer right which is hard it's

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.719
hard you know what i mean it's hard to

01:18:54.719 --> 01:18:56.800
be that is it i don't like it i'm

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:59.199
uncomfortable trying to market myself

01:18:59.199 --> 01:19:00.640
oh i guess that's interesting but i

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:02.480
think if you just put the put it out

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.719
there a lot of people will find it for

01:19:04.719 --> 01:19:06.800
sure putting it out yourself i'm talking

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.960
about marketing it to be like hey here's

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:10.080
uh

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.400
crazy captions on the bottom of my uh

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.760
and you gotta do thumbnails and you

01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:15.679
gotta have titles that are like white

01:19:15.679 --> 01:19:18.320
guy slams indian right you know what i

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.239
mean yeah some of that and that stuff

01:19:20.239 --> 01:19:21.600
sucks

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.760
i don't like i hate doing it and most

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.600
you'd be surprised how many people hate

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.840
doing it themselves but it's

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:30.080
the right thing to do

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.679
yeah it's interesting some of it's like

01:19:31.679 --> 01:19:33.199
some of the but sometimes the material

01:19:33.199 --> 01:19:34.640
can just stand on its own and you don't

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:36.080
need like the big but you sometimes you

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:37.920
do have you have to get some of it you

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:39.280
have to get the wording or something to

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:41.040
get people to see it yeah there's all

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.840
those tricks that otherwise if you were

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.280
handled by a network they would just

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:46.400
handle it they would just do it

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:47.760
themselves but if you're doing it

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:49.520
yourself unfortunately you do have to

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:51.120
play that type of game

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.199
it yeah that's a good point

01:19:53.199 --> 01:19:55.280
i heard that uh

01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.440
mark norman's was like the seventh most

01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:01.360
watched special yeah um

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:02.480
if you liked

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:04.800
over like you over hbo showtime those

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.719
sorts of uh the ones yeah netflix

01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:08.400
doesn't release theirs right they're not

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:09.679
sure they don't release their metrics

01:20:09.679 --> 01:20:12.239
yeah but norman put on a youtube special

01:20:12.239 --> 01:20:13.760
and it's number seven that's pretty

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:15.040
crazy it's pretty crazy that's really

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:16.000
crazy

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.840
so that's a lot of eyes man yeah

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:19.440
hopefully we'll see hopefully exciting

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:20.960
hopefully it does well if it doesn't you

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:22.320
know i'll just [ __ ]

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.320
kill myself

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:26.000
in your bunker bunker

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.199
like guys

01:20:27.199 --> 01:20:31.280
for real we kind of did it anyway

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:33.679
and the the the the artist with his boys

01:20:33.679 --> 01:20:36.639
like i mean i told you this was good

01:20:36.639 --> 01:20:38.800
the articles were probably like racist

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.560
pizza

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:42.000
takes his own life who would have

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
thought that that guy's idea

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.760
adolf hitler's

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:48.239
we're talking 19

01:20:48.239 --> 01:20:50.320
after world war one he's he's [ __ ]

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.320
wounded he's saying his

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:53.600
idea

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:56.080
would someday reach the whole way to a

01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:58.159
little caesars in ohio

01:20:58.159 --> 01:21:01.120
and just [ __ ] someone's day up

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.600
in 2021

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:05.040
but this is one thing i think that's

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:07.040
good butterfly flaps its wings type

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:09.120
scenario yeah

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:10.800
just a guy in austria gets denied from

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:12.400
art school

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.080
somebody's getting a [ __ ] up pizza in

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:16.480
the future

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:17.920
but this is the interesting it's just

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:19.920
crazy about the world like you could be

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:22.239
someone who could have the most negative

01:21:22.239 --> 01:21:24.239
or positive influence

01:21:24.239 --> 01:21:25.280
and

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.600
a hundred years later 150 years later

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.520
the best you're going to be is a joke on

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:32.239
a pizza you know true

01:21:32.239 --> 01:21:33.760
it's like

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:34.639
um

01:21:34.639 --> 01:21:36.080
also i think

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:38.080
it's also kind of cool to see the that's

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.679
where nazis are now it's like there's

01:21:39.679 --> 01:21:41.840
not it's so like that's one thing i

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:43.280
didn't like about the charleston thing

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:44.719
whenever those guys came out with those

01:21:44.719 --> 01:21:45.600
uh

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:46.880
tiki torches you know and they're like

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:49.840
these guys are all nazis it's like

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:52.639
if this is if if we're down to 60 people

01:21:52.639 --> 01:21:54.880
yeah with tiki torches then we're that's

01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:57.920
great yeah like that's great true that's

01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:00.000
how i see it like at least you like it

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.400
wasn't like there was like 30 000 people

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:05.199
yeah meet up i think yeah if you look up

01:22:05.199 --> 01:22:06.960
how many dudes are like actually in the

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:09.199
kkk yeah

01:22:09.199 --> 01:22:10.400
probably 60.

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:12.480
no i think it's like seven thousand but

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:14.560
that's really it's still pretty good oh

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:15.760
damn that's like one high school

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.520
football stadium that's a good point

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:19.440
it's not that many guys yeah and if

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:20.880
we're down yeah it's like sometimes it's

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:22.159
like you gotta look at some things as

01:22:22.159 --> 01:22:24.400
being pr i feel like as

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.320
you have to look at the actual progress

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:28.320
yeah it's like that's actual like

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:29.600
if you compare to some of the pictures

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.920
of like how many nazis they had 200 000

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:34.480
200 years ago 150 years ago yeah they

01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:36.000
packed madison square garden

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.520
unbelievable they filled madison square

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.280
garden in like the 30s did they really

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:41.280
yeah wow the nazis were big dude the

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:43.840
nazis were doing good and then hitler

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:45.920
they took it a little far

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.600
yeah

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.199
oh whatever we don't need to look up

01:22:49.199 --> 01:22:51.440
yeah how many clan members are three

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:54.480
thousand thousand nationwide it said

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:56.080
interesting that's a lot of that is a

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:58.560
lot actually i mean it is a small

01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:00.639
amount for a country but three thousand

01:23:00.639 --> 01:23:02.960
dudes are still like

01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:05.920
hey yeah yeah this [ __ ] kind of rules

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:07.040
but i wonder if they're also just

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:10.159
including fraternity kids that do that

01:23:10.159 --> 01:23:11.280
and that they'll be like oh these guys

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.440
are white supremacists i wonder i think

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.199
that's probably like estimated like 3

01:23:15.199 --> 01:23:17.199
000 like dudes that are like no i put on

01:23:17.199 --> 01:23:18.400
the hat

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:21.520
i'm [ __ ] nuts dude i'm [ __ ] i'm in

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:23.440
it i don't know what else to do that's

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:24.639
crazy

01:23:24.639 --> 01:23:26.719
i wonder how many because the crazy

01:23:26.719 --> 01:23:28.239
thing about that the crazy thing about

01:23:28.239 --> 01:23:29.760
the white power sign is they took the

01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:32.560
okay sign basically and made that said

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:34.080
oh that means white power well i think

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:36.000
wasn't it a joke when they did that

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.600
they i think the guys who said that that

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.840
was uh

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.520
to make everybody

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:43.199
follow through with it i think i could

01:23:43.199 --> 01:23:44.960
be wrong can you look that up

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:46.560
i think there was like a 4chan thing or

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:48.880
one of those guys type things

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:50.560
and they were like it'll it'll just make

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:52.320
people look silly when they're like

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:53.600
actually that's a secret white

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.159
supremacist sign right when it's like no

01:23:56.159 --> 01:23:58.560
it's it's a-okay or it's this game where

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.239
you punch your friend in the arm right

01:24:00.239 --> 01:24:02.400
but the craziest part is if you then or

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.920
then you become a white supremacist

01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:06.320
you're like yeah

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:07.760
but the crazy part is you look back

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:09.760
through time so many pictures of people

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:11.760
were like okay in the past everything's

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:14.400
okay like look at this white supremacy

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.560
[ __ ] jesus and then you every and you

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:17.600
have everybody doing it black

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:19.520
everybody's like oh look at this

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:20.880
guys are hitting threes in the nba

01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:23.280
[ __ ] totally like oh [ __ ] remember

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:24.960
lebron

i wouldn't have that i'm too lazy

01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:56.880
yeah i can't sit down and be a writer

01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.320
and then have somebody else go tell the

01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:01.120
jokes yeah that'd be tough to watch yeah

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:03.120
you ever write on anything like that

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:04.960
yeah it'd be so i can't imagine writing

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:07.199
a joke and then watching another guy get

01:25:07.199 --> 01:25:08.159
laughs

01:25:08.159 --> 01:25:10.000
oh and some people do that and they have

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.800
they're totally happy doing it yeah

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:14.320
yeah i have uh yeah i have some friends

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:15.920
that are writers it's got matt gold that

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:17.679
she's a great i mean john mckeever is

01:25:17.679 --> 01:25:20.320
one of my guys yeah mckeever he's he

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:23.600
writes almost all those wow he's yeah

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:25.760
he has no problem being a writer

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:28.000
i'm just which is probably a good thing

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.679
it's probably a healthy thing to be like

01:25:29.679 --> 01:25:31.600
no i don't care who who gets the

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:33.040
adoration

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:34.800
i'm like i should they should laugh at

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:36.800
me yeah if i wrote a joke and somebody

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:38.480
else told it i'd be like [ __ ] piece

01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:41.199
of [ __ ] oh stole it

01:25:41.199 --> 01:25:43.040
i gave it to him you know

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:45.280
you think about swastikas

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:46.960
yeah i think well even this wants to go

01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:48.239
pizza guy it's like

01:25:48.239 --> 01:25:49.520
i was trying to tell the guy you have to

01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:50.639
do something you have to put someone on

01:25:50.639 --> 01:25:52.840
a pizza and it's already been done

01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:55.840
yeah so you got it yeah you just got to

01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:57.199
think of something kind of creative i

01:25:57.199 --> 01:25:58.239
think

01:25:58.239 --> 01:26:00.560
um

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:02.719
yeah when do you think that you were

01:26:02.719 --> 01:26:05.440
part of like you know the eight the

01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:06.960
asian hate thing started do you feel

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:08.239
like getting it yeah you do pretty bad

01:26:08.239 --> 01:26:10.000
luck do you feel like you started that

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.440
at all uh

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:13.440
no but i was actually yeah now you

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:16.400
mentioned it yes i was one of the first

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:19.040
i was definitely early in the asian hate

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.360
community because after that it kind of

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:22.719
that's when it kind of took off i feel

01:26:22.719 --> 01:26:24.639
like that's when

01:26:24.639 --> 01:26:25.760
yeah

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:29.760
but you it it wasn't obviously

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:32.560
i mean that's ridiculous

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:33.840
no that's fine

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.600
it was kind of yeah i mean it was media

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:38.480
attention about a slur right directed at

01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:41.520
asian people so yes that definitely and

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:43.679
and and people are perfectly reasonable

01:26:43.679 --> 01:26:46.400
to see a headline that says this guy

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:47.920
said this slur

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:49.280
and they're perfectly reasonable to be

01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:50.800
like [ __ ] that guy

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.480
you know what i mean yeah because no and

01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:53.920
i do the same thing i don't read

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:56.000
articles i see a [ __ ] headline i'll

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.800
be like oh [ __ ] they're guilty yeah [ __ ]

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:01.840
them or there's no context or who knows

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:03.360
how the [ __ ] does the washington post

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:06.080
report on a podcast from 2018 right and

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:08.000
see the accuracy they're using here or

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.440
are they just like this guy's getting

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:10.960
fired for being racist

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:11.840
clicks

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:14.639
clicks clicks it's crazy huh yeah they

01:27:14.639 --> 01:27:16.480
don't get no one cares it's all done the

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:18.800
caring is done the the problem is though

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:21.360
is when they write those articles

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:23.440
after what i've said that doesn't count

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.040
when they write an article that says a

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:25.920
slur

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:28.480
like this guy used this slur then normal

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:29.760
people who obviously would have never

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:30.560
heard

01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:32.719
matt and shane's secret podcast

01:27:32.719 --> 01:27:34.320
are like holy [ __ ]

01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:36.000
he said like they're just

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.520
in the new york times it's like here's

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:39.600
the word that that guy said that's bad

01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:40.800
right that would have never reached

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:42.719
these people ever

01:27:42.719 --> 01:27:44.080
you know what percentage did your

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:46.960
viewership go up after the article

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:49.600
it probably doubled

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:52.800
yeah since the the months after after

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:54.159
snl our

01:27:54.159 --> 01:27:56.480
listenership probably quadrupled

01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:58.000
yeah for sure because then people heard

01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.679
about it and watched it so it's helped

01:27:59.679 --> 01:28:01.360
the problem this is actually funny yeah

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:03.600
it's helped the podcast tremendously

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:06.159
wow yeah but it's not like

01:28:06.159 --> 01:28:07.600
it's not like it's helping the podcast

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:09.600
in that like racists are showing up and

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:12.080
being like hell yeah brother no it's

01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:13.600
like people that are like oh this it

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:16.000
sounds you know i was trying to figure

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.679
out who the pizza guys were

01:28:17.679 --> 01:28:19.280
yeah it turns out if they were putting

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:21.360
out some more funny content i'd probably

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.360
i'd probably check in with them and see

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.199
what they were up to once you're in the

01:28:25.199 --> 01:28:26.560
news people are going to look at you and

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:29.120
be like all right this sounds kind of

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:31.840
funny yeah where does this go from here

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:34.400
if it's bad you just close the window

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:35.760
yeah

01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:37.280
um

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:39.280
and we're not condoning this guys we're

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:41.040
not condoning it

01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:42.639
um

01:28:42.639 --> 01:28:44.320
that's a scary thing now it's like you

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:46.159
don't it's like the people who are

01:28:46.159 --> 01:28:47.520
judging they don't care if it's a joke

01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:49.440
or not no

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:51.440
no they don't care at all

01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:53.199
oh yeah you got that [ __ ] thing

01:28:53.199 --> 01:28:54.320
tonight

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:55.440
yeah i was just thinking i was like

01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:58.320
what's he got to lose oh [ __ ] tonight

01:28:58.320 --> 01:28:59.920
yeah i was like yeah i'd be a little

01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:01.679
cagey maybe i don't put this out until

01:29:01.679 --> 01:29:03.120
that's done

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.960
but will we ever be able to put it i

01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:06.719
think

01:29:06.719 --> 01:29:08.239
do you think this podcast is too much or

01:29:08.239 --> 01:29:10.080
not no this podcast is not too much i

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:12.320
know it's not okay i'm certain it's not

01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:14.960
it's clearly joking okay very clearly

01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:16.320
joking yeah i just want to make it clear

01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:18.080
we are joking if you were putting up

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:21.199
like pictures of like

01:29:21.199 --> 01:29:22.719
i don't know horrible things and being

01:29:22.719 --> 01:29:24.560
like look at those losers

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:26.560
i'm glad that happened

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:28.400
that'd be bad yeah

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.000
yeah i wouldn't do anything like that

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.120
you don't seem like you would do that

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:33.360
you don't seem like a very

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:34.960
mean guy

01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:36.400
do you ever freak out and get mean to

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:37.600
people

01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:39.600
sometimes i get angry but my anger is

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:41.440
all always usually just inside of myself

01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:42.400
it doesn't have anything to do with the

01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:44.719
people outside of me yeah so sometimes i

01:29:44.719 --> 01:29:47.280
react i interact with the world angrily

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.800
but it's just the way i interact with

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:50.320
everything are you ever do you get mean

01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:51.600
to people you don't seem that you seem

01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:53.520
like a very nice guy i think i'm pretty

01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:55.199
nice guy i just

01:29:55.199 --> 01:29:57.600
i think uh with work and stuff sometimes

01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:43.080
i think uh

01:35:43.199 --> 01:35:44.639
yeah that's

01:35:44.639 --> 01:35:46.560
this is a tough one

01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:48.960
i i i

01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:51.520
lester i mean stevie how'd he look when

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:52.719
he was younger

01:35:52.719 --> 01:35:54.080

01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:58.080
black and white

01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:59.040

01:36:03.679 --> 01:36:05.840
even he like transitioned

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:08.719
even that seems

01:36:08.719 --> 01:36:12.080
like a white guy in like a wig kind of

01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:13.520
yeah

01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:15.280
this to be honest this is you you are

01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:16.880
getting borderline this type of thing is

01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:19.040
a little dangerous it is speculating on

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:21.360
black guy's race oh damn okay

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:24.239
look as i'll tell you where the line is

01:36:24.239 --> 01:36:27.199
okay we're getting close okay sorry

01:36:27.199 --> 01:36:28.719
then back me out i've just been there's

01:36:28.719 --> 01:36:30.960
been a lot of discussions here's sean uh

01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:32.159
king

01:36:32.159 --> 01:36:34.639
sean king uh-uh i've heard of him

01:36:34.639 --> 01:36:36.719
he was like a activist oh and he was

01:36:36.719 --> 01:36:38.400
wide out he's like pretty white oh it's

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:40.320
crazy now that's that's i think you can

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:42.320
take that shot publicly oh here you go

01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:44.560
but here it's going to be in the future

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:46.400
everybody's going to be beige and it's

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.239
going to be ridiculous we were all even

01:36:48.239 --> 01:36:50.239
arguing about race stuff

01:36:50.239 --> 01:36:52.560
yeah for sure like we're it's basically

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:53.840
it's funny for white people to say that

01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:56.080
though to like be

01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:58.000
the purveyors of racism for the longest

01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.520
time and then towards the end be like

01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:02.000
what are we even fighting about

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.480
it's like you don't get to decide that

01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:05.840
it's very funny it's like when a girl

01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:07.040
fights you

01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:08.639
and then she's just like

01:37:08.639 --> 01:37:09.920
she starts crying like what are you

01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:12.400
crying about you [ __ ] with me yeah

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:14.239
it's an easy out it's good for the

01:37:14.239 --> 01:37:15.760
honkies trying to hit the eject button

01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:18.000
like damn it what are we doing talking

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.119
about

01:37:19.119 --> 01:37:21.119
maybe i maybe i have such a white

01:37:21.119 --> 01:37:22.639
perspective sometimes no i don't think

01:37:22.639 --> 01:37:24.159
that's what you're doing i think it's a

01:37:24.159 --> 01:37:25.840
reasonable thing it's not like that's

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:27.280
the thing there's it's it's easy to

01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:28.800
compare like racism and all that stuff

01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:30.000
to like

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.400
well if you punched me i'd be mad about

01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:33.760
it but it's like are we talking about

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:36.320
our grandparents or our ancestors right

01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:37.920
like i that's where it gets murky

01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:39.679
because it's like well i didn't do that

01:37:39.679 --> 01:37:41.440
yeah

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:42.880
but like it's all you know it's

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:44.719
confusing eric griffin has a great joke

01:37:44.719 --> 01:37:46.000
he's like it's like when you walk in an

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.280
elevator and somebody farted in there

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:49.040
but you didn't do it you know and

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:50.239
somebody looks at you like you did

01:37:50.239 --> 01:37:51.760
you're like

01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:54.320
i didn't fart but i didn't yeah

01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:56.080
yeah but the smell is still there but

01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:57.840
the red but the but the effects of it

01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:59.679
are still around certainly and eric's a

01:37:59.679 --> 01:38:02.480
bit he was he fat was it was he fat he

01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:04.560

01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:06.080
thicker than uh

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:07.920
he used to definitely

01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:09.360
he would have been a hottie at spring

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.520

01:38:16.639 --> 01:38:18.639
if you're a big guy if somebody farted

01:38:18.639 --> 01:38:22.080

yeah you got to fight for comedy man we

01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:05.119
have to fight to be able to joke around

01:42:05.119 --> 01:42:06.960
isn't that crazy

01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:08.239
yeah

01:42:08.239 --> 01:42:10.080
yeah especially when most people know

01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:12.080
you're joking that there's this is the

01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:14.080
new government

01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:15.199

01:42:15.199 --> 01:42:16.639
everyone knows you're joking even the

01:42:16.639 --> 01:42:18.320
people writing the articles they know

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:20.239
it's a [ __ ] joke they have a bigger

01:42:20.239 --> 01:42:22.239
agenda they're trying to push yeah and

01:42:22.239 --> 01:42:23.600
they're pretending what you're saying is

01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:25.600
serious yeah and that's just what it is

01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:28.000
and that's fine right in fact it kind of

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.679
wouldn't be as funny if people weren't

01:42:29.679 --> 01:42:32.320
getting upset right that's kind of you

01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:34.560
know if we were all like nice pizza nice

01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:36.960
swastika on that pizza dude right it'd

01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:38.800
be like like if people thought that you

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:40.800
and i actually hated jewish people or

01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:42.880
were fans of nazism

01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:45.840
because we yes joked about or

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:47.760
if literally there would be zero

01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:49.920
blowback for going on a podcast and

01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:50.960
being like

01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:53.040
here's some funny things about hitler

01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:54.480
yeah it's not as dangerous it's not as

01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:56.080
funny you know what i mean right that's

01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:57.920

01:42:57.920 --> 01:42:59.040
swastika

01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:01.040
if those guys made that and sent that

01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:02.800
and everybody at little caesars and the

01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:04.880
people who received it were like

01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:07.760
that was funny nice right it wouldn't be

01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:09.679
as fun right right the backlash on that

01:43:09.679 --> 01:43:12.080
one is that makes it funny people be

01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:14.960
like what i can't believe this

01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:16.480

01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:56.480
now so i don't know if you are it's also

01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:58.719
just a fascinating topic right now i

01:43:58.719 --> 01:44:01.119
know it's just it gets

01:44:01.119 --> 01:44:02.400
like when people feel like it'll start

01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:04.000
to just suddenly that's who you'll

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.600
always be then i don't think so i don't

01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:07.360
think so either i'm confident i'm not

01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:08.639
yeah i'm confident i'm good enough at

01:44:08.639 --> 01:44:10.719
stand up that i'm not going to be

01:44:10.719 --> 01:44:12.239
the guy you know that about yourself

01:44:12.239 --> 01:44:13.679
then you can you're going to be fine

01:44:13.679 --> 01:44:16.320
yeah i i'm i am fine i'm not i'm not

01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:17.600
worried about that

01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:19.920
uh i never really was i never was like

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:22.480
this is gonna it'll always be part of my

01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:24.800
story that's how i was introduced into

01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:28.480
the comedy world yeah but

01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:30.159
was there any asian comedians that were

01:44:30.159 --> 01:44:31.199
supportive

01:44:31.199 --> 01:44:32.080
yeah

01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:34.239
for sure that's cool for sure definitely

01:44:34.239 --> 01:44:35.600
behind

01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:37.760
right closed doors in fact everybody was

01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:40.880
supportive behind the scenes right and

01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:42.480
that's to my face too so i'm sure there

01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:43.600
was a lot of them that weren't very

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:45.360
supportive that weren't just gonna walk

01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:46.880
up to me like i've had problems with

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.000
people and i'm not going to walk up to

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.199
them be like you know you're a piece of

01:44:49.199 --> 01:44:51.520
[ __ ] right so of course nobody's saying

01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:54.400
it everything's kind of yeah uh but yeah

01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:56.560
there were a lot of people for sure

01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:58.800
that's cool man yeah i mean they i think

01:44:58.800 --> 01:44:59.840
there were a lot of people that had

01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:02.000
conversations with people that knew me

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.520
that actually knew me that were like oh

01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:04.800
okay

01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:06.560
you know like if you see a headline

01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:08.560
you're like oh [ __ ] this guy said what

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:10.320
and then you look it up or you call his

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:13.119
friend and you're like is he like a

01:45:13.119 --> 01:45:14.800
racist dude and they're like no not at

01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:16.239
all he was [ __ ] around yeah it

01:45:16.239 --> 01:45:17.440
changes things you're just like oh all

01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:19.199
right yeah cause i read an article that

01:45:19.199 --> 01:45:20.960
said he was racist well it's weird

01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:22.239
because it makes it scary to talk about

01:45:22.239 --> 01:45:24.320
anything sometimes because you're like

01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:26.159
and it's also as podcasters it's like

01:45:26.159 --> 01:45:27.760
they could go back through anything and

01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:30.239
take out three or four words from so

01:45:30.239 --> 01:45:32.400
many things for sure

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:33.679
absolutely

01:45:33.679 --> 01:45:34.480
but

01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:36.560
not many dudes are getting

01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:38.159
i don't know snl seems like one of the

01:45:38.159 --> 01:45:40.159
few jobs yeah that they would do that

01:45:40.159 --> 01:45:41.679
for like they're not going to go back

01:45:41.679 --> 01:45:44.159
and cancel guys

01:45:44.159 --> 01:45:46.400
just willy-nilly they're not just gonna

01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:49.040
like it's gotta be a big

01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:50.800
you know if you're starring in a movie

01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:52.080
then people might be like all right

01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:54.000
let's take a look at him let's go listen

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:57.679

01:46:29.199 --> 01:46:30.800

sometimes when people don't know about

01:47:10.239 --> 01:47:10.880
it

01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:13.040
particularly when they're asian yeah i

01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:14.560

01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:17.520

asian people that like comedy right they

01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:24.239
come to shows and they're like you were

01:47:24.239 --> 01:47:27.600
our favorite tonight what's your name

01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:31.679
mark norman

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.119
you know i mean you don't want to get

01:47:33.119 --> 01:47:35.199
hit with the [ __ ] google in front of

01:47:35.199 --> 01:47:37.119
you like they're like

01:47:37.119 --> 01:47:38.560
what's your instagram i'll look it up

01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:41.360
it's like shane gillis

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:45.920
that was that was the wildest part was

01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:48.000
taking the train because i was poor when

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.639
i got canceled yeah so like that's the

01:47:50.639 --> 01:47:52.800
only way i'd travel and like people

01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:54.080
would be on the train like reading the

01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:56.719
news and for three days i was the next

01:47:56.719 --> 01:47:58.080
i was the news so people would literally

01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:00.400
be like

01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:02.159
like on the subway like looking at me

01:48:02.159 --> 01:48:04.400
sitting there like did you try to look

01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:06.000
nicer when you were the news do you

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.080
notice at all honestly definitely you

01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:11.199
definitely act nicer to everyone around

01:48:11.199 --> 01:48:13.199
you when you're in trouble like that oh

01:48:13.199 --> 01:48:15.440
for sure you want everyone to think like

01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:18.239
he's a nice guy yeah it's [ __ ] up but

01:48:18.239 --> 01:48:19.920
you definitely become

01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:21.520
a lot now maybe it's because you're not

01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:23.520
as stressed about minor things where you

01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:25.119
would have an ego with somebody about

01:48:25.119 --> 01:48:26.159
like

01:48:26.159 --> 01:48:27.920
you just bump me or some [ __ ] like

01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:29.520
that right when you're getting canceled

01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:31.040
you're like

01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:33.119
i love you we love each other right like

01:48:33.119 --> 01:48:34.080
it's like

01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:35.679
you want everyone to like you because

01:48:35.679 --> 01:48:36.880
you're getting

01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:38.000
destroyed

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:39.119
publicly

01:48:39.119 --> 01:48:40.400
maybe i wonder if that's why some

01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:42.320
comedians always want everybody they

01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:43.440
always

01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:44.880
i wonder if there's some correlation in

01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:46.400
there why a lot of comedians that's why

01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:47.920
you want everybody to like you because

01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:50.239
you feel like from the jump or something

01:48:50.239 --> 01:48:52.000
you've you feel like a bad guy you feel

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.360
bad yes

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:55.040
maybe i think a lot of comedians feel

01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:57.280
bad i feel bad yeah i feel bad most of

01:48:57.280 --> 01:48:59.040
the time yeah

01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:00.480
uh

01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:01.760
but yeah when you when you're getting in

01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:02.639
trouble

01:49:02.639 --> 01:49:04.960
you're nice to everybody it's very funny

01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:07.040
yeah that's cool yeah it's funny knowing

01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:08.719
that like

01:49:08.719 --> 01:49:10.560
harvey weinstein was probably nice as

01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:13.520
hell towards the end

01:49:23.599 --> 01:49:25.440
yeah the whole having to explain people

01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:27.040
what happened is a tough one

01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:28.800
yeah yeah

01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:30.800

01:50:54.980 --> 01:50:58.239
[Music]

01:50:58.239 --> 01:51:01.199
but it's gonna take

01:51:01.199 --> 01:51:04.239
a little time

01:51:04.239 --> 01:51:07.119
for me to set that parking brake

01:51:07.119 --> 01:51:10.320
and let myself on my heart

01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:15.040
shine that light on me

01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:20.920

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:33.000

01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:39.360

01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:42.000
the runaway train with a heavy load of

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.280
my

01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:46.000
hands

01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:49.840
and these rails that i've been riding on

01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:52.840
there
