dicks than us no they don't yes they do

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.560
no scientific fact they have a half an

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.799
inch on us really they have a half an

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.640
inch just length girth wasn't really

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.280
factory than study gay guys have a half

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.880
an inch on straight guys

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.880
on average

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.920
yeah i disbelieve this look it up was it

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.159
a male doctor conducting the test

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.040
no because maybe gay guys just had chubs

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.479
no they're showing them porn they're

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:05.759
just they're families

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.280
trust me the male doctor would take this

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.000
into effect maybe he was gay

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.560
well there's an inside job dude

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.560
you guys have more testosterone no they

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.560
don't they're at birth they're born with

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.080
an issue it's a theory they're born with

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.840
an injection of testosterone that makes

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.760
them produce more estrogen that's why

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.040
they get like half a girl brain and a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.640
big dick

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.800
or they get molested by their uncle when

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.800
they're young nope and then turn gay

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.200

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.239
inch if you admit that only gay people

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.159
would say that they read audio books

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.720
hell yeah all right and then uh so so

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.080
this book here vigorously

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.760
so yeah the one i'm listening to they

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.560
have

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.879
where were you reading it driving it

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.040
driving and reading yeah it doesn't seem

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.040
possible hell yeah dude when you're

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.400
listening your brain's designed to

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.920
listen to information reading is kind of

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.040
new to us

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.879
but the uh dude

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.760
so there's a thing called

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.400
straight guys for queer eyes

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.799
and it's it's heterosexual porn that's

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.320
male centric

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.519
so it's it's like a matte you know the

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.960
porn shots are all in the women in her

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.360
face it's that but like more focused on

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.639
the dude

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.400
just the guy like oh god i think i've

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.759
run into those accidentally dude

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.479
even if even if it's like 80 20 focused

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.560
on the lady if you if they like old porn

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.919

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.600
yep they're like most modern porn

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.880
directors are like all about the woman

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.320
but you catch older stuff and it's kind

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.000
of you watch like an old porn tape i

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.440
remember we were kids who would a lot of

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.040
times would cut to like the guy like

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.040
definitely like well the dude's mic'd up

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.479
in this too so we hear the girl moaning

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.240
been here like

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.360
the whole time and then it'll be like

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.199
the close-ups or of the guy's butt like

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.960
drilling her dude it's so [ __ ] fun

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.199
that [ __ ] undercarriage shot that's

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.280
the worst shot focused on the ball it's

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.080
the worst shot in porn

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.919
it's so [ __ ] fun that's the funniest

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.520
concept i've ever heard what male

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.080
centric straight porn yeah for gay guys

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.000
same thing happened with playgirl

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.840
play girl came out it was it was like

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.000

it's time for girls to have this blah

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.840
blah so he hired like a prominent

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.840
feminist at the time to lead it and she

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.280

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.080
they were they started booming and it

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.520
was just all gay dudes paying for

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.880
playgirl and they would get like burt

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.080

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.919
definitely dude being gay is wild dude

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.520
being gay is wild you just want to [ __ ]

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.400
straight alpha guys and and

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.560
they're 75 bottoms there's a lack of

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.639
tops there was a homosexual community in

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.720
philadelphia that made it clear several

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.919
times

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.320
on stage too that he wanted to [ __ ] me

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.759
he was probably he was [ __ ] a little

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:02.960
bit no

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.160
but also

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.400
i was sexually harassed and uh i did not

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.360
report him really well i understand

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.039
comedy and he was probably just kidding

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.960
give him the benefit of doubt true but

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.199
you also could have

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:16.560
stopped showing up and just blamed it on

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.360
him

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.039
like i don't feel safe

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:21.680
no you can't do that dude i'd be fueling

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.520
the monster that's true

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.680
um but yeah man so and also dude there's

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.360
a lack of tops

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.759
so gay guys are mostly bottoms and

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:31.199
there's only like which makes perfect

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.160

this thing forever

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.199

dude

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:01.199
it's so good that can't be

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:03.759
of a big enough study

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:05.120
what do you mean there can't be a large

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.240
enough people that they measure their

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.960
dicks oh well i think it was dude but

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.080
they said it was a pretty sizeable

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.000
amount of data

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.240

about that well

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.120
i told you i just i just don't trust the

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.000
data

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.520
i trust it it makes sense i don't trust

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.440
the data with my experience with

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.960
bodybuilding supplements i get the

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.960
theory on gay people having too much tea

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.800
they have too much too much to suck at

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.720
birth they have too much tea and their

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.400
body counteracts the tea and produces a

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.400
ton of estrogen huh

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.039
yeah next thing you know you're

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:39.440
getting [ __ ] pork yeah well they have

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.759
the hard wiring sexually of a man where

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:43.360
like they like like you know quick

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.960
anonymous sexual encounters like a guy

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.280
does but they want to [ __ ] dude so it's

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.039
like it's the ultimate health spin of

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:51.520
like i don't know what to do yeah

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.080
it's uh it's confusing

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.160
i'm sure that is confusing and you have

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.960
this big dong dude this floppy [ __ ]

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.800
dong now you mention it

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.840

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.840
homosexual comedians what's up with it

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.360

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.599
he would always wear tight pants oh dude

00:08:07.599 --> 00:08:10.400
that thing was a [ __ ] arrest

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.360

00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:16.319
thing was a beast it's true

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:18.080
they got [ __ ] they got the hammers

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.039
dude

00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:20.720

bit

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.720
big my dick was not bigger than that

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.759
dude that was

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:34.159
going into the gay territory

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.599
if you're a big dick you're definitely

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:36.880
[ __ ] gay

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.680
no i had i got a semi and uh

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.240
i was wearing my arab brother-in-law's

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.800
uh like [ __ ] muslim muumuu or

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.320
whatever the [ __ ] that thing is sick to

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.000
where you can go to a video now you know

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.600
what's funny i uh i wore that and i if i

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.080
wear muslim garb it just looks like i'm

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.600
in the hospital

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.519
like i'm so [ __ ] pale that it just

00:08:57.519 --> 00:08:59.600
looks like i came out of surgery

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.519
there's nothing [ __ ] ethnic about me

00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:03.839
like if i wear anything like that people

00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:07.440
are like are you okay like are you sick

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.360
so anyway i was wearing that nothing

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.839
underneath

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.399
yup and uh i [ __ ] filmed me flopping

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:18.080
my dick back and forth under this thing

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.600
which is hilarious

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.519
and i made it my snapchat story and they

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.959
took it down

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:24.560
i can't believe that [ __ ]

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.680
there's something i must have [ __ ]

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.040
something up there's no way they took it

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.279
down someone you they're you have to be

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:30.880
able to take it like if i so i want to

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.399
snapchat and like put myself a bunch of

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:34.080
schwa stickers and like

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.600
march into sickles and [ __ ] someone's

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.360
going to get that off there i don't know

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.320
5

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.800
i mean maybe because this is my story

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.240
maybe i accidentally put it as

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.080
philadelphia's story

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.959
until my story so it was in the city so

00:09:46.959 --> 00:09:48.240
it must have been yeah that could have

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.680
been that

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.000
yeah that would make sense because if

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.240
it's just your story i think only your

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.680
followers can see it do you think the

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.040
mayor took it down

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.360
mayor nutter no jimmy it's kinney now

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.640

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.720
mayor not probably let it fly yeah

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.279
another definitely would have all right

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:06.480
but yeah

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.160
flop and dong dude i thought it was

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:08.959
funny

00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:10.160
that's just funny i'm surprised my

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.440
girlfriend let me do that i showed it to

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.480

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.200

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.640
like

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.560
whatever you want

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.640

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.320
i could tell she was like she was like

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.800
whatever she's like it's weird but yeah

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.560
that's good that's support that was a

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.160
nice support i just did you shouldn't

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.440
put like a twerking video on her

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.040
snapchat i'd be like get the [ __ ] out of

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.399
here yeah take that down although mine

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:34.079
was clearly funny

00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:36.640

not at all for like everyone to be like

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.480

[ __ ] forever yeah since i've agreed

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.399
to this true but it's like i got [ __ ]

00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:00.000

time or the money i'm telling you dude

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.880
they'll spend like thousands of dollars

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.040
to be sacrificed so they can go take a

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.639
picture of their legs on a sunset at

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:12.720
like riviera mines and then to put a

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.160
picture up and rub it in the front so

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.000
their [ __ ] six friends can be like

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.560
she's doing well yeah i wish i was doing

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.920
well well that's what happened they got

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.600
[ __ ] catfished by somebody else's

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.120
legs on a beach

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.560
somebody took a picture at a beach and

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.720
they're like [ __ ] her i can do that yep

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.880
or like i should be there and it's like

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.880
no i i want to make this clear honey

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.910
this is not about you

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:35.040
[Laughter]

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.399
dude i'm telling you they'll lead you to

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:37.920
absolute financial ruin if you let the

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.000
bait take the wheel [ __ ] do you let

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.079
the baby take the finances dude it's

00:15:42.079 --> 00:15:43.680
over dude

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.959
all dude i'm telling you i have a theory

00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:46.720
that i think all women want to secretly

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.160
do is spend all the money and get fed

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.480
that makes sense like leave ice cream in

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.480
your base refrigerator it's gone dude

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.839
it's like it's like leaving cheese for a

00:15:55.839 --> 00:15:58.079
mouse dude they [ __ ] eat it yeah they

00:15:58.079 --> 00:16:00.240
can't not eat a little [ __ ] ice cream

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.440
glue trap

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.320
dude

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.920
gotta take her out if you want a girl to

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.680
get fat leave ice cream and they'll they

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.440
can't help it they'll indulge they have

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.680
no other choice yeah they cannot help

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.600
but indulging they have to indulge on

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.600
these sweet vacations they love sweets

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.680
if you have a big dick or you like sweet

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.959
treats

00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:18.720
you're gay exactly and you love getting

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.800
[ __ ] by guys yeah

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.560
it makes sense of course

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.399
dude that is that's most gay dudes are

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:25.839
fit but they have big dicks so it's

00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:27.440
either one or the other

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.120
what do you either love sweet treats

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.519
sweet treats and or have a big dick dude

00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:33.440
how many calories you burn [ __ ] a guy

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.360
wrangling that guy dude

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.759
yeah especially if you rape him yeah

00:16:37.759 --> 00:16:39.839
that's a hard [ __ ] fight it's

00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:41.440
probably like fifty percent of gay sex

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.360
is rapes you think yeah the guys were

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.320
like oh dude i don't really [ __ ]

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.440
[ __ ] in the butt anymore it's like too

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.519
late brother

00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:51.000
too late brother

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.000
oh brother

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.680
dude that actually i listened to that

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.880
and then i was listening to a thing

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.480
about when girls ovulate they basically

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.079
just become [ __ ]

00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:01.600
like they're so much more prone to cheat

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.120
on you and i was listening to this thing

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.160
on the way

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.000
sucks this is this is it's a book you're

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.360
listening to it

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.120
women ovulate and it hits them to a

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.400
whole other thing like women are way

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.360
more likely to cheat when they're

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.120
ovulating i was listening to this i went

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.400
home and instantly started a fight with

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.000
my girlfriend i was like what the [ __ ]

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.319
are you doing

00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:21.199
i was so mad like they'll seek out a

00:17:21.199 --> 00:17:23.360
chisel-faced man most likely and tried

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.280
it and i'm just like [ __ ] he's [ __ ] a

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.559
horse i went home and i'm like what the

00:17:26.559 --> 00:17:27.839
[ __ ] are you doing what have you done

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:29.840
all day instantly starting no one's

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.200
seeking out my

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.520
entirely unchiseled face

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.840
they were like like tall men of like

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.520
prominent wealth and chiseled i'm like

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.919
[ __ ] [ __ ] i was driving like i was

00:17:39.919 --> 00:17:42.960
so [ __ ] mad yeah i mean that's that's

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.640
probably just like a one time a month

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.280
there remotely near a man it's level of

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.240
like

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.000
uh i gotta [ __ ] that

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
it's yeah it's that's the one time

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.240
they're likely equal it's well not even

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.840
equal but they'll actually get off on

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.600
visual stuff because women will see a

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.360
guy and it's like you could have an

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.880
eight-inch dong [ __ ] rip stand in

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.160
front of them and they'll still be like

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.080
yeah but what the [ __ ] that guy about

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.280
you know what i mean like they have to

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.720
suss you out but when they ovulate

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.840
they're more like

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:08.720
[ __ ] it

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.679
yeah

00:18:09.679 --> 00:18:11.840
yeah [ __ ] them they could see a shaved

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.200
chimp yeah

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.640
jacked as [ __ ]

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.240
and they'll [ __ ] them and they've got it

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.679
you got to keep the ice cream away from

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:18.880
them keep the money away from them and

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.480
when they're obviously pansies lock them

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.440
up dude

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.280
keep all those harambes out of the way

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.720
yep they'll come get you they're more

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.000
likely to lie about where they're going

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.919
while ovulating really when you try to

00:18:27.919 --> 00:18:28.960
be like if you try to like what are you

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.880
doing today it'll be vague it's building

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.880
hardware this is like a nice little this

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.559

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.799
audiobooks but they're great i have no

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:02.559
beef with audiobooks so what's the

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:04.240
problem i have a beef with people saying

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.320
they read audiobooks that's it same

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.600
thing no

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.160
dude as soon as a knowledge goes here

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.160
they're fine and that counts as reading

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.679
yes when you absorb knowledge it's

00:19:13.679 --> 00:19:16.240
reading yeah dude that's not true

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.799
i think reading is a way to absorb

00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:20.640
knowledge avenue to pass information so

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.160
that's like saying if i see something

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.799
i'm reading it yeah

00:19:24.799 --> 00:19:26.400
if you take the information so i see the

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.440
movie

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.080
the information i read the movie

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.200
it's not about reading you get hung up

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.039
on semantics about did you absolutely

00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:34.960
all i'm getting hung up on is the word

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.480
reading yeah

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.480
that's it it's just like a it's a matter

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.840
of speech it's like i read it and it's

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.880
like because you know you're reading

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:41.840
books and you're listening to them and

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.880
it's like yeah i read this book and it

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.039
just gets caught up in a world

00:19:45.039 --> 00:19:45.919
you know

00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:47.200
yes it's like well yeah technically i

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.679
just listened to it but it's like

00:19:49.679 --> 00:19:51.679
yes but then when i say that it's like

00:19:51.679 --> 00:19:53.679
you're basically stopping a gushing

00:19:53.679 --> 00:19:56.000
river of knowledge just to like

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.400
pick up a little pebble dude who me yeah

00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.840
it's like what do you mean flowing dude

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.440

disgusting that is kind of like [ __ ]

00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:36.240
that's a weird thought that happened to

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.400
me one time where i got like

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.159
just way too stoned when i was like 19

00:22:40.159 --> 00:22:42.080
years old and like

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.600
grappled with the idea that i was just

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.600
an animal and it [ __ ] me up for like

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.200
two weeks we are

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.960
yeah but entirely that killed me man

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.240
like everything you just described about

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.600
like when they ovulate things like that

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.360
yeah pure animals

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.120
dude all of it's 100 animals i was

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.720
sitting i was watching tv with my

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.159
friends and we're like it was like 9 00

00:22:58.159 --> 00:23:00.240
p.m and i was like making weed butter

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.679
and i was like sat over the stove and

00:23:01.679 --> 00:23:02.799
breathed it in the whole time and like

00:23:02.799 --> 00:23:04.480
ate a bunch of it so i was just sitting

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.400
there like

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.520
friday night we're just sitting here

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.039
we're watching like a nature documentary

00:23:09.039 --> 00:23:10.000
i'm like

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.440
we're just like birds on a branch right

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.880
now and i just looked around i was just

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.760
like

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.880
i don't know what to do with myself i'm

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.720
just like a dog

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.240
i'm an animal and i just like walked in

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.280
i was like i'm going to bed guys it was

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.039
like 9 30 on a friday night just lay in

00:23:21.039 --> 00:23:22.400
the dark it was like

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.600
this is it

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.679
i'm just a beast in the wilderness yeah

00:23:25.679 --> 00:23:27.200
we are i was looking outside of the

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.960
trees i'm like we kind of do live in the

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.640
woods right now we just have houses now

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.240
i was like oh no yeah exactly i dude i

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.400
have that sober oh now oh that was three

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.840
that was three days of pure just like

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:38.960
you're an animal dude you don't know

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.400
what to do with yourself just i just

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.000
wanted poop to eat and poop and i was

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:42.640
like

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.720
i had one where i was like every single

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.520
thing we do is instinct we have no free

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.840
choice like every single thing we do

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.600
every conversation we have everything we

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.600
say like what i'm saying right now is an

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.799
instinct

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:56.559
like there's no like no matter what i

00:23:56.559 --> 00:23:58.159
was always going to say this i don't

00:23:58.159 --> 00:23:59.039
know it's weird i don't like to think

00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:00.320
about that stuff it's a long [ __ ]

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.760
line of like

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.720
if everything we do is instinct

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.640
so then everything was by design i don't

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.400
know it's a long [ __ ] that's a weird

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.679
[ __ ] that's a weird [ __ ] that's a

00:24:09.679 --> 00:24:11.279
weird thing to think about your animal

00:24:11.279 --> 00:24:13.039
side and like moving or just being a

00:24:13.039 --> 00:24:14.880
lumbering beast around in the wild yeah

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.080
when i get around like when i go to

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.080
grocery store i see other humans and i'm

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.600
like

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.799
just out here looking for food

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.960
with all these other primates

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.039
i mean that's exactly what we are but

00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:28.480
hopefully there's something a little

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.960
special to us like we have alien in us

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.120
i don't think it's alien it could be i

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.159
think so i think we got a little could

00:24:34.159 --> 00:24:36.320
be but uh at least we have something in

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.159
us that like we can

00:24:38.159 --> 00:24:39.279
communicate

00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:41.279
the way we do very complex we can make

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:43.120
things there's i mean clearly there's a

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.960
great difference but

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.960
but we are still

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.279
minkies running entirely on instinct

00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:51.120
that's weird that's my that's my sick

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.279
theory this is a sick theory everything

00:24:53.279 --> 00:24:54.159
we do

00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:55.600
start to finish yeah i think that's well

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.559
supported

00:24:56.559 --> 00:24:58.320
yeah i feel like it's the domination

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.720
hierarchy dude it is it goes in there

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.320
hell yeah now we're firing on all

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.360
cylinders all right what do you think

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.559
the listeners take a little break let's

00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:06.320
take a little break take a break oh hold

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.840
on before we take a break

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.240
uh shout out [ __ ] mike and noel what

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.200

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.080
wedding oh they weren't the only ones

she figured that out i don't want to

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.159
think about it dude my mom because she

00:27:46.159 --> 00:27:48.400
stumbled upon that i know what else was

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.559
she doing with vaz in her butt i don't

00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:52.880

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.640
i don't want to think about it hopefully

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.240
maybe it was just an old [ __ ] irish

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.600
folklore dude someone told her no

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.120
vaseline is not that old is it they used

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.399

00:28:00.399 --> 00:28:02.080
leaf and put it in the old butthole dude

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.399

i think the cuskers were like we have

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.360
too many kids we gotta explore some

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.840
options that's very likely actually the

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.520
oh that's an old irish [ __ ] trick

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.840
clan has grown too large let's get this

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.279

just screams horrified and falls on the

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.799
ground and just takes the beating that's

00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:06.080
what would happen if they threw a

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.079
missile at guam

00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:10.079
their next move is to just curl up into

00:34:10.079 --> 00:34:11.839
a ball they're gonna get [ __ ] that

00:34:11.839 --> 00:34:13.919

highest generals that happened to be his

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.440
uncle and the way he killed him was

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.920
uh like an extremely heavy caliber

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.359
machine gun basically an anti-aircraft

00:36:41.359 --> 00:36:43.359

00:46:06.319 --> 00:46:07.760
porn i've watched

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.240

it that's a good rule exactly it's a

00:46:17.839 --> 00:46:19.200
good rule of thumb

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:20.880

true talking about a [ __ ]

00:48:33.119 --> 00:48:35.680
story of beautiful [ __ ] nfl blitz

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.440
victory into coming in his dad's lazy

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.280
boy nobody else is doing that that's

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:41.119
what i remember dude i don't know if

00:48:41.119 --> 00:48:42.880
you've ever experienced this but

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.559
this is something i found was weird in

00:48:44.559 --> 00:48:45.680
high school i tried talking to someone

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.119
about

00:48:47.119 --> 00:48:48.800
how did they receive your weight was my

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.079
girlfriend she was kind of freaked out

00:48:50.079 --> 00:48:51.760
but the uh there's a thing in high

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:53.839
school i noticed about girls wanting to

00:48:53.839 --> 00:48:56.079
have sex in their parents beds

00:48:56.079 --> 00:48:58.319
huh that's a that's a theme that i've

00:48:58.319 --> 00:49:00.880
come across multiple times

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.119
you ever bump into that one

00:49:03.119 --> 00:49:04.720
it's girls and they want to have sex

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:05.839
they want to like i think that's them

00:49:05.839 --> 00:49:08.319
dominating their mom or something

00:49:08.319 --> 00:49:09.760
but i bumped into that a couple times i

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:10.800
thought about it and i was like dude

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.960
that's [ __ ] weird so think about that

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:16.000
ruminate over that one

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.680
um why

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:21.200
i don't know it's usually i've never

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.720
done that

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.559
privately it's always been at a party if

00:49:24.559 --> 00:49:26.240
that were the case

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.160
i've been that's the nicest bedroom see

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:29.599
i've had options of rooms he's like

00:49:29.599 --> 00:49:30.800
let's go to my mom's bed and i was like

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.160
and then like made a habit of it i was

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.160
like what the [ __ ] hmm it was just one

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:35.920
lady or multiple couple it's happened

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.079
twice so twice to me it's like all right

00:49:38.079 --> 00:49:39.920
well here's the new thing i've noticed

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.240
several times throughout the last 39

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:44.960
weeks that if you have two sources

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.480
that's it dude that's a hundred percent

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:48.000
well it's also weird though that like to

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.680
go oh no you're i don't think you're

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.800
wrong to do that you know true

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.640
so that's something that's something to

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:55.760
think about something to throw out into

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:59.040
the world yeah i'm gonna i just

00:49:59.359 --> 00:50:01.920
a few female listeners are like oh

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.599
i did that it's definitely a little

00:50:03.599 --> 00:50:05.760
weird yeah you're weird little freaky

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:08.000
sounds weird [ __ ] and that's coming from

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.119
a guy who jerks off to an asian lady

00:50:11.119 --> 00:50:12.800
trying to read the news getting

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:15.040
on her face that is tough to [ __ ] do

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:17.520
stuff knowing there's literally a world

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.760
of [ __ ] just crazy sexual [ __ ] you

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.520
can access for free

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.720
what do you mean it's tough to do stuff

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.160
it's just like tough not to watch porn

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.000
all the time i see this is you being a

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.160
porn addict i think it's pretty easy to

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.440
avoid

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.160
dude like right now my dong is not at

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.960
all in attack mode i'm good dude

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.960
i have no desire to watch porn i've been

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:38.720
watching porn and not jerking off to me

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.240
is

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:41.760
not that great

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.920
no of course not

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:45.599
so exactly

00:50:45.599 --> 00:50:47.040
i just don't watch it

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.280
unless i'm going to jerk off right now

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:50.640
well that's the thing i just i don't

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.400
even want to jerk off but the idea of

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.480
like coming i'm like well i want to come

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:56.559

00:50:56.559 --> 00:50:58.400
so like my work through it i feel it in

00:50:58.400 --> 00:50:59.839

00:51:17.599 --> 00:51:21.680
[ __ ] i vividly remember this uh

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.119
the hardest

00:51:23.119 --> 00:51:26.319
i've ever had to nut

00:51:26.319 --> 00:51:29.040

i was with my friend it was it [ __ ]

00:51:31.599 --> 00:51:33.680
not at but we were watching tv and it

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:36.400
was george w bush's inauguration what

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.160
was his inauguration i was in like

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.440
seventh grade

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.440
seventh grade i remember it that was the

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:43.760
fever pitch for me how hard it that was

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:46.400
the high water mark of me coming oh dude

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.000
seven no but i mean that was the that

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.680
was it was that like all your boyhood

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:52.160
nuts contained

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.359
seventh grade

00:51:53.359 --> 00:51:55.119
i remember george bush's inauguration

00:51:55.119 --> 00:51:57.440
was on you had it come and i was like i

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.359
dude and we were at my friend's

00:51:59.359 --> 00:52:00.800
aunt and uncle's house

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.400
and i was like dude i gotta [ __ ] jerk

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.480
off you gotta let me alone you just had

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.920
it you just broke off it was that i just

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:07.839
had to leave the room you announced it

00:52:07.839 --> 00:52:09.280
yeah me and my friend does it break off

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:12.079
a secret i see i think that's weirder

00:52:12.079 --> 00:52:14.160
it's not in hindsight but at the time it

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:15.680
was very like

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:19.119
i meant your cough the secretive thing

00:52:19.119 --> 00:52:20.319
makes it almost seem like there's a

00:52:20.319 --> 00:52:22.160
level of shame

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.559
yeah this was just blatantly like and

00:52:24.559 --> 00:52:26.160
maybe not shame but maybe you're being

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:27.440
polite and you didn't want your friend

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.800
to know you're about to come yeah it

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.559
means a secret too yeah it was a secret

00:52:30.559 --> 00:52:32.240
i didn't want to know and it was also

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:33.599
too there was a hidden agenda to it

00:52:33.599 --> 00:52:35.839
because like his mom used to leave she

00:52:35.839 --> 00:52:37.520
said hang dry all of her underwear and

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.280
unmentionables oh my god they would sit

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.240
in the bathroom and i was sitting in the

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:57.680
which is actually pretty sick yeah it's

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.839
tight he brings up a lady from the crowd

01:00:59.839 --> 01:01:00.880
and ladies and gentlemen talks to her

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.000
and ladies and gentlemen she probably

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.359
gets so wet

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:04.799
she probably ovulates

01:01:04.799 --> 01:01:06.240
oh dude i'm gonna start if i'm gonna

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.440
call my girlfriend now i'm fine what is

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.359
ovulating is that when like their egg is

01:01:09.359 --> 01:01:11.119
ripe it gets dropped and gets like ready

01:01:11.119 --> 01:01:13.119
for the [ __ ] sperms dude what a

01:01:13.119 --> 01:01:15.200
filthy creature so basically think about

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.880
this when your girlfriend's ovulating

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:17.839
and you see a dude with like an

01:01:17.839 --> 01:01:19.520
affliction tap out t-shirt walking

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.200
around all they want to do is have that

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.520
to his kid think about that and they

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.960
can't help it so don't be too hard on

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:25.920
them

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.680
they see it dude

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.200
so don't be too hard don't [ __ ] start

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.079
a fight with them when you come home

01:01:30.079 --> 01:01:31.119
