00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.870

Desperado Rough Rider no you don't want

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.410
NADA round two

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.380
[Music]

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.000
wow wow Wes and then again and then

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.400
again hello

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.079
welcome to part two of the presidents I

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.460
mean this is crazy

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.860
Matt Matt's unavailable he had to attend

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.680
to his family so that sounds really bad

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.059
yeah

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.040
it's not I checked in on him he's okay

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.200
everything's okay there was I don't mean

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.820
it sounds bad like medically it sounds

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.760
like you know fight no there was no

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.600
fight

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.360
just so we're clear

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.980
let's start dude let's start where we

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.780
left off we're going right into it

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.100
because we gotta plow through these guys

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.079
because they kind of suck yeah some of

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.160
these guys I'm not interested in at all

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.899
so just name them so this is Rutherford

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.820
B Hayes he he destroyed uh he stopped

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.220
um reconstruction I mean stop the slave

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.840
help the black people stuff so the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.340
reason he did that is because he was

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.340
losing to a guy named Tilden in the in

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.020
the election yeah South Carolina

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.240
Louisiana and Florida were the three

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.860
southern states that still hadn't

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.479
counted in the Electoral College yeah

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.040
the Republicans made a deal with the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.840
Democrats that said we'll remove federal

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.060
troops from those States if you give

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.040
them to Hayes and they do this is after

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.720
the Civil War is Over yeah still having

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.579
this [ __ ] well that's because the KKK

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.020
was

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.000
they were they were the real deal they

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.040
were [ __ ] [ __ ] up so they had the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.360
federal troops down there which actually

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.280
kind of helped the Republicans get votes

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.020
because the black people were allowed to

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.340
vote at this point

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.540
they had the troops down there

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.880
protecting them to get their votes then

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.180
obviously that's that's the thing guys

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.140
when the guy pitched the first guy

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.719
pitched the name Ku Klux Klan the leader

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.520
was gay

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.439
okay okay

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.540
he liked it bad joke yeah it took him he

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.119
had a warm up to it okay okay okay okay

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.099
okay

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:08.700
um

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.920
Republicans removed it basically he

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.480
ended reconstruction Hayes didn't do

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.239
much but this is where this is actually

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.739
important because this is kind of the

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.060
end of

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.160
it lowered Presidential Power quite a

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.959
bit these guys kind of took a back step

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.500
to Carnegie Rockefeller this is the rise

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.900
of these capitalists yeah like now with

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.520
the tech guys and we're still with the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.440
Bezos and the uh

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.340
and uh Elon Musk Elon Musk I'm sick oh

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.319
my God what are you gonna do if you buy

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.660
if well he bought it right he bought

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.640
Twitter you guys what are you gonna do

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.260
he bought Twitter from those really

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.660
great people that owned it

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.120
like now it's not going to be democracy

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.800
because the people I like this people

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.440
move forward like the like a bunch of

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.420
monks or something they were yeah

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.800
they're a bunch of monks like they just

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.720
knew everything yeah now they took it

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.140
and he's a piece of [ __ ] although I

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.120
don't think Elon Musk I don't think

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.440
Trump's getting back on which is the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.640
only thing I wanted

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.140
you don't know yet you don't know who

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.959
knows yeah he could be being coy

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.000
which one Trump he could be like maybe

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.920
I'll come back maybe I'll come back

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.920
maybe I won't uh so this is this is big

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.700
for Hayes 1877. those guys the

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.319
corporations started having more power

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.120
than the federal government as soon as

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.780
he has the [ __ ] uh industrial North

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.700
that plowed the South under and then it

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.420
just became belching machines yeah and

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.560
uh oil started yeah and [ __ ] it it just

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.860
there was no just steal

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.799
coal oil yeah uh what year are we at

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.200
this is 1877. okay so no cars or

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.959
anything but like a really big horses

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.680
the horses got bigger huge horses

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.319
they were like 10 feet wide horses then

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.420
when Hayes took over the trains pen

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.939
railroad cut employee pay by 20 so right

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.980
away [ __ ] they were Amazon right away

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.959
Amazon the Amazon thousands of [ __ ]

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.299
so there was strikes yeah and then Hayes

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.819
sent in federal troops to put down

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.980
strikes so the government sided with the

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.620
corporations obviously and they used you

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.239
know they went down and shot guys that

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.479
were striking but that's real troops did

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.239
you ever see never mind do it I'm right

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.800
I'm just reacting to [ __ ] I don't know

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.240
about by the way this is what when

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.580
people get excited and like make pop-up

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.320
remarks like I've been the last two

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.699

phone what a good way to put down a

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:37.860

Joe yeah so he made a movie called what

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.039
Meyer Lansky the Jews behind it I mean

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.940
he might have been Jewish

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.680
I'm not gonna say

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.180
he didn't do it because he was Jewish

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.440

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.320
Series

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.820
that's what Hitler was mad about I think

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.780
that might have been what he was pissed

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.360
about about the black socks yeah

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.060

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.500
just waiting to hear what the plans are

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.360
and the kid doesn't want them to know

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.699
what the plan is so he tells the

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:16.919
biblical Parable he tells a story from

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:19.319
the Bible that clearly to anyone who

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:20.699
knows the Bible

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:23.280
says what time and when yeah how they're

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.139
going to do it I don't know the Bible

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:27.900
story but the guys it's a great moment

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.539
because the guys in the back don't hear

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:32.460
it because they're heathens so they

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.380
don't have any faith so the truth is

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.580
right in front of them and they can't

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.380
even hear it it's a great great it's

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.120
nice that's my only thing I'd rather

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.580
behave that's good though so that's what

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.500
yeah back then it was like this wicked

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.080
uh but it's important for it it's the

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.639
through line of America

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:49.620
because once we're all kind of thrown

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.199
into the same place then it was this

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:55.199
thing about the industrial Rich the the

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:56.759
enormity all over the world too in

00:07:56.759 --> 00:07:58.139
England also

00:07:58.139 --> 00:08:00.240
with Oliver Twist and whatever and where

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.280
did when Dickens was writing poor houses

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.740
work houses that's how they did it over

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.960
there and here we had a horrible version

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.460
of the same thing three-year-old kids

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.699
working yeah in Mills and uh that

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:15.240
against the the impossibility of the

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.020
capitalist structure uh and and people

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.539
trying to organize and that that Union

00:08:21.539 --> 00:08:26.660
organization was not a sort of liberal

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.580
ideal it was the people it was the

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.319
working people yeah yeah yeah they had

00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:32.880
to do it they had to they just needed

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.560
leverage that's all they just needed

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.539
capitalist leverage they needed their

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:37.740
part

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.599
in the capitalist scheme that you had

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:41.099
that you couldn't just get some other

00:08:41.099 --> 00:08:43.620
guys if these guys wouldn't do it yeah

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.899
that's right this is 10 12 years after

00:08:45.899 --> 00:08:47.700
the Civil War that's right after these

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.680
guys were

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.140
veterans like they had been through hell

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.000
yes and now they're coming home and

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.839
they're like actually we're going to

00:08:54.839 --> 00:08:56.640
stop paying you guys as much because yes

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.700
we're getting richer every uh class of

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.560
veterans has come home to Total

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.620
confusion and having no worth in the

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.779
society that they protected every class

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:09.420
of veterans to get a party yeah like all

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.800
the guys the blacklisted guys in

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.600
Hollywood these were all War veterans

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.420
these were all war heroes who came home

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.000
and saw the country in tatters and saw

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.620
it I had some ideas about another system

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.300
and they got thrown in prison for me

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.260
anyway whatever but so yes they um

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.839
so that then hey and also we're pushing

00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:29.640
West yeah

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.800
so the cities like these cities like the

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.779
Northeast and places like Chicago were

00:09:33.779 --> 00:09:36.420
like churning out black smoke and

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.580
Industry and in the west people were

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.399
still gun fighting yeah absolutely

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:43.320
fighting each other with guns in the

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.480
1870s it would have still been it would

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.740
have been the Indian towards the end of

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.720
the Indian Wars yeah I mean the the

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.760
Comanche were still going wild like it

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.220
was it was still young American uh

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.320
professional soldiers yeah who fought in

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.940
the Civil War and some of them went West

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.940
to fight the Indian Wars yeah and then

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.000
some of them said [ __ ] all this and just

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.120
became gunfighters and used this ability

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.000
they had which is exactly the same it's

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.220
why in Japan I don't know if you watch

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.560
Curacao movies like Samurai movies you

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.660
need to you need to need to watch some

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.899
things

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.880
Clint Eastwood yeah okay

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.220
Fistful of Dollars yes Fistful of

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.079
Dollars is a remake

00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:31.440
oh okay yes of a Japanese movie a black

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.440
and white Japanese movie called Yojimbo

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.240
this is an idea this is a truth no Jimbo

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.660
uh Magnificent Seven

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.760
you saw it yes I used to watch all those

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.860
[ __ ] okay so the Magnificent Seven is

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.320
a remake yeah of this seven don't not

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.940
like you know it you don't even know

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.519
what I'm talking about the story if I'm

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:56.220
being honest what nothing go ahead this

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.100
is all has to do with presence we gotta

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.019
plow through these I know we're still at

00:11:01.019 --> 00:11:02.579
Hayes and we're talking about Japanese

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:05.100
movies

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.680
the seventh Samurai is uh This

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.720
Magnificent Seven is a remake of the

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.160
seventh Samurai

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.899
it's a total remake go watch these

00:11:12.899 --> 00:11:14.519
movies it's amazing because the Japanese

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:16.800
uh uh mid I think it was called the

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.320
medievaler it was the same as our West

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.980
because they had these wars with Samurai

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.860
and then all those dynasties like broke

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.540
up and it became just chaos and

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.459
corrupted they all became corrupt yeah

00:11:29.459 --> 00:11:33.959
and so the samurai just wandered the the

00:11:33.959 --> 00:11:36.300
the hills gun called Ronin and they just

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.000
became swords for higher yeah and so

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.160
that was just exactly the same as gunmen

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.779
so these great Japanese movies about

00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:44.940
these Swordsmen who were just out for

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.740
hire in these towns where there was no

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.860
law were precise perfect I'm just saying

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.540
that these kind of things happen all

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.639
over the world

00:11:53.639 --> 00:11:55.440
um but okay so Hayes who came after hit

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.440
[ __ ] Hayes who came after Hayes Garfield

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.060
1880 now this is a good one okay this is

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.740
a cool fact about him he could write

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.899
Latin with one hand in Greek with the

00:12:03.899 --> 00:12:06.060
other simultaneously and they were like

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.800
this guy is gonna be he's smart enough

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.019
he could be the guy to get us out

00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:12.380
because this is another

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.700
but this is after

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.660
three straight Duds this is Johnson

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.380
Grant yeah

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.899
uh 200 days in his office into office he

00:12:24.899 --> 00:12:26.399
was on his way to a college reunion he

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:28.320
was at a DC rail College reunion he was

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.320
going to a college reunion wow

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.940
he was going to do yeah he's gonna go

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.860
wild

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.440
he was shot twice in the back by a guy

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.160
named Charles gateau and gateau is very

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.480
interesting I looked into him last night

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.139
he was a [ __ ] he was a traveling [ __ ]

00:12:46.139 --> 00:12:48.000
who

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.519
thought that he had campaigned like a

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:52.380
village idiot but a traveling he just he

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.240
would go fail in town to town and

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.459
everyone hated him failed doing what he

00:12:56.459 --> 00:12:58.560
religious [ __ ] he joined like a cult

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.000
they were like this guy [ __ ] sucks

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.100
then he he would be like I'm gonna start

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.139
a paper for that cult in a different

00:13:04.139 --> 00:13:06.600
town it would fail then he would go to

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.880
like Boston and yell at people it didn't

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.220
work he would just go around [ __ ] up

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.380
and then he was in DC and he started

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.060
trying to give speeches on behalf of

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.200
Garfield

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.540
so then when Garfield won he was like I

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.579
did that I want to be the [ __ ]

00:13:20.579 --> 00:13:22.740
ambassador to Paris and they were like

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.420
no and he was like how about Vienna

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.120
they're like who are you so then he got

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.820
angry and then uh he bought a gun but he

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.620
was kind of aware of the significance of

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.180
it did he use he bought a he was a

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.240
bulldog revolver and it had he couldn't

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.360
afford the ivy Ivory handle yeah so the

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.620
guy selling the gun was like all right

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:41.820
you can just I'll give you the one with

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.899
the ivory handle and he's like this is

00:13:52.019 --> 00:13:54.139
um

00:13:54.139 --> 00:13:56.399

walk up there was no secret service you

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.060

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.880
yelled like I'm here for Arthur who was

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.100
the vice president Chester Arthur yeah

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.660
he was like Chester Arthur is the real

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.100

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.440
and yeah so this is still just a run of

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.779
horrific presidents that are distinct

00:15:21.779 --> 00:15:23.820
destroying we're marching through the 18

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.779
there are late 1800s 1893 Cleveland gets

00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:29.759
reelected yeah people liked his hot

00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:31.620
daughter and now their new daughter or

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.019
his hot bro wife yeah and now their New

00:15:34.019 --> 00:15:36.600
Daughter Baby Ruth

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.240
okay you know the candy bar yeah but

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.339
isn't that

00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:42.959
no I think it's named after their

00:15:42.959 --> 00:15:44.100
daughter

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.779
you don't think it's named after Babe

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:48.240
Ruth you gotta look that up

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.560
come on

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.380
feels closer to truth do they even have

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.399
candy bars back then

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.720
look man

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.880
you know what he's throwing them out you

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.339
know Mounds was named after two your

00:16:02.339 --> 00:16:05.399
mother's gonna feel it I had a strong

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:07.139
feeling

00:16:07.139 --> 00:16:10.380
what this is uh the candy bar was named

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.199
after Ruth Cleveland no I like that took

00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:16.620
place in 1921 okay let's check them out

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.120
see if Mounds was named after my

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.940
mother's [ __ ] okay I mean it's just sad

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.820
Shane what if it says Shane what if it

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.060
says Mrs CK

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.680
what if there's a twist

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:32.820
maybe I'm projecting it it could be uh

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.160
that gets it all right but this is these

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.540
guys are destroying the country uh

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:40.019
unemployment's at 18 yeah great there's

00:16:40.019 --> 00:16:41.899
a depression McKinley comes into office

00:16:41.899 --> 00:16:44.940
1897. he did his campaign entirely from

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.880
his front porch in Ohio yes it's pretty

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.800
funny and he's the first Ohio guy isn't

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.399
he great

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.100
where's Grant is from Ohio that's right

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.959
but there was like a run of Ohio yeah

00:16:57.959 --> 00:16:59.459
it's not a straight through but there's

00:16:59.459 --> 00:17:01.399
a lot of Ohio all these guys

00:17:01.399 --> 00:17:05.640
so uh McKinley's from Ohio

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.439
um he was last president who served in

00:17:07.439 --> 00:17:09.179
the Civil War he didn't want war

00:17:09.179 --> 00:17:11.280
everybody seemed to

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.319
he his whole thing was cultivating good

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:14.819
press he was the first guy that seemed

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:16.500
to master that yeah he understood it

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.260
because Cleveland before him uh [ __ ]

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.000
hated it so let's get to Teddy okay

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.280
because he's the only guy that I uh this

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.299
is something important to say about

00:17:24.299 --> 00:17:27.000
McKinley uh yeah I mean he started

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.340
he started the 1898 the Spanish Empire

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.260
was falling Cuba was open there's Cuban

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.840
Rebels uh he didn't want to but

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.580
eventually got talked into it because

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.460
guys like William Randolph Hearst the

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.140
all the major media people were like we

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.840
got to go to war [ __ ] that uh so he sent

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.480
the USS Maine into Cuba's Port somehow

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:49.500
it exploded no one knows how uh 250 guys

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.960
died media demanded war with Spain

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.820
that's that's where the remember the

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.980
main all that [ __ ] comes from uh

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.600
McKinley created The Situation Room in

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.340
the White House that was pretty tight so

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.919
that they could huh that's exciting

00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:03.539
stuff nice work

00:18:03.539 --> 00:18:06.900
this is a 10-week war yeah the U.S [ __ ]

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.280
them up

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.000
um

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.220
in in his thing he'd be Annex Puerto

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.020
Rico in the Philippines also annexed

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.380
Hawaii in 1898 1900 he wins the election

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.419
this time with his vice president Teddy

00:18:18.419 --> 00:18:20.640
Roosevelt yes and we can get into Teddy

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.340
dude so Teddy fascinating thing about

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.340
Teddy first of all Teddy was born

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:30.419
deformed yeah his uh lungs and his uh

00:18:30.419 --> 00:18:32.400
organs were too small for his chest

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.480
cavity

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.240
and his doctor told his father

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.520
um he's got to stay in bed and he'll

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.460
probably die in his teens yeah so he

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.460
told Teddy well they you weren't born

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.500
with much of a body so you'll have to

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.679
make your body and Teddy just became

00:18:49.679 --> 00:18:52.260
insane and yeah walked up the Matterhorn

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.740
just walked up it dude he was a ball of

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.720
insane energy he would just do anything

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.580
yeah it was kind of terrifying he was

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.980
and uh he was

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.860
um kind of an animal yeah but also very

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.960
intuitive very brilliant guy like he was

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.400
the first guy that they did like

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.799
caricatures of like he saw because he

00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:12.840
had his crazy big teeth in his glasses

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.580
so he was the first guy that they drew

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.380
like this funny version of him and he

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.400
liked it

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.679
he thought that's cool because they're

00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:21.260
thinking about me the fact that they're

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.120
caricaturizing me means that I'm an Ike

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.000
I'm I'm something above you know and he

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.460
liked it so he let that proliferate but

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.799
the other thing about him is that he

00:19:31.799 --> 00:19:33.480
liked being he didn't like being in

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.860
charge of things he liked being number

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:35.640
two

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.100
so like they asked him to run New York

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.260
City Police Department

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.660
and he became a commission he's like

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.160
I'll just be one of the Commissioners he

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.260
was like number two but he ran

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.580
everything from that number two position

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.020
because he knew number one is like the

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:53.160
shittiest job in any place so he started

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.679
I don't know this I'm uneducated and I

00:19:55.679 --> 00:19:56.940
read this a long time ago but I think he

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.640
invented the police academy because New

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.220
York's or or at least he and put one in

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.440
New York City in New York City to be a

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.500
cop you had to be in a family of cops or

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.600
you had to pay somebody because it was

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.820
the easiest job in the world you just

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.140
did you just walked around in the

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.539
uniform yeah and cops used to sleep like

00:20:15.539 --> 00:20:18.659
in alleys and they didn't do it they

00:20:18.659 --> 00:20:22.740
never never stopped crime yeah and they

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.100
just get paid to protect one gang or the

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.799
other in New York City and so and they

00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:31.559
were all fat and often quite old so

00:20:31.559 --> 00:20:33.539
Teddy said yeah there's age restriction

00:20:33.539 --> 00:20:35.159
you can't be old he said you have to be

00:20:35.159 --> 00:20:36.840
in shape you have to go to an academy

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.760
and you have to train to be a cop you

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.200
have to be taught you have to have an

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.419
education you get taught a lot lots of

00:20:42.419 --> 00:20:44.220
things in an academy it's a school

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.799
and so he started that Police Department

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:49.320
hated him he pushed it through he

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.580
reformed the New York Police Department

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.960
to the point

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.640
and this is where he was better than

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.500
other politicians

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.620
he wanted to test them and show that

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.659
they were honest

00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:02.520
and the only way to do that is to have

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.960
them

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.600
um enforce a law that everybody hates

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.100
so I think the law was that you couldn't

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.780
drink on Sunday

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.760
so he had the cops go around New York

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.919
City and bust anybody who was drinking

00:21:13.919 --> 00:21:16.559
on a Sunday and a hundred percent of New

00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:19.380
Yorkers hated him for this yeah and they

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.240
ran him out of town on a rail

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.480
and he was fired but to him it was like

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.059
mission accomplished Teddy would do

00:21:27.059 --> 00:21:30.600
everything until he was despised like he

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.360
would go past the point because his goal

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.580
was the goal the goal is the cops are

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.640
better not everybody loves Teddy yeah so

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.440
then he every time he got fired he would

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.039
just go to Montana and live in a [ __ ]

00:21:44.039 --> 00:21:45.980
Hut and kill Buffalo

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.480
and then they went and people would send

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.220
emissaries and say please run in this

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.679
this please this company please run this

00:21:52.679 --> 00:21:54.840
company you would always say no and then

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.640
they came to him and asked him to run

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.020
the U.S Navy

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.299
he did a similar thing to the United

00:22:00.299 --> 00:22:04.200
States Navy which I know less about yeah

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.320
um he was obsessed with the war in 1812

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.299
I think he wrote a book on it yeah what

00:22:09.299 --> 00:22:11.400
was how we could have won that quickly

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.020
we almost lost it because we didn't have

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.120
a Navy ready and his whole thing was we

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.559
need to have a huge navy that's right

00:22:16.559 --> 00:22:18.539
like the war it's actually pretty sick

00:22:18.539 --> 00:22:20.700
he gave a speech to I think either West

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.260
Point of the Naval Academy where he was

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.600
like it was probably the Naval Academy

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.280
um he was like there's a vacuum right

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.679
now England's failing there needs to be

00:22:28.679 --> 00:22:30.000
one leader someone needs to be there

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.620
somebody in the world Naval power yeah

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.720
he did two things that have lasted till

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.520
now I mean a lot of things but two are

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.280
the National Park system yeah uh it just

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.320
no one even thought of that that didn't

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.960
exist the idea of like the government

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.559
should protect vast tracts of land yeah

00:22:46.559 --> 00:22:48.360
and not allow anybody to [ __ ] with them

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.000
no one in the on the earth did that

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.179
Teddy Roosevelt invented that idea so

00:22:54.179 --> 00:22:56.520
that's exists because of him they still

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.960
don't have it in the Amazon they don't

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.059
do it that's why it's a nightmare

00:23:00.059 --> 00:23:01.620
because there's no laws down there that

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.179
say you can't do this everyone just

00:23:03.179 --> 00:23:04.980
wishes they wouldn't

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.340
so Teddy did that and he gave us uh made

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.659
right but he got like he he just did

00:25:09.659 --> 00:25:11.100

Roosevelt number one always [ __ ] up

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.760

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.559
Clinton was younger than that okay but

00:25:34.559 --> 00:25:35.640
yeah a lot of these guys have older

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.020
brothers who who just couldn't make it

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.240
but it's funny how he his brother ended

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.799
up in like a mental hospital in like

00:25:40.799 --> 00:25:42.779
Paris according to this documentary he

00:25:42.779 --> 00:25:44.400
was drinking like six bottles of Brandy

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.220
a day he was just not bad by the way he

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.440
died the way he died was like he had

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.419
like a he had delirium from the alcohol

00:25:51.419 --> 00:25:53.159
and he was trying to jump out of a

00:25:53.159 --> 00:25:55.200
window but he kept just running up and

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.080
down the steps and he uh he had like an

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.200
aneurysm seizure okay so when Teddy was

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.779
here's a great story about Teddy the way

00:26:03.779 --> 00:26:06.120
where teddy bears come from

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.419
okay Teddy Roosevelt was on in

00:26:09.419 --> 00:26:11.279
Pennsylvania again your [ __ ] State

00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:12.720
might have been incredible State not

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.059
much difference so

00:26:15.059 --> 00:26:17.880
um Teddy was there and uh on tour as

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.919
president and there were some people you

00:26:19.919 --> 00:26:21.240
know every time the president comes to a

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.620
town they always like they get so

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.260
excited and they plan stuff so they knew

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.320
he loves hunting Bear yeah so when when

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.240
Teddy hunts bear he's way up in a

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.539
mountain alone with a gun and it's him

00:26:33.539 --> 00:26:35.640
in the bear and he might die yeah but

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.260
these people think he's like a gentleman

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.120
Hunter so they take him we're gonna take

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.500
you to hunt some bear and they give him

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:41.940
a gun and they take him into the woods

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:45.299
and there's a bear chained to a tree a

00:26:45.299 --> 00:26:47.220
little bear who's kind of emaciated and

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.320
it was chained to a tree and they go

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.200
shoot him

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:55.260
and Teddy breaks down into tears yeah

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.000
and he says for the love of God let that

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.679
poor animal go

00:26:58.679 --> 00:27:01.860
and there was some journalist there who

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.659
drew a picture

00:27:03.659 --> 00:27:06.059
that was like a little sketch that was

00:27:06.059 --> 00:27:08.460
in the paper of Teddy with this and this

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.919
little bear and it was they put people

00:27:10.919 --> 00:27:13.679
put that together Teddy and bear uh and

00:27:13.679 --> 00:27:15.900
started making these stuffed bears that

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.480
looked like Teddy because of this Jesus

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:22.080
Christ so that his first day as

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.200
president yeah oh well let's uh McKinley

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.940

cholga

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.039

since 18 so in the last 40 years yes

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.899
um and the the people are like this was

00:27:45.899 --> 00:27:48.000
a gunshot today he would have survived

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.520
in two days yeah so like Roosevelt found

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.200

these are bad there's bad medicine yeah

00:28:03.179 --> 00:28:05.580
back then you could cut the president on

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.500
the finger to death yeah

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.600
because of how bad medicine was and how

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.600

he's an iconic moment Booker T

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.279
Washington

00:28:38.279 --> 00:28:40.399
um

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.460
says Hey I want to I have some issues I

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.840
want to talk about and Teddy says come

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.220
to dinner just come to the house tonight

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:49.140
come to dinner first night in the white

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.200
house he hosts a black man never

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.600
happened in the history of the country a

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.220
black man being

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.399
um a guest for dinner at the White House

00:28:58.399 --> 00:29:01.320
the whole country goes nuts it's the

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.980
first event of Teddy's presidency is

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:07.320
that the Senate and I could be having

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.399
some of these things wrong but the

00:29:08.399 --> 00:29:10.799
Senate unanimously censured the

00:29:10.799 --> 00:29:14.399
president for having there was nobody in

00:29:14.399 --> 00:29:16.919
the mix it like if it was happened today

00:29:16.919 --> 00:29:20.279
and even like [ __ ] AOC was like oh no

00:29:20.279 --> 00:29:21.539
you don't have them in the White House

00:29:21.539 --> 00:29:23.640
everyone like all the way across the

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.580
board said that's not okay and they

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.559
censored him they tried to throw him out

00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:30.480
they're like maybe we should impeach him

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.980
but the best thing they could do is

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.840
censure him for having had a black man

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.880
as a guest in the white house so this

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.740
was what Teddy did this is the kind of

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.559
guy he was he went on he had him to

00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:42.960
dinner constantly and he went on a

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.700
speaking tour with him he made him like

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.399
he elevated him more and more because he

00:29:47.399 --> 00:29:50.220
was just like you know [ __ ] you guys

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:51.360
yeah

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.039
there's one more I want to say about the

00:29:53.039 --> 00:29:54.240
Spanish Civil War that's pretty funny

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.520
yeah and they took that Hill he was on

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.520
his horse everybody else was like

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.039
so they took one Hill and then he saw

00:30:02.039 --> 00:30:03.960
San Juan Hill or whatever it's called

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.700
and he was like we're gonna take that he

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.440
went off by himself right Five Guys

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.600
followed him three of them got shot yeah

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.039
because he went all of a sudden he's

00:30:11.039 --> 00:30:13.320
like we're doing this yeah he didn't

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.360
order anything no into a hail of gunfire

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.820
so then he came back and one of the guys

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:19.919
was laying down and he was like how are

00:30:19.919 --> 00:30:21.059
you going to lay down when I'm up on

00:30:21.059 --> 00:30:23.039
this horse get up and as soon as the guy

00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:24.720
stood up he got shot in the head and

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.179
killed instantly that he led the charge

00:30:27.179 --> 00:30:28.500
and they were all you know a lot of them

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.120
died but some of them could have been

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.059
president he did it purely out of like I

00:30:33.059 --> 00:30:36.059
wanted to be in war which is really a

00:30:36.059 --> 00:30:37.620
terrible terrible thing terrible

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.779
terrible leader he had that for that

00:30:39.779 --> 00:30:44.399
yeah I mean it's but he won he won it

00:30:44.399 --> 00:30:48.840
worked out it did work out uh and

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.539
and then when he was another great story

00:30:51.539 --> 00:30:54.779
about him that I heard was that uh

00:30:54.779 --> 00:30:56.640
he would fight whoever was the

00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:00.419
heavyweight champ oh yeah he would bare

00:31:00.419 --> 00:31:01.740
knuckle yeah

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:04.500
so like Jack Johnson I think had just

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.000
won the championship so he was invited

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.380
he doesn't know this was gonna happen

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.240
he's invited to the White House

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.740
so I don't know if they had an oval

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:13.260
office yet yeah comes into the Oval

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:14.880
Office I believe they did and Teddy was

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.820
like oh terrific and he [ __ ] starts

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:19.320
Jack Johnson's like what are you doing

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.299
he's like come on now because to him it

00:31:21.299 --> 00:31:23.519
was like it made sense yeah that the

00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:24.539
president

00:31:24.539 --> 00:31:26.159
should fight with the heavyweight

00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:29.159
champion and he fought him

00:31:29.159 --> 00:31:32.940
and Johnson uh blinded him in one eye

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:35.580
and Teddy begged him please don't tell

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:37.260
anybody because I'll get it because

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.480
Teddy he's not supposed to do this so he

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.640
used to get people to leave the room and

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.200
then he fought him and he black and he

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.820
was always blind in that eye when she

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.100
was always in denial about because he

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.539
was sort of ashamed that he did this

00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:51.000
thing yeah this guy's insane he was nuts

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.919
again to me I'm approaching these guys

00:31:52.919 --> 00:31:55.679
as characters yes fascinating but he

00:31:55.679 --> 00:31:57.120
didn't he did a ton of great [ __ ] and

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.980
then he started going after all these

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.140
trusts he started breaking up all these

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:03.360
monopolies so he's the first president

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.700
from this [ __ ] lull of just garbage

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.860
presidents to start to actually like

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.840
reform [ __ ] that's right and start to

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.299
really well that's what he begins when

00:32:12.299 --> 00:32:15.000
he was governor of New York he was doing

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.720
something that was like huge and one of

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:22.200
his aides said if you pull this off

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.500
you could run for president and Teddy

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.200
snapped at him and said don't ever in

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.240
your life say something like that to me

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:34.860
he said if I add my own career and

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:38.820
potential to the math of my decisions

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:42.179
then it'll destroy everything he said we

00:32:42.179 --> 00:32:44.640
never never think about my career and he

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.320
really did live that way yeah he

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.000
personally wanted to be though that's

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.679
funny like he wrote

00:32:49.679 --> 00:32:54.059
uh to his lady because he was in DC yeah

00:32:54.059 --> 00:32:55.679
maybe before he was the vice president

00:32:55.679 --> 00:32:58.140
he was in New York that's that's when he

00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:59.340
became the vice president he was in New

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:01.380
York and that guy that he was in his

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.940
political party I forget the guy's name

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.159
was like send him to DC I don't want him

00:33:05.159 --> 00:33:06.840
in New York anymore yeah he's a [ __ ]

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.820
nightmare no he was fighting everybody

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.919
he's fighting every comfortable place he

00:33:10.919 --> 00:33:13.019
could possibly be but president of the

00:33:13.019 --> 00:33:14.580
United States but he was like every time

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.159
I walked past the White House like

00:33:17.159 --> 00:33:19.320
could be there someday yes like he had

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.720
that in there but the greatest piece of

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.399
film on Teddy

00:33:23.399 --> 00:33:26.700
is that he was the first president to

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:27.840
fly in an airplane

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.480
and there's film of it he went in with a

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.940
hot rod guy who's like a Barnstormer guy

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:35.580
yeah and it's just a biplane and they

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.380
show him you know it's shitty black and

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:38.519
white footage but he gets in the plane

00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:40.440
and it corkscrews and does he was

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.840
already retired he was kind of older and

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.340
you see him get out of it and you see

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.120
him go like what

00:33:51.659 --> 00:33:54.240
that's youngest president also youngest

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.600
one 42 or 43 yeah yes

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:01.380
one two terms one two terms and then and

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.980
then elected and then left uh then he

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:06.600
decided not to run the third time

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.700
because of he didn't like Republican

00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:11.040
politics and then he ran for a third

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.139
term after skipping a turn and he split

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:15.599
the vote uh on a new one what was it

00:34:15.599 --> 00:34:17.220
called the party bull moose or something

00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:18.540
like that yeah we're skipping the party

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:21.020
gets shot

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.480
in the chest

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.300
and he had his a big thick thing of his

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.700
speech yeah and he had

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.379
um something else metal I forget what

00:34:31.379 --> 00:34:33.000
was that something I got I wasn't a

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.440
flask I don't know yeah

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.260
but he had some [ __ ] in his pocket

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:39.179
didn't the bullet got lodged into his

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:41.099
chest though right it went but it was it

00:34:41.099 --> 00:34:43.500
was it didn't it didn't get into his uh

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.839
into it it didn't break his muscle no it

00:34:45.839 --> 00:34:47.579
stuck there and then he apparently

00:34:47.579 --> 00:34:49.500
cleared his throat finished the speech

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.480
and he finished he said it's going to

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.579
take a lot more to kill a bull moose

00:34:53.579 --> 00:34:55.619
that's right which is pretty [ __ ]

00:34:55.619 --> 00:34:57.420
wild getting shot in the middle of a

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.579
speech clearing your throat it's a great

00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:02.460
moment uh then he personally

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.460
elected the next guy which I'm

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:06.599
forgetting

00:35:06.599 --> 00:35:08.579
uh could have been Taft

00:35:08.579 --> 00:35:10.560
and then Taft

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:14.339
is okay but extremely fat guy didn't he

00:35:14.339 --> 00:35:17.240
die in a bathtub no he got stuck

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.800
didn't he gets stuck he gets stuck to

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.980
get buttered out of the tub yeah yeah uh

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:25.440
and that takes us to Wilson because then

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.079
he Taft ran against Wilson Roosevelt

00:35:28.079 --> 00:35:31.220
decides he wants to come back and Wilson

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.180
governor of New Jersey or something I

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:34.320
don't know this is where I stopped

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.660
Wilson is uh

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:39.960
I don't know much about him except for

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.359
for me like some of the sources for what

00:35:42.359 --> 00:35:43.619
I know about these guys come from

00:35:43.619 --> 00:35:45.599
different places so what I know about

00:35:45.599 --> 00:35:48.060
Wilson is because

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:51.000
um I read this book about it was called

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.280
the peace to end all Peace book that

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.440
everybody should read and it's about how

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.040
World War One the end of world war one

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.780
was how all the Middle Eastern countries

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:04.980
were drawn Iraq and Iran and Syria and

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:06.300
all these places

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.240
only exists because of

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.619
British and America and French these are

00:36:10.619 --> 00:36:11.880
lines that were these are countries

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.859
that's why we don't have like Kurdistan

00:36:13.859 --> 00:36:15.720
there's no Kurdistan but there's Kurdish

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.220
people yeah but they just didn't have a

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.800
place at that table so we just made Iraq

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.160
Iraq is a bunch of differences

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.200
it's the something something uh it's two

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.640
names it's a

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.859
whatever but yeah it was colonization

00:36:28.859 --> 00:36:30.599
they just were like yeah the treaty or

00:36:30.599 --> 00:36:32.700
whatever the [ __ ] but so but anyway but

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:36.240
World War one was this just bizarre

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:39.780
stupid until World War One Europe was

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:43.380
still all Kings and princes and uh there

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.420
was still a country called Prussia and

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.400
there was guys that went with like uh

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.220
helmets with brushes on the top and they

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:51.960
marched around and he was like the

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.359
prince of and uh it was still the whole

00:36:54.359 --> 00:36:56.940
yeah and they had some budding democracy

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.500
but they still gave an enormous amount

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.780
of power to their stupid [ __ ] yeah to

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.060
one family yes they were all related yes

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:04.500
and they were yes and they were all

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.260
married to each other yes the leaders of

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.820
World War One were cousins Kaiser

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:12.859
Wilhelm was an uncle to Nicholas Czar

00:37:12.859 --> 00:37:18.720
Russia yeah and um so they fought this

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.060
ridiculous War because and now they have

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.460
suddenly had this mechanized they had

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.140
machine guns yeah some of this [ __ ] was

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:27.599
developed here during the Civil War and

00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:30.240
they just start firing crazy weapons at

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.180
each other artillery yeah and the us but

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.339
the real the thing about that war was

00:37:35.339 --> 00:37:37.680
the Middle East it was the it was the

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.579
Turkish Ottoman Empire was falling apart

00:37:40.579 --> 00:37:43.320
and all of these European countries

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.119
wanted a piece of what was going to be

00:37:45.119 --> 00:37:47.339
there I think they had started to figure

00:37:47.339 --> 00:37:48.900
out that oil was in the Middle East I

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:50.160
don't I don't have all this worked out

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:53.640
of my head but Wilson refused to get

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.460
into the war because he knew it was an

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:58.440
imperialist [ __ ] and at a time

00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.700
America

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:02.760
was ex against going out and sending

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.560
troops other places for Imperial

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.780
imperialism was something America hated

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:08.460
because it still wasn't that long ago

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.160
that we were [ __ ] uh we were a colony

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.920
so we finally did enter World War one

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.859
and I don't know why it was which it was

00:38:16.859 --> 00:38:18.599
hard for the U.S to enter Because half

00:38:18.599 --> 00:38:20.220
the population is German

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.800
you know what I mean yes half's Irish

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.900
yeah they [ __ ] hated England yes all

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.640
this and then uh I think it was like the

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.359
Lusitania

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:35.339
I think Lusitania did have weapons on it

00:38:35.339 --> 00:38:37.560
well we were selling weapons we're

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.480
probably making money on the war but

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.420
when we entered the war we didn't fight

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.700
in the Middle East we're the only Allied

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.980
country that we didn't send any troops

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:50.000
we made up for it though lately sure

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.800
sure yeah we didn't get it but that was

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.720
our position back then we had like there

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.420
was like a morality to what we did at

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.760
least politically not economically we

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.900
never care sure because the those levers

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.400
were handled by

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.920
industry not by the government anyway I

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.300
don't know that I'm getting way out of

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:10.800
my debt I don't know that much about

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.180
Wilson so then I don't either who's

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:14.940
after Wilson Wilson after Wilson would

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.680
be

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.460
uh

00:39:19.619 --> 00:39:22.020

was corrupt he was really corrupt and

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:29.640
that started leading to

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.079

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.480
who cares yeah uh this is the Roaring

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.339
20s though so shit's going well

00:39:44.339 --> 00:39:46.260
financially yeah they had their pandemic

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:47.880
during all those guys by the way and

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:49.500
these guys are all

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.800
corrupt yes and like it's just out of

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.180
control the economy's out of control but

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.980
everything and this is post World War

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:58.079
one so who's after Coolidge Coolidge is

00:39:58.079 --> 00:39:58.920
Hoover

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.780
after Hoover right Herbert Hoover and

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:02.520
then this is [ __ ] starting to turn

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.099
around a little uh and then Here Comes

00:40:05.099 --> 00:40:08.760
FDR okay so FDR like again my Approach

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.200
is always who these guys were as people

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:14.640
and my favorite take on FDR is

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:18.480
um uh uh what's his name Churchill's so

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.520
I read this book Churchill and and uh

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.980
it's called um Franklin and uh Winston

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:25.740
about their relationship yeah Churchill

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:29.160
was a nerd he was a you know fat English

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.740
drunk nerd and he was a lord he was a

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:35.579
little Lord yeah Roy nerd now uh

00:40:35.579 --> 00:40:36.960
Franklin

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.599
Roosevelt was also a rich kid I was a

00:40:39.599 --> 00:40:42.780
nerd uh he was a nerd but he's also a um

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:46.020
really dedicated to the people and he

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:47.339
did a lot of things like up here in

00:40:47.339 --> 00:40:50.220
Upstate New York he had Hyde Park and

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:53.460
there's all these massive Estates Hyde

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:55.500
Park and the Vanderbilt Slevin live next

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.900
door and he gave his when he became

00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.760
president he gave Hyde Park to the

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.920
country he said you just let it be a

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.560
museum for a time when people when

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.500
people lived like this and he persuaded

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:08.940
his next door neighbors the Vanderbilts

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.380
to do the same he got all the upstate

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.240
rich people he said move into the City

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:14.339
and give these plates let these be

00:41:14.339 --> 00:41:16.079
places for the people to visit so that's

00:41:16.079 --> 00:41:18.780
the kind of guy he was but so Winston

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:22.380
Churchill uh worshiped uh Roosevelt he

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:24.359
just thought he was the coolest he was a

00:41:24.359 --> 00:41:26.579
Americans came off really cool back then

00:41:26.579 --> 00:41:28.500
and Churchill was like this you know

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.859
very yeah and and so there's a few

00:41:31.859 --> 00:41:33.480
intimate stories that are great about

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.940
the two of them one of them Winston came

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.319
to Hyde Park

00:41:37.319 --> 00:41:40.140
to plead the case please come into the

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:41.640
war because Franklin wasn't coming to

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.680
the war so he was he spent like a night

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.500
in Hyde Park and they talked and it was

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.599
and it was uh Churchill's feeling like

00:41:48.599 --> 00:41:50.099
for the first time that Franklin maybe

00:41:50.099 --> 00:41:51.420
liked him

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:54.240
and so the moment that they that's in

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.760
this book is that uh he was in his car

00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:00.359
Churchill at night and and FDR was

00:42:00.359 --> 00:42:01.680
seeing him off he was like at the window

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:04.859
of his car and Churchill said Franklin I

00:42:04.859 --> 00:42:07.380
feel so good to have really spent time

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.180
with you and I feel a connection with

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:13.619
you and Roosevelt said take take it easy

00:42:13.619 --> 00:42:17.339
I said just take it easy and then the

00:42:17.339 --> 00:42:19.200
other one and he just heard his feelings

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.660
then the other great thing

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:25.020
was at Yalta the conference at Yalta

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:28.140
where yeah this is good FDR

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:31.560
and Churchill are trying to get Stalin

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.960
to come into the war on the Allied he

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.160
could have come into either side it was

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.500
tossip or he could have stayed out

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.780
but a Russian front to the war was

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:40.920
everything it turned out to be

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:43.079
everything yeah same thing that happened

00:42:43.079 --> 00:42:46.140
to it's What stopped to uh it's what

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:48.839
killed Napoleon because Russia is just

00:42:48.839 --> 00:42:50.760
this deep forest and anybody who invades

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:53.040
Russia just gets absorbed and then stuck

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:56.640
for the winter it killed Napoleon and it

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.619
killed eventually took Hitler it's not

00:42:58.619 --> 00:43:00.119
where they lose but it's where they get

00:43:00.119 --> 00:43:03.960
they drains okay yeah so Churchill is

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.060
like the European Statesman he's the one

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:07.859
who's been fighting the war longer and

00:43:07.859 --> 00:43:10.079
he's like he's been mechanizing how am I

00:43:10.079 --> 00:43:12.060
going to do this and so when they get to

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:15.060
Yalta he goes to to Roosevelt and says

00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.740
let's talk let's plan how we're gonna

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:17.640
get

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.880

and

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:42.780
uh

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.839
and Roosevelt looks at Churchill and he

00:43:45.839 --> 00:43:48.000
says to Stalin Joseph look at look at

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.940
what had to be done and it was throwing

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.740
[ __ ] Winston Churchill onto the bus

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.420

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:40.680
World War II yes he did but he had to be

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.980
humiliated yeah the best was uh my cool

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.260

wanted was for them it's over there is

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:02.700
one point where he needed to meet in

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:06.780
person with FDR so the British Fleet

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:09.780
took Churchill into this middle of the

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.819
Atlantic Ocean yeah and the American

00:45:11.819 --> 00:45:14.760
Fleet sent to worship that had church

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:19.260
that had uh uh FDR's yacht on like just

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:20.880
sitting on the deck of an aircraft

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.339
carrier and they lowered his yacht into

00:45:23.339 --> 00:45:24.900
the water in the middle of the ocean

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:28.740
Jesus and it put it over to chart to the

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:31.319
English and they were ringed by like you

00:45:31.319 --> 00:45:33.060
know if the Nazis had come along there

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:36.000
was like a thousand guns just for a

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.040
meeting between those two guys on a

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:40.200
yacht drinking whiskey in the middle of

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:41.339
the ocean

00:45:41.339 --> 00:45:44.220
so that's all I got on uh FDR three

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:47.700
times yeah and then he died so here's so

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.440
Truman okay

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.060
Truman

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.740
[ __ ] the New Deal we don't need to talk

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:54.720
about it yeah don't care we are talking

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.579
about the guys not the not the American

00:45:56.579 --> 00:45:59.220
history so Truman

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:02.640
was his third vice President Truman was

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.000
uh yeah Missouri I think yes and he was

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.980
considered kind of a [ __ ] loser he

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:10.800
wasn't hated yeah he was like hated the

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.680
way that like Ted Cruz has hated like

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.960
that kind of like if you talk to people

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.839
in Washington they're just like oh I

00:46:18.839 --> 00:46:20.640
can't with that [ __ ] guy for

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:24.839
different reasons but Truman

00:46:24.839 --> 00:46:27.480
was picked FDR was like who can we pick

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.859
that's not gonna

00:46:28.859 --> 00:46:31.380
[ __ ] things up you know

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:33.780
and they picture him and Truman was a

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:36.300
guy who worked at a haberdashery uh it

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.220
didn't work out he had his he was one of

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:39.720
these guys his father was a farmer and

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:42.720
he was running his farm and then he

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.000
um went and worked at a bank and was

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.520
kicking ass yeah and then his father's

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.380
Farm failed and his fought so he took it

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.480
over and that wiped out like 10 years of

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.180
his life was just being a farmer and he

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.440
had a haberdashery that didn't work

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.420
whatever

00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:00.839
um but so Truman went to the Senate and

00:47:00.839 --> 00:47:02.520
then when he became

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:05.400
when he was oh when he was a Senator his

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:09.240
Focus was uh graft during World War II

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:12.359
basically all the money like billions of

00:47:12.359 --> 00:47:14.339
dollars would be appropriated for the

00:47:14.339 --> 00:47:17.400
war and given to American Industries and

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.680
they would all steal them and every

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:22.559
senator in Washington was stealing all

00:47:22.559 --> 00:47:24.660
the work we were fighting Hitler yeah

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:27.599
and everybody in Washington was just

00:47:27.599 --> 00:47:29.700
stealing money and fleecing their

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.920

00:49:33.839 --> 00:49:37.020
yeah but he was a very good president he

00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:39.480
nukes Japan dropped the bomb there's a

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.480
there's a and don't let it don't get it

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.640
twisted don't get it twisted they had it

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:45.480
coming

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.700
all right there's this thing in history

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.380
where everyone wants to be like I can't

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:51.660
believe they did that look into no

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:54.540
there's the account of the

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:57.420
um of the announcement of the uh Truman

00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:00.420
was on a ship when it he was on on a big

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:02.700
ship and he was having a big banquet

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:05.700
yeah and he got the report in his ear

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:08.040
like George Bush that they had just it

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:09.780
worked yeah that it worked because

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:11.940
nobody know if it even work and he did a

00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:13.680
little Ting Ting Ting Ting Ting hey

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.200
everybody just so you know we Dropped a

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:18.839
Bomb on the jet on Hiroshima it's it

00:50:18.839 --> 00:50:21.540
worked and we're starting again then I

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:23.460
think Nagasaki had dropped after also

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:25.740
and there it looks like okay and

00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:28.440
everybody everybody applauded because

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:30.599
there was no conflict

00:50:30.599 --> 00:50:33.859
yeah because

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:36.660
the Japanese were never going to

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:39.000
surrender yeah and the amount of people

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.559
that would have died this is what it's

00:50:40.559 --> 00:50:42.599
like when you get deep into a war how

00:50:42.599 --> 00:50:44.220
many people have died so far how many

00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:46.079
more will die if we do it this way yeah

00:50:46.079 --> 00:50:48.599
how many will die if we do it this way

00:50:48.599 --> 00:50:50.940
uh so that's what happened I don't have

00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:54.059
an opinion about it I doubt I do but

00:50:54.059 --> 00:50:56.339
that's fine here's the thing nobody

00:50:56.339 --> 00:50:58.500
cares about Dresden nobody cares about

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.300
no dressing way more people die yeah and

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:02.579
it's also and first off kind of well not

00:51:02.579 --> 00:51:04.500
more horrifically both had like fire

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:07.319
tornadoes yeah that just wiped out well

00:51:07.319 --> 00:51:09.900
I mean you're on fire yeah it's the

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:11.280
scariest thing in the world it's awful

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.920
it sucked the oxygen out of a city and

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:16.020
there were fire tornadoes yes

00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:18.240
people were melting in the streets yes

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:21.119
into the street going down the drains

00:51:21.119 --> 00:51:24.000
the pavement melted so they'd run out of

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.800
their houses and their feet would get

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:27.720
stuck and then they'd reach down and

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:29.880
then just be stuck in the [ __ ] I mean

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:32.480
it's the worst thing in the world but

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:35.339
you know

00:51:35.339 --> 00:51:37.200
they might have had it coming

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.940
but

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:40.740
of course there's of course these are

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:43.260
civilians this is a joke about two

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:44.819
agents run into each other on the street

00:51:44.819 --> 00:51:47.280
in Hollywood and one of them's like uh

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.660
hey what have you been up to and he goes

00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:50.460
I produced a special for you know

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:52.619
whatever just pick a you know Celine

00:51:52.619 --> 00:51:54.119
Dion or whatever yeah

00:51:54.119 --> 00:51:55.559
he goes how did you like working with

00:51:55.559 --> 00:51:57.480
her and she's like [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:00.839
worthless [ __ ] spoiled brat [ __ ]

00:52:00.839 --> 00:52:04.140
drunk [ __ ] drug addled [ __ ] I hope

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:06.300
she [ __ ] dies and the other guy goes

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:08.280
you know she's my niece and the guy goes

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.060
let me finish

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:10.920
[Laughter]

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:13.800
it's an old joke okay that's a good job

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:16.319
so so uh okay why do we get to that

00:52:16.319 --> 00:52:19.140
because because Nagasaki uh uh Hiroshima

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:21.119
so we dropped the so Truman dropped the

00:52:21.119 --> 00:52:23.160
bombs

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:26.400
um and uh won the war and then the next

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:29.579
guy is um Eisenhower

00:52:29.579 --> 00:52:31.559
I only have one good Eisenhower story

00:52:31.559 --> 00:52:33.960

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:36.660

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:43.260
and he was the president in a very good

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:45.000
time he's one of the few presidents that

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.280

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:36.599
Eisenhower Dwight Eisenhower yeah but

00:55:36.599 --> 00:55:38.040
Ike has nothing to do with it no it

00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.359
doesn't he said he had no idea why he

00:55:39.359 --> 00:55:41.520
was called like no him he said him and

00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:43.079
all his siblings were all called Ike

00:55:43.079 --> 00:55:45.119
they would call each other Ike right it

00:55:45.119 --> 00:55:46.799
was like they're like hey was he the one

00:55:46.799 --> 00:55:48.780
where it was do we do he wins that thing

00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:50.220
that happened there was that newspaper

00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:51.599
headline it said Dewey wins the election

00:55:51.599 --> 00:55:54.480
for some reason I counted too quick for

00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:55.319
some reason I thought that was always

00:55:55.319 --> 00:55:57.299
FDR holding that up

00:55:57.299 --> 00:55:59.220
I think it's FDR yeah maybe you're right

00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:00.780
I don't know I don't know what all these

00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:03.780
also rans were Truman Truman was holding

00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:05.579
it up yeah so Truman got reelected

00:56:05.579 --> 00:56:06.960
that's right

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:08.099
um

00:56:08.099 --> 00:56:09.500
so

00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:12.839
Eisenhower just running whatever so then

00:56:12.839 --> 00:56:16.440

called it a pink lady and he hated the

00:57:06.059 --> 00:57:07.740
Communists and there's a famous picture

00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:10.440
of him looking at a a piece of microfilm

00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:11.819
that it was supposed to be documents

00:57:11.819 --> 00:57:13.680
that he found that were being stolen by

00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:15.480
Communists and you know they killed the

00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:17.940
rosenbergs yeah all that stuff but they

00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:20.040
had it coming what no they didn't do

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:21.180
anything they didn't do anything they

00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:23.040
didn't do anything wait a minute when

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.960
the the Cold War started to lift anytime

00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:26.460
someone dies when the Cold War started

00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:28.799
to lift the KGB said by the way the

00:57:28.799 --> 00:57:30.900
rosenbergs never heard of them like they

00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:33.059
gave us nothing there was a giant red

00:57:33.059 --> 00:57:35.520
herring we killed a married couple with

00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:38.460
children we didn't do anything ever they

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:40.140
blamed the rosenbergs for nuclear

00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:42.119
secrets right yes but they didn't do

00:57:42.119 --> 00:57:44.819
that no and that's all Nixon was really

00:57:44.819 --> 00:57:46.859
into that [ __ ] it'd be funny if they're

00:57:46.859 --> 00:57:48.720
like we don't know anything about nukes

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:52.980
yeah we don't ever seen one so

00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:55.319
um Nixon becomes a vice president he

00:57:55.319 --> 00:57:57.180
gets in trouble and so he has to give he

00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:59.040
gives a speech on television where he's

00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:00.359
sitting at a desk it's called the

00:58:00.359 --> 00:58:03.599
Checkers speech because he had a dog

00:58:03.599 --> 00:58:06.720
um named Checkers uh who was given uh to

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.460
his children and they said it was a gift

00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:10.260
that he's he was supposed to register

00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:11.339
you know what I mean like he was taking

00:58:11.339 --> 00:58:15.180
gifts from from people pre-quote Pro

00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:17.700
whatever you call it and that the dog

00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:19.500
was an expensive dog given to his

00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:22.260
children so he goes on TV and he gives

00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:24.180
tells his finances to the American

00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:26.460
people and he says and I'm an honest

00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:28.200
person we didn't steal anything and

00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:30.180
here's what happened and he says but

00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:32.400
there's been some comment about this dog

00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.380
and my kids love that dog and we're

00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:36.000
gonna keep it and that was like this

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.619
whole moment that people were like all

00:58:37.619 --> 00:58:39.599
right you're okay but people never

00:58:39.599 --> 00:58:42.119
really trusted Nick tricky dick because

00:58:42.119 --> 00:58:44.040
of way back then

00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:46.559
so that he runs against uh [ __ ]

00:58:46.559 --> 00:58:49.020
Kennedy Kennedy

00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:52.559
um and uh that's number four he gets yes

00:58:52.559 --> 00:58:55.319
and he loot first Kennedy uh was on the

00:58:55.319 --> 00:58:57.480
ballot he tried to run against

00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:00.299
Eisenhower yes I believe so okay and

00:59:00.299 --> 00:59:02.160
then he got to the convention and he was

00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:04.500
gonna be and I think Kennedy lost in the

00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:05.579
at the convention used to be the

00:59:05.579 --> 00:59:06.780
conventions where they picked the guy

00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:09.180
yeah to whoever the [ __ ] I Adelaide

00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:11.819
Stevenson no he was his VP I don't

00:59:11.819 --> 00:59:13.619
[ __ ] remember how all this works yeah

00:59:13.619 --> 00:59:16.799
I'm confused by it so I think Adelaide

00:59:16.799 --> 00:59:19.760
Stevenson was

00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:21.720
um

00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:24.780
I think Kennedy was supposed to okay I

00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:27.500
don't care yeah

00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:30.839
so Kennedy and Nixon debate on

00:59:30.839 --> 00:59:33.599
television yeah exactly yeah

00:59:33.599 --> 00:59:35.579
when Nixon Kennedy's not the best

00:59:35.579 --> 00:59:37.440

01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:13.619
handsome man with that head of hair is

01:00:13.619 --> 01:00:15.599
unbelievable is that what a bear that

01:00:15.599 --> 01:00:18.119
head of hair

01:00:18.119 --> 01:00:19.619
not anymore

01:00:19.619 --> 01:00:21.960
no because somebody shot the back of it

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.700
who did though

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:26.160
a lot of people yeah you think like six

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:30.299
guys I think a lot of guys shot him so

01:00:30.299 --> 01:00:32.040
many they dug so many they're like four

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.660
people that shot him somebody with a

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:36.180
paper clip [ __ ] wait do you have any

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:38.940
opinions on that do you think it was do

01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:40.559
you believe it was the lone gunman Lee

01:00:40.559 --> 01:00:43.140
Harvey I think you can take any event in

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:44.520
human history

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:47.040
and find an alternate version of it if

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.319
you dig and dig and dig and I think a

01:00:49.319 --> 01:00:51.059
presidential assassination is just so

01:00:51.059 --> 01:00:53.280
interesting yeah

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.740
um that so I don't have an opinion I

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:58.020
mean I'm fascinated by it yeah it's

01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.700
really interesting there are some things

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:02.880
to read about it's fun to look into of

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.440
course because it seems the culture of

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.599
it is like the greatest it seems kind of

01:01:06.599 --> 01:01:09.119
like something was up yeah was it

01:01:09.119 --> 01:01:11.819

throats of some guys and you know they

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:23.819
offered him a false flag in Cuba and he

01:01:23.819 --> 01:01:25.980
was like no right I mean it's crazy

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:27.720

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.200
all these women but it actually was the

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:36.240
FBI he was lying but man that probably

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:37.799
was a tough sell dude it probably was

01:03:37.799 --> 01:03:39.660
your lady be like this is just like this

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:40.619

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:45.660
the FBI is trying to kill me she's like

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:49.079
who's Louise honey

01:03:49.079 --> 01:03:50.940
this is history we're going to talk

01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:52.980
about this later in podcasts eventually

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:55.079
they killed him so uh

01:03:55.079 --> 01:03:57.119
Kennedy

01:03:57.119 --> 01:04:00.420
um here's a great Kennedy story so Peter

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:01.619
soundtrack I think is what his name was

01:04:01.619 --> 01:04:03.480
Pierre Salinger one of the he was a

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.339
great he was a uh um a journalist who

01:04:05.339 --> 01:04:07.319
hung out with Kennedy a lot so they're

01:04:07.319 --> 01:04:09.119
in Kennedy's

01:04:09.119 --> 01:04:11.520
um in the Oval Office and what Kennedy

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:15.000
really liked bragging about was that he

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.440
could get anybody on the phone ever the

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.880
White House operators could get any

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:20.339
human being in the world so he said to

01:04:20.339 --> 01:04:22.380
Peter Salinger

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:25.200
um I give me a name I can get him on the

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.420
phone in 10 minutes and he happened to

01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:31.319
know that Truman Capote was uh writing a

01:04:31.319 --> 01:04:32.819
book in the woods he was like in a cabin

01:04:32.819 --> 01:04:35.579
in the woods cut off no phone on

01:04:35.579 --> 01:04:38.460
sabbatical and so he says Truman Capote

01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:41.039
and so Kennedy get picks up the phone on

01:04:41.039 --> 01:04:42.780
the coffee table says

01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:45.660
yeah get me a Truman Capote please and

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:46.920
just hangs up and then they keep talking

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:49.319
and in 10 minutes he hears like a hell

01:04:49.319 --> 01:04:51.839
like they [ __ ] got a helicopter and

01:04:51.839 --> 01:04:55.339
they lowered it and yes

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.380
so that's what he was like he liked

01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:00.180
being president he liked the [ __ ] he

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:02.160
was cool he was a cool president and

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.539
Jeff you think about him and because

01:05:03.539 --> 01:05:06.359
Nixon is Nixon and Kennedy's stories are

01:05:06.359 --> 01:05:09.359
just attached

01:05:09.359 --> 01:05:12.180
um Nixon was a nerd and Kennedy was cool

01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:14.579
and it's another thing like Churchill

01:05:14.579 --> 01:05:16.619
and FDR that Nixon was always

01:05:16.619 --> 01:05:18.720
heartbroken that people just preferred

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.760
Jack because he was a cooler guy and

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:23.400
there's a little story that's in I think

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.260
it's in Kennedy's

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:27.839
I think no it's in Nixon's

01:05:27.839 --> 01:05:28.799
um

01:05:28.799 --> 01:05:31.680
uh what do you call it in his

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:34.440
um Library about how the two of them

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.660
when they were Senators they were sent

01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:38.760
to Philadelphia

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:41.400
to debate like they used to do this the

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.660
Senate would say you they get a

01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:43.980
Democratic Republic you guys go up and

01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:46.319
debate the issue so the two of them were

01:05:46.319 --> 01:05:47.640
in a sleeper car together because

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.260
they're going overnight or whatever or

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:50.640
some City where they had to be in a

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:54.240
sleeper car and uh and Kennedy and so

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.640
Nixon suggested who who gets the top

01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:58.680
because there's bunks he says let's flip

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:01.200
a coin this is the story and then they

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.940
flipped a coin and Kennedy won that's

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:04.859
why it's a funny story to people it's

01:06:04.859 --> 01:06:07.020
the first time that they yeah yeah but I

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:08.700
picture this story like a fly on the

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:10.980
wall they're in the sleeper car and

01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:13.859
Nixon's like you know just nerd packed a

01:06:13.859 --> 01:06:15.319
little suitcase

01:06:15.319 --> 01:06:17.339
he's just [ __ ] somebody yeah

01:06:17.339 --> 01:06:19.799
Kennedy's hungover

01:06:19.799 --> 01:06:22.319
good looking dude smoking a cigarette

01:06:22.319 --> 01:06:23.760
and he's like I gotta be with this

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:27.000
[ __ ] Nixon he hates Nixon and Nixon's

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.099
like uh so I guess um

01:06:29.099 --> 01:06:32.460
we should flip a coin and Kennedy's like

01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:35.579
what yeah just don't decide who's yeah

01:06:35.579 --> 01:06:39.180
go ahead and he won he's like well you

01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:43.079
won okay dick great get up there nobody

01:06:43.079 --> 01:06:45.780
get the [ __ ] up Dad [ __ ] loser climb

01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:48.960
up there yeah so that was them

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:52.619
and then uh okay so Kennedy gets shot in

01:06:52.619 --> 01:06:56.280
the head yeah and throat yes and the

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:58.020
bullet somehow hits the gun in front of

01:06:58.020 --> 01:06:59.819
him a little weird he did have AIDS yeah

01:06:59.819 --> 01:07:02.579

yeah also the kills the governor or

01:07:04.559 --> 01:07:06.660
paralyzes the governor

01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:09.900
or um I don't know [ __ ] guy from

Texas also got shot uh whatever that's

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:13.799
another one they said today's medicine

01:07:13.799 --> 01:07:15.180
they could have he would have made it

01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:17.299
Kennedy

01:07:17.299 --> 01:07:20.880
empties his emptied head yeah

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:25.319
