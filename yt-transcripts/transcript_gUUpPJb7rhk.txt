friendships see that one's a bit extreme

00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:35.410

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:41.079

that like the Nazis did it's just all

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:48.900
these cliche they do the same [ __ ]

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.540
thing in every World War two movie which

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.339
is what like they always have that fight

00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:54.870
and it's in every war movie where like a

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.610
bomb goes off and the the buzz in the

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.560
air and you look around and slow motion

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.300
and your whole squads getting killed

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.070
yeah yeah every time it's like can we

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:06.240
not do that like that yeah look somebody

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.800
cowering like crying

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.839
well they this happened to the not like

00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:11.490
the hard ass is like looking around and

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:14.250
slow-mo happen to the Nazis that did

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.209
happen the Nazis

00:13:15.209 --> 00:13:17.369
getting them so this is versus Soviets

00:13:17.369 --> 00:13:19.439
this is like Eastern Front so that's

00:13:19.439 --> 00:13:22.470
cool I'm into that again to the Eastern

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.480
Front I'm big Eastern Front cus you're

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.740
saying the historical narratives a

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:29.129
little bit flexible in the show uh whoa

00:13:29.129 --> 00:13:30.839
did there but did they get the ear ring

00:13:30.839 --> 00:13:33.420
I don't know that's is that your ass I

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.829
think a lot of people got that but their

00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:37.439
bells rung back that the bells get rung

00:13:37.439 --> 00:13:39.449
but it's in every single movie yeah it

00:13:39.449 --> 00:13:41.009
is kind of every movie and then also

00:13:41.009 --> 00:13:43.769
every SS officer cuz alright so you

00:13:43.769 --> 00:13:44.790
gotta keep in mind these are just the

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:45.839
good Nazis

00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:48.480
okay shows about yeah the good boys but

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.249
the bad boys will show up the SS boys

00:13:50.249 --> 00:13:52.800
they'll show up and be like that is to

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.589
chew and the the good Nazis look they're

00:13:55.589 --> 00:13:57.329
not around you better get out of here

00:13:57.329 --> 00:13:59.730
you think it's cool killing civilians

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.429
I don't so this is like kind of a

00:14:02.429 --> 00:14:04.199
Gryffindor Slytherin kind of divide it

00:14:04.199 --> 00:14:06.720
is it is exactly are still under one

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:13.079
Hogwarts so it's also jarring and still

00:14:13.079 --> 00:14:19.110
wonders Gryffindor Dumbledore Dumbledore

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.240
sorry somebody it's funny to watch like

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.829
a dude in a suit like walk no room and

00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:28.019
just be like hey said hi to each other

00:14:28.019 --> 00:14:29.459
it's so funny do you

00:14:29.459 --> 00:14:33.629
but uh yeah every SS officer like

00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:35.730
they're always like eating like an apple

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.769
or like candy or something while they're

00:14:37.769 --> 00:14:40.019
like kill them you know I mean there's

00:14:40.019 --> 00:14:42.540
just a very common thing in all these

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.670
[ __ ] movies yeah it's kind of weird

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.259
although did they didn't SS officers

00:14:46.259 --> 00:14:47.699
constantly like stroke cats and eat

00:14:47.699 --> 00:14:48.990
candies while they did that I think they

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.459
did feel like that's a kind of uniquely

00:14:50.459 --> 00:14:52.980
German thing to do eating it's sweet

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.049
you're gonna be doing a delicacy while

00:14:55.049 --> 00:14:57.269
you carry out like a horrible thing yeah

00:14:57.269 --> 00:15:04.439
Steve you're Jewish what happened what's

00:15:04.439 --> 00:15:06.449
your take on this I don't I didn't even

00:15:06.449 --> 00:15:09.929
follow the plot this oh they're good

00:15:09.929 --> 00:15:17.160
Nazi Germans why would they be Nazis

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.410
well cuz you had to be if you were a

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:20.759
German in World War two and you were a

00:15:20.759 --> 00:15:27.419
guy or age you're out true they brought

00:15:27.419 --> 00:15:28.920
us in late you

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.079
when [ __ ] was falling apart they brought

00:15:31.079 --> 00:15:32.639
in the geezers yeah what was that like

00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:34.139
for the geezers that were like I guess

00:15:34.139 --> 00:15:36.149
I'm [ __ ] Nazi yeah this sucks yeah

00:15:36.149 --> 00:15:39.029
well they they were all fired up the

00:15:39.029 --> 00:15:40.740
users were fired up dude I mean imagine

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.709
the Fox News geezers here boomers

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:45.899
imagine the geezers over there they must

00:15:45.899 --> 00:15:48.360
have been like oh yeah for sure I fought

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.980
in World War 1 dude I knew we were the

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.620
best yeah yeah I think everyone was

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.170
pretty [ __ ] up from ww1 or ww1 got him

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:57.029
fired up yeah everyone got like

00:15:57.029 --> 00:16:00.500
attrocious Lee butt [ __ ] and that was

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.839
or why there was no reason for the whole

00:16:03.839 --> 00:16:05.279
war to have happened so the whole

00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:07.589
country was like we have [ __ ] yeah

00:16:07.589 --> 00:16:09.060
what the [ __ ] was in [ __ ] us and then

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:31.980
[ __ ] Dumbledore showed up damn bring a

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.540
little levity to world war ii dude I

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.490
know it's an atrocity so it's the only

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:36.570
you know the only thing you can do is

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:40.980
laugh that's the only thing had my

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.329
culture knows how to do through genocide

00:16:42.329 --> 00:16:44.550
dude excuse me yes excuse me pardon me

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:48.620
[Laughter]

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:55.560
sorry Steve

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.820
I just thought I'd never read Harry

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.800
Potter I don't understand sorry I'm

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:04.199
processing historical trauma yeah Harry

00:17:04.199 --> 00:17:10.439
Potter that's your hang-up on this it

00:17:10.439 --> 00:17:12.089
was a sorting hat either you when you

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:15.540
joined when those students got Hogwarts

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.130
Harry Potter that's the that's the

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.470
school they put a hat on to decide which

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.890
class they're in okay so in Matz Matz

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.839
sick and twisted joke that I don't

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:26.669
approve of that I would distance myself

00:17:26.669 --> 00:17:30.660
from like you the way I would did it but

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.760
it is in Matt's world I think what he

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.500
thinks is funny is a line of Jewish

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.350
people and Nazi is putting a sorting hat

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.200
on them that's telling them Dachau

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.190
Austrians

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:44.980
gingka stuff like that but I would make

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:50.640
or the us now they didn't get the nine

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.710
wasn't too yeah the us wasn't very

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.570
receptive true yeah that's true actually

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:56.710
no one really talks about that

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:58.870
yeah the us didn't really help out that

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.720
well the United States intelligence had

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.450
to have known kind of what's going on

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.740
there's no [ __ ] way they were like

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:09.789
wait what yeah I bet I bet in yes I bet

00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:11.710
the deep seat knew how I'm pretty sure

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:13.600
but I think a lot of the boys were

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.690
shocked when they found it you know when

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:18.580
they started like finding camps and [ __ ]

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.230
they were like oh my god this is what

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:22.450
you guys were doing the [ __ ] you guys do

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.039
it over here yeah well I mean what do

00:18:24.039 --> 00:18:25.630
they think like we thought you guys are

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:27.880
just kind of like you know POWs stuff

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.330
they did put out a propaganda that was

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.059
like hey these are kind of fun camps

00:18:34.059 --> 00:18:36.520
where we're exercising and eating

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.840

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.220
people be like hey don't worry bout

00:18:56.919 --> 00:18:59.260
where it comes got it yeah and the show

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.899
there's no real plot it's just about

00:19:00.899 --> 00:19:03.070
well there's a plot each one of them

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.570
it's kind of [ __ ] annoying they also

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.720
keep a meeting up throughout the show

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.720
during world war two they keep running

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.559
into each other in like Russia all four

00:19:14.559 --> 00:19:18.490
friends it's kind of [ __ ] annoying on

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.350
Amazon it's like dude yeah and the whole

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:21.820
thing they keep running into each other

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.070
one of the girls becomes a nurse one of

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:27.059
them becomes like a famous like USO type

00:19:27.059 --> 00:19:33.549
diva you know yeah yeah and they just

00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:35.559
keep [ __ ] running into it like the

00:19:35.559 --> 00:19:37.059
field hospitals right behind the line

00:19:37.059 --> 00:19:39.429
that the two brothers are on so they

00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:40.960
keep seeing that girl I don't know it's

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.679
it's yes pretty I mean I guess so

00:19:44.679 --> 00:19:46.600
it's got to be tough for you be such a

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.279
history buff and watch these movies and

00:19:48.279 --> 00:19:49.600
have all these things constantly you're

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.539
also a very staunch realist yeah which I

00:19:52.539 --> 00:19:54.790
think makes for horrible

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:56.620
television and movies if things are just

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.850
totally real it isn't like he would

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:00.430
never say that in that situation it's

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:01.720
like well then nobody's gonna say

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.230
anything

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:03.670
yeah I wonder how you'd really play that

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.080
out if they were like that was the show

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.030
and then they likes all each other and

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.530
the characters is completely dispersed

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.330
and like slowly died and like live like

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:15.610
slow meaningless live real where the guy

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:17.650
just gets he just freezes to death the

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.630
first day yeah it's like all right good

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:22.210
end of the show that might be your

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:23.680
calling dude you might have to write a

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.110
world of the most real world war 2 story

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.820
ever yeah guy that just hangs out for

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.320
like three years and then finally gets

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.000
on the front line just get zing - right

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.360
in the head right away oh cool

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.220
that'd be nice someone's just sitting

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:37.570
there kicking around kind of like a

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.910
half-assed relationship ultimately gets

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.260
the ranks doesn't really believe in what

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.000
he's doing gets murdered

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.440
fade to black [ __ ] what do you think

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.300
about that I don't think that's a good I

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.890
wouldn't watch the Jew cosign that

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:57.280
project no III don't really I don't know

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.930
I know I don't have a good explanation

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:02.020
for that I was thinking about when

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.310
you're talking I mean can I just switch

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:08.380
the subject what please don't please

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.410
let's [ __ ] talk it's not that easy

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:16.330
man I mean what I don't know I'm just

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.680
like this is funny I want to hear I'm

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.730
actually on the edge of my seat I want

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:19.900
to hear I'm glad you switched your

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.640
subject what do you gotta say well I was

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.530
just gonna talking about political

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:25.570
pragmatism because I was reading

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:28.030
Kissinger Henry Kissinger oh man I don't

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:31.600
like kiss oh well I I mean I really like

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.630
him in this book yeah okay you know I

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:36.010
know a lot of people find him to be a

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:42.670
war criminal you know I but but even if

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:45.100
he even if that's true that he is a war

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.660
criminal you'd still like I would still

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.360
read a book by a murderer if there was

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.860
information that I you know was

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.860
interested in so nevertheless the what

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.590
when Tiananmen Square happened was so

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.780
interesting is that they had been you

00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.590
know this guy

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.480
Dana Xiao ping had been like making all

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.180
this progress in the country after mal

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:07.420
and you know but it never claimed to be

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.630
anything but you know

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.860
well II didn't claim to be like a

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.170
Western democracy and anyway Tiananmen

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.870
Square happens and there's all this

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:18.850
international condemnation dang is just

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:22.690
like what are you guys doing like he was

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:24.850
he and Bush had this back and forth it

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.770
was George HW Bush at the time that was

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.650
like relations went south really quick

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:32.560
because Bush was like our people can't

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.080
see that degree of government repression

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:40.000
and not flip out about it but yet if you

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.390
put pressure on China in that situation

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.190
you may undo a lot of the progress that

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:48.070
had been done from opening themselves up

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:49.780
to markets which is exactly what

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.150
happened so it's this weird position

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:55.600
where do you do the pragmatic thing in

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.940
that moment which is just kind of like

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.550
let it go and not say anything about

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:03.220
which of course we couldn't do but it

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.290
you know in the long run yeah so just

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:07.060
Kissinger walking through those those

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.280
arguments is really interesting and I

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.330
was there ones that I would never have

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:11.920
considered because I would just be like

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.500
no you we have our ideals and that's it

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.840
and there's no compromise but it's like

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.940
does that undo everything you know it's

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.190
if there's a revolution happening or

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:23.200
change happening it can't happen

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:29.980
overnight and so you know yeah yeah also

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:31.300
so you are you talking about China now

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.150
is that time that how interested in now

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.280
I I don't know anything about it right

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.820
in Hong Kong yeah yeah so you know it's

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.890
just one of those things and Daeng was

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:42.970
saying he was like when you're trying to

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:45.070
do reform you you always have strife in

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:47.110
the country because there's a group of

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:49.750
people who don't want reform and then

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:50.800
there's a group of people who think

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.170
reforms not happening fast enough and so

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:55.180
then in you know how do you navigate

00:23:55.180 --> 00:24:00.850
that and what a kiss a he was like um he

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:03.610
he subscribes to I guess realpolitik is

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:06.100
the term which is pragmatism so in that

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:07.840
case he didn't really weigh in on what

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.310
he would do he was just giving you the

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:12.070
the how difficult the situation was to

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:14.260
navigate politically and at that time

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.840
this guy if you look people and trying

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.100
to keep getting like banished and then

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.260
brought back and then banished like dang

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.040
had been sent away for a while

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.050
and there was a physicist named Fang

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:27.680
something and he had something to do

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.900
with the protests and then sought

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.600
refugee in the American Embassy are you

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.560
familiar no no this is Fang yeah okay

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.860
something and then there it was all this

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.750
strife about you know dang saying we

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.430
need him back and Bush was like I can't

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:48.230
I can't give you this guy back so dang

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:50.750
wanted fang back yeah yeah hey cuz he

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:53.390
you know and so then that became this

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:55.430
huge turmoil and Kissinger had to go and

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.220
try and negotiate that and I haven't

00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.570
gotten aware that ends up but I think

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:02.210
they end up just sending fang to some

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:05.510
other place you know damn

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:07.370
yeah it's we turn this [ __ ] bizarre

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:08.960
man [ __ ] scares the hell out of me it's

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.300
yeah and how and and little billion of a

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.550
billion [ __ ] but that was like 1.3

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:14.810
billion people two billion people or

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:16.730
something and also it's like how do you

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:20.170
interact with a country like that like a

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.990
totalitarian regime right how undermine

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.180
it from within establish your own

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:27.530
leadership and take all their natural

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.540
resources eventually which is what

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.430
they're trying to do to us I think do

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:32.960
you read the thing on Rogan about all

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.050
the fentanyl coming from China yeah do

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:38.060
they're using the opium wars like that

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.290
[ __ ] England did to them the Chinese

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:42.080
joke Prince pretty much they killed

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.250
Prince you've all Tom Petty died Tom

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.260
Petty died from fentanyl to their kid

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.810
they killed Petty and Prince yes already

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:52.670
took he thought he was taking a [ __ ]

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:54.590
good for them good for them on the old

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:58.040
reverse [ __ ] opium wars did I mean

00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.540
you think they did like they had their

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.610
own I mean I know that's the ultimate

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:02.900
[ __ ] comeback

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.400
yeah that's a hard remember when the

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.310
west of the sauce do you think about

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:08.900
this do you think they dress their

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.460
people they're like we have killed Tom

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:17.720
Petty he died like a dog also I know

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.990
someone who just died from GHB what's

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.300
that that's like the rohypnol it's like

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.340
a date rape drug but ravers will take

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:26.120
that as well

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.430
he'll roofie themselves yeah it was like

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:30.320
my my one boy was telling me about he's

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.340

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.900
yeah dude he just was partying drinking

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.370
and the girl he was hanging out with it

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:39.630
was like let's do date rape drugs

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:42.000
together and the dude just died that's

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.410
like and I would like to heard the news

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:44.160
and it was like you know I was like

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.600
nighttime I was like putting something

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.750
outside and it just was like [ __ ] what a

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:51.270
dumb shitty way to die now and it's also

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:52.770
like that's sorry I thought was like

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:54.330
fentanyl just usually like if you're

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:56.220
drinking and someone offers you drugs I

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.050
wonder if it's like if he if she was

00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:59.240
like let's do it and he was like I

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:05.130
shouldn't come on and I can't imagine

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:07.530
died I've always had bass who have been

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:10.260
like I've always had very pragmatic I've

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.400
we watched the king do you guys see the

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.730
king on Netflix mm-hmm it's great but

00:28:52.730 --> 00:29:01.190
it's great it's Tim Dylan it's great he

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:04.080
the King King Henry at the time O'Connor

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.940
was told me this last night cuz I looked

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.080
it up and it said he died of dysentery

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.790
which is pretty funny like Timothy

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.860
Xiaomei plays this like awesome badass

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.990
King and then you look into it it's like

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:16.730
oh he died at thirty five of diarrhea

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.470
but it turns out he was like riding

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:22.200
around on a very hot day in his Knight

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.900
outfit and just respect and his armor

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.700
and passed out and died probably of

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.360
heatstroke

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.950
because they didn't they're [ __ ]

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:30.840
idiots so he's driving around in a

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.900
[ __ ] metal suit in the night like 90

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.760
degrees is probably like 200 degrees

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:40.500
inside his armor just my lord have a sip

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.910
of water and he's a kid out of my face

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:46.169
plus the waters just dying in there

00:29:46.169 --> 00:29:48.360
there was also a there's also I forget

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:48.960
who it was

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.179
I wanted to say Barbarossa but I think

00:29:51.179 --> 00:29:52.650
I'm wrong about there like Fredrik or

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:54.870
something one of these guys that went to

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:57.030
the Middle East and I think it was a

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:59.669
crusade and he was they he like found

00:29:59.669 --> 00:30:01.950
water and just ran into the water and

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:05.100
was wearing his armor oh [ __ ] I'm just

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.140
drowned right away he's into the water

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.660
it just drowned in front of oh my god

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:11.250
and I was just thinking about how funny

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:12.780
it is to be those guys that he brought

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.970
like you're just a [ __ ] from a village

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:17.490
in like Germany and yeah there's our

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:19.440
fearless leader who brought us here

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:23.549
well [ __ ] he's drowned himself standing

00:30:23.549 --> 00:30:26.700
in the desert how do we get home

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.380
surrounding an armored would be stupid

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:33.720
submerged so everybody waited like 10

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.160
minutes they're like cuz everybody told

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:41.460
them he was also got a camp set up for

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:47.210
two days I wonder what he's up to

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.620

a modern day that's a thing that

00:30:58.679 --> 00:31:00.690
everyone gets away from is the personal

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:02.190
agency everyone tries to act like you're

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:03.690
don't matter and it's like here's a

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:06.240

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:10.950
will only happen to you if you take

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:13.200
roofie drugs while you're drinking all

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:52.320
in a rough neighborhood okay okay and so

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.390
yeah you just don't answer the door for

00:34:54.390 --> 00:34:55.560
people that you don't know that's a

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.120
reasonable thing everybody can call me a

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.950
racist for that but it's just like you

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:00.360
know now I've seen your neighborhood

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:04.410
it's one of the shitty ones yeah so you

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:08.550
got to eat the scissors talk bro walk on

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:11.610
you got that you were about to let the

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:13.800
scissors sang on them no I

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.540
if you attacked with scissors would be a

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:17.119
stab

00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:26.509
I had them in stab would you handed it

00:35:26.509 --> 00:35:27.859
to him be like run down the hallway as

00:35:27.859 --> 00:35:32.539
fast as you can I braced it I was gonna

00:35:32.539 --> 00:35:35.240
throw my shoulder and hip into the door

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.130
maybe stab a hand as I was trying to

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:38.720
slam and then spin the scissors like a

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:43.099
Raphael his side it's like wait what did

00:35:43.099 --> 00:35:44.869
this guy what use is out of his mind no

00:35:44.869 --> 00:35:47.029
no he also could have just been looking

00:35:47.029 --> 00:35:49.940
for a places I mean but he did not seem

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.140
like he was on drugs or anything like

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.910
that yeah I think what he was probably

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:54.410
doing when you're like he had other

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:56.539
motives was probably trying to keep some

00:35:56.539 --> 00:35:59.079
ounce of dignity or pride while he was

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:23.119
slumber party you could play with your

00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:25.400

checking to see if anyone was there

00:36:58.339 --> 00:37:00.170

time I was waiting on a train and I

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:21.499

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:41.580
much when I like this just doing this I

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:43.710

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:47.400

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:51.060
head good one was the seat cushion okay

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:53.040
these are the roids and it was just like

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.200
just let me stand chained and it's just

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.900
like you know I'm in this you know and I

00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.640
just the whole thing in his [ __ ]

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.520
reaction was my reaction to use the

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.470
standard so your reactions I and now

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:07.200
again I didn't have I did say a few

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.070
things out loud

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:10.770
but what do you say I'll out well what

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:12.990
happens where you say no overwhelmed are

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:14.700
you saying mean things to me know which

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:25.740
is you saying very personal even go it

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.180
wasn't about you but it was about like a

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:28.830
different thing you know I've done that

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:29.940
on public where I'm like thinking about

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:33.840
southern I talked about it out loud yeah

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.880
but this one was like I need to stand up

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.870
and then he was like come on

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:46.230
I need to just let me stand it's like

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:48.450
dude don't [ __ ] singe sit down what's

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:50.400

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:56.160
got hemorrhoids and then he does stuff

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.260
like that and then it's just like you

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:00.360
know but then he threw me through a loop

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.010
because in the car ride to Saxbys he was

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:04.140
really amenable to different positions

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:07.440
that I potentially yeah I wanted you to

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:11.040
lay on so Steve could lay on his belly

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.800

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.350

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:31.800
I love my dad what no I love him I was

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.870
gonna have him do I don't know if I told

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:35.790

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:37.290
record him reading a public apology

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:44.370
about the toilet scenario oh yeah I took

00:42:44.370 --> 00:43:11.970
that knocked on his door without the

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:16.140
scissor you shall face the scissor you

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:18.240
know listen my daddy you wouldn't really

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:20.460
be able to tell that I'm his son so much

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:22.440
I mean he's like a bigger guy and it

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:30.270
doesn't yeah sure anyway he's jacked oh

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:31.650
my god

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:33.570
but can we shake about New York well

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:35.040
when I first moved he like moved me in

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.240
and that

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.650
I think this was like one of our first

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:38.970
conversations we had had about

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:41.190
hemorrhoids and he was like man he gave

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:42.240
me the birds and the bees

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:46.230
he was like you gotta had these wipes

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:49.740
these preparation-h wipes it's like you

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:51.930
know before that I'd have grapes hanging

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:57.150
out no he was taking shop dumps dude I

00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:59.310
guess so I wanted you to see that toilet

00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:01.080
was probably like mystical ruins of like

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:08.310
blood splattered shuffle up the doors

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:11.990
like what are you doing there I was like

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.470
you use those wipes I was like I'll use

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:18.060
the wipes like Steven I'm telling he's

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:22.740
like actually years about your ass I

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:23.520
guess yeah

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.810
he wants his boy to have a healthy whole

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:36.080

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:38.430

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:54.780
to get one back in my whole like a

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:57.830
little it's like a dishwasher plan white

00:44:57.830 --> 00:45:00.570
little cylinder it's almost like if you

00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:02.099
think of like a sperm because it's got a

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:06.530
little bulb at the top so what's it like

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:10.109
a little blocker come right and once it

00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:12.589
reaches a threshold over the things like

00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:15.150
Buzzle takes it take giver like role

00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:16.680

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.990
thing goes is it dissolve is there like

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:32.760
a carrying case very spooky it feels

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.140
like someone's in there taking it from

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:35.369
you don't know someone's in there it's

00:45:35.369 --> 00:45:36.150
like a Ouija board

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:37.530
it's like sleep porn it's like where

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:38.880
you're using the Ouija board and all

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:42.000
sonic controls itself you push this

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.520
thing up like halfway and then all of a

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.290
sudden it's like your butthole doesn't

00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:49.970
what hole takes oh my god

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.540
but I was saying the vehicle that

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:53.010
carries us up does it disintegrators it

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:54.450
popped back out there's no vehicle it's

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:57.420
a piece of [ __ ] it disintegrates so

00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:59.910
use your finger to push up the back end

00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:03.390
the GU it's not and if you put them in

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:04.860
the refrigerator then

00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:10.830
oh you're holding off repro and then is

00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:11.880
it kind of like when you go to like a

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:17.130
drive-thru bank teller cylinder - you

00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:18.750

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:20.700
and it's cool it's crazy I'm saying what

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:23.420
happens to the cylinder it disintegrates

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:25.940
made out of comes just the medicine

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:30.360

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.700
something squirts oh no no no it's just

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:35.520
I think there's a visioning a douche no

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:39.090

the medicinal prize it just feel good

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.710
there's have medicinal properties I

00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:49.340

you know it's the magic stick it's so

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.220
good I do it just for pleasure I do it

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:00.660
without happening so what's the biggest

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:07.640
one you can get it's a big the black box

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.990
usually it's nice because they give me a

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:14.630
yellow box so you know it's small steel

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:17.220
like it's autographed the outside the

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.590
yellow is the classic but then you can

00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:21.720
upgrade if you did the black box extreme

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.760

the of the weird thing I was gonna tell

00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:47.840
you guys that I've started doing is I've

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:50.580
rub minoxidil on my face

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:53.970
what which is like Rogaine on your face

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:55.500
yeah yeah try to get a beard

00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:57.570
yeah there's like a whole community I

00:52:57.570 --> 00:53:00.210
think it's just like stop looking for

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:03.630
communities I can't help its I did was a

00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:06.210
YouTube thing to get a beer to go on

00:53:06.210 --> 00:53:08.100
yeah they're called monoxides and like

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.360
people that can't grow a beard rub

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:12.090
Rogaine on their face it's crazy it's

00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:17.070
it's actually wearing a shave just like

00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:20.820
a beard what it's kind of crazy cuz I

00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:23.850
never I just gotta be honest I don't

00:53:23.850 --> 00:53:26.550
think you should do that alright I just

00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:29.040
there has to be repercussions to rub and

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.600
Rogaine on your face well it's what's

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:32.930
the difference between that in your head

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:35.160
neither I think there's repercussions to

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.810
that is that like the pin to comment and

00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:40.740
therefore yeah well when your friends

00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:42.420
argue with you here's what you said what

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:43.920
is the what is the side effects of

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.600
Rogaine how does it work what was

00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:48.150
originally developed for to lower blood

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:50.190
pressure as a pill and then they noticed

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:52.560
people had like weird growth and so you

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:55.440
could rub it on your head and then

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:56.910
people started rubbing it on their face

00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:59.460
and grew beards that doesn't work for

00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:02.970
everybody but whoa does it is it like it

00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:04.410
was just head hair does it grow what

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:05.850
kind of hair is like if I rub it on my

00:54:05.850 --> 00:54:09.420
pubes would I get like it people are

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:11.490

00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:13.710
and get a nice straight yellow nice like

00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:16.980
bud cut dude imagine that if you like

have benefits from other ones like

catchy beards I could get a little

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:47.730
Rogaine beard I wanted to thicken it up

00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:49.880

like to get a mustache you think a

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:09.960
mustache would be fun

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.210
you'd be [ __ ] really sick with a

00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:14.670
mustache yeah you'd be a problem could

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:16.560
be a problem on the streets that kid

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:18.090
would never knock on you won't you can

00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:19.710
lose the scissors if you get a mustache

00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:21.210
they might send you to China to deal

00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:22.770
with them like curbs you get it must ask

00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:24.150

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:25.710
let him know I would love to be a

00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:40.110
diplomat you'd be you like take over the

00:55:40.110 --> 00:55:42.180
world if you were a political leader no

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:44.850
no no no no it would really be very

00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:45.780
peaceful

00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.270
dude I'm come on man what are you

00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:49.980
talking about you would be very

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:51.690
difficult to deal with you know what I

00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:54.480
wasn't into you I was taking politics I

00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:57.060
was eating a lot of people against you I

00:55:57.060 --> 00:56:00.150
would make a deal immediately then I'd

00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:03.540
make a horrible shady deal day one and

00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:05.730
just never be aware did you have

00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:09.570
something because Shane was talking

00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:11.400
about the opium wars yeah which is I

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:13.710
understand it is like Britta the British

00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:15.570
wanted to open trade with China back in

00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:18.510
the day I think this is like 17 50 to 80

00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:20.580
or something on there so they sail over

00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:23.340
and they they bring like a litany of

00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:25.770
their things that they've created so

00:56:25.770 --> 00:56:27.210
they've got like a chariot a hot-air

00:56:27.210 --> 00:56:27.570
balloon

00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:31.410
you know chariot yeah cannon then

00:56:31.410 --> 00:56:33.510
they're showing this stuff but the

00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:36.390
chariots predate that but I may have

00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:37.830
read that hot-air balloon for sure I'm

00:56:37.830 --> 00:56:40.080
pretty sure they he wrote chariot but

00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.550
this was from the Kissinger book

00:56:41.550 --> 00:56:42.840
obviously but well true that would have

00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:43.890
been big in China because they were

00:56:43.890 --> 00:56:45.240
using people instead of horses

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:47.790
oh yeah Cherry's no need to use that

00:56:47.790 --> 00:56:49.109
rickshaw I hear you're saying exactly

00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:51.750
they hadn't chariots in like 1400s in

00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:53.400
like Ireland and now they Terry it's

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:56.010
Egypt yeah yeah so

00:56:56.010 --> 00:56:57.780
then he's saying that basically China

00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:59.610
had this it didn't have the sort of

00:56:59.610 --> 00:57:01.260
religion that some of the Western

00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:03.300
cultures had where it's like God made XY

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:04.920
and Z mm-hmm he sold us like China

00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:06.600
always existed it was always the

00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:08.730
greatest let me [ __ ] you up real quick

00:57:08.730 --> 00:57:10.110
I forgot have you ever got no no you're

00:57:10.110 --> 00:57:12.570
fine have you ever gotten into the how

00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:13.920
people who speak different languages

00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.090
have different perceptions of reality

00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:17.730
because of like the past like to having

00:57:17.730 --> 00:57:20.040
different tenses and like present future

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.320
versus all that I have it they interpret

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.460
reality completely different because

00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:24.660
they have a whole different language in

00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:25.830
different way of seeing the world that's

00:57:25.830 --> 00:57:27.150
really interesting pretty cool but go

00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:29.220
ahead yet to send me something I have a

00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:32.730
book on it's pretty cool so they show

00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:34.950
this stuff to the Emperor and because

00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:36.720
the Emperor's under the mindset that

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.460
China is the greatest it's like well if

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:40.020
China didn't make it and it doesn't

00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:42.030
actually matter so he's looking at the

00:57:42.030 --> 00:57:44.280
cannons and like they're fires no made

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:47.730
in China sticker on that so we don't

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:48.360
need this junk

00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:51.030
so he's like it's a toy so McDonald's

00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:58.500
toys were their answer to that is

00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:03.090
Inspector Gadget look at these

00:58:03.090 --> 00:58:05.220
bobblehead figurine look at this grimace

00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:12.900
we made [ __ ] made slaves make that's

00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:14.460
you when you think you're like the

00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:16.470
Chinese slave like all those slave like

00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:18.240
those sweatshops and [ __ ] mmm you think

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.890
of that make like toiling over like

00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:21.990
iPhones and [ __ ] there is definitely a

00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:23.460
Happy Meal factory where they were just

00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:25.620
sitting there making like a smiley face

00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:28.230
on a [ __ ] monster every day little

00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:31.860
kid some kid opens up their burger and

00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:35.730
is like yeah that's fine just think the

00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:37.080
little kids that were making it that

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:38.610
didn't have any toys of their own just

00:58:38.610 --> 00:58:43.890
like I want that one called the grommet

00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:45.090
and like one of the dudes breaks their

00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:51.540
little brother's finger yeah it's no fun

00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:53.670
that's no fun so yeah but they didn't

00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:55.050
they invent like I guess there's another

00:58:55.050 --> 00:58:56.670
thing I've been thinking about like with

00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:58.170
all this it's like what the [ __ ] am I

00:58:58.170 --> 00:59:00.270
doing with my life you know like I like

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:02.280
there's stuff like that going over it's

00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:03.990
like what can I do to help but anyway

00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:09.930
good don't question

00:59:09.930 --> 00:59:12.539
the Chinese regime that's the biggest

00:59:12.539 --> 00:59:14.279
thing you can do right now to help okay

00:59:14.279 --> 00:59:16.500
don't question them and just let them do

00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:17.599
their thing

00:59:17.599 --> 00:59:20.400
yeah I'm kidding that's what they gotta

00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:23.880
try for the MBA Hong Kong LeBrons like

00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:27.690
well it's pretty nuanced yeah LeBron

00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:29.819
coming in hot with you know China take

00:59:29.819 --> 00:59:32.190
I'd appreciated that it was tight so

00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:34.470
back to the you know so the Emperor's

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:35.880
watch this can it doesn't really you

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:36.900
know he's unfazed by it

00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:39.029
so the he sends the British back was

00:59:39.029 --> 00:59:40.500
sort of like a condescending note to the

00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:41.579
Queen that she didn't like a hot air

00:59:41.579 --> 00:59:43.770
balloon wasn't yeah apparently just the

00:59:43.770 --> 00:59:45.210
only thing he really took to was they

00:59:45.210 --> 00:59:46.980
they brought like four German musicians

00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:48.630
or whatever they were the four musicians

00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:50.220
they played every night they're like

00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:53.279
this is correct yeah these guys rule so

00:59:53.279 --> 00:59:55.109
he sends them back with sort of oh and

00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:56.910
it was funny though because when they

00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:58.890
had the ships and they were like sailing

00:59:58.890 --> 01:00:00.930
them the Chinese put like big signs on

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:02.609
their like gifts for the Emperor and

01:00:02.609 --> 01:00:04.589
they're like well it's that yeah it's

01:00:04.589 --> 01:00:06.990
like we're trying to so what Emperor

01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:09.720
thought he could keep them was

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:14.160
propaganda right so then when they go

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:17.609
back at some point I'm sorry I love that

01:00:17.609 --> 01:00:19.200
it was like yeah we got a hot air

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.150
balloon chariot we got some [ __ ] sick

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:23.339
musicians like yeah that's a [ __ ]

01:00:23.339 --> 01:00:30.150
heroin stage he's like oh you try this

01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:32.039
shitty [ __ ] rules

01:00:32.039 --> 01:00:34.470
hot air balloons [ __ ] suck yeah it's

01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:36.029
tied to be unimpressed by a hot air

01:00:36.029 --> 01:00:38.250
balloon just like this is pretty like

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:39.660
when people weren't this is before the

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:41.880
Wright brothers right yes oh dude it

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.799
flew over and the Emperor was like man

01:00:43.799 --> 01:00:47.250
all right I see how that works whatever

01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:51.660
yeah they had gunpowder didn't it for

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:54.960
like fireworks I think so they yeah this

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:58.140
is so much thicker so they then the

01:00:58.140 --> 01:00:59.279
merchants go and they start selling

01:00:59.279 --> 01:01:02.099
opium and this is obviously you know not

01:01:02.099 --> 01:01:03.779
good because now they're there people

01:01:03.779 --> 01:01:05.460
are like you know getting addicted to

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:08.819
opium so they violently sort of kick out

01:01:08.819 --> 01:01:11.039
those traders and then that you know the

01:01:11.039 --> 01:01:14.760
traders tra like Trader Joe's Trader

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.789
Joe's and that gets back to the British

01:01:17.789 --> 01:01:19.710
and now the British like come in and the

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:22.400
trader Steve's

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:28.970
not treating on treacherous alright god

01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:32.070
don't you dare trade on trading on you

01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:34.770
don't hate okay yeah I just I mean the

01:01:34.770 --> 01:01:36.540
one the one really bizarre thing I just

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:38.010
want to say this Oh God

01:01:38.010 --> 01:01:41.310
you don't have to why good so anyway

01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:45.119
they they come around they like black

01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:47.760
the ports you know Chinese English the

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.350
British do right in retaliation for

01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:51.240
these opium for like what would happen

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.490
to their traders so they block the ports

01:01:53.490 --> 01:01:55.109
they start firing off the cannons all of

01:01:55.109 --> 01:01:57.540
a sudden everybody's like oh [ __ ] we

01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:01.350
should have kept those cannons notes are

01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:05.790
going off fireworks in response so then

01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:08.609
they have to come to a agreement right

01:02:08.609 --> 01:02:10.619
like a treaty and one of the things that

01:02:10.619 --> 01:02:12.240
then the British put in writing and I

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.730
could send this via was like they said

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:16.640
to the Chinese like you have to stop

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.050
publicly saying that the British are

01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:20.730
trembling in the face of the Emperor

01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:25.740
like we won you have to stop saying it

01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:27.840
we're obeying and that we're trembling

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.910
in the face of it's like language like

01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:32.130
that that they kept using damn this is

01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:33.600
really interesting so they stopped

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.320
talking [ __ ] yeah like you won you're

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:41.160
here to thank we s to berra Singh yeah

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.560
it's interesting yeah now we have

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:47.520
fentanyl sure and that's why they return

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.090
the favor

01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:51.660
yeah was making all those revolutions in

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:53.760
China and this was like in the 70s he

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:56.400
was like we need to focus on math and

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.020
science we need to catch up with the

01:06:25.279 --> 01:06:27.109
really have it as this guy told me it's

01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:28.369
not as much in Germany and elsewhere

01:06:28.369 --> 01:06:30.829
it's more so what do you mean like as

01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:36.289

01:06:36.289 --> 01:06:38.479
has it Germany has German majorly okay

01:06:38.479 --> 01:06:40.609
Germany ever since World War two has

01:06:40.609 --> 01:06:42.680
been kinda at the forefront of like no

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:44.900
we're woke we're woke us [ __ ] true yes

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:47.329
true yeah yeah and they said okay and

01:06:47.329 --> 01:06:48.559
they're like real good they're kind of

01:06:48.559 --> 01:06:50.779
like smug about it too yeah I know they

01:06:50.779 --> 01:06:52.759
are pretty kind of real like we sent up

01:06:52.759 --> 01:06:54.949
America she made fun of your stupid

01:06:54.949 --> 01:06:57.469

right actually I didn't think about guys

01:07:01.729 --> 01:07:03.709
take a couple plays off of being smug

01:07:03.709 --> 01:07:05.749
ya know century before you guys can

01:07:05.749 --> 01:07:07.309
start acting up yes especially

01:07:07.309 --> 01:07:09.799
considering like every bad scenario was

01:07:09.799 --> 01:07:12.670
compared to like you guys did yeah

01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:14.150
that's true

01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:15.709
that's also kind of makes sense they'd

01:07:15.709 --> 01:07:17.539
be the ones kind of doing them if I take

01:07:17.539 --> 01:07:20.479

the French always you seem like you

01:07:41.239 --> 01:07:42.440
would imagine they'd be very very

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:43.969

ruse you still have that they're very

01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:18.480
like you know they still got the state

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:20.730
control but it's not like China where

01:09:20.730 --> 01:09:22.650
they can really I don't know Oh

01:09:22.650 --> 01:09:25.170
China has they always got a hard state

01:09:25.170 --> 01:09:27.000
control but I think they can really back

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.380
it up Russia's got all these different

01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:33.180
like carians of yeah mountain people and

01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:34.920
region I don't know yeah trying to

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:35.910
apparently like saw the thing were you

01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:37.440
walking to the Chinese Airport if you're

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.780
a person of like interest they scan your

01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:41.790
face and you're gone like you little

01:09:41.790 --> 01:09:43.980
snatch you up in the airport mmm then

01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:45.270
again it could be fronting like you said

01:09:45.270 --> 01:09:48.570
they lie I don't know but China you

01:09:48.570 --> 01:09:51.030
think they're saying like that I'm

01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:52.230
saying the fact that they're telling

01:09:52.230 --> 01:09:53.790
them they beat England the Chinese

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:56.580
government I think every government

01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:57.720
probably kind of churches up what's

01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:59.640
going on yeah America is like we're the

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:02.040
best you look up vital statistics of

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:04.050
like like citizen well-being and it's

01:10:04.050 --> 01:10:07.830
like wait a second this is well hidden

01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:09.380
on this either way but I wonder about

01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:11.250
monopolies just because you know

01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:12.600
warrants talking about breaking up

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:13.860
monopolies

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:16.739
I think a probably important thing to

01:10:16.739 --> 01:10:19.940
worry about is like AI and then also

01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:22.800
like 5g internet have you heard about

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:27.199
yeah y hi y Hawaii I can say and so the

01:10:27.199 --> 01:10:29.820
the reason I think that that ties into

01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:32.280
monopolies is like so China is basically

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:34.050
a monopoly right I mean anything that

01:10:34.050 --> 01:10:36.090
they do and the government's gonna put

01:10:36.090 --> 01:10:38.550
all its resources into that and then

01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:41.280
Google is working on it as well but then

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:44.310
if you want to break up Google don't you

01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:46.260
just like slow down their progress and

01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:49.290
then China can take over because it

01:10:49.290 --> 01:10:51.630
would need to be a US government funded

01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:55.469
you see we're going into like just

01:10:55.469 --> 01:10:58.110
straight totalitarian cyber systems and

01:10:58.110 --> 01:10:59.850
what you're saying are our thing is

01:10:59.850 --> 01:11:01.949
either Google like links up with the

01:11:01.949 --> 01:11:03.540
government becomes our ruler over you

01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:06.239
except China is our roller yeah well I

01:11:06.239 --> 01:11:09.060
suppose I mean I haven't you know I

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:11.760
haven't thought carefully about it I you

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.830
know like that you can think talk to you

01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:15.570
I think yeah because the idea of like

01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:17.310
the benefits of a monopoly is they have

01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:20.880
a lot of money to spend in to take risks

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:24.150
with for things that are like costs a

01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:26.820
lot to take risks mm-hmm so developing

01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:28.920
something that would compete with what

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:31.409
China's doing yeah go ahead

01:11:31.409 --> 01:11:33.179
so you guys talked it's all about VIII

01:11:33.179 --> 01:11:38.310
like you are porn yes faster speed ah no

01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:40.320
that you gotta get an oculus what's that

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.150
it's like a nice viewer thing so you can

01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:44.969
jerk off with it sure I'll get you one

01:11:44.969 --> 01:11:47.610
of those don't we gotta lock you up no

01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:50.550
good tight you know agoraphobia not an

01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:54.090
agoraphobe no be tight to have did you

01:11:54.090 --> 01:11:56.010
see the accusation there I saw it I saw

01:11:56.010 --> 01:11:57.659
it that's like I'm like a duck dude this

01:11:57.659 --> 01:12:02.130
is right off yeah dude you get it your

01:12:02.130 --> 01:12:10.350
feathers we get oily dude I wonder if in

01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:11.940
time of course when we enter our

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:13.860
dystopian [ __ ] cyber future if

01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:16.110
through the oculus rift people who start

01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:17.250
communicating they're like true

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:18.960
realities to other people so you're a

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.730
Chinese citizen no this is actually what

01:12:20.730 --> 01:12:22.080
it's like over here you send curbs

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.159
you're over there you're [ __ ] you're

01:12:23.159 --> 01:12:24.179
cranking it and all the sudden are like

01:12:24.179 --> 01:12:25.770
oh [ __ ] one of my boys in China then

01:12:25.770 --> 01:12:26.699
you're like well that's what's actually

01:12:26.699 --> 01:12:27.090
going

01:12:27.090 --> 01:12:28.679
over there that'd be pretty tired you're

01:12:28.679 --> 01:12:31.530
inside cranking it sure you just like

01:12:31.530 --> 01:12:32.580
see what's going on that's pretty bad

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:33.750
you're still cranking it you're like

01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:39.150
whatever dude okay yeah that's I was

01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:40.830
watching the thing about uh I mean III

01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:42.300
like completely freaked out about this

01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:43.619
and deleted all my social media which

01:12:43.619 --> 01:12:47.670
may have been a bit rash good call I did

01:12:47.670 --> 01:12:49.440
it was pretty cool yeah but dude the

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.239
this is the idea of people being

01:12:51.239 --> 01:12:53.849
completely spoon-fed by an algorithm

01:12:53.849 --> 01:12:55.199
like well I was on but early and

01:12:55.199 --> 01:12:56.130
Rainey's thing and they were talking

01:12:56.130 --> 01:12:57.570
about on dad meat and they were saying

01:12:57.570 --> 01:12:59.310
but early say now he takes total control

01:12:59.310 --> 01:13:00.630
of his algorithm he's like no no

01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:02.280
whatever he doesn't like he turns off

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:04.080
whatever makes him feel not so great he

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:06.780
turns off and it's like you have a whole

01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:08.190
group of people who are coming up on

01:13:08.190 --> 01:13:09.750
that of being able having their thing

01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:11.310
being completely spoon-fed everything

01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:12.840
they take in being completely curated

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.940
for them specifically right and the

01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:16.560
whole idea behind that is behavioral

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.540
modification to see what they can prompt

01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:19.619
you to do or what they can get you to

01:13:19.619 --> 01:13:21.420
click on and what kind of like literally

01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:22.889
by watching your facial expressions and

01:13:22.889 --> 01:13:24.210
[ __ ] as you watch videos through your

01:13:24.210 --> 01:13:26.820
devices that's [ __ ] terrifying to

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:28.320
being that information to be in the

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:32.580
hands of one monopoly but again like you

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:32.909
say

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:35.369
if China's doing it anyway what the [ __ ]

01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:37.380
what about the injury it's like they're

01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:39.179
there it's a winner-take-all economy

01:13:39.179 --> 01:13:40.770
like you're not gonna go to the third

01:13:40.770 --> 01:13:43.139
best search engine true

01:13:43.139 --> 01:13:45.090
you ever tried another search engine is

01:13:45.090 --> 01:13:47.849
being constantly what but it's for work

01:13:47.849 --> 01:13:49.770
and if it's worse and that actually

01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:50.340
makes it better

01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:52.710
because it says it it gives you URL

01:13:52.710 --> 01:13:58.349
respect like just like Google will give

01:13:58.349 --> 01:14:00.060
you more what you're looking for and

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:01.830
Bing will respond whether those keywords

01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:03.929
are in the URL and that's more what I'm

01:14:03.929 --> 01:14:06.780
looking for so like if a website is

01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:09.150
there's no traffic to it it doesn't have

01:14:09.150 --> 01:14:10.320
any value really

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:13.099
Bing will still show it and Google won't

01:14:13.099 --> 01:14:17.159
but I need that to you know for work for

01:14:17.159 --> 01:14:20.369
work I don't understand at me oh it's

01:14:20.369 --> 01:14:23.460
boring right but how you find exotic

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:29.010
porn thing what's the fine stuff wow

01:14:29.010 --> 01:14:30.090
that's cool pretty cool to go to

01:14:30.090 --> 01:14:31.590
different porn engine or the different

01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:33.929
search engine to go for like the poins

01:14:33.929 --> 01:14:34.920
you haven't seen I'm gonna go to

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:36.840
different porn sites you don't you're

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:39.420
one track my cycles I just stay on porn

01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:39.900
up

01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:41.130
is that right I haven't broken out of

01:14:41.130 --> 01:14:45.120
porno viewers Shane you gotta uh yeah I

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:47.220
just haven't I've been trying to get off

01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:50.040
a dude I'm pretty close together with

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:52.470
you about this sure cuz I remember we

01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:53.850
disagreed you got this porn stuff

01:14:53.850 --> 01:14:55.940
what you don't wanna know go ahead

01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:57.060
Christ

01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:01.140
oh Jesus Christ yourself this is what it

01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:02.790
feels like they scrutinized how did I

01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:05.070
screw tonight you know I scrutinized you

01:15:05.070 --> 01:15:07.560
just now you said what you don't want to

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:09.120
talk about it what were you talking

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:11.460
about anyway it was it was an over

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:13.170
scrutinize ation than you responded

01:15:13.170 --> 01:15:14.250
negatively doing it and I was just

01:15:14.250 --> 01:15:17.280
trying to [ __ ] talk to you every

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:21.090
[ __ ] time okay so basically the if

01:15:21.090 --> 01:15:26.960
porn was more accepted socially it is

01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:28.260
but go ahead

01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:30.270
no because it's totally what the [ __ ]

01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:31.530
are you talking about if you tell

01:15:31.530 --> 01:15:32.880
someone you don't watch porn they're

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.050
like what the [ __ ]

01:15:34.050 --> 01:15:35.910
my understand wondering am i of being

01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:38.760
important so like if you if my

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.770
understanding still from the interviews

01:15:40.770 --> 01:15:42.600
that I watch with porn stars is that

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:44.130
they still get an enormous amount of

01:15:44.130 --> 01:15:46.440
blowback socially from like you know

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.870
people that they care about dads yeah

01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:50.760
cuz it's upsetting to see her daughter

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:52.410
being gagged and strangled and like

01:15:52.410 --> 01:15:54.270
coming to her but it's horrible to see

01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:57.690
okay well what if it's just regular just

01:15:57.690 --> 01:15:58.890
sex you're talking about the

01:15:58.890 --> 01:16:00.780
degeneration of society this is what you

01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:03.900
want what I'm saying wait you got a

01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:05.670
bunch of dudes and everyone is if you

01:16:05.670 --> 01:16:07.110
know there was like 40 dudes who banged

01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:08.370
your daughter wearing masks you want

01:16:08.370 --> 01:16:11.100
people to be like oh wait a second why

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:14.340
posting like a piano recital I feel you

01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:15.750
just arguing to the extreme you're

01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:17.190
arguing to the extreme it's like why

01:16:17.190 --> 01:16:19.140
you're talking if if that's what she

01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:21.570
wanted what if she just wanted she was

01:16:21.570 --> 01:16:24.840
fine with having sex on camera with one

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:27.630
person that's way different than being

01:16:27.630 --> 01:16:30.150
like absorbed by the porn industry but

01:16:30.150 --> 01:16:32.430
my point is is that the porn industry is

01:16:32.430 --> 01:16:34.860
in the in all the ways that you don't

01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:40.110
like it as a result of us demonizing

01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:41.400
people that would want to do it so it's

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:43.440
not worth the social price for people

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:46.050
who would do it and are fine with it but

01:16:46.050 --> 01:16:47.220
they don't want to pay that social price

01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:49.590
so it's only left to people that have

01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:53.579
you know issues give it what okay so

01:16:53.579 --> 01:16:54.689
are you gonna know how your child

01:16:54.689 --> 01:16:56.309
responds to you getting like blood flux

01:16:56.309 --> 01:16:57.719
by your dad on camera and everyone can

01:16:57.719 --> 01:17:01.800
see it how am I so that's all becomes on

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:03.089
your kids so it's like you could do this

01:17:03.089 --> 01:17:04.409
it's all sounds great then you have kids

01:17:04.409 --> 01:17:06.989
and your kid has to like come across

01:17:06.989 --> 01:17:08.999
your mom just like yeah I mean imagine

01:17:08.999 --> 01:17:11.729
your kid coming across your podcast yeah

01:17:11.729 --> 01:17:14.309
that's gonna be bad enough yeah I'm

01:17:14.309 --> 01:17:16.289
we're me we're basically kind of porn

01:17:16.289 --> 01:17:18.389
stars dude this is a ill trodden path

01:17:18.389 --> 01:17:20.489
but but I think that's the point it's

01:17:20.489 --> 01:17:22.260
right it's I mean I hear what you're

01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:24.089
saying I do I do agree with that I think

01:17:24.089 --> 01:17:25.469
people should air out all the dirt I do

01:17:25.469 --> 01:17:27.119
I agree with that I do people should

01:17:27.119 --> 01:17:28.829
just get out of their hole puritanical

01:17:28.829 --> 01:17:31.769
sense and just don't you said for that

01:17:31.769 --> 01:17:33.749
right just like if it's your if you knew

01:17:33.749 --> 01:17:35.909
that if I knew that my parents had done

01:17:35.909 --> 01:17:37.859
porn could you not watch your parents if

01:17:37.859 --> 01:17:38.579
you knew it existed

01:17:38.579 --> 01:17:44.519
oh I mean unlike the dark stormy night

01:17:44.519 --> 01:17:49.469
like your boys were like yo I saw that

01:17:49.469 --> 01:17:51.629
video of your mom dude is so funny there

01:17:51.629 --> 01:17:53.249
was a porn of one of your guys do that

01:17:53.249 --> 01:17:55.199
regardless if there was like they could

01:17:55.199 --> 01:18:02.999
like have like counting the freckles on

01:18:02.999 --> 01:18:08.789
your mom's back that would do it

01:18:08.789 --> 01:18:11.309
you hold up your bomb and be like if my

01:18:11.309 --> 01:18:13.109
mom had a porn out you would definitely

01:18:13.109 --> 01:18:14.189
be like I mean it's a thing to we'd all

01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:15.839
be jerking off to each other's moms for

01:18:15.839 --> 01:18:19.229
sure which would be that's a bit

01:18:19.229 --> 01:18:25.349
liberating this is a good test Lee and

01:18:25.349 --> 01:18:26.479
extremely and you're right about that

01:18:26.479 --> 01:18:30.899
what would that be like yeah but then

01:18:30.899 --> 01:18:32.849
like god damn it man I would take a huge

01:18:32.849 --> 01:18:35.070
shift cuz I'm like every girl friend you

01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:36.659
ever had you'd have to contend with like

01:18:36.659 --> 01:18:38.999
visual reality of her past relationships

01:18:38.999 --> 01:18:43.889
that might be a little daunting yeah we

01:18:43.889 --> 01:18:45.539
all have to have Kanye West's energy to

01:18:45.539 --> 01:18:51.539
be able to take that you look great it's

01:18:51.539 --> 01:18:53.760
tough it's tough and it's like how I

01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:55.139
hear what you're saying and in ideal

01:18:55.139 --> 01:18:57.659
terms but how can we how much can we

01:18:57.659 --> 01:18:59.609
actually override our animal instincts I

01:18:59.609 --> 01:19:04.800
think a lot but then this is explicitly

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:07.350
sort of catering to them I suppose so

01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:08.820
I don't know what about the fallout of

01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:11.250
like jealousy all that other stuff I

01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:13.890
like seeing your girl get dirt down

01:19:13.890 --> 01:19:17.070
before yeah look I've already conceded

01:19:17.070 --> 01:19:18.570
the argument the moment Shane talked

01:19:18.570 --> 01:19:22.740
about holding up oh no I think about

01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:24.240
some things to reconsider because

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:25.650
anything about this stuff a lot everyone

01:19:25.650 --> 01:19:26.880
is getting it all out and being like

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:29.250
what's up yeah web history here it is do

01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:31.950
what's good what you got I'll be typed

01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:33.390
instead of baseball cards for kids to

01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:34.910
certainly trading their web histories Oh

01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:37.650
God and be like this is what this is me

01:19:37.650 --> 01:19:39.630
it's like job resume like here's my

01:19:39.630 --> 01:19:41.700
history here here's it love to see

01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:42.150
Steve's

01:19:42.150 --> 01:19:43.950
here's everything about that would be

01:19:43.950 --> 01:19:47.080
kind of liberating would be like Zillow

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:50.790
[Laughter]

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:54.900
that would be liberating for people to

01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:56.580
get out of everything and just be like

01:19:56.580 --> 01:19:58.890
here's a picture of my dick here's my

01:19:58.890 --> 01:20:02.630
web history what's up dude is what it is

01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:04.830
kind of we kind of took like ant we

01:20:04.830 --> 01:20:08.180
could became like ants in a way we're

01:20:10.130 --> 01:20:13.620

01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:22.800
something then I go back to like well

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:24.720
what's the reality of that how does that

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:28.650
actually play out past like that's four

01:20:28.650 --> 01:20:30.780
steps ahead of you bud sorry no no no

01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:32.370

up again now I gotta let it go no I

01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:35.940

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:40.740
morality to this because I watch pour a

01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:44.910
ton yeah so I love the women I love of

those women yeah yeah but it's also so

01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:48.210
do you how much do you think and do you

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:49.920
believe that watching porn negatively

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:53.640
affects human relationships I mean I

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:55.470
don't have great you know I don't have

01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:58.400
I'm not in the core folk

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:05.100

mm-hmm the whole thing it's just like

01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:25.150
it's the exact opposite he wants a lot

01:21:25.150 --> 01:21:26.920
of people there he mills and he talks

01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:28.570

feel I feel like that that you know I

01:21:52.030 --> 01:21:53.620
guess depending on which way you look at

01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:55.270
it either I'm sent advise incentivizing

01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:56.320
somebody to keep doing it but I also

01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:00.910
feel like economically you're like I'm

01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:03.100
getting into like the economics so after

01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:08.830

01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:11.260
like giving yourself a stranger jerk off

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:12.970
the invisible hand so you're like a

01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:15.070
you're a patron of the pornographic art

01:22:15.070 --> 01:22:16.660

01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:24.790
probably dead too

01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:30.400
she's roofied herself at a Florida thing

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:31.750
they get chewed up and spit out pretty

01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:34.210
[ __ ] hard and fast yeah that's the

01:22:34.210 --> 01:22:36.000
worst like could you find like a young

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.230

01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:55.630
beautiful woman get out of the tub and

01:22:55.630 --> 01:22:56.950
then he looks in the mirror and sees

01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:58.390
what she looks like you know I'm talking

01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:06.510
about well there's a part where Jack is

01:23:06.510 --> 01:23:09.490

01:23:09.490 --> 01:23:11.620
naked lady's in a tub and she gets out

01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:13.300

body's like decaying she had died there

01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:20.320
and I'm saying that's what it's like

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:22.390
seeing porn stars like are you great and

01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:23.830

The Shining how they don't know the one

01:23:27.490 --> 01:23:29.440
they have like Young's read the red book

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:31.330
on the office and I think it's in the

01:23:31.330 --> 01:23:32.680
beginning what about like the Apollo

01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:34.630
missions and [ __ ] no the red book is

01:23:34.630 --> 01:23:36.280
like when he young broke down and had a

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.140
bunch of like crazy hallucinations and

01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:39.940

do with this China his book is found on

01:23:46.570 --> 01:23:48.010
the dudes desk and I think the very

01:23:48.010 --> 01:23:50.020
beginning okay and they're pointing

01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:51.250
they're saying that who's the guy who

01:23:51.250 --> 01:23:54.490
did the shining it's film King and

01:23:54.490 --> 01:23:57.280
Stanley Kubrick they said he's a master

01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.870
of like throwing little tiny things in

01:23:58.870 --> 01:24:01.180
there saying they explore like how

01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:02.680
reading that book what it means that

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:07.270
anyway I should even be on the air the

01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:10.420
curbs I do can again what would it take

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:13.810
to get people over the hump of seeing

01:24:13.810 --> 01:24:16.570

generations do you think it would take I

01:24:24.030 --> 01:24:25.390
don't know

01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:27.220

life interaction for pornography I'm

01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:34.120
