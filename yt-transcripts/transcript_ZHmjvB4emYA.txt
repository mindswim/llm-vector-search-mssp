00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.000
what up everybody

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.420
sike null trying out a new format here

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.100
we've gone we've definitely taken it to

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.040
the full singularity this is actually a

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.960
I think it is I think it's some sort of

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.170
live stream so I people should be able

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.270
to join and currently there's nobody

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.920
here so I'm like I hope people can join

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.109
but if they can't I'll just be

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.250
live-streaming to nobody because I

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.840
[ __ ] up the invite but we'll see what

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.320
happens but bum bum bum figure out how

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.390
to share my screen here

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.670
bear with me yeah there we go all right

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.870
kyoool

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.350
so let's start it out in here update in

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.590
the groups so we got a little discord

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.149
going which is awesome

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.340
if you guys I don't know if you've so if

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.570
you listen to the episodes there's been

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.030
a couple like brainstorms so people who

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.010
signed up for the email list or not

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.059
didn't email list but they they put

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.800
their emails to like sign up for the

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.399
group generator I was doing like

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:07.660
brainstorm sessions with those people

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.039
we're even really trying to figure out

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:10.990
like how what's the best way to do this

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.640
you know also the easiest way and you

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.650
know how to make it how to make this be

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.119
the best thing that it can be with you

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.750
know obviously limited resources limited

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.820
degrees because I you know I just got I

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.590
have one so we have one degree going on

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.259
right now if we can get more degrees up

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.299
in this or just people who have at least

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.030
experienced doing this kind of work but

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.590
for now everything is going well the

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.240
discord is the [ __ ] I'll give you guys a

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.850
link to the discord in the description

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.380
of this video

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.780
also to we're gonna probably cap the

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.390
group's it's at like around 70 people

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.290
signed up right now

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.640
so you know I don't want to just have

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.079
one people sign up and say hey I'm not

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.130
gonna be able to get to you for a while

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.250
because you know we during the

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.570
brainstorm thing we kind of figured

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.549
something that was bothering me was like

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:55.899
well you know am I just going to figure

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.049
out some sort of like group program and

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.340
hit people with the word doc you make

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.390
all right you guys are in groups before

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.399
go it's like no I you know that that

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:04.960
would probably be it that could

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.470
potentially be a disaster so I was like

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.019
yeah I won't do that I will do instead

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.430
I'll just have it so it's like you know

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.500
we'll get the groups built then there's

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.180
gonna be room for people in discord to

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.230
like me you know you can have like

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.590
unofficial quote-unquote groups but you

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.760
know you still meet checking with other

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.380
people but I'll be selecting probably

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.940
like three groups like twelve people at

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.410
a time like three groups of four and

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.360
then I'll be doing like it probably like

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.580
a 10-week kind of program thing and then

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.930
it's you know back into the discord I'll

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.450
grab 12 more people 10-week thing back

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.830
in you know we'll be doing pretest

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.300
post-test all that stuff to see if it's

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.040
working everyone's stay in constant

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.140
communication so that's kind of a it's

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.740
kind of where this is going and also

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.790
we'll be having will be doing some

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.200
intakes my boy Jake will be doing some

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.630
intake soon just like feel people out

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.950
you know to screen you know make sure

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.760
you know it's like the basic idea is to

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.680
make sure that there's not people coming

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.950
into this who require like yeah like way

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.140
way more care in that that's necessary

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.340
than like what we can kind of provide

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.820
you know this is for this is the idea

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.690
behind this really is to give people an

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.760
option who are kind of in like a weird

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.410
middle ground you know that's not to say

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.000
like you know oh maybe I'm too messed up

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.680
so no no you'll you know it'll be it'll

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.650
be obvious kind of if that's the case um

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.660
but bum bum sounds kind of bad but

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.910
that's just kind of how it is and yeah

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.320
and hopefully eventually I can figure

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.150
out some sort of training thing after I

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.950
do a bunch of groups successfully if

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.180
anyone's ever interested in doing it a

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.530
little bit you know here's a here's all

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.120
the stuff you need to know you can start

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.070
taking them but I'm putting that's put

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.050
in the cart before the horse so that

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.290
being said let us jump into the thing it

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.790
also sucks I can't really see anything

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.430
when I'm doing this crowdcast kind of

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.110
blows for a screen sharing I can't see

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.490
my face and I can't see what else is

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.940
going on um let me say let me check in

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.940
to make sure everybody can see this

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.430
stuff hell yeah we got one dude in here

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.760
that's what's good dude alright so we're

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.680
here oh and the other again the reason

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.720
the the purpose of the livestream format

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.940
is if people have questions just ask

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.950
them alright so let us jump back in for

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.630
the audio this might be a little awkward

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.150
but again this is I can't stop but

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.010
experimenting did it's that's all I know

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.550
how to do mmm pulling up the thing again

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.170
alright pulling up this Prezi let's jump

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.410
into the she alright so I did chapters

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.320
three and four they were much less dense

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.180
and complicated than chapter two which

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.789
the rft chapter which took me forever to

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:41.560
get through so I'm giving you guys two

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.020
chapters in the time of one

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.150
so just to recap if you haven't seen the

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.910
one on the rft stuff please go back and

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.650
watch it and you know if you want a very

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.300
brief recap although this doesn't really

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.320
do it much justice so you know if you

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.729
watched it honestly you'll watch the

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.500
first three prezi's you might have the

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.820
feeling that like things are seeming

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.770
kind of bleak you know because like by

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.479
nature were programmed to use language

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:08.880
and symbols to think and communicate

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.590
which again for solving external

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.830
problems rules but for internal problems

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.530
drools and unfortunately seems to be

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.660
standard procedure due to our inherent

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.520
build as humans we're the only animal

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.620
that can use language and you know

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.449
symbols to kind of communicate and

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.970
relate to our environment we do this no

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.910
other animal as far as we know does this

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.500
you know for instance like taking action

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.690
to avoid a snake is good right let's you

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.009
know you're moving a bull [ __ ] you move

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:37.570
real quick out of the way that's a good

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.460
thing avoiding the discomfort of your

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.949
feelings around say your relationships

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:44.260
is bad why because your feelings are not

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.229
a snake you can't escape your thoughts

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.419
or feelings and trying to only makes

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.460
them worse because this is all an

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.740
internal in-house situation here and

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.470
again just to drive at home that thing I

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.150
just said of trying to escape our

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.620
thoughts and feelings that only makes

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.690
them worse is what we are naturally

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.849
programmed to do why probably because

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:06.190
we've inhabited a landscape with mostly

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.409
physical dangers long before we even

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:11.020
habitat this strange symbolic relational

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.570
landscape of wondering why people don't

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.430
like our facebook status or what kind of

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.820
car we drive etc you know hopefully that

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.199
makes sense I want to drive that home

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:21.400
because it's like if you think about it

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.310
our nervous systems the design of our

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.380
nervous system has been around for a

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.710
half a billion years and we've now

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.620
unleashed a central part of us which is

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.150
that ancient nervous system our you know

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.970
main parts of it into like an infinite

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.490
symbolic landscape of that's totally

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.400
unmowed from you know physical reality

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.990
and you think about cyberspace you think

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.490
about the arbitrary nature of getting

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.750
clicks and likes and all this stuff that

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.610
actually kind of get under our skin and

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.040
have like an actual biological root

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.210
and kind of affect us in a real

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.150
biological way hopefully that makes

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.200
sense this is where the stuff starts

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.870
getting weird but again if you're

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.250
confused go back and watch the first one

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.870
and if you've watched it or not the

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.550
first one the last one if you've watched

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.260
the last one you're still confused then

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.630
my bad but hopefully this is kind of

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.180
clear right and perhaps this seems a bit

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.770
hopeless and pessimistic and maybe

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.030
you're thinking I watched you know three

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.470
hours of Prezi stuff to learn that I'm

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.930
doomed in this like no you are not

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:17.320
doomed

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.720
what's doomed is your unceasing effort

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.520
to control your private events and

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.920
feelings around them which is only a

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.790
part of you

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.520
right and unfortunately the majority of

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.140
us think that it's the whole picture

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.140
this is what we'll learn later is fusion

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.510
there's cognitive fusion you can fuse

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.040
with you can fuse with your thoughts

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.140
you can fuse with your the story of

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.150
yourself you can fuse with any of these

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.800
things and one of the skills in this is

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.300
learning how to diffuse from your

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.370
thoughts and you know to kind of adopt a

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.110
more expansive view of yourself where

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.270
things aren't really just like happening

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.740
to you all the time versus like you know

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.290
you're the one experiencing things right

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:54.820
so they kind of can just drift by rather

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.710
than being like you know it's like

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.480
either there's a cloud coming by in the

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.850
sky or that there that like Mario level

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.440
cloud that just throw spiky turtle

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.850
shells at you you know so that's nice

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.260
and it's good it's a good thing there's

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.180
more to you than this aspect of yourself

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.980
that you may have or still do confuse

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.690
for your total sense of who you are and

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.520
also here you could be because who you

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.530
are we also we hope we forget a lot of

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.630
the time still includes our potential

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.550
but if we're totally fused with our

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.770
current story of ourselves usually we're

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.480
ignoring our potential because you know

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.600
we're not really experiencing it and a

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.510
quick note on feelings difference

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:32.710
between thoughts and feelings a lot of

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:34.390
people tend to not know this because you

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:35.470
know they just don't teach this stuff in

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.960
school a thought is something that you

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.180
know it's just like a might as well just

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.040
be a gas of words that flies through

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.080
your head feelings are the physical

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.000
sensation that typically accompany a

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.980
thought or sometimes precede them right

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.840
so feelings although typically

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.910
experienced as painful or out-of-control

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.970
should ideally serve as the internal

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.990
physical barometer that guides our life

00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:59.740
you know these are the butterflies

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.860
gurgles hot face flashes of anger and

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.420
tight throat sensations that accompany

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:04.600
our

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.130
thoughts and are typically what are

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.839
being referred to when people speak of

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:10.389
being in emotional pain and when I the

00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:12.220
first thing to and I say they're the you

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.720
know the the they should serve as the

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.399
internal physical barometer that guides

00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:18.459
our life you know I can use an example

00:09:18.459 --> 00:09:21.279
of I I was married before and I knew

00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:22.540
deep down inside I had all these bad

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.459
feelings about it I know you know this

00:09:24.459 --> 00:09:25.899
is the difference between this is where

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.389
the stuff gets really subtle and tricky

00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:30.040
because you know you don't want to it's

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.930
like when are you you know engaging in

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:33.519
avoidance versus whenever you when are

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:34.839
you listening to your intuition and

00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:36.880
acting on that and typically if you're

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.350
listening to your so here's a good

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:39.670
example this is actually a perfect

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.920
example um so all right you're in

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:42.850
marriage you don't want to be in it

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.529
you're like oh man this is wrong I kind

00:09:44.529 --> 00:09:47.860
of like I just I had reservations and I

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.149
said you know I just I didn't want to

00:09:49.149 --> 00:09:50.829
deal with the fallout and all the

00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:52.720
[ __ ] so I just kept going along with

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.220
it going along with it and hoping things

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.519
would change obviously they didn't so

00:09:57.519 --> 00:09:59.290
the way you can tell if you're typically

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:00.790
following your intuition and kind of

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.350
letting your feelings guide you in a way

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:03.819
that's kind of healthy would be to be

00:10:03.819 --> 00:10:06.160
like you know this really feels wrong it

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.380
feels like it's not working in order for

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.029
me to like you know bring this issue to

00:10:10.029 --> 00:10:11.860
light it's going to be very very very

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.779
uncomfortable and then following through

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:15.370
with that rather than being like the

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.990
coward of Matt mckusker and spending

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:18.759
years being like this is wrong this is I

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:20.589
shouldn't do this kind of trying to

00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:22.720
bring it up big emotional explosion on

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.670
the other end you know like ye you know

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.250
I'll do another year cuz I'm too much of

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.560
a coward to deal with this you know and

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.819
that's kind of like you know you want

00:10:30.819 --> 00:10:32.350
those you want to have a good relation

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:33.459
with your feelings you don't always be

00:10:33.459 --> 00:10:35.829
stuffing them down because this is your

00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:37.839
you know this is a very serious aspect

00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:39.519
of yourself that's being like we like

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:41.259
being in this setting we don't like

00:10:41.259 --> 00:10:43.389
being in the setting and it's like you

00:10:43.389 --> 00:10:44.740
know you can't always analyze everything

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.240
sometimes you just get a gut feeling

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.560
it's good to learn to go with it so rule

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.689
of thumb the thought quote I am going to

00:10:52.689 --> 00:10:55.149
die alone unquote can either be

00:10:55.149 --> 00:10:57.670
perceived it can either be experienced

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.490
as a perceived reality experienced

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:02.860
physically by the thinker right so I'm

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.269
going to die alone can either float

00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:06.130
through your head and then just go down

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:07.569
all your you know float down through

00:11:07.569 --> 00:11:08.889
your nervous system and shoot whatever

00:11:08.889 --> 00:11:10.839
hormones and horrible things that make

00:11:10.839 --> 00:11:13.600
you feel like whoa right that can either

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.130
be experienced that that's cognitive

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:16.959
fusion that's oh my god I thought a

00:11:16.959 --> 00:11:18.120
thing obvious

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.620
your thoughts can trigger your biology

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.140
in a way that makes things seem very

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.000
very real because what's more real than

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.950
feeling your heart speed up it's the

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.600
most real thing you know but

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.240
unfortunately when you know these are

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.950
traveling on the back of just plain old

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.110
thoughts that we're thinking up it's not

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.490
really real that's what you call a

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:36.330
private event

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.010
it's an event it's a real it happen

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.350
inside you but is it like objective

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.450
reality no it's just some [ __ ] we bugged

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.700
ourselves out on right so the thought

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:45.930
I'm gonna die alone can either be

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:47.670
perceived can either be a perceived

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.529
reality experience physically by the

00:11:49.529 --> 00:11:51.450
thinker or this is the other way it's

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.160
what we're going for simply a thought

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.200
that occurs within a more expansive view

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.960
of ourself one that keeps a line into

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.360
the present moment and moves toward what

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.520
one values despite pain and fear rather

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.350
than one who moves away from what one

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.750
values in the service of mitigating the

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.670
immediate fear and pain that seems

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.740
larger than us and this is a good way

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.060
this is how I kind of try to assess

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.470
things this is like you know something I

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.690
started doing last week is when I catch

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.370
myself getting bugged out right like the

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.670
audio on the podcast last week the last

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.110
two weeks like one time it just didn't

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.860
even show up

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.900
second time of super quiet and it's like

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.690
I was so mad I could have just like

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.600
started you know breaking [ __ ] I have

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.160
this inner toddler inside me it likes to

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.750
destroy self on it if I hit like a level

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.670
10 angry I just want to break something

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.980
and like I felt myself like my biology

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.810
was totally activated over the fact that

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.440
a you know there wasn't a sound file on

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.209
my video which you know is a problem I'm

00:12:45.209 --> 00:12:46.529
not like saying it wasn't you know a

00:12:46.529 --> 00:12:48.450
problem but it's like is it a problem

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.420
that requires a biological response no

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.730
and this is how I asked that is it is

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.470
the problem a biological threat or no if

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.540
it's not a biological threat it really

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.400
doesn't require a biological response

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.230
you'll still get one you know and that's

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.430
your feelings that's something popping

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.950
up and you you feel it you assess it you

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.930
say all right yeah it sucks there's no

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:08.520
sound that you know that's a couple

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.680
hours of work down the drain but it's

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.660
like if this is where acting out of the

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.980
present moment really helps you know

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.390
it's like right now what's actually

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.940
going on I'm a person in a chair trying

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.950
to derive sound from a video file that

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:23.580
has no sound you know I don't need to be

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.529
like super hot and angry and all jacked

00:13:25.529 --> 00:13:27.780
up but typically what happens is you

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.100
know the sound file it doesn't come

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.740
doesn't come in right it's messed up and

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:32.760
stead of acting out of the present

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.350
moment I'm acting out of a perceived

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.930
dystopian reality of like oh my god the

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.910
sound files down everyone's gonna get

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:39.390
mad

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.550
everyone's gonna leave there wasn't any

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.020
money on the patreon I'm gonna be poor

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.580
whoo

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.260
that happens in the blink of an eye

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.250
because you're fusing with the

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:48.450
experience you're fusing with your

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.160
negative fantasy of the situation where

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.540
in reality if you boil it down

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.040
you're a dude in a chair trying to watch

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.830
a video of people talking and there's no

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.600
sound it's not a biological threat it

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.670
needs to be problem-solve but your heart

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.230
rate doesn't have to go up to 140 beats

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.480
a minute that doesn't help anything all

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:03.870
right

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.990
hopefully that makes sense all right so

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:08.100
like I said good thing there's more to

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:09.570
you than that aspect of yourself

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.000
that's ruthlessly ruse ruthlessly trying

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.670
to problem-solve you know and solve

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.770
external problems and you know luckily

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.200
there we can garner this more expansive

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.230
self expansive sense of self and this

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.820
picture too if you can see it there's I

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.920
have a picture of like a guy kind of

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.750
like a meditator looking guy it's

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.250
sitting so this is your physical self

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.780
this is your body this is your you know

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.790
your brain all your organs this is the

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.630
present moment entity that's like

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:38.070
inhabiting the space that you're

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:39.840
symbolic self if you look at the picture

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.150
this is a shape of a person at like made

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.310
on the sky and clouds so the physical

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.470
self constructs a symbolic self right

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.690
you know you're born you're just like we

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:49.950
talked about in the last chapter you're

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.110
just kind of like drinking milk doing

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:53.460
your thing and all of a sudden you know

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.910
you adopt language you start comparing

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.140
objects around you you start learning

00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.970
words you start symbolizing events

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.220
through physical objects and then you

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.260
eventually come up with a sense of self

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.570
like your physical self becomes

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:09.270
self-aware your physical self starts

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:11.340
perceiving itself symbolically I know

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.470
this sounds crazy but just hang with me

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.530
your physical self at a certain point

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:19.650
enters itself enters you into the realm

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.560
of comparison and symbolism to where

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.060
it's like you know you're big this toy

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.360
trucks better than this you know toy cat

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.840
then eventually you go that person is

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.180
better than me or I am better than that

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.920
person you start doing this weird I'm

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.600
bigger than you I'm smaller so we end

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.310
and then through that you know this is

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.050
this is kind of why this stuff so weird

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:43.070
and tricky this are symbolic self

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.570
typically kind of gets built this

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.400
the start of it kind of gets built for

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.100
us before we even understand what's

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.380
going on so we're starting to construct

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.300
the story of who we are before we even

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.910
understand that a story of who you are

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:58.770
can be constructed so it takes like you

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:00.240
know that's why a lot of the stuffs kind

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.410
of like what the hell are you talking

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:03.720
about because it goes down so deep till

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.600
like almost bedrock levels of like are

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.590
symbolic consciousness and again when I

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:09.330
say symbolic self I just mean anything

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.000
that's non-biological the story of what

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.100
we tell who we tell ourselves we are our

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.040
culture all of that stuff and the idea

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.410
is you know you know and again one of

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:20.460
them is not better than the other it's

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.720
not like dude you should be I'll be your

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.160
physical self forget about your symbolic

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.870
self it's like no this is this is kind

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.280
of like a dualistic thing it's like one

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.660
needs the other for the most part the

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.730
symbolic self is kind of what got these

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:31.980
physical stupid you know naked monkeys

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.380
to get to where we are but it's like you

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.310
know it also you have to keep your

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.220
symbolic self in check and that's by

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.390
realizing there's more to you than just

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:41.940
your symbolic self and there's also more

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.170
to you than just your physical self if

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.090
you just ate sat in a room and [ __ ] all

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:48.000
day that's not cool I mean I could I

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.440
could probably do like a day of that but

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.610
I'd we got to get bored pretty quickly

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.250
all right so we've done a lot of the you

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.200
know why you know a lot of the theory

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.250
that's what we've been covering so far

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.840
so we're starting to dip our toe into

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.940
the how like how do we do any of this

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.190
we're starting to learn all right so

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.650
step one before you even proceed give

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:05.820
yourself a break you know that's

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:06.810
something you can do for yourself

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:08.490
realize that you've been doing the best

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.350
you can given that we've all been

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:13.020
essentially playing a rigged game so

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.000
take it easy on yourself nobody told us

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.240
[ __ ] about how our brains work right so

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.180
again we're human beings we learn before

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.650
we even know what's going on at all

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:24.360
start using language start comparing

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.680
ourselves it's a [ __ ] that's a

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.570
nightmare right so here's a couple

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:28.770
options for ways you can ease up on

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:29.250
yourself

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.170
step one before you even get into it you

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:32.130
know step one I could face the

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:34.050
possibility that my avoidance strategies

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:35.550
will never work I'll tell you right now

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:37.500
number one when you look at like the

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.590
therapy modalities that's a big first

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:42.330
step to just come to grips with the fact

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.280
that like I'm not going to be able to

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.800
control my environment ever in a way

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.620
that Ward's off pain and suffering and

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.690
trying to do that is actually a waste of

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:54.900
my time you know it's like being smaller

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.340
than all my fears and everything again

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.620
there's there some fears again that are

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.510
again ask yourself is it a biological

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.520
necessity people like well so what if I

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.559
like live in a war zone I should take it

00:18:04.559 --> 00:18:06.030
easy no that's a biological threat you

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.010
should get the [ __ ] to a safe shelter

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.140
but I'm but we don't most of us who are

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.610
listening this I would say almost all of

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.559
us don't live in war zones we're in a

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:16.200
cubicle we're like boom bored mulu which

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.020
again I mean dude I first time I was in

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.370
a cubicle at a panic attack so I'm not

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.450
trash anybody and I haven't returned

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.830
again I could have compassion for myself

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.360
how hard I've tried to deal with my pain

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.340
you know feel treat yourself you know if

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.420
you really want to make yourself cry

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.790
imagine yourself back when you were like

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.950
a little toddler like a fourth graders

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.110
imagine yourself now going and just kind

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.000
of put your arms around that little kid

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.620
and be like look man I know this shit's

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.740
[ __ ] hard I got you relax

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.260
I can stop blaming myself for not being

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.330
able to make my avoidance strategies

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.940
work again it's because they can't it's

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.920
not because like oh if if I was strong

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.230
enough I know dude you can't do it man

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:57.059
you cannot make your avoidance

00:18:57.059 --> 00:18:58.320
strategies work and there's people who

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.600
you know I I'd suffer from a little bit

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.100
I used to suffer from this as well like

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.840
trying to achieve my way out of my

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.520
misery and it's like you get to

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.870
something else and you're still that

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.160
miserable [ __ ] you just have

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.440
more stuff and like now people are like

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.640
sir and you're like why are you

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.190
respecting me or you know number four I

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.140
could fill in the fourth one on your own

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.230
make it up whatever you want alright

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:21.360
number two this is this again we're just

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.250
tone our waters we're just laying the

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.080
the foundation for how we're going to

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.270
start pretty much implementing what you

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:28.860
know which a lot of people would coin is

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.510
like kind of massive change or you know

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.010
in terms of how we relate to the world

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:34.380
so that's why we're babying into this

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.790
because if you do it too quick it's kind

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:37.050
of like well that's too weird so you

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.360
know you got to kind of dip your toes in

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.790
the water here alright so the second one

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:44.690
is accept responsibility not

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:46.860
responsibility the classic

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.290
responsibility this is response ability

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:51.150
which yes sounds kind of like a cheesy

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:52.830
McDonald's slogan but it brings up a

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:54.960
fair point accepting classical

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.630
responsibility tends to carry a sense of

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:00.360
blame along with it but as we already

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.550
know from our own lives and dealing with

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.320
others how effective is blame in terms

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.090
of motivating ourselves or others to

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:09.570
change right and response ability isn't

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.160
so much about telling yourself you

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.030
should

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.040
but more of an admission of I can

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.290
meaning owning the fact that there is

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.210
something I can do about my essentially

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:21.180
quote unquote doomed nature now we're

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.710
going to do a little this is a little

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.720
exercise from the book it's called the

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.850
blame game so if you if you see this

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:28.020
thing you know you can check it out if

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:28.950
not you're listening you can kind of

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:30.720
follow along get the gist so it says in

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.280
the space provided below write down some

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.080
examples of blaming yourself or others

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.910
for any negative events that you've

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.650
experienced then on a scale of one to

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:40.350
ten rate how well your examples work to

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.900
motivate and empower you to live a more

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.020
vital fulfilling and liberated way you

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.760
know in this scale one means not

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.600
empowered at all ten means empowered to

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.550
me ten means empowered to the max and

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:54.630
when you say empowered what they

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.250
actually mean is the sense that your

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:59.550
life is expanding and growing so and

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:02.220
this I have a couple these are most

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.750
people the first ones actually a real

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.370
one that the last ones not really I just

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:06.630
kind of threw it in there because it's

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:09.780
something I've seen people deal with so

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.790
the first one I had my dog being bad at

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:12.360
the dog park

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.300
I do dive honestly like you've probably

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.650
heard from the podcast like I've like

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:18.450
dump the water on my dogs I like [ __ ]

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:20.430
their collars I'm out here why are you

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.890
always so poorly behaved as if my dog

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:24.900
has any [ __ ] idea so I'm blaming my

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.140
dog my dogs ruining my dog you know my

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.900
dog has the audacity to ruin my dog park

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.300
experience as human and I get all angry

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.240
I'm a good guy can't you just act right

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.530
but then you know I used to blame the

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:39.570
dogs I'll get mad same thing pissed off

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.040
I'm grabbing my dogs in a way that

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.840
people are kind of like my call of

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.990
[ __ ] animal services and one day I

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:47.670
was like well that's not really working

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:49.860
so let me try to just bring treats with

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.570
me and then when my dog for typically

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:53.310
Jackson starts getting like too

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.230
aggressive like you know like he just

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:57.000
it's just I'm not gonna get into it but

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.430
he's too aggressive he's a nice dog he

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:00.540
doesn't wanna fight any dogs but he's

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:01.950
wrestles too hard the freaks people out

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:03.390
he like does this thing where he'll lock

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:05.340
on the dog and the start just keeps

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:06.570
messing with it mess when the dog will

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.250
be running around and I like go to get

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:09.600
him and it's like I'll even be pulling

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.310
him off and it's like he just looks at

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:12.630
me with these shark eyes that are just

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:13.560
like it's like dude there's no

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.940
intelligence going on in your brain at

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.010
all and it pisses me off so I started

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.420
bringing treats and then when he was

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.700
getting a little too you know hot under

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:21.990
the collar for another dog I would tell

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:23.880
him leave it and then he'd see the treat

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.440
and leave the dog alone come to me and

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.789
I got to the point where like oh I can

00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:28.500
enjoy the dog park again just because I

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.120
wasn't blaming my dog stead of blaming

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.620
someone else for my problem I was like

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.539
well what can I actually do to help and

00:22:33.539 --> 00:22:35.429
I did it and it worked

00:22:35.429 --> 00:22:36.960
same thing with like social anxiety let

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.389
you know you can be like oh man I wish

00:22:39.389 --> 00:22:41.279
you say you know you're dating someone

00:22:41.279 --> 00:22:42.750
who has social anxiety we go more places

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.399
if you just weren't so anxious it's like

00:22:44.399 --> 00:22:46.440
yeah but again blaming that person for

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.450
being socially anxious isn't gonna lead

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.639
to you being at more places you need to

00:22:50.639 --> 00:22:51.690
try to figure out a way to work with

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:54.149
that person or you know even is evaluate

00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:56.190
if that's working for you baba wawa the

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:57.240
other one I had on here was like you

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.039
know mom or dad's [ __ ] ass desperate

00:22:59.039 --> 00:23:01.139
ass dating life I've seen that situation

00:23:01.139 --> 00:23:03.210
numerous times and it's like you know

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:07.529
I've seen people who especially is

00:23:07.529 --> 00:23:09.120
typically especially women with her

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.580
mothers were kind of like you know my

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.759
mom put her perspective romantic

00:23:14.759 --> 00:23:17.009
partners before me which really [ __ ]

00:23:17.009 --> 00:23:18.720
people up and you know as a legitimate

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.909
gripe but again it's like blaming your

00:23:20.909 --> 00:23:22.950
mom for how does that help you you know

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.049
it's like yeah they're [ __ ] that sucks

00:23:25.049 --> 00:23:27.059
but it's like did you try to gain any

00:23:27.059 --> 00:23:28.799
understanding of your mom's psychology

00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:30.929
or her what she's went through or her

00:23:30.929 --> 00:23:32.700
struggles its again it's not saying like

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.799
you know you got to do all the you know

00:23:34.799 --> 00:23:36.629
emotional work for your mom it's just

00:23:36.629 --> 00:23:39.899
what works for you you know not shaming

00:23:39.899 --> 00:23:41.669
anyone who called her mom [ __ ] some moms

00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:44.159
or [ __ ] maybe all of them are I don't

00:23:44.159 --> 00:23:44.429
know

00:23:44.429 --> 00:23:46.860
all right um so again this is this is a

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.870
way to think about responsibility versus

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:51.659
responsibility or even just all of this

00:23:51.659 --> 00:23:52.950
in general maybe doesn't even apply to

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:54.539
that but think of a radio station with

00:23:54.539 --> 00:23:57.570
two dials one dial controls whether or

00:23:57.570 --> 00:23:59.639
not you experience pain right you can

00:23:59.639 --> 00:24:01.590
twist it turn it even pop it off clean

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:03.690
it no eval you turn this thing you're

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:05.340
just it honestly it's worse you're just

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:06.450
turning this dial it come on come on

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:08.250
turn off turn off you feel worse Morse

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.259
then one day you discover another dial

00:24:10.259 --> 00:24:12.450
this dial allows you to control how you

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:14.759
personally respond to the pain from the

00:24:14.759 --> 00:24:16.769
other dial right so there's the pain

00:24:16.769 --> 00:24:18.330
dial and there's this other dial that

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:21.179
allows you to change how you relate to

00:24:21.179 --> 00:24:23.009
the pain from that other constant dial

00:24:23.009 --> 00:24:23.970
that you can't change

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:26.639
that's what response-ability is about

00:24:26.639 --> 00:24:28.559
recognizing that you ultimately can

00:24:28.559 --> 00:24:30.360
determine what to do with pain instead

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.820
of trying to rid yourself of it right

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.619
sound of light switch you can't turn it

00:24:34.619 --> 00:24:37.259
on and off this is a little knob and all

00:24:37.259 --> 00:24:38.520
you can do is try to like

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.530
less than a little bit and if you can

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:41.970
turn it on and off typically that's kind

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:44.640
of dissociation all right so we're

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.350
getting closer to a real alternative

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:49.230
right so number three this is this is

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:50.280
something that actually helps a little

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.330
bit if you just want to get a more

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:55.170
objective view on yourself try to record

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:56.820
your daily experience in any kind of way

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.800
you can do it your phone or whatever you

00:24:58.800 --> 00:24:59.880
know just in case you're not totally

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.320
sold on the fact that your efforts to

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.760
control unwanted thoughts and feelings

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.500
are jamming you up consider this

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.970
exercise because typically if you're

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:07.740
watching this you made it through this

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.780
far you probably feel pretty shitty a

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.550
lot or you're just a curious cat so if

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.650
you're curious cat whatever but you know

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:15.570
I the only reason I've ever research any

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:17.429
of this stuff because I typically feel

00:25:17.429 --> 00:25:21.690
like dog dick more times than not so so

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.309
for the the little worksheet and you can

00:25:23.309 --> 00:25:24.450
again all this stuff can be downloaded

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:25.020
offline

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.670
there's judging your own experience you

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:29.100
record the date and all this stuff is

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.350
scale to one of 100 so you record your

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:32.400
pain you can even put if it's anxiety

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.360
depression all whatever anger what point

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.590
of the day did you get like you know

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:39.660
make it triggered on some [ __ ] where

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.280
you're anxious you're depressed you're

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.500
mad you're this think about that at the

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.850
end of the day and you know how bad was

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:46.320
that was it like on hunter where you

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.670
just [ __ ] spazzing where there's no

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:48.840
audio and you want it to break your

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.820
headphones or is it you know kind of

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.920
like an all-day 50k like a malaise real

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.170
like what's the point and then you think

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.990
about how hard the struggle thing like

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:00.150
how much energy or time did you expend

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:02.610
in trying to control or stop or mitigate

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:04.320
this original pain so you know we have

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.580
the pain switch the dial then we have

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.929
our struggle to try to like turn that

00:26:06.929 --> 00:26:09.870
off then third so your rate you know how

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:12.390
how much time of day or you know how how

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:13.860
difficult was it for you to kind of try

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.240
to like deal with that and then the

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.800
third one is what was your overall

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.120
success on the day you know I don't

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.559
wanna know how did you how did you feel

00:26:19.559 --> 00:26:21.630
the day one that gives you kind of

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:23.580
really the idea is again they're really

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:25.559
trying to hammer getting people to admit

00:26:25.559 --> 00:26:27.990
that like experiential avoidance is

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:30.150
something that's kind of jamming them up

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:31.559
and for good reason there's a lot of

00:26:31.559 --> 00:26:33.660
research that talks about that so and

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:34.860
then again the end of the day you just

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.130
rate your success so alright we're again

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.040
there baby alright so the fourth thing

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.450
and again this is still we're still in

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:44.160
the baby pool but it's like know that

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.840
the alternative to control is

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.690
frustratingly subtle right so if you

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:50.520
find doing the previous exercise you

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:51.840
know or even just reflecting on your

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:52.350
days

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.419
of the day that you're expending a good

00:26:54.419 --> 00:26:56.250
amount of energy trying to control your

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.139
unwanted thoughts and feelings but not

00:26:58.139 --> 00:26:59.519
getting much out of the struggle in

00:26:59.519 --> 00:27:01.320
terms of personal empowerment again a

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.360
sense that your life is expanding then

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.700
perhaps a radical changes in order by

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:06.840
the way all of the stuff is from the

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.470
book so before you can move on with your

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:12.179
life you need to really examine where

00:27:12.179 --> 00:27:14.850
where you presently are before you try

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:17.279
to change anything try to simply spend

00:27:17.279 --> 00:27:19.230
some time observing the thoughts and

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:21.570
feelings and bodily sensations that have

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:23.789
been plaguing you remaining as aware as

00:27:23.789 --> 00:27:25.769
you can of how you tend to cope with

00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:27.570
these feelings right so where this is

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:28.649
and again this is kind of a trick or

00:27:28.649 --> 00:27:29.879
being tricked by the author I hate to

00:27:29.879 --> 00:27:32.389
break it to you guys this is mindfulness

00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:35.070
right before you change quote-unquote

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.990
I'm gonna stop this try to simply spend

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:39.539
some time observing so mindfulness says

00:27:39.539 --> 00:27:41.909
observing the thoughts and feelings and

00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:43.620
bodily sensations because when we're

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.600
observing a thought right this isn't

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.090
being dissociated we're observing it

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.070
we're experiencing it that means there's

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.529
more to us and the person who's going oh

00:27:52.529 --> 00:27:58.320
no no we're going hmm well this sucks

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.259
this sucks out on a [ __ ] audio

00:28:01.259 --> 00:28:03.960
goddammit you know my god I'm I'm really

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.789
angry right now oh my god dude I'm

00:28:05.789 --> 00:28:06.779
telling you man if you're in a fight

00:28:06.779 --> 00:28:09.240
especially being married I'll get super

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.860
pissed and I will just so you know

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:12.210
without assigning blame without being

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:13.500
like why didn't you I'll just be like

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:16.440
I'm really angry right now I just give

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.750
me a second you know and I sort of got

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:19.710
it works like a charm

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:20.879
because you're not in assigning blame

00:28:20.879 --> 00:28:22.350
you're sick I'm pissed right now and I

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:23.639
need to process why and if this is a

00:28:23.639 --> 00:28:26.009
valid reason to be pissed you know and

00:28:26.009 --> 00:28:27.120
you know if you just walked in on like

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.830
you know you're begging your sweet

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.240
little angel getting doggystyle then

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.529
like you know you can fly into action

00:28:31.529 --> 00:28:34.049
but you know most times I mean most

00:28:34.049 --> 00:28:35.940
times that's not the case and if it is

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.279
even then I swear to God even then what

00:28:38.279 --> 00:28:41.929
are you gonna kill the guy or girl

00:28:41.929 --> 00:28:43.860
everything's a girl you just lick both

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.720
your fingers and you ever seen people

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.980
like grease their eyebrows all

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.470
discussing ladies like yo ladies so um

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:53.980
all right I already regret that and

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:57.220
all right so again before we try to

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.780
change anything or implement any new

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.790
practice there spend some time observing

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:02.440
the thoughts and feelings and bodily

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.030
sensations that have been plaguing you

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:07.390
remaining as aware aware as you can of

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.990
how you tend to cope with these feelings

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.590
million-dollar that's the million-dollar

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:14.080
three sentence paragraph also to end

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.270
this chapter the author asks you to stop

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:18.160
and reflect on some of the thoughts and

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.290
feelings you were having right now about

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:23.020
the personal difficulties that may have

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.090
motivated you to read the book or watch

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:28.870
this Prezi take oh excuse me try to take

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:30.730
note of try to take note about anything

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:33.010
that may have popped up that we may have

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:35.200
that we may have been more aware of

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.299
before okay sorry I get confused if

00:29:37.299 --> 00:29:39.250
we're talking about we or I yeah just

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:40.570
try to notice like you know if anything

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:42.490
so you're thinking about something that

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:43.419
popped up right now you might be

00:29:43.419 --> 00:29:44.650
thinking this is stupid

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:48.190
I'm not this oh my god just take note of

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:50.320
that again you don't have to it might be

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.240
stupid you might be right but just pop

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.280
just try to take note of it and just get

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.080
some distance between yourself and your

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.179
judgment and the what the author's

00:29:58.179 --> 00:29:59.620
asking is try to notice if something

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.150
else pops up you know we learn how to

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:02.620
kind of distance ourselves from what

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.980
we're currently thinking sometimes more

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.240
thoughts pop up it's like whoa I've

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.130
freed ups you know real estate in my

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:11.230
whole you know thought universe and now

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:12.610
like I have since I'm relating to my

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:14.169
thoughts differently different thoughts

00:30:14.169 --> 00:30:17.230
pop up just try it out man take it first

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:18.940
yeah you know what I'm saying no big

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.190
deal all right and following chapters

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:24.130
right we are actually going to start to

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:25.990
explore new ways and approaches to

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:28.120
relating to our pain don't expect to

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.220
master these skills or feel some form of

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.870
lifetime relief overnight the author

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.600
isn't asking anyone to believe in any of

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.669
the approaches put forward but in simply

00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:39.160
ask that you simply try them and let

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.820
your experience be the judge all right

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.410
that's all we're moving in even the next

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:45.880
one that hits so funny the next one or

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.309
even like this is still a primer but it

00:30:48.309 --> 00:30:50.260
you actually do some stuff and you know

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.450
I I'd call it I don't know I don't think

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:55.179
it's just a primer so there it is that I

00:30:55.179 --> 00:30:58.870
believe is chapter three and I think I'm

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:00.100
just going to do this one as a single

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:04.450
episode and then do chapter four as one

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:06.970
in itself let me see if anybody's here

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:07.690

in zoom and screen share and have you

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.009
