what do they do

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.400
i think when the mines closed because it

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.479
was an old copper mine

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.880
uh they all like hippies from california

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.600

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.600
is he like the mayor of the town yeah

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.560
pretty much

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.479
yeah although i think all he does is i

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.680
could be wrong

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.479
maybe his routine change during cove in

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.479
fact i know it did uh but they

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.880
yeah that was it

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.399
uh

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:49.920
he would just go to the grocery store

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.920
and come back that was his that's it

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.159
that's it

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.320

yeah it was fun but yeah like i said

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.479
every once in a while you'd get a couple

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.680
drinks and be like like

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.800
[Music]

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.720
people that just drink like bud lights

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.239

yeah like some seafood

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.840

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.840
outside it's brilliant yeah real cold

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.680
yeah you can't drink like craft or like

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.080
ipas outside yeah you can i don't like

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.440
it i do

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.560

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.120
yeah

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.959

times huge yeah there you go

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.480
if i drink 12 ipa's a night instead of

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.319
bud lights would be a disaster that's

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.000
true but you wouldn't need 12 you'd need

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.959
five and you'd have the same effect

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.400
yeah but that's why i don't drink like i

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.800
try not to drink liquor ever

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.239
i'm trying not to get [ __ ] hammered

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.599
at these places he's just trying to like

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.120

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.200

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.360
hammered at clubs and talking [ __ ] that

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.040

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.400

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.760
comedians that are virtue signaling like

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.439
around other comedians and trying to

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.200
establish like a way that we should all

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.040
communicate you're like

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.920
yeah

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.280

to to

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.720
claim the moral high ground to be upset

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.800
everybody else but if you're a comedian

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.800

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.120
i've been reading about um lately i i'm

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.680
actually rereading this book by brian

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.479
murray rescue on um it's called the

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.080
immortality key

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.440
it's all about ancient greece and how

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.639
they used to take wine and they had wine

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.320
laced with all these psychedelic

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.240
chemicals and that's you know the whole

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.479
illustinian mysteries

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.120
but back then everybody used to drink

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.160
all day

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.160
they all had like the alcohol was

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.840
terrible like the wine had like three

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.520
percent alcohol the booze had like three

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.600
percent like beer was three percent that

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.039
what they didn't know how to make like

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.639
strong [ __ ] like they know how to make

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.960
today and everybody was drunk all the

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.400
time

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.319
yeah what else are you gonna do yeah

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:58.160
sitting around waiting to get [ __ ]

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.319
killed by barbarians

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:01.919
you better get hammered the barbarians

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.680
are on mushrooms yeah

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.440
yeah they were that was the thing like

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.720
the vikings they were they were all on

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.160
mushrooms were they yeah they would do

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.400
mushrooms and go berserking yeah they

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.400
would do some bad things i can't imagine

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.400
doing those things on mushrooms

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.319
yeah but if you live back then you could

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:18.080
true if like that was a normal part of

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.080
everyday life was cutting people apart

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.199
you'd probably want to be i guess you

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.520
might take mushrooms and giggle yeah you

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.800
guys would take it

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.639
but they might have giggled too i bet

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:29.840
they were giggling yeah i would imagine

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.039
we're lucky

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:32.880
but that's why people complain today you

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.960
know it's like because it's pretty easy

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.440
so the things that people complain about

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.160
they're relatively mild in comparison to

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.400
the historical record of how [ __ ] up

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.080
life was yeah

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.440
it was terrible did you buy that shirt

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.199

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.880

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.720

right

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.399
yeah that's his vibe i don't like i'm

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:16.080
not going to a [ __ ] tent yeah he

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.920
likes taking molly and hanging out with

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.780
weirdos i like taking molly

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.360
[Music]

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.040
yeah i don't like the weirdos like i

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.360
take molly i want to be alone

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.720
yeah but yeah

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.600
it's uh he's you know he's living the

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.839
life of a free man you know i mean he

00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:33.519
like i don't think i know anybody who

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:36.240
values freedom yeah like that like ari

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.959
does because he values freedom above

00:09:38.959 --> 00:09:41.040
like freedom from everything freedom

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.880
from the best job in the world like even

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.080
though standup's the best job in the

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.080
world he'll take

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.080
months off of his schedule not i'm not

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.120
doing anything i'm not doing any

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.480

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.720
going to wander around with nobody by

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.320
himself yeah

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.680
it's not it's impressive i don't have

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.240
that it's a weird instinct yeah you know

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.160
well i think because it's from uh when

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.240
he was a kid leaving the whole jewish

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.279
thing

00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:06.079
he's probably you know he's probably

00:10:06.079 --> 00:10:08.399
accustomed to losing his entire

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:10.240
community for people who don't know he

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.880

everybody's [ __ ] up they don't know

because there's

00:13:51.839 --> 00:13:53.519
it's like someone who stays up for five

00:13:53.519 --> 00:13:55.519
days in a row you lose the cycle there's

00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:57.839
no cycle so you get confused you need a

00:13:57.839 --> 00:14:00.079
little winter you need a little sun you

00:14:00.079 --> 00:14:02.079
need a little cold you yeah a little bit

00:14:02.079 --> 00:14:04.320
of everything you can't just only eat

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.560
cake you [ __ ] you can't just take it

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.160
that's what like california people are

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.320
doing they're eating cake you know even

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.240
california now they're recognizing like

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.399
los angeles is hitting a massive crime

00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:16.880
wave like [ __ ] crime is everywhere i

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.720
know so many friends who their

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.720
apartment's broken into their cars were

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.040
broken into they've been robbed so many

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.160
people are getting robbed there it's

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.720
just a totally different situation

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.120
and you know that makes it more

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.639
dangerous but it also makes it work

00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:32.079
strong a little more fun a little bit

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:34.320
more fun yeah philly's doing that too

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.519
like burr was saying when he did

00:14:35.519 --> 00:14:37.440
celebrate live and yeah we did that

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.480
sketch

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.480
or that opening monologue rather and he

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.720
talked about uh what's his name that got

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.399
punched the little dude yeah yeah the

00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:46.399
guy from uh

00:14:46.399 --> 00:14:48.079
what the [ __ ] his name rick moran rick

00:14:48.079 --> 00:14:49.600
moran

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.000
they punk punched miranda seals new

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.959
york's back baby

00:14:55.199 --> 00:14:57.199
that was a rough one dude rick took one

00:14:57.199 --> 00:14:59.120
on the chin yeah he out of nowhere for

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.959
no reason someone just yeah punched him

00:15:00.959 --> 00:15:02.160
but that's what happens when you have

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.360
one shouldn't have shrunk those [ __ ]

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.240
kids

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.199
that's probably that homeless guy

00:15:05.199 --> 00:15:06.880
probably saw it was like maybe you got

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.560
mad i don't like people playing with my

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.199
kids right probably

00:15:11.199 --> 00:15:13.199
it's all this crazy rhetoric

00:15:13.199 --> 00:15:14.720
because white people are terrible

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.959
rhetoric we just allowed to just run up

00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:19.519
to random whities and punch them

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:20.399
yeah

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:21.600
that's good though keeps our head on

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.880
swivel a little

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.639
time for the whitey's to start

00:15:24.639 --> 00:15:26.079
when you're 60 years old and you don't

00:15:26.079 --> 00:15:27.279
know karate

00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:28.880
when you're rick moran

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.959
it's probably not the best level yeah

00:15:30.959 --> 00:15:32.560
and that like that guy's not going to

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.399
recover from that well no you know

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:38.240
he's not married

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.600
yeah he'll be able

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.000
hold bounce back rick's tough dude what

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.959
are you doing

00:15:42.959 --> 00:15:44.480
no he's got anything

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.320
i'm just taking a guess i don't think so

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.680
he went down pretty quick

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.000
it was a sneak shot it was a sneak shot

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.600
that's true

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.360
yeah you can see his instincts kick in a

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.040
little daily you think so a little

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.320
coverage yeah if you watch it close

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.000
you'll see rick i thought that was like

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.160
a seizure no he definitely did okay he

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.079
did not react at all he got leveled

00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:05.519
up

00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:08.639
what happened yeah yeah tim told me uh

00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:10.240
dylan told me that he was in times

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.519
square and he felt like he was being

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:12.720
hunted

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.199
he's like dude because uh it's so

00:16:15.199 --> 00:16:17.279
dangerous there now it used to be like

00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:18.639
so easy to walk and now you walk into

00:16:18.639 --> 00:16:21.120
the streets you feel like a victim yeah

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.040
yeah it's it's yeah it's crazy but i

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.639
just moved there i moved there like a

00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:26.079
year before

00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:28.399
covet started oh really yeah from where

00:16:28.399 --> 00:16:30.079
uh philly oh that's where you're from

00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:31.839
yeah now i'm from mechanicsburg

00:16:31.839 --> 00:16:33.120
pennsylvania where did you start doing

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.160
stand-up uh i first open mics i did were

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.399
at the harrisburg comedy zone my parents

00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:40.480
used to live in harrisburg what yeah

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.639
yeah that's what i said yeah nice yeah

00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:44.079
they moved to harrisburg for a while

00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:45.759
they lived in harrisburg and they lived

00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:47.600
uh somewhere else out there there was

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.240
another like real rural area of

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.160
pennsylvania i'm like people who think

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.279
of pennsylvania they think of uh philly

00:16:55.279 --> 00:16:56.320
you know you think of pennsylvania you

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.000
think of pittsburgh you think philly you

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.680
think cities you're out there you just

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.600
smell cow [ __ ] and you see deer

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.640
everywhere lancaster pa a lot of amish

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.160
mechanicsburgs

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.679
it was white trash it's getting a little

00:17:07.679 --> 00:17:10.400
more it's getting gentrified is it yeah

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.720
well people are spreading out yeah i

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.760
think that's one thing that happened

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.120
with covet people are moving out of

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.679
cities in a lot of places there's still

00:17:17.679 --> 00:17:19.919
plenty of people in cities obviously but

00:17:19.919 --> 00:17:22.079
a lot of folks are like do i need to do

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.919
this i can work from home

00:17:23.919 --> 00:17:24.720
yeah

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.240
yeah that'd be nice i think that's the

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.319
plan eventually for you like to get good

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:30.480
enough and stand up to do like what nate

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.240
bogatse he's doing just living in

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.919

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:36.240
traveling yeah or you live out here this

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.240

the cellar and all that so yeah i want

00:17:47.039 --> 00:17:48.640
to do that for a while well you could

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.640
always just travel around too you know

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.960
you could always just get a condo and

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.960
just i mean when you're like like guys

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.480
like tim that have places out here you

comedy condo but i do not trust

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.679
comedians like for the club i would have

00:18:03.679 --> 00:18:05.760
a condo out here where comics could stay

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.520

public high school we we decided to meet

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.280
to fight

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.520
and i guess half their guys didn't show

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.320

probably like we were probably about 20

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.200
to 30 deep they were probably like 10.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.760
we just beat the [ __ ] out these kids my

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.520
one friend my one friend bison dude he

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.280
was like you have a friend named bison

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.799
yeah this is nickname he's gonna be very

00:21:58.799 --> 00:22:00.880
happy when he hears this he's a big guy

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.159
he was way out of high school he was

00:22:02.159 --> 00:22:04.320
like 24. he showed up well

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.240
he was huge he started doing it he

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.679
started doing wrestling moves with these

00:22:07.679 --> 00:22:09.600
kids

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.080
oh put him in the walls of jericho kid

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.320
was crying the kid was crying jesus

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.120
christ

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.200
that's child abuse that was yeah he

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.240
should face

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.320
charges he should face something someone

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.919
should call his mom at least yeah but it

00:22:21.919 --> 00:22:23.039
was funny because a lot of the kids who

00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:24.799
were like afraid to fight that were with

00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:26.960
us like my friends were like kind of

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.240
hiding it was at night so they're like

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.480
hiding in the dark and then once one kid

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.760
from the other school went down they'd

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.320
all swarm and start kicking him

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.640
face jesus christ

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.400
it was nice

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.000
yes that's what happened

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.280
now imagine a 25 year old man

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.960
jesus who's like 350 pounds so walls mma

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.960
fighter used the walls of jericho

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.799
that's his name right right right but

00:22:50.799 --> 00:22:52.720
who what mma fighter used that to win a

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.679
match oh no no in his fight no no no no

00:22:55.679 --> 00:22:57.840
it says mma fighter oh jesus christ i

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:58.799
didn't see that

00:22:58.799 --> 00:23:00.880
yeah jamie

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.200
who the [ __ ] used that in a fight

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.559
if you use that oh my god he really did

00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:09.200
no whoa

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.039
oh my god

00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:13.200
that works man that's tremendous

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.120
pressure on your back that's crazy yeah

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.280
i saw what happened to a guy he cried

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.280
so they're calling it boston crab what

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.120
is that a boston grab let's see dude

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.200
you're tagged in that i know i asked a

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.280
long time ago that's hilarious it says

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.520
jamie vernon

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:31.120
197 weeks ago wow look at that that

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.919
seems like it would hurt like legit work

00:23:33.919 --> 00:23:35.919
and once someone has your legs in that

00:23:35.919 --> 00:23:37.760
position and they've got their center of

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.000
gravity over the your lower back you're

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.520
not really getting out of that i don't

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.440
see how to get out of that

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.960
like if you get to that position right

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.720
there you're kind of [ __ ]

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.559
you know every single younger brother on

00:23:48.559 --> 00:23:50.799
earth has had that happen to them it's

00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:54.000
like you shouldn't ever get to that spot

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.480
but if someone does get you to that spot

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.760
i'm trying to think of how you would get

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.440
out of that i don't think

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.520
there's a clear way out of that

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.919
because you're the way your body is bent

00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:05.200
like you would have to figure out a way

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.880
to rotate but you're not going to rotate

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.200
with full hold your legs like that and

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.039
then someone leaning on your back and

00:24:11.039 --> 00:24:13.200
you're trying to turn you're [ __ ] yeah

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.240
that might be like the ultimate

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.000
finishing move

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.679
it's just pain though

00:24:17.679 --> 00:24:18.960
yeah think about that it's like it's not

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.039
gonna take you out that just gonna hurt

00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:22.400
that could [ __ ] you that could [ __ ] your

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.279
spine up right no i don't think so

00:24:25.279 --> 00:24:26.799
i think it just puts your spine in a

00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:28.480
very bad position where it hurts a lot

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.000
yeah here it is

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.360
is this the same fight or a different

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.440
one i think it's the same thing because

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.480
it just was like a cleaner video of it

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.039
oh yeah

00:24:39.039 --> 00:24:40.640
nope different guy

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.080
different guy there's another guy doing

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:42.880
it

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.640
sure i think so because he stuck his

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.159
tongue out and i think that guy did it

00:24:46.159 --> 00:24:48.159
too oh really yo yo you know you're

00:24:48.159 --> 00:24:49.360
right you're right look at the shorts

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.799
same color shorts

00:24:50.799 --> 00:24:52.880
yep that's him

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.080
they just didn't have the full video

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.320
that's crazy they did that because once

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.080
you get into that position

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.080
like when someone has both of your legs

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.240
tucked under the arms like that

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.840
i don't know what you're going to be

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.440
able to do

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.880
do you know what this is this is the guy

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.360
who's way better the guy in the blue

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.559
he's way better and the other guy's

00:25:10.559 --> 00:25:12.720
already done he's arrested moved to him

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.840
yeah he decides to have some fun

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.960
he's tapping hey you have to tap from

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.960
that well the key is to never let

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.919
yourself get into that position

00:25:23.919 --> 00:25:25.600
shout out to that fella whoever he is

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.200
yeah he should have not gotten in the

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.240
ring if johnny was yours john o'mears

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:30.960
john

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.039
oh and then that was his first name

00:25:33.039 --> 00:25:35.039
john o'mears yeah

00:25:35.039 --> 00:25:36.799
congratulations jono

00:25:36.799 --> 00:25:38.559
so that's a boston crap or is that the

00:25:38.559 --> 00:25:40.000
walls of jericho what's the difference i

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.919
think both i think it's chris jericho

00:25:41.919 --> 00:25:44.080
doing it makes it the walls of jericho

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.679
yeah makes sense shout out to the other

00:25:45.679 --> 00:25:48.240
guy too congratulations on reliving the

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.240
worst thing that's ever happened to you

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.240
on a jacket

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.320
it's not the worst way to get tapped

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.400
what yeah no there's worse ways for sure

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.320
wrist walks

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.360
oh yeah

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.679
it's like how it catches them

00:26:03.679 --> 00:26:05.200
jesus christ

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.120
a wristlock in an mma fight is very

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.080
embarrassing

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.600
yeah it's embarrassing because it hurts

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.760
like hell like you will tap

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.320
but yeah in jiu jitsu it's like the most

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.520
embarrassing way to get tapped if

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.520
somebody gets in a wrist lock really

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.279
yeah i thought the most embarrassing is

00:26:19.279 --> 00:26:21.120
getting tapped by like a girl right but

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.400
that happens

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.679
that happens to everybody that does jiu

00:26:23.679 --> 00:26:26.559
jitsu yep 100 yeah yeah yeah if you

00:26:26.559 --> 00:26:28.240
always show up early and they're like

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.440
i'll be pretty good at this and then

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.600
they pair you up with a girl then i'll

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.520
[ __ ] tab [ __ ] behind your back

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.120
just chucking the [ __ ] out of yeah like

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.039
i thought i'd be into this

00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:38.320
it's humiliating when you find out a

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.919
woman can kill you

00:26:39.919 --> 00:26:41.840
it's very sad a woman who weighs less

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.679
than you who's weaker than you but she

00:26:43.679 --> 00:26:46.000
can kill you yeah easily i don't want to

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.400
find out multiple times yeah like duncan

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.720
i got dunked in a year of jiu jitsu once

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.679
for christmas and uh he went to classes

00:26:53.679 --> 00:26:55.440
and he was doing it with his girl and

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.720
she was new

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.320
she wasn't even she was wasn't all the

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.760
experts starting together

00:27:01.919 --> 00:27:03.760
and she was strangling him and i was

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.559
like oh duncan we gotta work on this

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:08.240
just get out of the sport

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.919
he's like dude she just killed me

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.360
yeah you gotta go home

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.159
yeah

00:27:14.159 --> 00:27:17.600
he eventually decided it was not for him

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.279
he could have stuck with it though

00:27:19.279 --> 00:27:20.799
he would figure it out and then one day

00:27:20.799 --> 00:27:23.440
beat a girl no beat guys you move from

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.919
girls to guys

00:27:25.919 --> 00:27:27.760
i guess look i don't i don't do that

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.840
stuff when i started there was very few

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.399
where you can just say you're a woman

00:28:24.399 --> 00:28:25.919

rugby against women and i would say that

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.880

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.200
sexual assault like

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.799
is there any small chance that they just

00:30:14.799 --> 00:30:16.159
like accidentally put the wrong picture

00:30:16.159 --> 00:30:18.880
up in the article

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.399
what do you think

00:30:20.399 --> 00:30:22.640

should do that they're like the male

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.080
teachers are getting trouble for hooking

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.279
up with kids to say they're women should

00:30:45.279 --> 00:30:46.880
be like i actually identify as a woman

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.960
yeah you get a way lighter sentence yeah

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.520
yeah women who molest boys like

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.360

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.360
i retract i've now googled the name i

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.120
see it everywhere okay yeah that's it i

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.120
was just checking that looks if i didn't

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.559
if i had a bet

00:31:00.559 --> 00:31:02.000
guy or girl

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.559
i mean i'm leaning heavily

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:07.039
on that woman on ruby and ruby the guy

00:31:07.039 --> 00:31:08.799
the girl woman i'm gonna take her word

00:31:08.799 --> 00:31:09.679
for it

00:31:09.679 --> 00:31:12.159
wow you're amazing you're so open-minded

00:31:12.159 --> 00:31:14.159
i don't care what she's done in the past

00:31:14.159 --> 00:31:16.720
yeah right like why should we judge

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.640
walk a mile in her shoes that's another

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.679
thing they're trying to do now they're

00:31:19.679 --> 00:31:21.360
trying to say that that's a sexual

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.679
orientation and that being a pedophile

00:31:23.679 --> 00:31:26.530
is actually a sexual orientation

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:27.679
[Music]

00:31:27.679 --> 00:31:29.919
i guess technically it is that it's just

00:31:29.919 --> 00:31:31.440
a bad one it's the worst one it's the

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.360
worst one you can do yeah

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.960
i've i've seen like

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.240
we talked about it recently i saw a

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:40.000
professor talking about how a woman

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.519
uh or a man rather could

00:31:43.519 --> 00:31:45.679
have a sexual consenting relationship

00:31:45.679 --> 00:31:48.320
with a 13 year old and i was like what

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.240
in the [ __ ] are you saying who's a

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.159
viking maybe it's a guy with no kids how

00:31:52.159 --> 00:31:53.360
about that yeah yeah probably because

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.880
you have no kids you think stupid [ __ ]

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.559
because you think you think it makes you

00:31:56.559 --> 00:31:58.000
sound progressive

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.559
yeah yeah i don't that's a tough one to

00:32:00.559 --> 00:32:01.919
get to

00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:04.080
through being progressive it's a tough

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:04.880
one

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.039
yeah i don't know man people can make

00:32:07.039 --> 00:32:08.799
some [ __ ] weird mental leaps and

00:32:08.799 --> 00:32:10.399
gymnastics

00:32:10.399 --> 00:32:13.600
they they can justify some wacky [ __ ]

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.039
there's also some people that are just a

00:32:15.039 --> 00:32:17.120
real contrarian they just want things to

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.799
be okay even if they're not okay so

00:32:18.799 --> 00:32:21.039
they'll argue for it as an intellectual

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:22.799
exercise

00:32:22.799 --> 00:32:24.720
you know yeah for sure they do it's

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.240
[ __ ] strange

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.919
it'd be a tough one to present though

00:32:27.919 --> 00:32:29.600
like be like no this is how i feel i

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.519
think pedophiles

00:32:31.519 --> 00:32:34.240
you would say that but we are so through

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.399
the looking glass with so many things

00:32:36.399 --> 00:32:38.399
that really are preposterous that i'm

00:32:38.399 --> 00:32:40.720
not sure if that's the case anymore

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.480
you know like the idea that you can't be

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.399
racist if you're a person of color it's

00:32:44.399 --> 00:32:46.399
not possible yeah because race has

00:32:46.399 --> 00:32:47.679
something to do it has something to do

00:32:47.679 --> 00:32:49.679
with power like okay

00:32:49.679 --> 00:32:51.039
that's not true

00:32:51.039 --> 00:32:53.360
that's that's not true of course yeah we

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.240
know that we know it's not true

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.840
experience they know it's not true too

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.279
but they're counting the fact that the

00:32:59.279 --> 00:33:01.039
people that say this first of all

00:33:01.039 --> 00:33:03.279
they're all people of color so they're

00:33:03.279 --> 00:33:05.519
in a protected class or they're white

00:33:05.519 --> 00:33:08.240
people who feel extra guilty so they

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.200
want you to feel bad and so they want to

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.559
show you that they're on the side the

00:33:12.559 --> 00:33:14.080
good side they're they're on the side

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.600
they're just that are anti-racist the

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.080
thing about the the white people

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.840
or the people of color can't be racist

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.120
is because like you call a white person

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.880
like yeah whatever cracker

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.320
or

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.000
but they found a loophole and it's to

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.919
call us racist

00:33:27.919 --> 00:33:29.519
that one hurts that does hurt that's

00:33:29.519 --> 00:33:31.200
like r n word that is someone's like

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.519
you're racist what did you say about me

00:33:33.519 --> 00:33:34.960
it's even worse because it makes you

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.120
feel guilty sure because if someone

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.600
calls you a bad word like a negative

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.760
stereotype about your race they're the

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.919
piece of [ __ ] not you if someone calls

00:33:43.919 --> 00:33:46.399
you a a racist now you have to defend

00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:48.399
yourself against being a piece of [ __ ]

00:33:48.399 --> 00:33:50.159
yeah it's tough i've been there it's a

00:33:50.159 --> 00:33:51.840
tough one to defend against what was

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.159
your experience like the whole snl

00:33:54.159 --> 00:33:57.600
debacle thing what was that like uh

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.159
it was very very crazy i don't know it's

00:34:00.159 --> 00:34:01.360
tough to

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.039
there's not many people that have you

00:34:03.039 --> 00:34:05.200
can even talk to about it you know

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.360
because it [ __ ] you up a little like it

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.200
makes you like uh

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.520
not trust people and [ __ ] for a while

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.960
like you won't what

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.280
i don't know i don't know how to explain

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.079
it it's but back to the the experience

00:34:18.079 --> 00:34:20.000
of it was like

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
you just uh it was kind of surreal

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.440
because i went from i was one of the

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.119
first people to get like canceled or

00:34:25.119 --> 00:34:27.599
however you want to say consequences

00:34:27.599 --> 00:34:29.679
however yeah however you want to say it

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:31.119
doesn't matter what we call it it is

00:34:31.119 --> 00:34:34.480
what it is but uh i was one of the first

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.639
people to go from i was doing

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:37.760
i was poor

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.440
i was not famous at all

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.800
i was poor

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.960
and then i got canceled immediately like

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.320
that was my like

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.560
right it was a very different experience

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.839
and then yeah most people that get

00:34:47.839 --> 00:34:50.000
cancelled or yeah you got canceled on

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.240
the way i got cancelled immediately yeah

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.599
they they literally were like how about

00:34:53.599 --> 00:34:55.919
this guy and everyone was like no

00:34:55.919 --> 00:34:59.040
so you got cast on snl yes and then what

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.839
happened

00:35:00.839 --> 00:35:04.640
um so i found out i was getting on snl

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.400
the day before they announced it they

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.440
got a call

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.560
they're like hey we want to put you on

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.119
the cast the whole time i was

00:35:11.119 --> 00:35:13.440
we'll start from the top

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.520
my my agents and all those people they

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.720
were like

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.480
you're do you want to audit or do you

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.760
want to write do you want to send a

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.560
packet in for snl i was like no

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.839
i'm not going to be a writer i'm never

00:35:23.839 --> 00:35:26.240
going to i won't work on that show and

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:28.480
then i guess they saw me at jfl

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.320
and comedy central thing and they were

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.160
like we like him we want him to audition

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.560
he can come straight in to audition so i

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.240
went straight to the main stage for the

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.760
audition and the whole time leading up

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.520
to it i was like i'm never going to get

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.960
this i don't care i want to do stand-up

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.280
i kind of hated snl at that point

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.920
because every every sketch was like

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.079
you know you know what it is yeah and

00:35:50.079 --> 00:35:52.960
then i was like i'll never fit in there

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.000
and then

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
when when you go to audition it's just

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.640
you just wait your turn in a green room

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.079
and they keep you there extra long for

00:36:00.079 --> 00:36:02.000
like two or three hours to like make you

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.720
nervous really but i knew i was certain

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.560
i was never gonna get it and i really

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.560
wasn't nervous i was in there [ __ ]

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.320
dipping hanging out

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.520
and they were like all right it's your

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.640
turn to go

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.079
but that's when the nerves hit like you

00:36:14.079 --> 00:36:16.000
walk in and you see the main stage

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.760
because that's what you audition on it's

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.160
like v stage wow and it's a totally

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.760
empty studio the whole room's empty

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.920
except for a table of like writers and

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.240
producers and lorne michaels and then

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.560
you go on and they're like three two

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:31.200
go do five minutes wow in front of just

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.400
a camera right and then you're doing

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.400
stand up i did stand up

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.920
wow i did five minutes of stand up

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.480

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.599
i ran into michael che that night

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:43.119

i don't know how

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.960
and like all that [ __ ] and then

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.160
time passes and i figured they were

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.079
gonna ask me to be a writer

00:38:44.079 --> 00:38:45.760
because that's usually how it goes yeah

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.440
usually you work on the show to

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.839
experience what the show's like

00:38:49.839 --> 00:38:51.119
but

00:38:51.119 --> 00:38:52.079
i don't know i didn't want to be a

00:38:52.079 --> 00:38:53.040
writer

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.680
by all accounts that place is a den of

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.480
everybody yeah a den of thieves

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.040
you hear jim brewer's account of the the

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.720
climate in that place yeah and it's

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:05.280
horrific yeah they're all stealing from

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.240
writers they're stealing from performers

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.000
if you're a writer and you submit your

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.240
packages the the higher up writers will

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.880
steal your [ __ ] according to brewer yeah

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.119
if you submit a package they own that

00:39:17.119 --> 00:39:19.040
package even if they don't hire you i

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.720
know that so if you have some great

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.400
premises they decide they're just going

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.000
to take your premises and not hire you

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.720
they they own all those bids yeah

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.960
it's crazy i mean yeah i don't

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.640
i don't i don't i don't care about

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.000
writing i didn't want to be a writer

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000
right so i was like if even if they

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.240
offered me the writing thing i was like

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.000
i don't want to take it i think i would

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.800
have at the time but anyway they they

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.960
asked me to go straight to cast so i was

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.760
like yeah i'll definitely do that

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.320
lauren calls says hey we want to use you

they're not used to people having

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.200

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.560
through hundreds they go through your

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.280

that's fine don't worry about it

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.240
so i was like all right we'll see and uh

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.800
so the day they announced it

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.560
it was it was cool it was very cool you

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.160
hear from everybody you've ever grown up

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.839
with they're all like holy [ __ ] what

00:40:29.839 --> 00:40:31.839
just like i can't believe you're on this

00:40:31.839 --> 00:40:33.680
and then so that lasted for about like

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.160
three hours before an article came out

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.720
that was like here's what this guy says

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.280
there's a clip of me saying something

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:44.800
yeah unsavory stuff yeah but talking

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.359
[ __ ] it was it was the

00:40:47.359 --> 00:40:50.400
one podcast we ever filmed

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.960
that's the one they used wow and it just

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.720
happened and it was funny too because

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:55.920
people were like man they really had to

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.599
dig to find this i was like that's

00:40:57.599 --> 00:40:59.760
probably like three minutes in it's like

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.839
we had one podcast online it was three

00:41:01.839 --> 00:41:03.040
minutes in

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:03.920
wow

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.280
it's what we were saying earlier that's

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.280
what podcasts are that's what comics do

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.280
a lot we talk [ __ ] it doesn't mean you

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.880
really mean those things but the idea

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.760
today is that talking [ __ ] is not real

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.599
they want to take

00:41:15.599 --> 00:41:17.280
out of context

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.520
phrases and sentences that you've used

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.040
and put them in quotes

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.440
and make you look like a monster yeah

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.440

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.839

literally thought that oh okay yeah i

00:42:59.599 --> 00:43:00.960
thought it would be funny

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.960
well it could have been funny yeah i was

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.119
booked up though no it's fine i it was

00:43:05.119 --> 00:43:07.599
just funny to truly

00:43:07.599 --> 00:43:09.440
that was a conversation i actually had

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.280
really inward michael's office in the

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.480
middle of that

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.640
that's hilarious it was i was in pure

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:16.560
[ __ ]

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.560
yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.839
but

00:43:19.839 --> 00:43:21.680
because i remember somebody contacted me

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.200
like to have you on

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.119
and i was like i don't have any room

00:43:25.119 --> 00:43:26.720
like for a yeah i could do like an

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:28.480
emergency podcast but i'm like let me

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.240
let this dude ride this out yeah and

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.960
then we'll do one eventually truly

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.880
glad that that did not happen because i

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.880
would have come in emotional yeah come

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:40.319
in like guns blaze

00:43:40.319 --> 00:43:41.760
and i never felt that way like the whole

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.359
time i was like i kind of get it when

00:43:43.359 --> 00:43:45.280
someone gets really cancelled you need

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.119
perspective yeah you need you know what

00:43:47.119 --> 00:43:48.560
it's like it's like you need that venom

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.480
to work its way through your system and

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.480
then you develop a certain amount of

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:56.800
immunity to the actual moment yeah

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.280
absolutely yeah yeah it ended up being a

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.800
good thing so when lauren pulls you in

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.240
the office and says we just have to get

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.839
you to the stage we just have to get you

00:44:03.839 --> 00:44:06.319
to an episode then what happens

00:44:06.319 --> 00:44:08.640
it just it just kept it just kept steam

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.000
rolling like it never it didn't

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.760
dissipate at all like it kept being like

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.160
no you guys need to fire him and i get

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:17.119
it well that's where the fun is yeah the

00:44:17.119 --> 00:44:19.280
fun and going after someone is not going

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.440
after someone and then no consequences

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:24.400
that makes them sad yeah which makes

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:27.599
them happy so they get you fired yeah

00:44:27.599 --> 00:44:29.359
and that's yeah they did they did a good

00:44:29.359 --> 00:44:31.839
job yeah good job got me yeah and it's

00:44:31.839 --> 00:44:34.240

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:36.720

00:44:54.319 --> 00:44:56.400

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.599
quality to it because it looks so fake

00:45:23.599 --> 00:45:26.160
but it's obvious it's like it's like

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.400
these things like look how bad these

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.160

so fake like you would never believe

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.640
that that's the real person so it's

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:45.760
comedic

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.480
but

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.319
it it's also

00:45:48.319 --> 00:45:50.480
the the material is brilliant and you

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.240
can get away with so much in someone

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.000
else's voice when everybody knows it's

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.839
not really that person yeah it's really

00:45:55.839 --> 00:45:57.680

he's one of my favorite but the [ __ ]

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:09.280
you're doing is right up there with that

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.920
it's really [ __ ] funny man it's

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.599
really funny and it's like something you

00:46:13.599 --> 00:46:15.680
would never be able to do on snl the

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.119
stuff you guys are doing how are you

00:46:17.119 --> 00:46:19.440

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.960
production company that financed have

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.040
the trump one was made the trump speed

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.839
dating

00:46:30.079 --> 00:46:33.839
yeah it's john mcevery he's keeves he's

00:46:33.839 --> 00:46:36.240
incredible writer he writes all he's

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.079
they're really good man yeah they're

00:46:40.079 --> 00:46:42.240
really good damn i spazzed on that snl

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.720
story no you didn't at all how do you

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:47.040
feel like it came out bad no no no look

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:49.599
it's an awkward story it is

00:46:49.599 --> 00:46:51.040
it's always here's what's uncomfortable

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:53.599
about it is i don't want to sound like

00:46:53.599 --> 00:46:55.440
it's weird for me to rail against

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.839
canceled culture because i was

00:46:57.839 --> 00:47:00.240
a victim of it for lack of a better word

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.599
you know what i mean why is it weird for

00:47:01.599 --> 00:47:03.200
you to rail against i don't know i don't

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.839
know i just it makes me seems defensive

00:47:05.839 --> 00:47:07.920
yeah yeah i'd rather just be like look

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.359
if people bring up canceled culture i'm

00:47:09.359 --> 00:47:10.800
just like

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.960
honestly i really believe it's better

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.560
for you in the long run i really do

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.400
you're a brilliant comedian i think your

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.079
sketches are incredible and i think it's

00:47:18.079 --> 00:47:19.520
better that you not get attached to

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.119
something that's ultimately corrupting

00:47:21.119 --> 00:47:23.119
and i don't want to be on the other side

00:47:23.119 --> 00:47:25.440
of it where it's like

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.599
i'm a free speech guy i'm a [ __ ] it's

00:47:27.599 --> 00:47:28.960
like dude i don't want to be involved in

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.880
any of this i just want to do comedy the

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.200
free speech thing should be

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.559
it should just be uniform everyone who's

00:47:36.559 --> 00:47:38.160
involved in creative endeavor should

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:40.400
understand context and nuance yeah and

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.640
when they don't they're either being

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.160
disingenuous

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.640
or they're stupid it's one of two things

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.720
either you you don't agree with someone

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:50.480
talking [ __ ] which is fine maybe you

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:52.160
don't like talking [ __ ] because you're a

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.160
more serious person yeah and in which

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.720
case comedy is the right venue for you

00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:58.480
but you should it's not the right but

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.720
you should also understand

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.400
you know what people are doing and if

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:03.839
you don't know what people doing are

00:48:03.839 --> 00:48:05.599
doing you're either an idiot or you're

00:48:05.599 --> 00:48:08.559
an [ __ ] you're either purposely

00:48:08.559 --> 00:48:10.400
trying to

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:13.680
ignore subtlety and nuance and

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.760
the fact that there's context to what

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.680
people are doing and joking around

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:19.359
joking around is a real thing and how

00:48:19.359 --> 00:48:21.119
come you can joke around about

00:48:21.119 --> 00:48:22.960
all sorts of stuff but you can't joke

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.400
around about race

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.559
like why not yeah how come

00:48:26.559 --> 00:48:28.160
why does that make you bad you can joke

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.760
around about women you can joke around

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.280
about men you can joke around about your

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:34.079
dick you can joke around about anal sex

00:48:34.079 --> 00:48:36.160
you joke around about drugs you can't

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.800
joke around about race that's nonsense

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.319
yeah we're just so over sensitive and

00:48:40.319 --> 00:48:41.680
you're so worried about being called out

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.960
for stuff that's why everybody's so

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.400
scary

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.920
yeah

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.359
yeah people get very afraid of getting

00:48:47.359 --> 00:48:48.559
called out and

00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:50.720
and very afraid of not calling out

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:53.040
someone else because then silence is

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:54.720
violence true

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.720
true you just gotta take a second like

00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:58.960
don't get caught up in it like uh

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.720
like if i see other people [ __ ] up and

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.119
say something crazy even still my first

00:49:03.119 --> 00:49:05.200
reaction is like whoa what the [ __ ] were

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.520
they thinking right and then 20 minutes

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.640
30 minutes later i'll be like all right

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.240
he was [ __ ] around yeah but it's

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.520
still there's still that instinct and

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:14.640
then especially if you just see a clip

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.640
and it's wild right you're going to be

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.880
like what the [ __ ]

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:20.960
thing tony ari

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.760
yeah yeah and every time you see it the

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.760
first i tony's perfect example first

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.680
time i saw it i was like whoa

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:30.079
what the [ __ ] but then you see the whole

00:49:30.079 --> 00:49:32.240
video and you go thinking oh i see what

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.119
he's doing

00:49:33.119 --> 00:49:35.200
that guy opened for tony and you're like

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.160
oh

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.640
he was and he he did kill tony multiple

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:41.119
times like oh they're friends that's

00:49:41.119 --> 00:49:43.680
just how people do it yeah but people

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.359
outside of our world

00:49:45.359 --> 00:49:48.240
don't understand if someone you know if

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:50.240
you introduce someone

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.559
and they go on stage and they say thank

00:49:52.559 --> 00:49:53.280
you

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:56.000
give it up for shane that [ __ ] loser

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.960
that fat drug hey

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.760
bro what the [ __ ] that's what people do

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.319
that's what we do as comics and

00:50:04.319 --> 00:50:06.640
we [ __ ] around it's talking [ __ ] and

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:09.040
that's what tony was doing and it was

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:10.640
real clear if you saw his whole set

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.160
absolutely that not only was he [ __ ]

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.920
around but it actually worked yeah like

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.240
he got laughs and it got last because

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:19.280
the guy's whole set before him was

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.520
talking about white people being mean to

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.359
asians yes and he had this whole

00:50:23.359 --> 00:50:25.040
pandering thing it was like what i would

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:27.119
really ask is please stop being mean to

00:50:27.119 --> 00:50:28.720
us you know i'm paraphrasing whatever it

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:30.240
was and then tony goes on right

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.520
afterwards and says that horrible [ __ ]

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.839
is the worst thing it's funny yes

00:50:33.839 --> 00:50:35.680
that's why people laugh that's it it's

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:38.000
not like a racist convention at vulcan

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.200
gas company

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.400
yeah it's

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.319
true i mean that's that's all it is it's

00:50:42.319 --> 00:50:44.240
a comedy it was common yeah and maybe

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:45.760
it's not your kind of comedy that's okay

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.359
too but don't pretend this is real

00:50:47.359 --> 00:50:49.680
thoughts yeah that's that's ridiculous

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:52.079
this is uh the thing about joking around

00:50:52.079 --> 00:50:54.559
it's like it can be weaponized it could

00:50:54.559 --> 00:50:57.119
be weaponized against you i had people

00:50:57.119 --> 00:50:58.559
coming to shows

00:50:58.559 --> 00:51:00.160
recording my sets

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.839
and then typing them out

00:51:01.839 --> 00:51:03.839
as if they were real yeah well i do that

00:51:03.839 --> 00:51:05.920
bit i don't decide the bit that i do

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:07.520
about what happened when i was and why i

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:08.800
endorsed bernie sanders where people

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.520
were taking small pieces of stand-up

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:14.000
bits and taking them out of context and

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.839
using them to show what a piece of [ __ ]

00:51:15.839 --> 00:51:18.160
i am

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:21.599
it's like here's a joke yeah clearly and

00:51:21.599 --> 00:51:23.440
if you if you type out someone's

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:25.839
stand-up or a podcast especially a

00:51:25.839 --> 00:51:28.480
segment of it just take the worst parts

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.400
you know yeah yeah it's

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:33.040
it's uh it's intentional it's just

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.559
it's just they're trying to get clicks i

00:51:34.559 --> 00:51:35.920
don't even think half of them care

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:38.000
they're [ __ ] they care they're all [ __ ]

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.160
anybody is doing that's a [ __ ] yeah they

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:41.680
know what they're doing oh they do they

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:42.960
do know

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.319

00:51:44.319 --> 00:51:46.400
don't care i meant to say they they're

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.079
not hurt by it they're literally just

00:51:48.079 --> 00:51:49.440
like look at this look at this oh yeah

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.280

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:53.599
what what you're saying no they know

00:51:53.599 --> 00:51:55.280
what they're doing what they're doing is

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:57.520
they're intentionally taking something

00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.119
out of context and they're trying to

00:51:59.119 --> 00:52:00.960
make it something that it's not there's

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:01.920
a lot of

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:04.000
there's a lot of range in when people

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.079
are saying things

00:52:06.079 --> 00:52:08.640
they don't they don't necessarily

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.559
they're not trying to offend yeah you

00:52:10.559 --> 00:52:11.839
know when you're saying

00:52:11.839 --> 00:52:14.160

00:52:27.119 --> 00:52:28.400
this stuff he said

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:29.839
if you think if something is really

00:52:29.839 --> 00:52:31.040
funny or if you think something is

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.960
offensive it comes from the same place a

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.800
guy's just trying to he's just trying to

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.200

uh in the end one of the things that you

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.599
and i have been talking about is that it

00:54:51.599 --> 00:54:54.000

absolutely like when people hear you and

00:54:58.559 --> 00:55:00.640

they're happy you're there but for a

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:09.040
while what happens the first like

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:11.440
couple weeks or i was in new york too so

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:14.960
people are very very very uptight and

out the statement what does the

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:37.520

like that's how this gets passed if we

00:56:46.559 --> 00:56:47.760
say nothing

00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:49.839
if we start interacting with this at all

00:56:49.839 --> 00:56:52.160

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.040
so

00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.720
i didn't know

00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:57.680
an nbc producer was on this group texas

00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:59.440

apologizing i had no idea nbc was in the

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:07.119
group text so it made me look like i was

00:57:07.119 --> 00:57:08.559
a baller but

00:57:08.559 --> 00:57:11.670

00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:14.800
[Music]

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.119

00:57:19.119 --> 00:57:20.880
no one knows who i am at all right to

00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:23.040

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.559
crazy yeah

00:57:24.559 --> 00:57:27.040
and then uh so they asked me to put out

00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:28.559
a statement i'm like [ __ ] no i can't do

00:57:28.559 --> 00:57:30.400
that it was a ridiculous statement

00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.400
inexcusable growth

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:36.000
all that [ __ ] yeah it's just wild yeah

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.440
and uh

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:39.280
i talked to some comedians and they were

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:41.119
like how are you going to do stand up

00:57:41.119 --> 00:57:43.440
again if you say this

00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:45.119
like how are you going to be able to go

00:57:45.119 --> 00:57:46.000
do

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000
comedy having just said everything i

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.760
said was inexcusable

00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:52.000
from now on everything he said is

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:52.880
you know what i mean it's just

00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:54.400
disgusting everything you've done you

00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:57.599
regret and it's disgusting

00:57:57.599 --> 00:57:59.119
and then i talked to lauren lauren

00:57:59.119 --> 00:58:02.160
called and he was like

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:03.760
just give me something

00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:05.280
give me anything because i told him i

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.480
couldn't do that i was like i can't do

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.480
the sorry inexcusable thing he was like

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:09.920
just give me something

00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:12.000
but i need it in the next 10 minutes

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000

00:58:16.079 --> 00:58:17.440
sitting there i mean it's raining out i

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:19.040
was at the i was at the stand in new

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:21.599
york i was like trying to do

00:58:21.599 --> 00:58:23.839
so i go in and he's like uh

00:58:23.839 --> 00:58:25.680
or my manager was like

00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:27.200
just say you're a comedian that pushes

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:29.760
boundaries and sometimes so my first

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.040
thing i tweet out was like i'm a

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:34.079
comedian that pushes boundaries

00:58:34.079 --> 00:58:36.319
that's so lame dude god damn it i blew

00:58:36.319 --> 00:58:37.440
it

00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:39.200
uh but yeah i was like sorry to anybody

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.720
that's actually offended that was never

00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:41.599
my

00:58:41.599 --> 00:58:42.640
thing

00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:43.680
because i didn't think anyone was

00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:45.119
actually offended

00:58:45.119 --> 00:58:46.880
they probably really weren't almost no

00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:48.559
one well there was a few of course there

00:58:48.559 --> 00:58:49.839
are people that saw it that were like

00:58:49.839 --> 00:58:51.359
this bums me out that these words

00:58:51.359 --> 00:58:52.720
getting thrown around

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:55.040
yeah you know and i get that and i do i

00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:57.280
am sorry for that yeah no i believe you

00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:00.400
are yeah because that's not the way you

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:02.880
meant to do it in the context yeah again

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.720
it's a thing that people do they're just

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:06.240
talking [ __ ]

00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:08.480
it's not real it's like you're saying

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:10.880
something inappropriate on purpose yeah

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:13.520
and the the only way you can do that is

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:15.280
if the other person knows you're not

00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:18.400
racist yeah that's why it works it works

00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:19.359
because you're saying something that's

00:59:19.359 --> 00:59:20.880
ridiculous i'm like what the [ __ ] is

00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:23.280
that we're doing a podcast for 500

00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:25.200

00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:39.359

00:59:39.359 --> 00:59:41.040
you've said to me this week

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:42.880
i've heard from men

00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:45.359
like dude every single thing really yeah

00:59:45.359 --> 00:59:46.640
like you know humans were supposed to be

00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:48.319
like this like you know we're supposed

00:59:48.319 --> 00:59:50.400
to be out gathering like all that [ __ ]

00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:51.760
that's funny man

00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:54.079
um

00:59:54.319 --> 00:59:57.599
what the [ __ ] was i saying uh who cares

00:59:57.599 --> 01:00:00.160
you were at your statement oh 10 minutes

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.079
statement i had 10 minutes i put this

01:00:02.079 --> 01:00:04.559
thing together

01:00:04.799 --> 01:00:06.480
it's okay but it's one of those things

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:07.920
where it's like you're caught up in this

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:09.520
moment of like this is huge you're

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.599
emotional

01:00:11.599 --> 01:00:13.520
and in in a couple like you know it's

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.880
you're going to be embarrassed don't

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.480
ever apologize

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.079
that's what i'm saying like you can

01:00:18.079 --> 01:00:19.920
apologize for hurting people's feelings

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.440
for hurting people's feelings certainly

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.040
you can still apologize for things you

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:25.040
don't issue a statement yeah the problem

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.200
is those statements are so grandiose too

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.280
it's like people like when jimmy kimmel

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.440
made his statement about doing blackface

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:34.559
in the 90s it's like oh jimmy yeah

01:00:34.559 --> 01:00:36.400
everybody knows they know that you were

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.160
just doing carl malone they know you're

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.680
not racist

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.920
like this you're appeasing to the worst

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.440
humans yeah

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.960
that's the problem is the people that

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.559
want you to apologize for that stuff

01:00:46.559 --> 01:00:48.200
they're all

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:51.680
sanctimonious [ __ ] who are just

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.520
trying to take people down it's not

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.599
that's they're not really thinking

01:00:55.599 --> 01:00:58.400
you're a bad person no reasonable human

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.799
being thinks jimmy kimmel's a bad person

01:01:00.799 --> 01:01:03.280
or a racist that's ridiculous they're

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.040
looking for targets

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.799
they're looking for they've got a bag of

01:01:06.799 --> 01:01:08.640
rocks and they're looking at windows

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.640
that's what it is

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.720
and yeah it's fun yeah it's fun it's fun

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:14.640
to watch someone get [ __ ] crushed

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.319
that's what people like it's i like

01:01:16.319 --> 01:01:18.559
watching car accidents yeah

01:01:18.559 --> 01:01:20.799
all the time i watch yeah the worst

01:01:20.799 --> 01:01:22.799
things possible i watch that and on

01:01:22.799 --> 01:01:25.599
twitter when even today even after

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:27.440
it happened to me i'll see it happening

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:29.520
to someone else and be like

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:31.839
it's crazy it is but you know we're

01:01:31.839 --> 01:01:33.599
talking about tony

01:01:33.599 --> 01:01:35.440
when tony goes on stage now i'm telling

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.280
you the round of applause as [ __ ] guy

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:40.720
gets is like double what needs to happen

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.559
it's your first year it's fans

01:01:42.559 --> 01:01:45.119
reassuring you yes we like you we know

01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:46.559
what you did wasn't

01:01:46.559 --> 01:01:48.400
that wasn't you right like we know that

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.079
you know we know it's just you're just

01:01:50.079 --> 01:01:52.000
doing comedy you're [ __ ] around and

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:52.960
it might

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.400
might have been the wrong thing to say

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.400
at the time but he probably had about

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.760
five seconds to think about what he was

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.680
gonna say as he was walking to the stage

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.760
and said i'm gonna light these people up

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.599
yeah i like to think about like tony

01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:04.880
right before he went on like looking at

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:07.839
someone like watch this

01:02:09.599 --> 01:02:11.200
ruining his life

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:14.160
ruining his life for a full week yeah

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.400
now my mine was for

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.680
a couple months

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:20.400
i got [ __ ] drilled by that

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.319
but

01:02:22.319 --> 01:02:24.000
yeah it's just very it's a very surreal

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.319
thing how long before you went on stage

01:02:26.319 --> 01:02:28.480
again i went on stage that night i did

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.039
shows at the stand wow yeah because that

01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:33.039
was and that was the only place that i

01:02:33.039 --> 01:02:35.599
wouldn't have been freaking out right

01:02:35.599 --> 01:02:37.920
right like it was at a comedy club right

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.359
like i didn't want to go home and sit in

01:02:39.359 --> 01:02:40.880
my apartment alone

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.799
oh yeah it would have been crazy that's

01:02:42.799 --> 01:02:44.319
crazy what was it like the moment you

01:02:44.319 --> 01:02:45.760
went on stage like knowing all this [ __ ]

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:49.039
is happening places went

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.559
it was the biggest story at the time so

01:02:52.559 --> 01:02:54.319
everyone in the room was like it was my

01:02:54.319 --> 01:02:55.359
first

01:02:55.359 --> 01:02:56.720
the only time i've ever experienced like

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.480
what it must be like famous and do stand

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.060
up as like a drop

01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:01.599
[Laughter]

01:03:01.599 --> 01:03:02.160
then in

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.839
time it's funny because after time

01:03:03.839 --> 01:03:06.079
everybody forgets what happened yeah did

01:03:06.079 --> 01:03:08.480
you address it yeah that's all i talked

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:10.319
about i mean it was the it was happening

01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:13.839
yeah yeah while i was on stage [ __ ] yeah

01:03:13.839 --> 01:03:16.480
and it happened and it lasted for months

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.079
yeah how long before they fired you how

01:03:18.079 --> 01:03:20.319
many days was it four maybe

01:03:20.319 --> 01:03:22.480
and so what was the decision like how

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.480
did they explain it

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.799
uh i knew i knew it was i was the one

01:03:26.799 --> 01:03:28.480
that was like you guys are gonna find

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:29.760
like it's okay

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.240
i get it i'm not i wasn't even like [ __ ]

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:34.000
them i should have my job i was like i

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.640
get it i said something [ __ ] up this

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.720
is a corporation

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.440
it's snl you can't yeah i i underst now

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.799
if it wasn't me i'd probably be

01:03:42.799 --> 01:03:44.960
defending me of course but because it

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.400
was me i was like

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.799
i said it whatever

01:03:48.799 --> 01:03:51.920
keep making your [ __ ] show yeah

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.880
i don't know i don't know how to

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.400
describe it

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.599
it's weird

01:03:57.599 --> 01:03:59.280
it's weird defending yourself i don't

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:03.520
know maybe i gotta improve my self-worth

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:04.799
no

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:07.599
you know i think ultimately

01:04:07.599 --> 01:04:10.000
look life is filled with these weird

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
trials and moments of revelation and

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.200
ways you understand things and the best

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.680
way to understand consequences is to

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:22.319
really have a moment where the walls

01:04:22.319 --> 01:04:24.160
come tumbling down

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.039
and

01:04:25.039 --> 01:04:26.400
when you come out on the other end and

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.680
you don't think you're ever going to

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:28.799
because there had to be times where you

01:04:28.799 --> 01:04:29.680
didn't think you were going to come out

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:32.079
on the other end yeah but when you do

01:04:32.079 --> 01:04:33.599
it's like there's a

01:04:33.599 --> 01:04:35.760
feeling of levity it's lifted off for

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:37.200
sure

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.960
for sure yeah

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.720
it's also the

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.640
the embracing of the importance of

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:45.119
stand-up comedy like with the real

01:04:45.119 --> 01:04:46.160
raw

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:48.160
night club stand up oh that was the best

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.119
that was

01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:51.760
there's been two times i've like loved

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.680
stand-up comedy one was i went through a

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.240
breakup after a long time and i was

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.920
[ __ ] devastated i dated this girl for

01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.839
like six years and then i went and did

01:04:59.839 --> 01:05:01.200
stand up that night and like almost

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.039
cried again just because it was the

01:05:03.039 --> 01:05:05.039
first time i was happy oh after going

01:05:05.039 --> 01:05:06.559
through a breakup and i was like damn i

01:05:06.559 --> 01:05:09.200
love this same thing with that

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.960
like while you're getting [ __ ]

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.559
crushed by everybody you can go out and

01:05:12.559 --> 01:05:14.799
do stand-up and people like ah it's like

01:05:14.799 --> 01:05:16.640
you guys like me yeah everyone else

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.880
hates me it's a wild art form man it's

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.440
fun it's so it's so fun to just to watch

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.359
still i've been doing it for more than

01:05:23.359 --> 01:05:25.359
30 years and someone goes up and kills i

01:05:25.359 --> 01:05:27.839
have a great time i'm loving it

01:05:27.839 --> 01:05:30.000
yeah it's another best thing to watch so

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.760
much better than someone killing no

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.359
there's nothing better nothing better

01:05:33.359 --> 01:05:35.359
when you don't know their material too

01:05:35.359 --> 01:05:36.799
yeah never seen him before and they're

01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:38.799
just lighting a room on fire with really

01:05:38.799 --> 01:05:41.119
interesting [ __ ] yeah

01:05:41.119 --> 01:05:44.079
yeah it's um it's better man it is

01:05:44.079 --> 01:05:45.760
because like if you're contained inside

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.760
that satellite live structure no

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:50.400
disrespect to anybody that is but you're

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.000
you're not as free you're you're going

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.760
to be more reserved you're going to

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:56.240
definitely hold back definitely

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.920
yeah there's that for sure i think i

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.440
would have done well though

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:00.880
that's what on the show you would have

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.400
killed it i think that's what bothers me

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.480
the most because people like to

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:05.920
here's one thing that i noticed that

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.400
people that do the canceling or attack

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.920
people on twitter however you [ __ ]

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:13.280
want to call it uh they like to like

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.039
vindicate themselves by being like no

01:06:15.039 --> 01:06:17.440
one gets canceled they love saying that

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.720
what does that mean they're always like

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.720
cancer culture's not real

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.400
it's like

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.400
of course it's real i mean i lost i lost

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.760
my job

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:28.640
yeah what does that mean but

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.520
they

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.720
they like to be like nah you're doing

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.559
better now he's better now

01:06:32.559 --> 01:06:33.760
it's like you're the one who got me you

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.440
can't [ __ ] someone over like that and

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:37.599
then be like that you're fine

01:06:37.599 --> 01:06:39.200
well it's like a real big brother thing

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:41.200
you were like yeah you know like stop

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.480
crying

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.440
yeah

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:44.960
uh

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.559
and they like to say like snl couldn't

01:06:46.559 --> 01:06:47.920
have used me or wouldn't have used me

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:48.960
they would be like yeah he would have

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.640
been a waste on there anyway

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.079
so i think i could have been good you

01:06:52.079 --> 01:06:53.920
would have been great yeah but you would

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:55.200
have never had the kind of freedom that

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:57.440
you are doing your sketch show now that

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.280

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:12.319
anywhere yeah and it's better than

01:07:12.319 --> 01:07:14.880
anything snl is doing that's a fact it's

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:18.400

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:34.719
like it's very like they're fans of this

01:08:34.719 --> 01:08:36.080
one person because they've seen her

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.640

thing launched on only fans how that

01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.199
would have went down right if they just

01:08:57.199 --> 01:08:59.440
started just banging yeah on only fans

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.920
just releasing videos yeah

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.440
a lot of a lot of girls got into only

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:04.640
fence during

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.920
well it's a great way to make money but

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:07.199
the problem is you get addicted to that

01:09:07.199 --> 01:09:08.560
money you know if you're making a

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:09.920
hundred thousand dollars a month and

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.279
then you go you know what i really want

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:12.640
a family someday and i gotta stop

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:16.239
showing my cooter you know yeah and then

01:09:16.239 --> 01:09:18.560
you get off of it and you know you

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.359
realize you got a 4 000 a month condo

01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:22.719
and you're like what am i doing here

01:09:22.719 --> 01:09:24.400
yeah i got to show my [ __ ] yeah i got

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:26.080
to show my [ __ ] to pay for this [ __ ]

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.839
lexus i bought

01:09:27.839 --> 01:09:29.600
you know it gets weird because you can

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:32.560
get imprisoned by by bills or your

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.159
lifestyle and if you have that kind of

01:09:34.159 --> 01:09:35.279
lifestyle

01:09:35.279 --> 01:09:37.279
it's super hard for someone to give up

01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:38.560
that kind of money because that's like

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.560
way more than porn money

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.319
you know porn star like unless you're

01:09:42.319 --> 01:09:44.719
like top of the food chain porn gal yeah

01:09:44.719 --> 01:09:46.560
you're not making that kind of loot

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:48.560
yeah porn stars are pretty exploited

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.560
well they're doing the only fans now too

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.480
good for them that's actually nice

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.839
that's good but they're not just

01:09:53.839 --> 01:09:55.120
exploited like they're in a weird

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:58.320
situation now where no one buys dvds

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.239
anymore right so that was where they

01:10:00.239 --> 01:10:01.679
made the most money one of my neighbors

01:10:01.679 --> 01:10:02.960
back when i lived in california there's

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:05.040
a guy that i did jiu jitsu with he was

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.640
like two houses down from me he was a

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.239
big porn producer

01:10:08.239 --> 01:10:09.840
he was a crazy dude

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.679
really crazy guy he's always coked up

01:10:11.679 --> 01:10:12.640
and

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:15.360
you know yeah yeah he um

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.760
he he was doing great balling making

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.600
videos you know and he and he would tell

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.360
me like the real money's in producing

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:22.719
you know and then yeah

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:25.360
then the [ __ ] internet comes along

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.440
and just pulled

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:28.960
pulled the rug out from underneath that

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:31.199
business and everybody was just getting

01:10:31.199 --> 01:10:34.000
porn for free yeah and so like they went

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.520
from making millions and millions of

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:39.440
dollars every year to nothing

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.280
he lost his hair what did they do his

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.280
house got repossessed

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:46.239
really yep yeah he lost his house

01:10:46.239 --> 01:10:47.920
he uh

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.600
moved out of the neighborhood they

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:52.080
eventually foreclosed on his house

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:56.000
and uh yeah it just was a wave of things

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.800
falling apart and i mean i think the

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:01.040
only people that can make any money are

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.440
the girls the guys make very little

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:05.760
money because oh the actors

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.880
the male actors

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.960
yes those guys they they can't make much

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:12.880
money at all it's hard unless they're

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:15.040
very yeah of course very industrious and

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.159
they figure out some sort of

01:11:16.159 --> 01:11:18.080
subscription only pam they only [ __ ] all

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.679
the hottest girls and yeah

01:11:22.239 --> 01:11:25.040
i'd love to add to this

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.400
it's a weird world

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:27.760
because um

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:29.840
a lot of people beat off

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:32.480
but a lot of people like to lie about it

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.159
yeah it's a weird world i've been up

01:11:34.159 --> 01:11:35.840
here before ari got here i was just up

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:38.480
in tim's mansion in the hills alone just

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:41.679
beating off up in the mountains nice

01:11:41.679 --> 01:11:42.640
it's good

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.239
beating up is good i'm glad we do it

01:11:44.239 --> 01:11:46.080
beating off up in the hills changes

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.400
people's uh feelings about things you

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.239
beat off it relaxes you oh dude i'll

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:52.239
start dm and they're like texting girls

01:11:52.239 --> 01:11:55.040
or something just one

01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.120
jerk off first then think about about

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.960
keys to life like if you're thinking

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.640
about doing something just jerk off and

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.640
then look at it because a lot of times

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.800
your perspective is marred by this

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:09.360
desire to breed yeah and you don't

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.120
really like the person that you're going

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.520
to call yeah you're not really like

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:15.440
socially compatible with them

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.360
but you want to [ __ ] them yeah and then

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:20.320
you jerk off and you go

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:23.120
like if a guy jerk saw the bit was

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.640
basically that if guy jerks off and

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.800
still calls you he [ __ ] loves you

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:29.280
yeah like that's real

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:30.480
he loves you

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.800
yeah not just the opportunity to not

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.960
coming yeah

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:37.360
sudden it's so embarrassing when you're

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.960
a young man and you don't understand it

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.800
like i remember being like 18 and 19

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.199
being so confused because i was like i

01:12:43.199 --> 01:12:45.360
was really into a girl and then i'd have

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.679
an orgasm and i was really not into her

01:12:47.679 --> 01:12:50.560
yeah like really quickly and some girls

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:54.159
would think that like oh he's an [ __ ]

01:12:54.159 --> 01:12:55.840
he tricked me into thinking he liked me

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.840
like no i tricked me too yeah i loved

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.800
you

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:01.280
i [ __ ] loved you so much

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:03.040
please leave

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.560
please i need to be alone i bet they

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.000
feel the same way too now i think

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.880
they're oh yeah maybe after they yeah

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.560

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:25.840
because they want you to raise the

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.520
children with them yeah it's like it's

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:29.520
weird primal instincts man yeah of

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:31.840

all those things like they can do you

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:24.880
good they don't don't get me wrong but

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:27.120
they're basically like bridges that'll

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.800
fall apart in the middle of your journey

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:30.960
across the river yeah they they you

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.280
can't count on them no they turn on you

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.520
yes the moment they have to they'll turn

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:38.080
on yeah and they will that's okay though

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.159
as long as comedy doesn't yeah you know

01:15:40.159 --> 01:15:41.679
comedy is the only thing that we can all

01:15:41.679 --> 01:15:42.640
count on

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:45.280
comedians and and audience members that

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.920
love comedy and there's a lot of people

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:49.840
outside of that world that will try to

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:50.880
change

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.560
the the true meaning of what you're

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:54.000
saying and try to pretend that you're

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.600
being serious and try to pretend you're

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.199
a bad person or to try to pretend that

01:15:57.199 --> 01:15:59.199
it doesn't matter and you should never

01:15:59.199 --> 01:16:00.960
be able to say those things again

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:02.880
you're a racist or a sexist or a

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.120
homophobe or this or that like

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:07.840
you guys can all eat [ __ ] you can all

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.679
eat [ __ ] because you know what you're

01:16:09.679 --> 01:16:11.199
doing and it's not it doesn't work

01:16:11.199 --> 01:16:13.360
anymore yeah the thing about this whole

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.679
climate this over sensitive climate is

01:16:15.679 --> 01:16:17.360
that people are fed up with it yeah and

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.520
so there's a massive rebound when

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:21.040
someone gets through on the other end

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:22.080
yeah

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.520
yeah people are definitely everybody's

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:25.760
tired of it yeah every day yeah it's

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:27.600
every day but there's still people that

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.600
that is their currency that's what they

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.199
trade in so they're still trying to

01:16:31.199 --> 01:16:33.360
cancel people all the time and with a

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:34.640
lot of in one of the things that tim

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.800
said and then i became friends with tim

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:39.040
after he wrote something really

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:41.520
insightful about comics that were coming

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:43.440
out against louie he said one thing that

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:44.960
they have in common is they're all

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:47.440
really mediocre and they love the fact

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:49.600
that this brilliant guy is being taken

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:52.560
out so it it moves them up the ladder

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:53.920
and they're they're trying to gain

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:57.360
social clout by attacking him that's 100

01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:00.000
and the louis thing was everybody knew

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.040
that

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:04.080
everybody knew that story about louie in

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:06.320
comedy oh yeah before that that it

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.679
dropped yeah i knew before the news

01:17:07.679 --> 01:17:09.440
broke i knew about i was an open miker

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:11.360
in philly well i knew that he used to

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.760
ask sarah silverman and he would jerk

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:15.360
off and she would say yes yes he would

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:16.960
jerk and they would laugh about it we

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:19.199
heard the stories and then so everybody

01:17:19.199 --> 01:17:21.520
knew it again i knew it i was of open

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:23.199
micro in philly yeah i had heard about

01:17:23.199 --> 01:17:24.880
it i didn't know it right

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.640
and then as soon as it becomes in the

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.960
news now every comedian wants to speak

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:30.400
out against it

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.080
he's like where were you right when you

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.760
heard about it i heard about it right

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:36.000
they well they they were scared when lou

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.239
is on top that you know if they came

01:17:38.239 --> 01:17:40.239
after him then everybody else would

01:17:40.239 --> 01:17:44.080
take out them to try to you know

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:45.920
make louie happy if louis didn't get

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:47.600
taken out but once once it was clear

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:50.239
that louie was hit yeah we did you know

01:17:50.239 --> 01:17:52.560
you ever see what happens with uh

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.640
buffaloes when they get attacked by a

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:57.520
lion it's really interesting

01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:59.120
when there's a video of these water

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:00.960
buffalos get attacked by a lion one

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:03.600
water buffalo gets attacked and finally

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:05.679
manages to get free of these lions

01:18:05.679 --> 01:18:07.760
they're fighting off these lions finally

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:09.520
managed to get three free and as he's

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:11.520
moving around another water buffalo

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.840
comes along and slams into him and

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:15.520
knocks him over and then the lions get

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:16.239
him

01:18:16.239 --> 01:18:19.120
and i'm like that is comedy that's

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:22.560
nature that's humans that's just biology

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:25.440
when when someone senses weakness the

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:26.560
really

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:29.360
the really shitty people amongst them

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:31.679
those people attack

01:18:31.679 --> 01:18:33.360
it's pretty funny that buffalo did that

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:35.840
yeah it's funny the video is funny

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:37.280
because you watch him like look at that

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.440
contest gonna get out of this oh man he

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:41.520
got his friend comes along rams into him

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:44.239
and knocks him over i watch those videos

01:18:44.239 --> 01:18:46.480
how i mean just stand up for yourselves

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:50.080
water buffalos they try everyone swears

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:52.480
but there's so many of them yeah

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:54.560
there's a place in africa there's an

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:56.640
amazing documentary called relentless

01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:59.360
enemies and uh in this documentary

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.000
there's a strange part of africa where

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.800
the river shifted and when the river

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:07.600
shifted these lions and these water

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:10.239
buffalo got stranded on an island and

01:19:10.239 --> 01:19:13.280
it's a large island but it's only filled

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:16.080
with water buffalo and lions yeah and so

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:19.679
because the lions can only hunt buffalo

01:19:19.679 --> 01:19:21.800
they all grew bigger so they have

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:25.040
enormous lines like the female lines are

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.880
as big as a male line everywhere else

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:29.440
and they look they look cartoonish like

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:31.679
they have giant muscles like the hulk

01:19:31.679 --> 01:19:33.920
it's crazy because all the ones that

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:35.679
survive are ones that figure out how to

01:19:35.679 --> 01:19:37.360
attack lions yeah

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:40.000
pull up a picture of these [ __ ] lions

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.600
remember that documentary of relentless

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:44.480
enemies oh there's the kroger one yeah

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.159
is this the one where the buffalo

01:19:46.159 --> 01:19:47.520
escapes

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.920
this is where the boys finally unite

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:50.960
yeah

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.480
this is where they unite and try to take

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:53.840
out the lines it's great they start

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.440
[ __ ] them up yeah

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:57.440
well lions are so much smaller than a

01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.280
buffalo yeah and once they start

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:00.719
attacking the lions it's like that's

01:20:00.719 --> 01:20:03.679
kind of sad now not really

01:20:03.679 --> 01:20:06.080
it's how it goes

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:08.239
this is how it goes see if you can find

01:20:08.239 --> 01:20:11.280
that uh relentless enemies lions so it's

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:14.400
just a weird genetic uh

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:16.239
aberration like natural selection has

01:20:16.239 --> 01:20:18.320
taken place and these lines have gotten

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:19.679
way bigger but

01:20:19.679 --> 01:20:22.400
the thing is the female ones have these

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:25.760
[ __ ] enormous muscles man

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:27.480
like there it is the

01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:29.679
2016 women

01:20:29.679 --> 01:20:30.719
yeah

01:20:30.719 --> 01:20:34.960
there's relentless enemies full video

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.920
oh

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.920
oh just show me just give me some images

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:44.960
of the the jacked female lions anyway

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:46.960
that's the odds the idea it's a great

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.480
documentary if you're into it go check

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:50.719

that they look normal there there's

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:55.360
there's pictures of them where they look

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:57.199
[ __ ] super those young ones though

01:20:57.199 --> 01:20:58.840
that's why

01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:02.400
anyway you get it so um when do they

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.880

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.679
top of a skyscraper

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:42.239
it's all fake the entire thing's fake

01:22:42.239 --> 01:22:44.000
the people that are outraged are not

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.679
serious the people that are sorry are

01:22:45.679 --> 01:22:47.040
not serious

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:48.239
everybody that's

01:22:48.239 --> 01:22:50.000
basically everybody that has said sorry

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.080
has been like yeah i'm very sorry [ __ ]

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.840
them

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:55.920
like that's how it goes yeah and the

01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:59.920
whole time no one cares no one cares

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:02.159
it's a weird dance isn't it it's a very

01:23:02.159 --> 01:23:04.639
very weird dance so when you went over

01:23:04.639 --> 01:23:06.000
comedy like that's the thing we're

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.600
worried about right

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:10.000
well it's all it's podcast it's what it

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.360
is that's the thing that can get you in

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.560
the most trouble

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:15.040
yeah is because it it's so

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.880
free-flowing and when you're doing it

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:19.199
alongside another comedian you're just

01:23:19.199 --> 01:23:22.239
trying to make each other laugh and

01:23:22.239 --> 01:23:23.679
one of the best ways to make a comic

01:23:23.679 --> 01:23:24.800
class to say some [ __ ] you're not

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:27.120
supposed to say yeah

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:29.040
but we know it's the funniest it's the

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:33.360
only way to make a comic yeah just about

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:36.159
it's one of the ways yeah you know yeah

01:23:36.159 --> 01:23:38.960
say something [ __ ] up

01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:41.760
so

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:42.880
they

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:45.120
eventually released a statement

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.040
you know these these

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.040
things he said did not align yeah we

01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:51.440
can't yeah he's out of here yeah and

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:53.040
then did you ever have any contact with

they'll come through and yeah that's it

01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:34.320
i don't know i thought i'd be more

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.320
capable of discussing it

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:37.679
but yeah

01:24:37.679 --> 01:24:39.440
oh it's uncomfortable yeah it's it's

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:41.120
like i don't

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:43.520
i'm not too worried about it anymore i

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:44.800
don't like

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:46.320
i don't like

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:48.639
i don't know yeah

01:24:48.639 --> 01:24:50.400
does that make sense no it does make

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:51.280
sense

01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:53.120
it's um

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.080
you know

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:55.360
like i don't want to be a victim i want

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:57.199
to be a comedian yeah well i don't want

01:24:57.199 --> 01:24:59.040
to come on and do stuff where i'm like

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:00.719
yeah and then it was unfair how i was

01:25:00.719 --> 01:25:02.719
treated it's like no i get it i

01:25:02.719 --> 01:25:05.040
understand why i was treated that way i

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:07.440
said wild [ __ ] i'm gonna keep saying

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:08.880
wild [ __ ] yeah

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:10.480
nowadays there's no chance i'm gonna

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:12.960
work at nbc right so those are the rules

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:15.360
now if i want to argue

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.199
why we made these rules

01:25:17.199 --> 01:25:19.120
that's different but i understand the

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:20.080
rules

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:22.960
and i don't i'm not i wasn't

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:24.639
abiding by those rules

01:25:24.639 --> 01:25:25.600
i have

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:27.760
zero desire to do a television show now

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:29.840
but i've been offered multiple ones over

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:31.440
the last couple of years

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:34.560
um last few years and what the first

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.000
thing that i think of is like i don't

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.080
want to defend any of the [ __ ] that i

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:41.520
said in like 2009 or whatever i'm not

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:43.199
i'm not interested in doing that yeah

01:25:43.199 --> 01:25:44.880
it's like

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:47.120
if you know what i'm doing

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.800
then good and if you don't know what i'm

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:50.639
doing and you see it you're not offended

01:25:50.639 --> 01:25:52.560
all i can say is just

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.719

see this is bud light number four

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:43.199

01:26:43.199 --> 01:26:44.880
where they like listed in the

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:48.239

and they were like 88 years old

01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:57.679
and then now obviously there's nothing

01:26:57.679 --> 01:26:58.960
funny about it it's just funny that

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:00.560

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:01.920
heard so i was like there's nothing

01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:04.320
funny about that but it's it yeah just

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.719
two old ladies like who's at the door

01:27:06.719 --> 01:27:07.840

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:10.560
[ __ ] devil

01:27:10.639 --> 01:27:12.880
see i i hear stuff like that and i just

01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:15.199
it's terrifying that guy

01:27:15.199 --> 01:27:16.080
that's

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:17.679
his ending was funny he went through

01:27:17.679 --> 01:27:19.040
like a mexican neighborhood and they all

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:20.400
started beating the [ __ ] out of him and

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:21.520
turned him in

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.719
yeah but they didn't kill him

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:28.239
is he dead now yeah he died in prison oh

01:27:28.239 --> 01:27:29.760
yeah oh that was the worst part of the

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:31.280
documentary yeah at the end it's like

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:33.760
yeah he died uh he had a long life and

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.520
died of like cancer yeah i think he died

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.320
again

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:37.440
yeah

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.719
yeah

01:27:38.719 --> 01:27:40.880
well he was broken you know

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:42.159
there's a lot of different people out

01:27:42.159 --> 01:27:44.320
there definitely

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:45.600
the crazy thing is things like the

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:48.000
zodiac killer like guys that get away

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.960
with it yeah like leave notes and get

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:52.239
away i think there was a new

01:27:52.239 --> 01:27:54.880
breakthrough very recently on the zodiac

01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:56.320
killer they think they know who it is

01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:57.199
now

01:27:57.199 --> 01:27:58.719
but they've done that like 10 times i

01:27:58.719 --> 01:28:00.159
think they know who it is yeah wasn't it

01:28:00.159 --> 01:28:03.440
uh ted cruz's dead

01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:05.520
ted cruz

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:07.040
that was in trouble i think it was ted

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:08.639
cruz didn't trump say his dad killed

01:28:08.639 --> 01:28:10.639
canada yeah

01:28:10.639 --> 01:28:12.800
he's ruthless and then ted cruz is out

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:14.719
there [ __ ] carrying water for him

01:28:14.719 --> 01:28:16.639
after that

01:28:16.639 --> 01:28:17.920
he said

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:20.960
that's about to do a trouble

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:22.960
good

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:25.199
don't be scared

01:28:25.199 --> 01:28:26.400
yeah

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:27.600
so

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:30.400
when did it relax for you well you felt

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:32.560
everything's okay again

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.239
um

01:28:34.239 --> 01:28:36.239
i mean what you felt it was like five or

01:28:36.239 --> 01:28:38.639
six months after i got like canceled

01:28:38.639 --> 01:28:40.320
kovitz started

01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:41.679
so that's kind of when everything i mean

01:28:41.679 --> 01:28:43.679
everything's shut down so it was like

01:28:43.679 --> 01:28:45.360
that helped ari as well we got bigger

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:48.639
fish to fry right yeah yeah for sure

01:28:48.639 --> 01:28:51.280
so that was it it just sucked like

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:53.040
it was kind of inconvenient timing for

01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:54.560
me because i would have liked to have

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:57.440
kept going you know i mean like not stop

01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:59.360
at all but then it did look like i got

01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:01.760
canceled and stopped because because

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:03.840
covet you know i couldn't

01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:05.920

yeah how do we get to that uh matt and

01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:22.159
shane's secret podcast patreon oh google

how many downloads you guys getting on a

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:26.960
regular basis i'm not sure

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:28.800
i don't look that up yeah good good for

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:30.960
you now yeah smart

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.800
yeah i didn't know until it's too late

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.320
oh really i wasn't paying attention till

01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.639
it got really big and i was like oh no

01:29:36.639 --> 01:29:38.480
yeah now you gotta like

01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:40.480
now you gotta worry about what you say

01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:42.000
or like or at least not worry about it

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:42.960
but you know what i mean literally you

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:44.000
gotta be like

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.880
i'm i'm joking this isn't real

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:49.360
because people you know you also have to

01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:51.360
establish a relationship with your

01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:52.960
audience where they understand who you

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:53.679
are

01:29:53.679 --> 01:29:55.280
and they know that if even if you say

01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:56.639
wild [ __ ] you're saying why because

01:29:56.639 --> 01:29:59.120
you're being silly yeah but i think it

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:00.960
gets so big that like

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:02.320
you lose the

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:03.920
relationship with people

01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:05.840
and people join yeah but then then i'm

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:07.360
saying outsiders will jump in and be

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.360
like what did he say that's okay you

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:10.080
know

01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:11.360
that's okay

01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:12.960
it's it's worth it

01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.960
it's all worth it to be able to have

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:16.800
something like for me

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:18.560
to be able to have something where you

01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:19.520
can

01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:20.800
talk

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:23.760
i would do this podcast exactly this way

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:25.600
if i was just starting out and no one

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.920
knew who i was yeah and there was just a

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.679
hundred people listening yeah i would do

01:30:29.679 --> 01:30:31.360
it exactly the same way

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.840
and you can it can be done that way but

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.840
you got to take your lumps yeah they'll

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:37.120
come for you

01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:39.840
and when they come for you just go

01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:42.800
yeah this is crazy huh yeah i just keep

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:44.719
going i was dude i was taking the

01:30:44.719 --> 01:30:47.840
[ __ ] subway home while getting

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:50.880
i would go to like 30 rock and like

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.639
meet with lauren and they're like we're

01:30:52.639 --> 01:30:54.480
gonna be all right like all that then i

01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:56.400
would get on the train huh and everybody

01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:58.080
it was number one on twitter so people

01:30:58.080 --> 01:30:59.520
were just like looking at their phone

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:02.239
looking at me just sitting there like

01:31:02.239 --> 01:31:05.840
i literally watched people go like this

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.840
like just staring at me i'd be sitting

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:09.199
there

01:31:09.199 --> 01:31:11.199
i'd go like this

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:13.040
what did they say it's me did you have

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:14.480
conversations i've had a couple yeah i

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.040
had a couple and everyone was like

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:19.040
every normal person is like yo this is

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:22.320
crazy yeah well people understand people

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:23.920
inherently but when people try to

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:27.040
pretend they don't and try to reduce you

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:28.880
to the worst thing you've ever said and

01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:31.679
this is you this is evidence of you

01:31:31.679 --> 01:31:33.440
they're all failures that's the crazy

01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:35.679
thing the people that want to do that

01:31:35.679 --> 01:31:37.360
most of them

01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:39.520
they want to be a comic or they were

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:41.760
failed performer they're either a failed

01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:44.000
comic or a failed writer there's

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.480
something wrong yeah most critics are

01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:49.199
critics because they don't have anything

01:31:49.199 --> 01:31:51.440
to contribute yeah they don't have like

01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:53.120
do you think stephen king wants to be a

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:54.880
critic right yes

01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:56.560
did great writers want to be critics no

01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:58.639
they want to be writers they want to put

01:31:58.639 --> 01:32:01.840
out art they want to like explore the

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.920
boundaries of their creativity and their

01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:06.639
discipline to bring that creativity into

01:32:06.639 --> 01:32:08.239
a tangible form where other people can

01:32:08.239 --> 01:32:10.159
absorb it and appreciate it and enjoy it

01:32:10.159 --> 01:32:12.320
and if you can't do that you criticize

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:13.600
and that's actually

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:15.440
a good point because

01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:17.760
before so like while i was an open mic

01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:18.960
or in philly

01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:20.800
i was criticizing because i wasn't

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:22.639
creating anything good so i would sit

01:32:22.639 --> 01:32:24.400
there i'd be like this person sucks this

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:25.679
comic sucks

01:32:25.679 --> 01:32:28.560
[ __ ] them yup [ __ ] that and then you get

01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:30.400
you get you start to get good at stand

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:32.080
up you start to [ __ ] meet these

01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:34.400
people that you just [ __ ] on yeah and

01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:35.600
you're like what the [ __ ] was i doing

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:37.440
why the [ __ ] was it so it's almost the

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:39.679
same thing where like

01:32:39.679 --> 01:32:41.280
while you're in that little incubation

01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:42.800
period of like being an open mind i was

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:44.480
miserable i was like [ __ ] these people

01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:46.000
that person sucks

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
they suck everybody sucks

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.800
dude i'm good that thing i had the exact

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:52.000
same

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.400
experiences when i was coming up because

01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:56.880
there was i was super hyper critical of

01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:58.400
other people yeah but it was because i

01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:00.880
wasn't doing well exactly yeah and i

01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:02.639
remember uh

01:33:02.639 --> 01:33:04.880
i had a bit about jenny mccarthy and

01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:06.800
then i met her and she was so nice oh

01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:08.400
what a bummer that adam's and i had to

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:10.880
drop the bed it was just a bit it was i

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:12.159
mean it wasn't the meanest bit in the

01:33:12.159 --> 01:33:14.000
world it was a bit about her uh i read

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.440
that she was getting her breast implants

01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:17.760
removed and i go that's like tiger woods

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:20.080
chopping his [ __ ] arms off i go put

01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:21.760
him back in and make him bigger and no

01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:24.239
talking

01:33:24.639 --> 01:33:26.320
i go you're not famous because you're

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:27.520
you're gonna what are you gonna go do

01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:29.120
shakespeare in the bible you're mine

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:31.679
you're hot you think we like your mind

01:33:31.679 --> 01:33:33.840
but it was just mean and then i met her

01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:36.560
and she's so friendly [ __ ] happened to

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:37.280
me

01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:39.520
like crazy every comedian i'd be like

01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:42.320
this person special sucks and then i

01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:44.560
meet them then i'd see them do stand up

01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:46.159
be like [ __ ] they're so much better than

01:33:46.159 --> 01:33:48.239
me they're so good

01:33:48.239 --> 01:33:49.360
you know what i mean the thing about

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:52.320
specials is everyone's special is 60 to

01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:55.040
70 less funny than how they actually are

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:57.679
live there's no way around that because

01:33:57.679 --> 01:34:00.400
the experience of being there live is

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:02.480
magic and i say this as an audience

01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:04.400
member like i watched chappelle

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:06.159
this week we did these two shows in

01:34:06.159 --> 01:34:07.840
vegas and chappelle has this bit i don't

01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:08.960
want to give it away because it's so

01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:10.960
good but this is bit about the metoo

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:11.920
movement

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:13.040
it had me

01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:15.520
crying like tears rolling down my eyes

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:17.920
i'm holding my sides like if you see

01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.880
this live it's so good and i was like

01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:22.880
being like there's a special thing in

01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:25.679
the air when you see a comic live and

01:34:25.679 --> 01:34:28.400
you get a lot of that through a special

01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:30.480
like i said 60 to 70 percent you don't

01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:31.600
get 100

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:33.840
no you don't get 100 no and you're also

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:35.440
tense when you're doing a special like

01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:37.360
especially like

01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:39.040
you did this special this uh past

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:41.360
weekend last weekend yeah and

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:42.800
i was super bummed out when i heard that

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:45.360
you only got to film one night yeah i

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:47.679
like two nights i do two nights and i do

01:34:47.679 --> 01:34:49.600
four shows because that way i'm loose

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:52.320
because i know i have four shows

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:54.080
one of these are gonna be great and but

01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:56.239
you also feel better on the first show

01:34:56.239 --> 01:34:57.760
like my last special that i did that i

01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:00.080
filmed in boston most of it was from the

01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:03.199
first show the reason why i did a couple

01:35:03.199 --> 01:35:05.520
of extra bits in other shows that i i

01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:07.360
figured out a way to sandwich in because

01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:09.199
i forgot to do this on that first show

01:35:09.199 --> 01:35:10.719
it's the only reason why i put anything

01:35:10.719 --> 01:35:12.960
in from other shows because the first

01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:14.719
show i was super loose because i knew i

01:35:14.719 --> 01:35:17.199
had four shows yeah but saw my specials

01:35:17.199 --> 01:35:19.520
before that i only had two shows and you

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:21.280
go out there for those two show specials

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:23.679
like boy i got lucky saturday early i

01:35:23.679 --> 01:35:24.960
did well

01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:28.080
if i hadn't saturday late show sucked if

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:28.719
i

01:35:28.719 --> 01:35:30.960
if those had reversed like if my first

01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:32.320
show sucked

01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:34.080
oh the confidence i would have just been

01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:36.320
on stage just like what the [ __ ] one of

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:38.560
my biggest specials i did was in 2014

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:41.520
for comedy central and a lady heckled me

01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:45.679
during my first my first session

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:47.760
it was such a dumb heckle too she's like

01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:49.920
prove it and i was like oh my god you're

01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:50.560
in

01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:52.560
she she also didn't understand what i

01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:54.960
was doing like i was i was going

01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:56.880
the bit was about the guy that broke

01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:58.239
into the white house

01:35:58.239 --> 01:35:59.600
i remember that that wasn't a bit that

01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:00.960
was that was the second special was

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:02.960
another bid because that was a that was

01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:03.800
my

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:06.639
2016 special that was triggered

01:36:06.639 --> 01:36:09.040
but whatever the bit was this this was a

01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:11.280
setup and it eventually made men look

01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:13.679
really stupid but the beginning was like

01:36:13.679 --> 01:36:16.880
like hey where are you going with this

01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:18.560
oh it happened it happened to me this

01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:20.719
weekend i was doing a trump joke and i

01:36:20.719 --> 01:36:22.159
started the trump joke and she was like

01:36:22.159 --> 01:36:24.639
we hate trump here i was like do you

01:36:24.639 --> 01:36:26.800
hear what i'm saying right like do you

01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:28.159
think i'm gonna do a special where i go

01:36:28.159 --> 01:36:30.480
on stage and i'm like i loved our last

01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:31.600
president

01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:33.440
like what type of psycho would that you

01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:34.239
know

01:36:34.239 --> 01:36:35.679
right it's not funny i'm not gonna go on

01:36:35.679 --> 01:36:37.440
stage i support the government right

01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:40.000
just let the fit play outside listen to

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.600
me yeah but people are just wanting

01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:43.119
their voice to be heard and they're not

01:36:43.119 --> 01:36:44.560
taking into consideration that you're

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:46.400
filming something you know and if you

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.920
are they want to be the one who gets it

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:50.239
on on recording yeah as if as if we're

01:36:50.239 --> 01:36:54.000
going to keep it yeah well

01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:57.840
you let me learn yeah yeah but filming

01:36:57.840 --> 01:36:59.280
specials is a [ __ ] harrowing

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:00.880
experience because it was the only one i

01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:01.600
did

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:02.960
it got done

01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:05.199
and sat in tim's house by my all my

01:37:05.199 --> 01:37:07.280
friends went back to philly in new york

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:09.040
i stayed in tim's house by myself for

01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:11.920
like two days i was like damn i'm sad

01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:13.360
why is this like a depressing feeling i

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.040
don't know i never felt so special yeah

01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:16.080
oh this is your first special was the

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:18.159
only thing i've ever been doing now

01:37:18.159 --> 01:37:20.400
it's like 10 years eight years that's

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:23.360
around the time to do it yeah yeah

01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:24.800
and it's an uncomfortable feeling when

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:25.920
you're done

01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:27.520
could i have done better

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:29.119
stuff like that you know

01:37:29.119 --> 01:37:30.880
are you happy with it i don't know i

01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:34.400
haven't seen it i probably won't like it

01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:35.440
i don't know if you had a chance to do

01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:36.880
it again you know like uh whitney was

01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:39.360
about to do a special and uh we were

01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:40.719
hanging out in the parking lot at the

01:37:40.719 --> 01:37:43.360
comedy store and she was like you know

01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:45.360
i'm i'm pretty i'm confident and

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:48.239
everything this but uh you know like

01:37:48.239 --> 01:37:49.520
what do you think and i said you know

01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:50.880
what i think i think you got some

01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:52.800
amazing premises that you're a [ __ ]

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:54.480
hilarious comedian

01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:56.000
and

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.480
every special that i've ever done

01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:01.199
uh there's always like six months before

01:38:01.199 --> 01:38:03.199
the special comes out or five months and

01:38:03.199 --> 01:38:05.040
during that time i'm still doing some of

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:06.880
that old material yeah and it gets

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.639
better and i'm like [ __ ] if i just

01:38:08.639 --> 01:38:10.239
waited three more months

01:38:10.239 --> 01:38:11.760
i go i think you should just wait a

01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:13.520
little because i guys see some of these

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:15.119
bits you're thinking them out while

01:38:15.119 --> 01:38:17.119
you're doing them they're not like

01:38:17.119 --> 01:38:18.239
they're not

01:38:18.239 --> 01:38:19.199
just

01:38:19.199 --> 01:38:21.679
drilled into your dna yet and sometimes

01:38:21.679 --> 01:38:24.320
bits do get they just they have a time

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:26.400
like a wine or a whiskey or something

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.920
like that there's a time where it's take

01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:29.760
it out of the barrel it's ready yeah but

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:31.679
if you take it out of the barrel early

01:38:31.679 --> 01:38:33.360
they seem clunky like

01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:34.960
i remember louie was doing a special

01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:37.600
every year yeah i think even he realized

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:39.520
like this is not the way to do it

01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:42.000
they're not ready after a year but two

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.560
years seems to be the number and maybe

01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:45.520
three

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:46.880
yeah three is even better it's tough to

01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:47.600
tell

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:50.159
you know i don't know i'll see how mine

01:38:50.159 --> 01:38:51.760
i don't know if it was good

01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:53.600
i think it was good

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:55.679
yeah i thought i thought it was it's

01:38:55.679 --> 01:38:57.119
always good to just get one out there

01:38:57.119 --> 01:38:58.960
anyway yeah i'm doing it it's on it'll

01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:00.800
probably be on youtube let's like make

01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:02.480
it myself look what norman's doing

01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:04.480
norman

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:06.800
schultz killed it on youtube yeah

01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:09.360
youtube made him it really did you know

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.199
i mean his special

01:39:11.199 --> 01:39:12.800
shots helped uh schultz helped with

01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:14.880
gillian keebs did he was like a big

01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:16.880
influence like talking to

01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:18.159
talking to the people i was trying to

01:39:18.159 --> 01:39:20.639
make it with like yes do it

01:39:20.639 --> 01:39:23.199
because a lot of people are very like

01:39:23.199 --> 01:39:26.080
you don't want to risk losing money it's

01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:27.679
like if we just put our money together

01:39:27.679 --> 01:39:29.199
and make something really good it'll pay

01:39:29.199 --> 01:39:30.880
off right maybe not right now but in

01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:33.360
five years yes it'll it'll it'll work

01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.760
right yeah and they needed to hear it

01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:37.600
from somebody who actually

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:39.520
had that happen well he's one of the

01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:42.639
most industrious of all the young cops

01:39:42.639 --> 01:39:44.480
in my opinion he's like the best guy

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:47.280
that took advantage of the um

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:49.760
the the pandemic too because he put out

01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:51.600
the heaven

01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.440
yeah tim is amazing both of them but

01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:55.360
what he did with those sideways videos

01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:57.119
like turn turn your phone sideways and

01:39:57.119 --> 01:39:59.760
then these wild rants where it's like

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:01.679
punch line punch line punch line bang

01:40:01.679 --> 01:40:03.280
bang bang which is very different than

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:04.880
his actual stand up yeah you know where

01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:07.600
his stand up is like he'll hold a laugh

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.520
he'll work the room he'll [ __ ] around a

01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:11.679
little he's super loose and relaxed but

01:40:11.679 --> 01:40:13.760
these things he had figured out a very

01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:16.320
specific rhythm that's

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:18.960
applicable for watching it on instagram

01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:21.679
oh yeah yeah genius he's yeah one of the

01:40:21.679 --> 01:40:24.719

i

01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:32.960
the anxiety over

01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:36.080

01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:41.600
reading comments for sure you think

01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:42.800
you're gonna get to a point one day

01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:44.480
where that'll be untenable and you're

01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:46.560
gonna have to just like not read it

01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:48.880
i'm getting better it comes and goes

01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:51.360
like i'll be like i won't read

01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:53.040
reddit or twitter or all that [ __ ] i

01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:55.600
read read it reddit's wild red is wild

01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:57.119
[ __ ] people are wild well that's the

01:47:57.119 --> 01:47:59.280
thing because reddit is why and it's

01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:01.679
funny though yeah when it's not me it's

01:48:01.679 --> 01:48:03.199
hilarious well

01:48:03.199 --> 01:48:05.119
reddit is filled with some of the most

01:48:05.119 --> 01:48:07.040
intelligent commenters

01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:08.960
on the internet yeah and

01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:10.320
psychopaths

01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:13.600
and idiots all mixed in together yeah

01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:16.320
but it's very self-regulated but

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:18.239
the thing that bums me out about reddit

01:48:18.239 --> 01:48:21.360
is reddit is generally uncensored right

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:23.199
generally but

01:48:23.199 --> 01:48:25.440
they took out the donald when they had

01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:28.159
that the donald uh the donald was great

01:48:28.159 --> 01:48:29.840
subs yeah

01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:31.760
they took it out but i think people were

01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:33.760
really concerned with there's a thing

01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:35.520
that was happening

01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:37.360
during the alt-right movement of like

01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:38.159
the

01:48:38.159 --> 01:48:39.080
like

01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:42.080
2015-ish somewhere around there where

01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:44.560
people were realizing like there's a lot

01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:47.520
of attention that can be

01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:50.560
gathered up by joining that movement and

01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:52.639
attacking the libs and you know and

01:48:52.639 --> 01:48:53.920
calling them [ __ ] and saying we're

01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:55.040
going to punch them in the face and all

01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:56.159
that kind of [ __ ]

01:48:56.159 --> 01:48:58.719
and it and it became like pepe the frog

01:48:58.719 --> 01:49:01.040
and pepe the frog was funny yeah

01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:03.199
it was funny it was funny i know it was

01:49:03.199 --> 01:49:05.199
funny it was funny yeah it's still funny

01:49:05.199 --> 01:49:07.280
to me it's still pretty funny i mean you

01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:09.679
know pepe the frog all of a sudden had a

01:49:09.679 --> 01:49:12.320
nazi outfit on like hey

01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:14.080
dick but that doesn't mean pepe is a

01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:16.800
nazi like the whole feels good man was

01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:20.000
funny and it was like when someone was

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.840
saying something mean you know you'd

01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:23.920
have the pepe the frog crimes

01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:26.560
yeah oh like it's funny but somehow or

01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:28.639
another it got connected to

01:49:28.639 --> 01:49:31.119
white supremacy and all this that's

01:49:31.119 --> 01:49:32.800
because they're saying the worst things

01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:35.440
you can say through they were anonymous

01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:38.080
yeah they were so

01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:39.679
this is the worst thing you could say

01:49:39.679 --> 01:49:41.440
some people were yeah and then some

01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:44.320
people exactly the right way yeah yeah

01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:45.119
yeah

01:49:45.119 --> 01:49:46.480
it's uh

01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:48.960
i mean i'm a big proponent of free

01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:51.520
speech but i'm also

01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:53.040
i understand that

01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:54.639
you know things can get out of hand with

01:49:54.639 --> 01:49:56.719
this community they did they did a

01:49:56.719 --> 01:49:58.800
couple of times yeah

01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:01.840
but do you ever see the thing with uh

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:04.400
kakistan and shia labeouf

01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:06.800
yes oh my god we talked about it

01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:08.320
that was like the beginning of it where

01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:12.320
it was like we played the radio lab uh

01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:14.320
podcast it was a radio lab podcast it

01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:17.520
was brilliant and radio lab took it down

01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:19.360
they gave into the pressure and the the

01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:21.040
podcast was about how brilliant these

01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:24.960
people were they found it yes they

01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:35.199
the location yeah so you could hear the

01:50:35.199 --> 01:50:38.239
horn honking online and that was funny

01:50:38.239 --> 01:50:40.080
it was amazing there's no denying that

01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:41.520
that was missing

01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:43.520
editorial update radio lab has decided

01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:45.599
to take down this episode some listeners

01:50:45.599 --> 01:50:47.760
called us out saying that telling the

01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:49.760
capture the flag story in the way that

01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:52.159
we did we essentially condone some

01:50:52.159 --> 01:50:54.400
pretty despicable ideology behavior do

01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:56.080
you think we just essentially don't yes

01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:58.480
we did i condone that to all listeners

01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:00.639
who felt that way and to everyone else

01:51:00.639 --> 01:51:02.880
please know that we hear you and then we

01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:05.840
take these criticisms to heart i feel

01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:08.000
awful that the things we said could be

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.040
interpreted that way that's on us it was

01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:12.800
certainly not our intention and we

01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:15.440
apologize

01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:20.320
come on nonsense you're reporting on a

01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:21.920
fascinating thing that happened on the

01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:23.280
investigation where a pretty

01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:25.280
preposterous actor who's really

01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:27.599
ridiculous he will not divide us yeah he

01:51:27.599 --> 01:51:29.440
will not define he's freaking out yeah

01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:32.159
and he puts up this flag

01:51:32.159 --> 01:51:33.679
and uh

01:51:33.679 --> 01:51:35.679
they found the flag they found the

01:51:35.679 --> 01:51:37.520
camera like that's just what the

01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:40.000
internet does yeah it's it's beautiful

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.400
in that way yeah and what they said they

01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:43.760
didn't condone anything they're

01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:45.119
reporting on

01:51:45.119 --> 01:51:48.080
people smart enough to figure out where

01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:49.840
the location of this thing is based on

01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:52.560
the goddamn stars in the sky yeah and

01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:54.880
tracking flights and see yeah i mean

01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:56.320
for those of you who don't remember this

01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:59.040
yeah there was just one part shyla shaya

01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:00.880
moved his flag to just in the middle of

01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:02.800
tennessee with like an upward camera

01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:04.560
angle at a flag

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:06.000
and they just looked at the sky in the

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.440
background and figured it out what did

01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:09.440
the flag say on it i think he will not

01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:10.719
divide us yeah

01:52:10.719 --> 01:52:12.159
that was it

01:52:12.159 --> 01:52:13.920
yeah he will not divide it this is this

01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:15.679
is the flag and it was funny because

01:52:15.679 --> 01:52:16.880
they were all like

01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:18.560
weaponizing autism that's what they were

01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:19.920
saying they were doing they were like he

01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:22.400
has no idea the power of autism just

01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:23.760
guys

01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:26.320
dudes in their basement

01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:28.239

is owned by a corporation that's what it

01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:33.280
is well that's it yeah it's absolutely

01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:35.040
that's again back to the snl thing

01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:36.239

01:52:36.239 --> 01:52:37.520

01:52:48.159 --> 01:52:49.679
i would say

01:52:49.679 --> 01:52:51.520
right before this podcast gets released

put that away before someone gets hurt

01:53:32.159 --> 01:53:33.520
this is a neighborhood to get those

01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:35.360
[ __ ] out of here

01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:36.960
comedy's incompatible with the corporate

01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:39.360
environment it just is the of course

01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:40.719
of course you know that's why i was

01:53:40.719 --> 01:53:43.280
saying that you know

01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:44.639
the one of the best things about all

01:53:44.639 --> 01:53:46.639
these things is you appreciate comedy

01:53:46.639 --> 01:53:48.719
you appreciate stand up you appreciate

01:53:48.719 --> 01:53:50.159
what it takes to do stand up it's a

01:53:50.159 --> 01:53:52.840
[ __ ] wild wild art form

01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:56.320
yeah yeah i like it there's not that

01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:58.960
many of us

01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:01.360
no there's none

01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:02.480
no

01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:04.080
it's more neurosurgeons than there are

01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:06.639
stand ups

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:09.040
is that true that can't be true

01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:10.800
guarantee is true well what do you mean

01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:12.480
yeah

01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:13.760
people with stand ups in their twitter

01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:14.800
bio

01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:15.599
no

01:54:15.599 --> 01:54:17.280
no not those people yeah there's a lot

01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:18.800
of people that claim to be stand-ups but

01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:20.880
yeah someone paid to see you yeah

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:22.400
someone willing to pay to see you it

01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:24.080
takes a while to get there yeah it's

01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:25.280
like you were saying that you're 10

01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:26.719
years in you're doing your first special

01:54:26.719 --> 01:54:28.639
i'm like that's about right that's

01:54:28.639 --> 01:54:30.800
because it's a it really is a 10-year

01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:33.360
journey and only if you work hard

01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:35.280
the people that sort of dabble in it

01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:37.520
like that is one of these saddest things

01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:39.599
when you see like an open micro who

01:54:39.599 --> 01:54:42.560
you've seen for 12 13 years they're

01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:44.320
still an open micro yeah and they're

01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:46.800
still struggling and bombing and

01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:48.639
and they kind of go on stage once a week

01:54:48.639 --> 01:54:51.040
or something like that yeah and it's

01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:52.239
tell you what when you get canceled

01:54:52.239 --> 01:54:53.520
those are the guys coming out of the

01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:54.560
woodworks

01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:56.080
they're coming out just being like that

01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:58.080
[ __ ] was mean to me at a bar

01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:00.320
once and here's a three paragraph thing

01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:01.679
it's like i forgot about you what are

01:55:01.679 --> 01:55:03.920

01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:05.599
mean to

01:55:05.599 --> 01:55:07.360

01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:09.760

01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:12.000
yeah i was hammered you just bombed

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.280
again i saw you bomb a thousand times

01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:16.800
finally i was like

01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:18.560
i wasn't mean about it there's some

01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:19.920
people that like

01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:21.760
you want to tell them like you're

01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:23.599
probably good at something this isn't

01:55:23.599 --> 01:55:25.679
the thing i had a club owner tell me

01:55:25.679 --> 01:55:28.639

01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:39.920
they get mad if you crash a wedding

01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:41.760
people don't like it

01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:42.960
so they were all trying to fight us and

01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:44.400
then i had to leave to go do this show

01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:47.119
and i bombed in the hotel lobby my

01:58:47.119 --> 01:58:49.440
[ __ ] face was everywhere in the hotel

01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:51.599
the groomsmen showed up to the bar that

01:58:51.599 --> 01:58:53.280
i was performing at and they're like

01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:54.639
there's that [ __ ] while you were

01:58:54.639 --> 01:58:56.159
on stage after the show they're like

01:58:56.159 --> 01:58:57.520

01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:58.880

01:58:58.880 --> 01:59:01.440
of [ __ ] dude this guy sorry god yeah it

01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:04.320
was uh first weekend i ever did

01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:05.520
wasn't good

01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:07.440
yeah but they're never good

01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:09.920
the first weekend's a disaster

01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:12.560
that was about as bad as it could get

01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:14.400
not as not as bad as it could get but

01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:16.080
yeah how long have you been doing comedy

01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:18.719
at that point maybe four months

01:59:18.719 --> 01:59:21.280
and this is once a week maybe at best i

01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:24.320
had zero dude i had zero

01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:26.639
when did it start rolling for you

01:59:26.639 --> 01:59:28.400
i moved to philly

01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:31.040
so i lived in central pennsylvania and i

01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:32.960
was like kind of dabbling in it but

01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:34.480
there's only so much you can do you can

01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:36.719
go down what gave you the confidence

01:59:36.719 --> 01:59:38.159
what made you think that you could go to

01:59:38.159 --> 01:59:40.960
philly and make it um

01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:43.679
i i did magoobies you know magus joke

01:59:43.679 --> 01:59:45.760
house i won their new comedian of the

01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:48.800
year in 2014

01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:50.080
and then i was like all right i can do

01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:51.920
this and then i moved to philly

01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:53.280
because baltimore was kind of the

01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:54.480
closest

01:59:54.480 --> 01:59:56.960
city to from harrisburg so i'd go down

01:59:56.960 --> 01:59:58.560
to baltimore to do stand-up go to philly

01:59:58.560 --> 02:00:00.159
to do stand-up

02:00:00.159 --> 02:00:02.880
and uh yeah then i moved to philly

02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:05.840
and i i moved to philly with the only

02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:08.400
the sole intent of doing stand-up you

02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:09.360
know

02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:11.040
i didn't move that i moved there but no

02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:13.119
job none of that had you graduated from

02:00:13.119 --> 02:00:15.199
college i did so you had a degree i had

02:00:15.199 --> 02:00:17.520
a degree in history right that was good

02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:19.360
luck with you useless yeah so unless you

02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:22.320
want to be a teacher so you just decided

02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:23.920
i'm gonna go for it you give yourself a

02:00:23.920 --> 02:00:25.520
certain amount of time

02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:29.040
no i got i got fired from that state job

02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:30.880
that i was doing which was fine i was i

02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:33.520
was literally going to like

02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:37.199
in investigating like children's crimes

02:00:37.199 --> 02:00:38.320
at like

02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:40.880
state-run children's houses who is the

02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:42.639
most depressing job

02:00:42.639 --> 02:00:44.560
possible crimes against children crimes

02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:46.960
again anytime like a an orderly would

02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:48.560
subdue a child you'd have to go

02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:50.239
investigate it but then there was

02:00:50.239 --> 02:00:52.000
obviously

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:55.280
constant abuse uh

02:00:55.280 --> 02:00:57.199
it was rough but anyway it was good for

02:00:57.199 --> 02:01:00.159
stand-up yeah

02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:02.159
damn

02:01:02.159 --> 02:01:03.119
uh

02:01:03.119 --> 02:01:05.440
yeah i moved to philly did that

02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:06.800
and then finally moved to new york wait

02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:08.480

02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:10.800

i didn't work on the cars i just worked

02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:16.320

02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:21.920
after college i sold hondas have no idea

02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:23.599
how cars work at all

02:01:23.599 --> 02:01:25.360
worked at a car garage have no idea

02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:26.159
people would be like what's wrong with

02:01:26.159 --> 02:01:28.480
my car i'd be like [ __ ] uh

02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:29.760
you know the thing

02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:31.040
the rotor

02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:33.040
and so what clubs are you getting up in

02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:34.560
philly

02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:37.199
yeah it's great room

02:01:37.199 --> 02:01:38.719
is the best helium mark grossman's

02:01:38.719 --> 02:01:41.199
opening up a spot out here i heard yeah

02:01:41.199 --> 02:01:42.400
what do you think you gotta [ __ ] him up

02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:44.159
for that no i'm excited

02:01:44.159 --> 02:01:46.639
i'm gonna keep coming bring him all in

02:01:46.639 --> 02:01:48.320
when i lived in boston there was five

02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:50.639
clubs on one block

02:01:50.639 --> 02:01:52.560
it's possible yeah all you have to do is

02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:53.920
just have enough talent and there's

02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:55.760
enough talent here already

02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:58.480
and more are coming you know

02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:01.679
it's uh this is a real unusual place and

02:02:01.679 --> 02:02:03.920
i think it could be better i think i

02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:05.440
think i think this could be the hub of

02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:06.639
stand up in the country i think it's

02:02:06.639 --> 02:02:07.760
totally possible and it could be

02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:09.119
separate as i was saying before we

02:02:09.119 --> 02:02:10.239
started

02:02:10.239 --> 02:02:12.719
separate from any other

02:02:12.719 --> 02:02:14.719
showbiz institutions

02:02:14.719 --> 02:02:16.159
that are

02:02:16.159 --> 02:02:17.760
more uh

02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:20.000
hesitant to take risks

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.800
right like television and film and this

02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:25.599
is uh this is connected by

02:02:25.599 --> 02:02:29.119
it is now a mainstream network of

02:02:29.119 --> 02:02:30.480
podcasts

02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:32.159
because if you thought about like what

02:02:32.159 --> 02:02:34.320
mainstream mass media is podcasts were

02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:36.639
never thought of in that light because

02:02:36.639 --> 02:02:38.800
it's just even this room it's like this

02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:40.480
[ __ ] two of us and jamie you know

02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:41.920
it's like you would think that for

02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:43.599
something to reach millions and millions

02:02:43.599 --> 02:02:46.400
of people it has to be there's got to be

02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:48.320
more folks here of course but that

02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:50.560
that's not true anymore and because

02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:52.400
segura is here now and he's brought his

02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:54.000
podcast and his wife is here who's

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:55.040
brilliant

02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:57.199
christina positsky she's hilarious

02:02:57.199 --> 02:02:58.800
you know giannis pappas has split this

02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:00.760
time here tim is spending his time here

02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:02.400
[Music]

02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:03.840
i was here two weeks ago doing shows

02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:06.320

02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:08.480
coming down here fahim has been coming

02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:10.159

02:03:10.159 --> 02:03:12.480
here now yeah and tony's here it's just

02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:14.480
like this is a there's a good talent

02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:16.400
pool here certainly and there's a real

02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:19.520
enthusiastic group of up-and-comers

02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:22.320
real enthusiastic yeah they moved yeah a

02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:23.599
lot of them there's there's some

02:03:23.599 --> 02:03:25.119
up-and-comers that came from la and new

02:03:25.119 --> 02:03:28.080
york and yeah all that yeah just i would

02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:30.639
have had the club up already the goal

02:03:30.639 --> 02:03:32.719
was to be up by july 4th but we ran into

02:03:32.719 --> 02:03:34.239
some wild [ __ ] that i'll have to talk

02:03:34.239 --> 02:03:36.480
about eventually yeah but it was uh it

02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:37.840
was a disaster

02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:39.920
that's all right take your time yeah get

02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:42.400
it out it's all good i mean

02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:44.719
younger comics should it is it is a good

02:03:44.719 --> 02:03:46.880
opportunity like if you want to

02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:49.920
move to new york or la

02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:51.920
good luck there's gatekeepers yeah right

02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:53.679
here there's it's pretty good here

02:03:53.679 --> 02:03:55.440
there's escorts

02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:57.440
yeah yeah yeah because like that's what

02:03:57.440 --> 02:03:58.800
needs to happen i mean there's a lot of

02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:00.719
these comics like genevieve who went on

02:04:00.719 --> 02:04:03.040
the show she's been killing yeah david

02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:05.679
lucas was on the shows with us like

02:04:05.679 --> 02:04:07.599
we'll help you yes the whole idea of

02:04:07.599 --> 02:04:10.400
comedy is like a lot of comics just need

02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:12.400
a little help they just need

02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:14.320
a little encouragement

02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:16.239
camaraderie they need to know they're

02:04:16.239 --> 02:04:18.000
loved and accepted and they got a place

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.199
they got a home

02:04:19.199 --> 02:04:20.480
and that's what i'm trying to do out

02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:22.480
here it's a good thing to do yeah i

02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:25.040
think so something i can do and it's not

02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:26.800
something a lot of people can do

02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:28.320
buy a club yeah you're one of the few

02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:31.440
people that can and run a club with the

02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:33.360
expressed

02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:35.599
idea intention the expressed intention

02:04:35.599 --> 02:04:36.960
of just

02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:39.440
keeping it open yeah not using it as a

02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:40.800
money yeah yeah i'm sure i'm just trying

02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:42.800
to just trying to keep it open

02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:44.639
that would be sick and you'll know

02:04:44.639 --> 02:04:46.400
obviously what a good club should look

02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:49.280
like so the room will be good yeah yeah

02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:51.199

02:04:51.199 --> 02:04:52.480

02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:44.639
one of the most important people in the

02:05:44.639 --> 02:05:45.599
history of

02:05:45.599 --> 02:05:48.400
the art form because when she ran the

02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:49.679
comedy store

02:05:49.679 --> 02:05:52.159
she that her whole thing was yeah the

02:05:52.159 --> 02:05:54.400
inmates were running the s.i yeah she

02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:55.679
thought it was funny that the comics

02:05:55.679 --> 02:05:57.280
were running things she thought it was

02:05:57.280 --> 02:05:59.280
funny that the comics would do wild [ __ ]

02:05:59.280 --> 02:06:00.960
she thought it was funny that they would

02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:02.960
say crazy [ __ ] and people when people

02:06:02.960 --> 02:06:05.520
would call in or they would uh send in

02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:07.599
complaint letters you know like

02:06:07.599 --> 02:06:08.960
especially if they got kicked out from

02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:10.480
heckling yeah it was like a lot they

02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:12.880
would say your comedians were rude to me

02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:14.480
she would read them and laugh

02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:15.360
yeah

02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:17.119
that's funny they don't do that anymore

02:06:17.119 --> 02:06:19.119
she didn't give a [ __ ] it was just her

02:06:19.119 --> 02:06:21.920
she was so eccentric would you would you

02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:23.679
get like

02:06:23.679 --> 02:06:25.199
christians coming at you that's what

02:06:25.199 --> 02:06:26.480
everybody always like tries to make the

02:06:26.480 --> 02:06:28.079
comparison like the canceled culture now

02:06:28.079 --> 02:06:31.040
is like the left a couple you know two

02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:32.719
decades ago was the right like the

02:06:32.719 --> 02:06:34.079
christians being like you can't talk

02:06:34.079 --> 02:06:35.760
about sex you can't do that i never

02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:37.520
really had that i mean i had a little

02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:39.280
bit you know

02:06:39.280 --> 02:06:41.679
it feels easier to dismiss the right

02:06:41.679 --> 02:06:44.000
yeah you know what i mean they're less

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:47.119
aggressive in their desire to stop you

02:06:47.119 --> 02:06:48.800
from doing their job

02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:51.199
they might they might not want people to

02:06:51.199 --> 02:06:54.159
go to see you or they might not want you

02:06:54.159 --> 02:06:56.159
know their friends to see you but i

02:06:56.159 --> 02:06:58.000
don't think they they're trying to get

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:01.199
you fired the way the left is now yeah

02:07:01.199 --> 02:07:02.480
though you know what the thing is going

02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:04.000
on with the left is

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.079
a lot of it is

02:07:06.079 --> 02:07:08.000
they're being bullies

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.159
and a lot of the people that are

02:07:10.159 --> 02:07:12.360
progressive that are really like

02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:15.840
open-minded and unfortunately

02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:17.840
there's a lot of people on the left that

02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:20.400
were bullied by [ __ ] yeah they were

02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:22.800
young of course so now they have like

02:07:22.800 --> 02:07:24.880
this they have resentment were you a

02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:27.119
serious

02:07:27.119 --> 02:07:29.840
they have a serious resentment and they

02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:33.040
want to go after the people

02:07:33.040 --> 02:07:34.560
yeah nerd rage which is the most

02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:37.199
dangerous rage that is real nerd rage is

02:07:37.199 --> 02:07:38.400
the meanest

02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:41.520
saddest rage yeah that's kind of capture

02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:44.560
that's that is what did you say yeah

02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:46.480
and it's also people that they don't

02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:48.400
have a lot of love in their life

02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:50.239
if they do have love it's like very

02:07:50.239 --> 02:07:52.800
conditional and it's very you know it's

02:07:52.800 --> 02:07:55.840
very precarious yeah it's like

02:07:55.840 --> 02:07:56.960
obviously i'm making mass

02:07:56.960 --> 02:07:58.800
generalizations now it's just lots of

02:07:58.800 --> 02:08:00.719
people but it's a personality trait that

02:08:00.719 --> 02:08:02.239
they have there is

02:08:02.239 --> 02:08:04.719
there's a thing that leads people to

02:08:04.719 --> 02:08:06.840
want to be completely

02:08:06.840 --> 02:08:08.880
uncompassionate and attack people

02:08:08.880 --> 02:08:10.800
relentlessly and try to get them fired

02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:12.880
most of those people have experienced

02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:14.719
deep pain in their life it's that old

02:08:14.719 --> 02:08:17.040
expression hurt people hurt people yeah

02:08:17.040 --> 02:08:18.480
and that's what it is like that's the

02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:20.639
reason why the cancer culture coming

02:08:20.639 --> 02:08:22.880
from the left is so vicious and the most

02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:24.480
vicious [ __ ] is coming from like

02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:27.199
transgender people or gay people yeah

02:08:27.199 --> 02:08:29.119
they're all fired up

02:08:29.119 --> 02:08:30.960
about they've been bullied they've been

02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:32.320
bullied they're angry they've been

02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:34.560
picked on yeah so that when when

02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:38.079
something happens they come for you

02:08:39.199 --> 02:08:40.960
i don't know the one thing i will say

02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:42.320
like we were talking we touched on a

02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:44.320
little bit about like when i was an open

02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:46.079
micro in philly like i was talking [ __ ]

02:08:46.079 --> 02:08:48.880
dude i was like mean yeah you know what

02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:50.719
i mean yeah and that's where i think a

02:08:50.719 --> 02:08:52.079
lot of these people that are like these

02:08:52.079 --> 02:08:53.840
comm these former comedians are

02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:56.880
comedians that are like now [ __ ] them

02:08:56.880 --> 02:08:58.079
[ __ ] this

02:08:58.079 --> 02:08:59.520
i think they have that and i've been

02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:01.360
there you know what i mean like i've

02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:02.880
been in that where it's like i'm not

02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:05.119
doing [ __ ] so i'm just sitting around

02:09:05.119 --> 02:09:07.440
like oh you think they're good they suck

02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:10.159
actually yeah it's just bitter even

02:09:10.159 --> 02:09:12.320
established comedians a lot of things

02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:14.880
you'll see in established comedians is

02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:17.040
if you go to see them live and i've seen

02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:18.639
some of these established comedians on

02:09:18.639 --> 02:09:20.560
the road and you got to have phil friday

02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:22.079
night yeah because even though they're

02:09:22.079 --> 02:09:23.599
established they're not selling tickets

02:09:23.599 --> 02:09:25.199
there's people that you know even from

02:09:25.199 --> 02:09:26.960
television shows that have been on

02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:28.960
sitcoms and stuff they're not selling

02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:30.480
tickets on the road

02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:31.840

02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:50.320
when you realize like they're not

02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:51.599
thinking

02:09:51.599 --> 02:09:53.920
deeply or honestly about things at all

02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:56.079
no they're just subscribing to this

02:09:56.079 --> 02:09:58.400
pattern of thinking and behavior yeah

02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:00.400
that they think is gonna get them and

02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:02.239

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:49.280
no matter what i do there's always a

02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:50.880

overnight

02:11:58.320 --> 02:11:59.520
yeah i mean

02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:01.040
they're not happy when people are just

02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:02.960
attacking people randomly and trying to

02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:04.800
exaggerate who that person is so that

02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:07.360
they can make them more cancelable

02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:11.119
those are not happy people yeah i think

02:12:11.119 --> 02:12:12.320
part of it is

02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:14.239

and they're like super insightful

02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:36.560
like these are one of the rare people

02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:37.679
that i'm

02:12:37.679 --> 02:12:39.520

02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:41.840
listen to what he says and he said

02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:44.239
you're going to have a problem with what

02:12:44.239 --> 02:12:45.520
you're doing

02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:47.920
with other people because you have a

02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:50.159
walled garden and he goes and you're

02:12:50.159 --> 02:12:51.520
very close to your friends and you're

02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:53.760
very supportive of all your friends yeah

02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:54.560
and

02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:56.320
people on the outside

02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:57.520
they

02:12:57.520 --> 02:12:59.280
they don't like the fact that they can't

02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:01.199
get in and it makes them angry so they

02:13:01.199 --> 02:13:02.880
want to attack that walled guard of

02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:04.480
course they want to attack these close

02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:06.719
friendships because

02:13:06.719 --> 02:13:08.400
comics in general

02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:10.639
you know we're all

02:13:10.639 --> 02:13:12.880
insecure to a certain extent but also

02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:15.040
like desiring of love and attention

02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:16.400
that's why we go on stage in the first

02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:17.760
place when you see a whole group of

02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:18.800
people that seem to be having this

02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:20.960
amazing party that you can't get into

02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:22.719
and they're all supporting each other

02:13:22.719 --> 02:13:25.199
it's rare for comedy it's a rare thing

02:13:25.199 --> 02:13:27.679
for comedy to have like this like real

02:13:27.679 --> 02:13:29.520
love and acceptance amongst people that

02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:31.520
also do what we do yeah but the people

02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:33.119
on the outside men like

02:13:33.119 --> 02:13:35.760
even people that are successful

02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:38.800
they're resentful it bothers them like

02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:42.000
to be an island to be one person alone

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:43.679
even if you're doing well out there

02:13:43.679 --> 02:13:45.679
floating around like the only people

02:13:45.679 --> 02:13:47.440
that like you are your fans yeah that's

02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:49.040
the other comics don't like you you

02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:51.040
don't have real comic friend like comics

02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:53.440
without comic friends bro that's a [ __ ]

02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:56.000
life dude if if you

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.239
didn't have your comic friends like if

02:13:58.239 --> 02:13:59.840
you just tried to go out and what

02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:01.599
happened the other night happened and

02:14:01.599 --> 02:14:02.719
you were just by yourself that [ __ ]

02:14:02.719 --> 02:14:04.560
would stink it'd be weird like every

02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:06.239
time you went out there was just a crowd

02:14:06.239 --> 02:14:07.520
you'll be really you're not there with

02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:09.119
your friends [ __ ] around being like

02:14:09.119 --> 02:14:10.880
this is weird right yeah you're just by

02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:12.880
yourself it's [ __ ] weird or if it i

02:14:12.880 --> 02:14:14.719
let it change me yeah and all of a

02:14:14.719 --> 02:14:16.320
sudden i thought that i deserved all

02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:18.639
that that it was normal you know like

02:14:18.639 --> 02:14:20.719
yeah this is what people feel about me

02:14:20.719 --> 02:14:22.480
you know infecting people changing

02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:24.480
culture yeah

02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:27.280
that's a that's a slippery bad place

02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:29.840
too that's a gross drug to be on you

02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:33.040
know and people get on that drug too

02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:35.280
you know yeah

02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:37.840
comics without comic friends so that's a

02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:39.040
terrible life

02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:40.719
like because you got to think they're

02:14:40.719 --> 02:14:41.679
the only people that are going to

02:14:41.679 --> 02:14:42.880
understand you

02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:44.800
and if you have

02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:47.199
a job that you do and you don't have the

02:14:47.199 --> 02:14:49.280
love of your peers you know the love of

02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:51.760
other people that do the job you do

02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:53.199
they don't feel like you have their back

02:14:53.199 --> 02:14:54.960
or you know yeah they feel like you're a

02:14:54.960 --> 02:14:56.639
traitor or you're you know you're not

02:14:56.639 --> 02:15:00.719
helping or you're not supportive or oh

02:15:00.719 --> 02:15:02.800
yeah but that that walled garden thing

02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:04.480
that's very very true very true

02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:06.480
especially with you and your guys

02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:08.400
that happened i would have seen it yeah

02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:09.679
i was probably i was probably doing a

02:15:09.679 --> 02:15:11.760
podcast affiliate [ __ ] all those guys

02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:13.360
[ __ ] sucked

02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:15.199
dude 100

02:15:15.199 --> 02:15:18.320
100 that happened yeah i'm sure and

02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:20.719
that's yeah that's

02:15:20.719 --> 02:15:22.320
and that's real and that makes sense it

02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:24.320
does make sense and that's that's again

02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:25.599
that's why like

02:15:25.599 --> 02:15:27.679
if a comedian talks [ __ ] on me which a

02:15:27.679 --> 02:15:29.599
lot of them did a lot of them very

02:15:29.599 --> 02:15:31.280
publicly [ __ ] on me

02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:33.679
i didn't really respond and go after

02:15:33.679 --> 02:15:35.360
them because it's like i've been there

02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:37.679
yeah i know exactly where you're at yeah

02:15:37.679 --> 02:15:39.280
where it's like i'm gonna take advantage

02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:42.000
of this moment because i'm

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.400
nobody good [ __ ] on me right not once

02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:46.079
not once

02:15:46.079 --> 02:15:49.840
i've met you louis chappelle burr

02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:52.400
everybody you guys were all [ __ ] cool

02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:54.159
burr was my favorite one everybody else

02:15:54.159 --> 02:15:56.800
like had like advice and talked

02:15:56.800 --> 02:15:59.520
bear followed me at the stand

02:15:59.520 --> 02:16:01.040
and he watched some of my set and he was

02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:02.159
like yeah you're funny you're gonna be

02:16:02.159 --> 02:16:04.880
fine just walked right past it

02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:07.119
that's his outlook on everything he burr

02:16:07.119 --> 02:16:08.880
is an interesting cat because he's not

02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:10.880
on really social media at all no good

02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:12.320
for him yeah he doesn't really pay

02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:14.079
attention he's smart about it you know

02:16:14.079 --> 02:16:15.440
he'll post things every now and then but

02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:16.960
he's not reading he's posting like he's

02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:18.480
like the bronze

02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:19.280
that's

02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:21.040
it that's who he is

02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:24.239
he's uh remarkable in his ability to

02:16:24.239 --> 02:16:27.520
like maintain who he is in spite of this

02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:29.360
a massive amount of fame that he's

02:16:29.360 --> 02:16:32.160
achieved yeah so that was like the first

02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:33.840
that was like the first podcast i

02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:35.519
listened to it was bill bears

02:16:35.519 --> 02:16:37.760
and it's just it hasn't changed well his

02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:40.559
podcast is like tim's in a way that he's

02:16:40.559 --> 02:16:42.319
got that muscle where he can just ram

02:16:42.319 --> 02:16:45.439
[ __ ] crazy but no one on friday

02:16:45.439 --> 02:16:47.359
i've done a few podcasts solo they're

02:16:47.359 --> 02:16:48.960
not as i'm not it's not my thing it's

02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:51.439
hard i could do to just me and jamie it

02:16:51.439 --> 02:16:53.200
was just me and jamie see the the way

02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:54.960
tim dillon does she was just do it jv

02:16:54.960 --> 02:16:56.880
like jamie put this on yeah yo look at

02:16:56.880 --> 02:16:58.840
that exactly

02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:01.519
baby we'd be [ __ ] with each other but

02:17:01.519 --> 02:17:02.880
like

02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:04.639
that's one of the things that tim has a

02:17:04.639 --> 02:17:07.120
massive advantage he has his producer

02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:09.679
ben so ben is sitting there laughing at

02:17:09.679 --> 02:17:11.200
everything he says

02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:14.719
so he's got like this one in yeah in the

02:17:14.719 --> 02:17:16.559
house crowd which is important because

02:17:16.559 --> 02:17:17.760
if you're doing it by yourself you're

02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:19.760
like is this what are you saying funny

02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:21.599
right but that's the thing about bill

02:17:21.599 --> 02:17:23.040
he's not worried about whether or not

02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:24.960
he's saying something funny or not he

02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:26.880
doesn't give a [ __ ] but he makes himself

02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:30.399
laugh yeah which is very fast

02:17:30.479 --> 02:17:31.840
yeah

02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:32.880
it's incredible

02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:33.760
no he's

02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:35.359
maybe the worst bill burr impression

02:17:35.359 --> 02:17:37.280
it's not a good one but he's right he's

02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:38.639
a gem

02:17:38.639 --> 02:17:41.190
kill myself dude i [ __ ] up

02:17:41.190 --> 02:17:41.340
[Music]

02:17:41.340 --> 02:17:45.260
[Laughter]

02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:47.439
[Music]

02:17:47.439 --> 02:17:50.160
you'll be fine yeah i'll get confident

02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:52.319
it's the last thing this podcast needs

02:17:52.319 --> 02:17:54.080
you're not confident yet you should be

02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:57.040
i'm getting pretty good

02:17:57.500 --> 02:17:59.519
[Music]

02:17:59.519 --> 02:18:01.920
i mean at that part that snl part was

02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:02.960
great

02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:04.800
there's one moment i was like and then i

02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:07.280
was like i'll just go on joe rogan

02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:09.439
and you're like what i was waiting for

02:18:09.439 --> 02:18:10.559
more

02:18:10.559 --> 02:18:12.000
i know i know but it should have helped

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:13.760
you there dude you should have seen my

02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:16.479
face just like

02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:19.359
it was fully like that was my failure as

02:18:19.359 --> 02:18:21.439
much as yours i thought about having you

02:18:21.439 --> 02:18:22.880
on and i thought about like even

02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:24.559
rescheduling people but i was like like

02:18:24.559 --> 02:18:26.240
this guy's just got to go through this

02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:28.880
no i and i also thought that like the

02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:31.200
perspective that you achieve through

02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:33.120
time is valuable for something like this

02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:35.359
you gotta you don't want to catch it

02:18:35.359 --> 02:18:38.960
on the wave it would

02:18:50.719 --> 02:18:52.240
did she go after you of course she did

02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:53.599
now she's getting chaos when i'm sitting

02:18:53.599 --> 02:18:54.960
there like that she's not just getting

02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:56.479
canceled she's she might she's going

02:18:56.479 --> 02:18:59.639
through a mental breakdown she might be

02:18:59.639 --> 02:19:02.479
irreferably irrefutably what's the word

02:19:02.479 --> 02:19:04.240
irreparably no it's not a word

02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:05.519
irreparably that's the word i was

02:19:05.519 --> 02:19:07.439
looking for okay that's

02:19:07.439 --> 02:19:09.040

02:19:15.679 --> 02:19:18.000
like a legitimately like mentally ill

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.240

02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:05.280
10 to 15 minutes a day yeah and i'm

02:22:05.280 --> 02:22:06.640
always like what am i doing and then i

02:22:06.640 --> 02:22:08.399
shut it off yeah

02:22:08.399 --> 02:22:10.000
i'll read i'll read something and then

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.640
i'll read somebody saying some wild [ __ ]

02:22:12.640 --> 02:22:13.920
and i'm like all right

02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:14.800
yeah

02:22:14.800 --> 02:22:16.640
i want to take those pieces of anxiety

02:22:16.640 --> 02:22:19.120
put them on a podcast alone

02:22:19.120 --> 02:22:21.680
yeah just go over your thought process

02:22:21.680 --> 02:22:22.880
you know like what are you doing and

02:22:22.880 --> 02:22:24.399
what do you think when you release it do

02:22:24.399 --> 02:22:26.399
you ever feel bad like once you say

02:22:26.399 --> 02:22:28.000
something like hurt yeah that was

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.479
another thing like i feel horrible after

02:22:30.479 --> 02:22:32.560
everything i said yeah everything i do

02:22:32.560 --> 02:22:34.319
and say i'm like what the [ __ ]

02:22:34.319 --> 02:22:37.040
[ __ ] am i why would i say this yeah and

02:22:37.040 --> 02:22:39.920
then that was one thing this was a real

02:22:39.920 --> 02:22:42.319
weird moment of clarity i had while i

02:22:42.319 --> 02:22:43.760
was getting canceled by these people

02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:46.000
that have always gone after me they've

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:47.840
always like in philly the alt scene

02:22:47.840 --> 02:22:49.600
always we always had a problem which was

02:22:49.600 --> 02:22:52.000
weird always they're nerds they are

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:53.760
they're [ __ ] nerds i played football

02:22:53.760 --> 02:22:55.600
they hated me

02:22:55.600 --> 02:22:57.760
and then

02:22:57.760 --> 02:22:59.840
i was like laying in bed at night like

02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:01.920
really thinking about what i had said

02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:03.920
why people were upset about it and i was

02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:05.600
just like

02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:07.680
i don't think they're doing this

02:23:07.680 --> 02:23:09.040
i genuinely was laying there i was like

02:23:09.040 --> 02:23:10.160
i don't think they're laying in their

02:23:10.160 --> 02:23:13.439
bed like maybe i'm being mean to shame

02:23:13.439 --> 02:23:15.280
right meanwhile i was laying up at night

02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:17.040
like maybe i [ __ ] up maybe these

02:23:17.040 --> 02:23:18.880
people you know what i mean and then

02:23:18.880 --> 02:23:21.439
that gave me some assurance of like at

02:23:21.439 --> 02:23:23.520
least i'm second guessing myself i don't

02:23:23.520 --> 02:23:24.720
think these people are second guessing

02:23:24.720 --> 02:23:26.399
themselves at all they will if they have

02:23:26.399 --> 02:23:28.160
to and that's the thing

02:23:28.160 --> 02:23:30.160
you know do you know jamie kelstein yeah

02:23:30.160 --> 02:23:32.720

02:23:32.720 --> 02:23:33.600

that's hilarious that's very good that's

02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:44.720
very good yeah it's just a way for

02:24:44.720 --> 02:24:46.640
people to be special

02:24:46.640 --> 02:24:48.000
that

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:49.359
they don't have to put in any extra

02:24:49.359 --> 02:24:52.560
effort but it's also a way legitimately

02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:54.720
for certain people that don't feel like

02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:57.920
they fit in to any gender to try to like

02:24:57.920 --> 02:25:00.640
have like a path carve down if you say

02:25:00.640 --> 02:25:02.880
someone's he him there's certain people

02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:04.560
that just they don't feel like a he or a

02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:07.120
him they feel [ __ ] up they don't feel

02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:09.280
it because there's a [ __ ] crazy

02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:12.319
spectrum of human beings in males and in

02:25:12.319 --> 02:25:14.319
females and some people they don't want

02:25:14.319 --> 02:25:17.359
to play the game they're either asexual

02:25:17.359 --> 02:25:18.880
or they don't care they don't feel like

02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:21.359
they fit into gender norms listen when i

02:25:21.359 --> 02:25:23.920
joke around about [ __ ] i still get it oh

02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:26.000
for sure i still get it i still i

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.080
couldn't imagine what it's like to be a

02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:30.319
biological male who doesn't identify

02:25:30.319 --> 02:25:32.800
with being a male who doesn't want to be

02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:35.040
thought of as a female and you want to

02:25:35.040 --> 02:25:36.479

02:25:36.479 --> 02:25:37.760

them it's like other people that want to

02:25:46.319 --> 02:25:48.160
like reinforce them that are the most

02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:50.080
annoying of course because they're just

02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:51.840

the afternoon with chest pains

02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:23.120

i bet before your heart gives out it

02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:08.319
probably gives you a few warning shots

02:29:08.319 --> 02:29:10.720

02:29:10.720 --> 02:29:12.240

02:29:38.319 --> 02:29:40.080
be very traumatic for them it's

02:29:40.080 --> 02:29:41.680
traumatic for them no matter what if you

02:29:41.680 --> 02:29:43.920
die

02:29:45.359 --> 02:29:48.240

to my grandfather as anybody in my

02:29:54.720 --> 02:29:57.359
family and when he died

02:29:57.359 --> 02:29:59.600
um i remember

02:29:59.600 --> 02:30:02.880
there was part of me that was we knew he

02:30:02.880 --> 02:30:04.960
wasn't doing well so it was part of me

02:30:04.960 --> 02:30:07.120
that was relieved that he wasn't in pain

02:30:07.120 --> 02:30:08.560
anymore

02:30:08.560 --> 02:30:10.000
and then but there was part of me that

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:10.800
was

02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:12.880
i don't want to be there

02:30:12.880 --> 02:30:14.000
i don't want to be there when that

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:15.840
happens yeah yeah i watched my grandpa

02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:18.560
die i was in the i was in the room

02:30:18.560 --> 02:30:20.160
and he started like he was laying there

02:30:20.160 --> 02:30:22.319
and he just started like oh

02:30:22.319 --> 02:30:24.000
and they had to like shove a tube down

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:25.359
his throat and they pushed me out of the

02:30:25.359 --> 02:30:27.920
room yeah and it was just like they know

02:30:27.920 --> 02:30:29.760
it's over right yeah they have to do

02:30:29.760 --> 02:30:32.080
whatever they can to prolong life isn't

02:30:32.080 --> 02:30:33.760
that fascinating like how we feel about

02:30:33.760 --> 02:30:36.880
life like even if a guy is 136 years old

02:30:36.880 --> 02:30:38.960
if he's just getting three steps but you

02:30:38.960 --> 02:30:40.800
know what i'm saying right even if he's

02:30:40.800 --> 02:30:41.600
like

02:30:41.600 --> 02:30:43.760
he's done it all if he's in the hospital

02:30:43.760 --> 02:30:46.560
twitching they'll

02:30:48.160 --> 02:30:50.160

feel really good before she goes oh

02:31:23.600 --> 02:31:25.680
you'd like this that night the night we

02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:27.040
were talking about that

02:31:27.040 --> 02:31:28.399
and spud

02:31:28.399 --> 02:31:31.120
we took we took a couple hits of molly

02:31:31.120 --> 02:31:33.439
and then i ate see i'd always done

02:31:33.439 --> 02:31:35.840
mushrooms but i always i always did like

02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:37.040
a little bit

02:31:37.040 --> 02:31:38.720
like enough that like you would get

02:31:38.720 --> 02:31:40.240
giggly

02:31:40.240 --> 02:31:42.640
it felt like weed

02:31:42.640 --> 02:31:44.240
it felt like weed without the anxiety

02:31:44.240 --> 02:31:45.760
and then one night we i i must have

02:31:45.760 --> 02:31:47.600
eaten like

02:31:47.600 --> 02:31:49.200
seven grams

02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:51.439
i mean bro

02:31:51.439 --> 02:31:53.280
i never did that

02:31:53.280 --> 02:31:54.479
so we're sitting at it it was my friend

02:31:54.479 --> 02:31:56.960
matt's bachelor party we're outside

02:31:56.960 --> 02:31:59.359
we're at this fire all of a sudden i i

02:31:59.359 --> 02:32:01.359
blacked it like dude i couldn't see

02:32:01.359 --> 02:32:02.800
i went like blind i was sitting there i

02:32:02.800 --> 02:32:04.080
was like

02:32:04.080 --> 02:32:06.000
i was like yo guys i'm blind and they're

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:07.359
like you're alright you're not supposed

02:32:07.359 --> 02:32:09.200
to do seven grams with a bunch of people

02:32:09.200 --> 02:32:11.359
around you were on molly too i did do a

02:32:11.359 --> 02:32:13.600
little so you started on that started on

02:32:13.600 --> 02:32:14.800
molly

02:32:14.800 --> 02:32:16.319
that seems like that's a little bit more

02:32:16.319 --> 02:32:18.720
too right

02:32:18.800 --> 02:32:20.720
it's like it's like you're starting like

02:32:20.720 --> 02:32:22.240
you're precursor i haven't done drugs

02:32:22.240 --> 02:32:23.120
since

02:32:23.120 --> 02:32:24.960
yeah it was that extreme is that right

02:32:24.960 --> 02:32:26.399
yeah it's but it's funny the way you're

02:32:26.399 --> 02:32:27.840
describing it you'll be like cautious

02:32:27.840 --> 02:32:29.600
like it seems like look at that yeah

02:32:29.600 --> 02:32:31.600
yeah someone should have told you this

02:32:31.600 --> 02:32:34.080
is such a crazy ingredient first of all

02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:36.160
it's a crazy idea to do molly and

02:32:36.160 --> 02:32:38.640
mushrooms together yeah look it was the

02:32:38.640 --> 02:32:40.319
molly the molly took over somebody

02:32:40.319 --> 02:32:42.560
dropped oh the moment we made it

02:32:42.560 --> 02:32:45.920
ziploc bag of [ __ ] mushrooms and i

02:32:45.920 --> 02:32:47.439
was just sitting there

02:32:47.439 --> 02:32:49.680
munching as many as i could

02:32:49.680 --> 02:32:51.359
to the point like i was having trouble

02:32:51.359 --> 02:32:53.920
swallowing them dangerous

02:32:53.920 --> 02:32:56.000
no yeah it was there's nothing actually

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:57.600
never really die

02:32:57.600 --> 02:33:00.319
but i did die mckenna thought there was

02:33:00.319 --> 02:33:03.040
a time i did die mckenna did i think he

02:33:03.040 --> 02:33:06.399
did some sort of an mao inhibitor with

02:33:06.399 --> 02:33:07.920
mushrooms

02:33:07.920 --> 02:33:09.359
and it was one of the few times like

02:33:09.359 --> 02:33:10.880
i've listened to a lot of terence

02:33:10.880 --> 02:33:12.800
mckenna lectures yeah really interesting

02:33:12.800 --> 02:33:14.720
and not really they weren't in lectures

02:33:14.720 --> 02:33:16.399
it was like he gave these talks that we

02:33:16.399 --> 02:33:17.120
do

02:33:17.120 --> 02:33:18.560
in front of like a couple hundred people

02:33:18.560 --> 02:33:19.840
who travel around the country and do

02:33:19.840 --> 02:33:22.720
these and he gave one of them about some

02:33:22.720 --> 02:33:25.359
combination of drugs i'm not completely

02:33:25.359 --> 02:33:26.960
sure i remember but i think it was an

02:33:26.960 --> 02:33:28.720
mao inhibitor

02:33:28.720 --> 02:33:31.439
and a large dose of mushrooms together

02:33:31.439 --> 02:33:34.399
and he said that he could feel like

02:33:34.399 --> 02:33:36.000
his

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.080
his thought process his ability to think

02:33:38.080 --> 02:33:40.479
was getting erased he could like like

02:33:40.479 --> 02:33:44.560
lines of code getting erased

02:33:44.560 --> 02:33:46.800
yeah that his ability to process

02:33:46.800 --> 02:33:48.560
thoughts and the ability to communicate

02:33:48.560 --> 02:33:50.319
was like he could watch it get a race

02:33:50.319 --> 02:33:52.319
and he was like genuinely concerned that

02:33:52.319 --> 02:33:53.680
he was never going to come back from it

02:33:53.680 --> 02:33:55.760
i'm not paraphrasing it i'm doing my i

02:33:55.760 --> 02:33:58.720
haven't heard that in maybe 10 years the

02:33:58.720 --> 02:34:00.640

02:34:20.080 --> 02:34:21.439
mushrooms

02:34:21.439 --> 02:34:22.560
fully

02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:24.960
dude i had a vision

02:34:24.960 --> 02:34:25.840
of

02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:27.600
i kept dying

02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:29.200
going to heaven

02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:32.080
seeing my dad who's still alive

02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:33.359
i would be in heaven with my dad and

02:34:33.359 --> 02:34:35.120
then i'd get brought back to life with a

02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:37.760
paramedic shining lights into my eyes

02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:39.520
like i was overdosing

02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:40.880
it was crazy

02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:42.720
i thought you'd be fired up

02:34:42.720 --> 02:34:44.560
wasn't wild that's pretty one and it

02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:46.160

wasn't my story wild for you it is i'm

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.240
trying to absorb it and it was

02:34:52.240 --> 02:34:53.760
so vivid

02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:56.399
i stopped on drugs i thought it was like

02:34:56.399 --> 02:34:58.000
that was an overdose that was an

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.160
overdose that i would have had if i kept

02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:01.359
doing drugs

02:35:01.359 --> 02:35:03.600
i just i don't know one of the things

02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:05.120
that i think about with psychedelics is

02:35:05.120 --> 02:35:06.640
how much of

02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:09.680
the way you think normally plays a part

02:35:09.680 --> 02:35:12.080
in what you see and if that's the case

02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:15.200
but if that's the case what is happening

02:35:15.200 --> 02:35:18.000
like what is happening is it that your

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:19.520
anxiety

02:35:19.520 --> 02:35:20.800
and your

02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:23.600
your fear and all your your ego is

02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:25.920
interfering with your imagination and

02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:28.080
creating these nightmare scenarios that

02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:29.200
aren't real

02:35:29.200 --> 02:35:30.560
or

02:35:30.560 --> 02:35:33.920
is it that the way you think about life

02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:36.000
and the way you behave and the way you

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.640
treat people changes

02:35:38.640 --> 02:35:41.120
the world itself and it changes your

02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:43.600
world and it's represented in the

02:35:43.600 --> 02:35:46.319
psychedelic world that when you

02:35:46.319 --> 02:35:47.520
embrace

02:35:47.520 --> 02:35:49.600
a certain mindset and go into these

02:35:49.600 --> 02:35:52.080
psychedelic experiences and release

02:35:52.080 --> 02:35:54.399
yourself and allow whatever it is the

02:35:54.399 --> 02:35:56.479
dmt or the mushrooms or whatever it is

02:35:56.479 --> 02:35:58.319
take take a hold of you and take you on

02:35:58.319 --> 02:36:00.080
a journey then those journeys are

02:36:00.080 --> 02:36:02.479
generally positive

02:36:02.479 --> 02:36:05.680
it was extremely negative yeah i wonder

02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:06.640
but

02:36:06.640 --> 02:36:08.800
afterwards it was great like i woke up

02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:11.600
the next day like bro i got to change a

02:36:11.600 --> 02:36:13.359
lot of things

02:36:13.359 --> 02:36:14.240
right

02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:15.040
uh

02:36:15.040 --> 02:36:16.880
so that's the thing about negative ones

02:36:16.880 --> 02:36:18.640
they're not really negative they're just

02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:20.160
no it's just hard while you're in it's

02:36:20.160 --> 02:36:22.240
just a hard lesson yeah it's a hard

02:36:22.240 --> 02:36:24.319
lesson i think when people struggle with

02:36:24.319 --> 02:36:26.240
psychedelic experiences

02:36:26.240 --> 02:36:27.920
or if people have legitimate mental

02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:29.840
illnesses that do psychedelics that's

02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:32.160
that's never a good idea you know people

02:36:32.160 --> 02:36:33.760
that are like hanging on by a threat

02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:37.040
already and they eat

02:36:38.460 --> 02:36:41.520
[Music]

02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:43.040
we were outside by a campfire and i was

02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:45.200
literally i'd be like staring at someone

02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:46.479
and they'd be like what are you looking

02:36:46.479 --> 02:36:48.240
at

02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:49.680
because their face would change they'd

02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:51.280
have like three heads i'd be like dude

02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:53.200
are you okay so that makes me think like

02:36:53.200 --> 02:36:55.200
what is that you know what's weird is we

02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:57.520
all kind of see the same things that's a

02:36:57.520 --> 02:36:59.280
problem it's like you ever have sleep

02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:01.920
paralysis no i haven't i had sleep

02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:05.520
paralysis one night and it was

02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:07.680
at the foot of my bed have you ever

02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:09.200
you've heard of sleep problems yeah for

02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:11.600
sure foot in my bed there's a long

02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:13.200
spindly

02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:15.280
shadowy figure just standing there and

02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:17.680
it was fully real it was real

02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:19.680
and it walked along the side of my bed

02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:22.160
like reaching its hand out of my face

02:37:22.160 --> 02:37:24.880
and i woke up tried to fight it

02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:26.319
i thought it was it was so real that i

02:37:26.319 --> 02:37:28.319
thought it was like an intruder

02:37:28.319 --> 02:37:30.080
you know i mean there was no part of me

02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:31.760
that was like this is a demon i wonder

02:37:31.760 --> 02:37:34.000
what that is and then

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.319
months later i found out about sleep

02:37:36.319 --> 02:37:38.399
paralysis

02:37:38.399 --> 02:37:41.200
i never heard of it googled it

02:37:41.200 --> 02:37:42.479
and there was a

02:37:42.479 --> 02:37:45.200
image of exactly what i dreamed on the

02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:47.520
internet like i saw it wow and i was

02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:49.600
like it gave me [ __ ] chills like it's

02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:52.319
all [ __ ] and everybody sees the same

02:37:52.319 --> 02:37:53.760
thing

02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:55.840
it's crazy but that's what i'm saying

02:37:55.840 --> 02:37:57.520
and that goes to the mushrooms thing

02:37:57.520 --> 02:37:59.920
with like the ego death or whatever

02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:01.520
all those dumb [ __ ] hippies want to

02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:02.640
call it

02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:05.120
i did experience it even though i'm like

02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:07.359
these [ __ ] dumb hippies i'd literally

02:38:07.359 --> 02:38:09.200
experienced an ego death one of the

02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:11.120
weirdest experiences i've ever had is

02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:14.560
with 5meo dmt which is a different kind

02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:16.800
of dimethyltryptamine i think it has

02:38:16.800 --> 02:38:18.960
like a different molecule attached to it

02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:22.640
or something and there's no visuals yeah

02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:25.280
regular v dmt it's like these wild

02:38:25.280 --> 02:38:26.479
fractal

02:38:26.479 --> 02:38:27.840
psychological

02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:30.479
yes it's super luminous and then you

02:38:30.479 --> 02:38:32.160
have entities that are communicating

02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:33.920
with you there's wild things

02:38:33.920 --> 02:38:35.359
in the world i'm sorry to cut you off

02:38:35.359 --> 02:38:36.240
what are they

02:38:36.240 --> 02:38:38.080
saying i had a bunch of jokers the last

02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:39.600
time i didn't give me the finger they

02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:41.760
were all gestures like with the bells

02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:44.720
yeah yeah and they're like this

02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:46.960
and it made me realize instantly because

02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:48.720
like my first thought was like hey [ __ ]

02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:52.000
you hey [ __ ] you guys but my my first

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.640
instinct like they were it was all laid

02:38:54.640 --> 02:38:56.479
out in front of me they were saying you

02:38:56.479 --> 02:38:58.880
take yourself too seriously really yeah

02:38:58.880 --> 02:39:00.319
and i was like oh

02:39:00.319 --> 02:39:02.000
you're right damn i wish everybody got

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:03.840
to see you get that high like get that

02:39:03.840 --> 02:39:06.319
high back hey [ __ ] you but it was a real

02:39:06.319 --> 02:39:08.160
lesson because it's true and it changed

02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:09.200
the way

02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:10.560
this was just a few years ago the last

02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:12.640
time i did it i think it was two and a

02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:16.880
half ish three-ish years ago and i still

02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:19.040
think of that it's like that made me a

02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:21.280
markedly more relaxed person from that

02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:23.280
moment on like the way because i was

02:39:23.280 --> 02:39:25.600
realizing like this is tension when

02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:27.120
you're worried about what people think

02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:28.880
about you and there's like a thing if

02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:30.240
you take yourself too seriously you

02:39:30.240 --> 02:39:32.399
don't want people to to talk about you a

02:39:32.399 --> 02:39:34.560
certain way and whatever it was i'm

02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:39.560
doing this experience and i'm also

02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:45.200
and i'm like what and then i'm like oh

02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:47.120
and i go like this like oh i get it like

02:39:47.120 --> 02:39:49.520
it was instantly apparent like i knew

02:39:49.520 --> 02:39:51.359
i had because it's you're managing a

02:39:51.359 --> 02:39:53.120
certain level of fame and certain

02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:55.120
sometimes your ego gets in the way or

02:39:55.120 --> 02:39:56.800
that your perceptions are off and you're

02:39:56.800 --> 02:39:58.960
not willing to readjust whatever it was

02:39:58.960 --> 02:40:01.439
yeah but these these gestures give me

02:40:01.439 --> 02:40:02.560
the finger

02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:05.040
i realized exactly what it was about you

02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:07.280
take yourself too seriously i go oh and

02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:10.000
then i had to examine it really briefly

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:11.280
i'm like you're right you're right

02:40:11.280 --> 02:40:12.640
you're right and they just they all

02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:14.880
started nodding like that wow and then

02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:16.000
they went away

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:17.120
and then they went away and then it

02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:18.800
became this beautiful journey but it was

02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:21.680
an opportunity for me to have a bad trip

02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:23.840
because not really not terrible it

02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:26.240
wasn't like demanding [ __ ]

02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:28.960
i was just seeing [ __ ] about it

02:40:28.960 --> 02:40:30.479
they were all giving me the figure i was

02:40:30.479 --> 02:40:32.640
like oh my god there's so many of you it

02:40:32.640 --> 02:40:34.800
was like fractal there was like

02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:37.200
like like who knows how many like

02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:38.800
there's no way i could count them but

02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:41.359
there was like a massive number of

02:40:41.359 --> 02:40:43.600
gestures giving me the finger and it let

02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:45.439
me know like that shouldn't bother you

02:40:45.439 --> 02:40:47.279
at all but that shouldn't bother you you

02:40:47.279 --> 02:40:48.960
should embrace that you have two ways to

02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:50.319
look at that you could look at that and

02:40:50.319 --> 02:40:51.439
you could be bothered by it and you

02:40:51.439 --> 02:40:52.640
could look at that and think that's

02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:54.960
hilarious if it's true the only reason

02:40:54.960 --> 02:40:56.399
why you'd be bothered by it is you're

02:40:56.399 --> 02:40:58.319
connected to your own self-image and

02:40:58.319 --> 02:41:00.000
you're connected to this this idea that

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:01.439
you want to project out to all the other

02:41:01.439 --> 02:41:03.600
people and the gestures were right the

02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:07.200
gestures were right it's a great lesson

02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:08.880
they're right you know you got a good

02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:10.319
point you're right i was like you're

02:41:10.319 --> 02:41:12.000
right i don't know what to do but you're

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.399
right isn't that this kind of goes back

02:41:14.399 --> 02:41:16.319
to the cancel thing but same thing with

02:41:16.319 --> 02:41:18.479
like the the mushroom thing i had where

02:41:18.479 --> 02:41:20.880
like there's that trauma the gestures

02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:22.560
whatever however you want to describe it

02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:24.479
but there's like you wish you could keep

02:41:24.479 --> 02:41:26.399
it because eventually you start to lose

02:41:26.399 --> 02:41:29.200
it again yeah you forget that that

02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:30.880
yeah the low point where you have that

02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:32.399
moment of like

02:41:32.399 --> 02:41:34.319
this is what i am this is i [ __ ]

02:41:34.319 --> 02:41:35.920
everybody you know i mean that yeah

02:41:35.920 --> 02:41:37.920
[ __ ] who gives a [ __ ] attitude you do

02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:39.439
lose it

02:41:39.439 --> 02:41:41.439
you can then you get it back you gotta

02:41:41.439 --> 02:41:44.160
you gotta reinforce it yeah you know and

02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:45.760
that's one of the good things about

02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:46.960
failure

02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:49.680
like failure forces you to reassess and

02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:52.800
and and also you can get to like with

02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:54.319
comedy particularly because it's so

02:41:54.319 --> 02:41:56.000
weird like no one there's no director

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:57.439
there's no producer it's just you you're

02:41:57.439 --> 02:41:59.200
writing it and then you're producing it

02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:00.640
and then you then you're performing it

02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:02.000
in front of everybody

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.479
and you could get lost in what you're

02:42:04.479 --> 02:42:06.720
doing you know you need a little failure

02:42:06.720 --> 02:42:08.800
you need a little like a slippage you

02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:11.200
need a [ __ ] up word you know the word

02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:12.399
comes out wrong

02:42:12.399 --> 02:42:14.640
you stumble on your words those are good

02:42:14.640 --> 02:42:16.560
man they don't seem like they are at the

02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:18.240
time but they really are good because

02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:20.240
that's the only way you're going to like

02:42:20.240 --> 02:42:22.960
reignite your enthusiasm yeah that's

02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:24.720
right that's kind of where i'm at which

02:42:24.720 --> 02:42:25.600
is like

02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:26.800
just i just

02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:28.319
started doing the cellar

02:42:28.319 --> 02:42:30.080
and everybody there hadn't seen me do

02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:32.080
stand up so then i was doing i was able

02:42:32.080 --> 02:42:35.200
to do my best material my old material i

02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:37.120
was killing people like damn this guy's

02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:39.600
great and now it's like what do i have

02:42:39.600 --> 02:42:40.800
anything else

02:42:40.800 --> 02:42:42.319
you know what i mean yeah what is that

02:42:42.319 --> 02:42:44.000
moment of like i gotta start trying to

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:45.279
do new

02:42:45.279 --> 02:42:47.680
at a at a club that i'm

02:42:47.680 --> 02:42:49.920
just at like just filming different

02:42:49.920 --> 02:42:51.120
places

02:42:51.120 --> 02:42:52.479
different places for different things

02:42:52.479 --> 02:42:54.479
right like if you're just doing arenas

02:42:54.479 --> 02:42:56.399
you're not going to write new material

02:42:56.399 --> 02:42:58.720
it's not it's not right it's just like

02:42:58.720 --> 02:43:00.640
it's a detached sort of feeling yeah but

02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:02.240
there's a thing that's detached about

02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:04.720
doing a top level club like the seller

02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:07.520
yeah sellers it's an a club yeah you

02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:08.880
know it's one of the best clubs in the

02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:11.040
world and it's in manhattan and everyone

02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:12.399
knows that chris rock goes up there

02:43:12.399 --> 02:43:15.120
occasionally dave chappelle shows up and

02:43:15.120 --> 02:43:16.560
you know it's the best comics in the

02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:18.240
world david tells there all the time the

02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:19.760
best comics on earth

02:43:19.760 --> 02:43:21.680
so there's a pressure to a place like

02:43:21.680 --> 02:43:23.920
that that's not necessarily conducive to

02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:26.319
creativity like you're you're you're

02:43:26.319 --> 02:43:28.479
it's good to do open mic nights it's

02:43:28.479 --> 02:43:30.000
good to do shows where no one knows

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:31.120
you're going to be there it's good to do

02:43:31.120 --> 02:43:33.359
shows with small amounts of people

02:43:33.359 --> 02:43:35.920
you got to think about it like training

02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:38.000
like if you're a fighter like you don't

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.800
just box you have to do jiu jitsu you

02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:42.000
have to wrestle you have to go to the

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:43.920
strength and conditioning gym and if you

02:43:43.920 --> 02:43:46.080
don't do those things you won't get as

02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:47.600
good as if you did those things like you

02:43:47.600 --> 02:43:49.520
could be a successful fighter and just

02:43:49.520 --> 02:43:51.600
work on take down defense and punching

02:43:51.600 --> 02:43:53.760
and you maybe get pretty far with that

02:43:53.760 --> 02:43:55.760
but you won't get as far as a guy who

02:43:55.760 --> 02:43:57.359
learns jiu jitsu and a guy who has

02:43:57.359 --> 02:43:59.600
amazing cardio you know you need more

02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:02.640
weapons and a guy who failed yes like we

02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:04.479
just saw yes

02:44:04.479 --> 02:44:07.200
yes wasn't that cool it was very cool

02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:09.840
but that was an unfortunate ending oh

02:44:09.840 --> 02:44:11.760
that's stunning because uh apparently

02:44:11.760 --> 02:44:13.760
that was an existing injury he uh had

02:44:13.760 --> 02:44:16.000
that ankle scanned uh she he had

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:17.520
probably kicked someone really hard in

02:44:17.520 --> 02:44:19.840
training and create a stress fracture

02:44:19.840 --> 02:44:21.920
and uh john wayne parr

02:44:21.920 --> 02:44:24.960
and then uh eric nixik from uh extreme

02:44:24.960 --> 02:44:27.439
couture who's one of the top coaches in

02:44:27.439 --> 02:44:29.600
vegas he they both

02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:32.080
put videos up on their instagram and

02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:33.920
when john wayne park noticed that his

02:44:33.920 --> 02:44:35.439
leg was starting to buckle in a weird

02:44:35.439 --> 02:44:37.600
way after he threw one leg kick kicked

02:44:37.600 --> 02:44:39.040
him in the thigh because he he

02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:41.359
apparently had a cracked shin going in

02:44:41.359 --> 02:44:42.080
there

02:44:42.080 --> 02:44:43.760
and it was um

02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:45.680
you know there was it was of concern

02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:47.040
enough that they went to the doctor got

02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:49.279
it scanned yeah so when you see him

02:44:49.279 --> 02:44:51.600
throw a kick there's one where he's he

02:44:51.600 --> 02:44:53.760
hits the elbow yeah and then he goes

02:44:53.760 --> 02:44:55.520
back to sit down and his leg just gives

02:44:55.520 --> 02:44:57.279
out on him totally that leg was already

02:44:57.279 --> 02:44:59.359
broken yeah he's probably kicking him

02:44:59.359 --> 02:45:00.960
with a broken leg and that's what that's

02:45:00.960 --> 02:45:01.840
what you have to realize that's what

02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:03.840
kind of a savage conor mcgregor is he

02:45:03.840 --> 02:45:06.720
was kicking him with a broken leg

02:45:06.720 --> 02:45:09.200
man because he's up he's a left-hander

02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:11.600
right so his left side is the power side

02:45:11.600 --> 02:45:14.000
so his left kicks his big kick and that

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:15.439
was the kick that he was throwing even

02:45:15.439 --> 02:45:18.000
though he had a broken shin

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.560
pretty wild that that [ __ ]

02:45:20.560 --> 02:45:22.800
i mean it's insane it's truly insane

02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:23.920
he's wild

02:45:23.920 --> 02:45:25.760
video we were watching him driving

02:45:25.760 --> 02:45:28.240
around he scooted yeah

02:45:28.240 --> 02:45:30.640
he's so funny nothing but respect for

02:45:30.640 --> 02:45:33.120
that guy and people are like i did not

02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:36.560
enjoy the way people who are not mma

02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:38.000
experts were talking about the

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:39.920
conclusion of that fight and they were

02:45:39.920 --> 02:45:42.640
saying that conor is old connor's done

02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:44.399
he doesn't have the the

02:45:44.399 --> 02:45:47.520
the the anger anymore or the the the

02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:50.319
drive to become a champ anymore horse

02:45:50.319 --> 02:45:52.000
[ __ ] yeah people don't know anything

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:53.840
about mma let me tell you what happened

02:45:53.840 --> 02:45:55.680
you got a guy who went out there guns

02:45:55.680 --> 02:45:57.200
blazing to give it his all with a

02:45:57.200 --> 02:45:58.960
pre-existing injury and he got beat by a

02:45:58.960 --> 02:46:01.040
better man yeah he got bit by he got

02:46:01.040 --> 02:46:03.120
beat by a guy who made it might have

02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:06.319
beat him anyway yeah but took him down

02:46:06.319 --> 02:46:09.040
has a superior ground game dustin beat

02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:10.399
him up and here's the thing that i was

02:46:10.399 --> 02:46:11.760
saying going into that fight

02:46:11.760 --> 02:46:14.080
historically and this is never an

02:46:14.080 --> 02:46:15.600
indication of like what can happen in

02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:17.120
the future because people can improve

02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:19.840
they get better but historically conor's

02:46:19.840 --> 02:46:21.359
really dangerous in the beginning of a

02:46:21.359 --> 02:46:23.439
fight it's not as dangerous as the fight

02:46:23.439 --> 02:46:26.640
goes on dustin poirier is dangerous for

02:46:26.640 --> 02:46:29.520
all five rounds and that's a big factor

02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:31.520
he relishes

02:46:31.520 --> 02:46:33.520
these combat

02:46:33.520 --> 02:46:34.640
trench

02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:37.439
warfare type fights where like you're

02:46:37.439 --> 02:46:40.000
five rounds in with dan hooker and he'll

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:41.520
win it in the fifth round yeah like

02:46:41.520 --> 02:46:44.000
that's who dustin poirier is and he's

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.560
gone he's had these five round wars with

02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:49.439
these wars with like max holloway and

02:46:49.439 --> 02:46:53.040
justin and justin gaichi like he's had

02:46:53.040 --> 02:46:55.040
savage fights

02:46:55.040 --> 02:46:57.200
and gone into the trenches so he's like

02:46:57.200 --> 02:46:58.880
real confident he can get through those

02:46:58.880 --> 02:47:01.600
trenches and be victorious so

02:47:01.600 --> 02:47:03.920
the problem with the fight is not just

02:47:03.920 --> 02:47:06.399
that conor broke his leg the problem was

02:47:06.399 --> 02:47:07.439
that doc

02:47:07.439 --> 02:47:10.800
that dustin dominated the first round

02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:13.600
yeah when dustin yeah that was if he

02:47:13.600 --> 02:47:16.399
dominates the first round he's he's

02:47:16.399 --> 02:47:18.319
likely

02:47:18.319 --> 02:47:20.560
the favorite to win the second round and

02:47:20.560 --> 02:47:22.399
then he's even more of a favorite to win

02:47:22.399 --> 02:47:24.000
the third round and this is but this is

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.800
just based on historical moments and

02:47:26.800 --> 02:47:29.279
fights what conor has done and what does

02:47:29.279 --> 02:47:30.720
connor

02:47:30.720 --> 02:47:33.600
diaz do though oh my god i remember

02:47:33.600 --> 02:47:35.520
thinking that yeah but the second floor

02:47:35.520 --> 02:47:37.439
the third one's next i guarantee you uh

02:47:37.439 --> 02:47:39.520
yeah it's got to be that's it it's got

02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:40.960
it that's the fight you can't go right

02:47:40.960 --> 02:47:43.760
back how does this

02:47:44.240 --> 02:47:46.399
if nate diaz had fights with no time

02:47:46.399 --> 02:47:48.399
limit he'd win them all except the

02:47:48.399 --> 02:47:50.800
undefeated that last one

02:47:50.800 --> 02:47:53.279
what the [ __ ] crazy he was i mean that's

02:47:53.279 --> 02:47:55.600
my it hurts leon edwards

you didn't care about it oh my god i had

02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:00.720
an argument with someone they were like

02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:03.600
yeah he let uh he let uh leon off the

02:48:03.600 --> 02:48:04.800
hook he should have gone after him like

02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:05.840
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:07.760

to the first fight

02:49:28.720 --> 02:49:30.399
when nate diaz and connor were doing

02:49:30.399 --> 02:49:31.680
interviews with each other i was like

02:49:31.680 --> 02:49:33.920
dude nate diaz is the

02:49:33.920 --> 02:49:36.399
[ __ ] because connor was getting into

everybody's [ __ ] heads yeah talking

02:49:38.640 --> 02:49:40.080

02:49:42.479 --> 02:49:44.080
interview with like

like a gazelle i'm a lion i'll [ __ ]

02:49:52.960 --> 02:49:55.520
terry apart and nate just goes

02:49:55.520 --> 02:49:59.680
no one even knows what a gazelle is dude

02:50:00.080 --> 02:50:01.359
immediately i was like well that guy's

02:50:01.359 --> 02:50:04.240
gonna win dude

02:50:04.319 --> 02:50:06.640
oh in the same interview connor connor

02:50:06.640 --> 02:50:08.319
was like i'll probably knock him out in

02:50:08.319 --> 02:50:10.479
the first round and he was like he

02:50:10.479 --> 02:50:11.760
better

02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:13.840
i was just like oh

02:50:13.840 --> 02:50:15.279
it's the biggest [ __ ] talk i've ever

02:50:15.279 --> 02:50:17.600
heard in my life i was telling people

02:50:17.600 --> 02:50:19.439
going into that fight because it was a

02:50:19.439 --> 02:50:21.520
last minute replacement

02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:24.399
someone got injured oh yeah yeah he

02:50:24.399 --> 02:50:26.640
[ __ ] dude this interview is

02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:29.200
incredible i think it was rafael dos

02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:30.319
anjos

02:50:30.319 --> 02:50:32.399
who's a dangerous fight for connor he's

02:50:32.399 --> 02:50:33.760
like nate come on

02:50:33.760 --> 02:50:34.840
go get her

02:50:34.840 --> 02:50:38.160
coffee and connor did you change your

02:50:38.160 --> 02:50:40.399
your approach once it got named nate for

02:50:40.399 --> 02:50:42.240
your fight

02:50:42.240 --> 02:50:44.240
the only approach i changed is i dug the

02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:46.080
grave a little bit wider a little bit

02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:49.040
longer for nate's skinny fat long body

02:50:49.040 --> 02:50:52.560
that's the only difference i made

02:50:53.279 --> 02:50:55.520
connor says this has been the easiest uh

02:50:55.520 --> 02:50:57.279
training week of his career do you think

02:50:57.279 --> 02:51:00.160
he's walking in

02:51:02.399 --> 02:51:04.800
look at the lineups he has fought little

02:51:04.800 --> 02:51:06.800
nobodies

02:51:06.800 --> 02:51:08.880
look at my last 20 fights

02:51:08.880 --> 02:51:12.080
better step it up for this one

02:51:12.080 --> 02:51:14.960
connor your response to that

02:51:14.960 --> 02:51:17.279
his last fight was a decision i bounce

02:51:17.279 --> 02:51:19.760
heads off the canvas every time against

02:51:19.760 --> 02:51:23.359
a normal sized human being

02:51:24.319 --> 02:51:25.920
i mean it's a fifth grader

02:51:25.920 --> 02:51:28.080
it's incredible that you actually like

02:51:28.080 --> 02:51:30.560
nick and nate as your opinion changed

02:51:30.560 --> 02:51:33.840
about that now after this week

02:51:33.840 --> 02:51:35.600
no there's no emotions in it i have no

02:51:35.600 --> 02:51:36.880
problem with him i'm going to slap the

02:51:36.880 --> 02:51:40.560
head off him it's business as usual

02:51:41.359 --> 02:51:43.840
and you know i'll i'll let his gazelle

02:51:43.840 --> 02:51:46.840
team

02:51:58.160 --> 02:52:01.399
you'll know

02:52:04.399 --> 02:52:05.520
what's your approach how do you think

02:52:05.520 --> 02:52:07.920
this fight's gonna go down

02:52:07.920 --> 02:52:09.359
yeah we're gonna see what happens on

02:52:09.359 --> 02:52:11.439
saturday we'll see

02:52:11.439 --> 02:52:14.000
better hope he better hope yeah he

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:17.120
better hope he gets that knockout

02:52:17.120 --> 02:52:18.560
better hope he gets that knockout

02:52:18.560 --> 02:52:22.160
otherwise he'll be deaf knight for him

02:52:22.160 --> 02:52:24.000
and connor if you don't get the knockout

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:27.040
is it a dub night for you

02:52:27.040 --> 02:52:29.840
if he's still conscious when he hits the

02:52:29.840 --> 02:52:30.800
mat

02:52:30.800 --> 02:52:33.120
i will crush his hips and pass his guard

02:52:33.120 --> 02:52:34.960
and mount him until you get right

02:52:34.960 --> 02:52:39.359
out by two handle him how are you like

02:52:39.359 --> 02:52:41.359
around his long frame

02:52:41.359 --> 02:52:43.439
a boa constrictor wrapping around the

02:52:43.439 --> 02:52:47.600
gazelle you were submitted by lanes

02:52:49.279 --> 02:52:51.279
i was not even that long ago like a week

02:52:51.279 --> 02:52:51.740
ago

02:52:51.740 --> 02:52:57.570
[Laughter]

02:53:07.200 --> 02:53:08.640
are you intimidated at all there's going

02:53:08.640 --> 02:53:10.880
to be a massive contingent of irish fans

02:53:10.880 --> 02:53:12.720
just like uh they're looking for a kind

02:53:12.720 --> 02:53:13.840
of movement

02:53:13.840 --> 02:53:16.720
intimidated at all by that

02:53:16.720 --> 02:53:20.200
no never

02:53:22.150 --> 02:53:25.240
[Music]

02:53:26.640 --> 02:53:28.560
that [ __ ] that that line when he was

02:53:28.560 --> 02:53:29.520
like

02:53:29.520 --> 02:53:30.560
yeah i'll probably knock him out in the

02:53:30.560 --> 02:53:31.920
first round he's like he better he bet

02:53:31.920 --> 02:53:33.920
he he better [ __ ] get that can i just

02:53:33.920 --> 02:53:35.359
say something right now they should

02:53:35.359 --> 02:53:38.160
never do interviews this way is the the

02:53:38.160 --> 02:53:40.240
dumbest most disconnected

02:53:40.240 --> 02:53:42.479
guys well not only that there's two guys

02:53:42.479 --> 02:53:44.479
who not i don't know if they're mma fans

02:53:44.479 --> 02:53:45.520
i don't know how much they know about

02:53:45.520 --> 02:53:47.279
mma and they have written questions on

02:53:47.279 --> 02:53:49.120
pieces of paper and they're throwing it

02:53:49.120 --> 02:53:51.200
out of two guys who are literally about

02:53:51.200 --> 02:53:53.279
to engage in the most important fight

02:53:53.279 --> 02:53:55.439
yeah they're low they're laughing yeah

02:53:55.439 --> 02:53:57.680
they're having fun these guys should be

02:53:57.680 --> 02:54:00.080
in a room somewhere together and they

02:54:00.080 --> 02:54:02.479
should be a skilled moderator like a max

02:54:02.479 --> 02:54:04.399
kellerman type dude who could talk to

02:54:04.399 --> 02:54:05.520
those guys well that's because they

02:54:05.520 --> 02:54:08.520
should have that's because that was

02:54:08.520 --> 02:54:10.479
2015

02:54:10.479 --> 02:54:12.160
somewhere so it was right it was right

02:54:12.160 --> 02:54:13.120
before

02:54:13.120 --> 02:54:15.680
like that fight really made

02:54:15.680 --> 02:54:17.520
mma

02:54:17.520 --> 02:54:18.880
it's starting to get to the point where

02:54:18.880 --> 02:54:21.439
it's treated like the nba or the nfl

02:54:21.439 --> 02:54:23.120
well the big thing they start respecting

02:54:23.120 --> 02:54:25.040
it enough to not have guys on [ __ ]

02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:28.000
fox sports whatever what's up jimmy

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
oh nice lamest lineup of training

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.160
partners i ever even heard of i'm just

02:54:32.160 --> 02:54:34.000
looking at your little friends yeah and

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:35.840
it just reminds me of an injured gazelle

02:54:35.840 --> 02:54:39.279
yeah strapped up people don't know

02:54:39.279 --> 02:54:42.240
what that means

02:54:43.520 --> 02:54:47.399
people don't know what that means

02:54:51.120 --> 02:54:53.680
just those guys talking about mma in

02:54:53.680 --> 02:54:56.080
that context it seems so preposterous

02:54:56.080 --> 02:54:57.359
with their little score cards like

02:54:57.359 --> 02:54:59.120
reading off like the little yeah little

02:54:59.120 --> 02:55:01.040
like gotcha questions

02:55:01.040 --> 02:55:03.680
that's uh it's old media man the money

02:55:03.680 --> 02:55:05.920
the money interview the like cnn

02:55:05.920 --> 02:55:07.600
business or whatever that was there's a

02:55:07.600 --> 02:55:11.040
lady asking him questions and it's just

02:55:11.040 --> 02:55:13.200
he's like ah nate we're talking money

02:55:13.200 --> 02:55:15.439

02:55:15.439 --> 02:55:17.920
like takes the mic off he's like [ __ ]

02:55:17.920 --> 02:55:21.040
this that's funny and she

02:55:21.040 --> 02:55:23.439
did she know about mma no definitely not

02:55:23.439 --> 02:55:25.120
she's talking to connor and she's like

02:55:25.120 --> 02:55:26.560
uh

02:55:26.560 --> 02:55:28.399
she's like what's uh what's your plan

02:55:28.399 --> 02:55:30.479
he's like my plan is to make a hundred

02:55:30.479 --> 02:55:32.800
million dollars and she's like how are

02:55:32.800 --> 02:55:35.439

02:55:35.439 --> 02:55:38.800
steaming right along it's stephen

02:55:38.800 --> 02:55:41.520
and the time he was it [ __ ] it i

02:55:41.520 --> 02:55:44.560
i remember him saying she said he said

02:55:44.560 --> 02:55:45.600

now he goes i'm steaming right along

02:55:50.080 --> 02:55:51.760
so i googled his net worth at the time

02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:54.560
it was like maybe a million

02:55:54.560 --> 02:55:56.319

02:55:56.319 --> 02:55:58.479
his confidence and now now he is now he

02:55:58.479 --> 02:55:59.600

half a billion now he's yeah

02:56:03.680 --> 02:56:06.319

02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:31.600
example of

02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:32.800
like you know how i was talking about

02:56:32.800 --> 02:56:34.640
earlier about like when you see someone

02:56:34.640 --> 02:56:36.880

02:56:36.880 --> 02:56:39.680

even want to fight the way he's fighting

02:58:10.240 --> 02:58:12.000

floyd mayweather as rich as he is and

02:58:20.800 --> 02:58:22.560
he's a one of the all-time greats if not

02:58:22.560 --> 02:58:24.640
the greatest boxer of all time he's

02:58:24.640 --> 02:58:26.560
fighting people that have zero chance of

02:58:26.560 --> 02:58:28.319
beating him yeah right because he's

02:58:28.319 --> 02:58:29.200
smart

02:58:29.200 --> 02:58:30.479
because like he's like i'm just gonna

02:58:30.479 --> 02:58:32.319
make a lot of money here connor is

02:58:32.319 --> 02:58:34.560
fighting dustin poirier

he's fighting cowboy cerrone he's

02:58:36.560 --> 02:58:39.040
fighting khabib nurmagomedov while he's

02:58:39.040 --> 02:58:41.200
worth hundreds of millions terrifying as

02:58:41.200 --> 02:58:42.880
that guy's responses to these things

02:58:42.880 --> 02:58:46.240
he's my favorite responsibility scariest

02:58:46.240 --> 02:58:48.399
there's nothing like when when conor was

02:58:48.399 --> 02:58:50.800
like i only count knockouts in my record

02:58:50.800 --> 02:58:53.040
and then you just see like a reply from

02:58:53.040 --> 02:58:55.279
khabib it's like i take people into deep

02:58:55.279 --> 02:58:57.359
waters and they discover themselves it's

02:58:57.359 --> 02:58:58.560
like dude

02:58:58.560 --> 02:59:01.200
what the [ __ ] is this guy talking what's

02:59:01.200 --> 02:59:03.680
scarier than a white muslim just talking

02:59:03.680 --> 02:59:06.399
[ __ ] i take people into deep waters and

02:59:06.399 --> 02:59:08.560
they discover themselves that should be

02:59:08.560 --> 02:59:11.040
the name of his book dude that should be

02:59:11.040 --> 02:59:14.960
the title of his book social media

02:59:27.040 --> 02:59:29.359
not even oh from all the way from dubai

02:59:29.359 --> 02:59:31.359
to usa thank you so much brother these

02:59:31.359 --> 02:59:33.760
are my scariest and my favorite favorite

02:59:33.760 --> 02:59:37.120
this are my favorite dates

02:59:37.120 --> 02:59:39.040
bro he smashed everybody there's never

02:59:39.040 --> 02:59:41.279
been a guy like him that guy made it to

02:59:41.279 --> 02:59:43.920
undefeated as a world champion and the

02:59:43.920 --> 02:59:46.640
last guy he beat was what many people

02:59:46.640 --> 02:59:48.000
thought would be his most dangerous

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:49.520
challenge and he almost had him in the

02:59:49.520 --> 02:59:51.279
first round he got him in the second oh

02:59:51.279 --> 02:59:53.040
he's the greatest of all time that that

02:59:53.040 --> 02:59:54.560
wasn't even close

02:59:54.560 --> 02:59:57.040
pourier

03:00:00.960 --> 03:00:03.120
it was just like uh

03:00:03.120 --> 03:00:04.720
a few adjustments

03:00:04.720 --> 03:00:06.880
and maybe if he was less tired you never

03:00:06.880 --> 03:00:10.319
know like a human's a human and but yeah

03:00:10.319 --> 03:00:12.479
but that guy really elite grapplers it's

03:00:12.479 --> 03:00:14.479
hard to submit a man they just they can

03:00:14.479 --> 03:00:16.560
get out of stuff better good god that

03:00:16.560 --> 03:00:18.640
guy's up there [ __ ] wrestling bears

03:00:18.640 --> 03:00:20.080
in the mountains when he was a little

03:00:20.080 --> 03:00:22.000
kid

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:24.399
he was someone i keep bringing up these

03:00:24.399 --> 03:00:26.240
[ __ ] ufc interviews but there's one

03:00:26.240 --> 03:00:29.600
with him and i think it was max holloway

03:00:29.600 --> 03:00:32.560
and khabib's just like you're american

03:00:32.560 --> 03:00:34.640
don't talk to me about fighting

03:00:34.640 --> 03:00:37.279
wow and it was just like

03:00:37.279 --> 03:00:40.160
wow terrifying bro that fight never took

03:00:40.160 --> 03:00:42.000
place they pulled mass

03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:43.920
yeah max was cutting weight and they the

03:00:43.920 --> 03:00:46.240
the new york athletic commission decided

03:00:46.240 --> 03:00:48.640
he was too too skinny he couldn't make

03:00:48.640 --> 03:00:50.319
it couldn't make the weight

03:00:50.319 --> 03:00:51.439
and he's like i could have made the

03:00:51.439 --> 03:00:52.640
weight he goes yeah it would have been

03:00:52.640 --> 03:00:53.920
hard but i could have made the weight

03:00:53.920 --> 03:00:55.279
it's good you just stepped in and

03:00:55.279 --> 03:00:56.399
decided

03:00:56.399 --> 03:00:58.080
i don't know man you know of course

03:00:58.080 --> 03:01:01.040
that's how fighting goes max was uh the

03:01:01.040 --> 03:01:02.720
problem was he's losing a lot of weight

03:01:02.720 --> 03:01:04.479
over a short amount of time but when it

03:01:04.479 --> 03:01:06.880
comes to skill level max is at a very

03:01:06.880 --> 03:01:10.160
very very high level very high level

03:01:10.160 --> 03:01:11.120
and

03:01:11.120 --> 03:01:13.120
he's also a very good grappler and he's

03:01:13.120 --> 03:01:15.359
really good moving so if he could

03:01:15.359 --> 03:01:17.520
if he can keep the fight going the thing

03:01:17.520 --> 03:01:19.279
about a guy like max holloway is like he

03:01:19.279 --> 03:01:20.399
never gets tired

03:01:20.399 --> 03:01:22.080
so if he can get you into the third

03:01:22.080 --> 03:01:23.359
fourth and fifth round if you don't have

03:01:23.359 --> 03:01:25.600
the cardio to keep up with max you're

03:01:25.600 --> 03:01:27.760
[ __ ] yeah yeah because he throws crazy

03:01:27.760 --> 03:01:29.920
volume like the the last fight that he

03:01:29.920 --> 03:01:31.279
had

03:01:31.279 --> 03:01:33.760
with uh calvin kater is like literally

03:01:33.760 --> 03:01:35.439
one of the greatest performances i've

03:01:35.439 --> 03:01:37.359
ever seen inside the octagon against

03:01:37.359 --> 03:01:39.760
calvin a guy who's like really [ __ ]

03:01:39.760 --> 03:01:44.240
dangerous man like real real scary guy

03:01:44.240 --> 03:01:45.439
knowing

03:01:45.439 --> 03:01:48.240
no one is ever close to as scary as

03:01:48.240 --> 03:01:50.560
khabib though

03:01:50.560 --> 03:01:51.840
[ __ ] that while he was fighting

03:01:51.840 --> 03:01:54.319
connor and he was like now we talk yeah

03:01:54.319 --> 03:01:56.240
we're talking holy [ __ ] let's talk now

03:01:56.240 --> 03:01:57.840
while he's punching him in the face the

03:01:57.840 --> 03:01:59.680
best thing he said during the lead up to

03:01:59.680 --> 03:02:01.120
the conor fighting he goes i want to

03:02:01.120 --> 03:02:02.220
change his face

03:02:02.220 --> 03:02:05.439
[Music]

03:02:05.439 --> 03:02:07.680
think about seeing that like i get upset

03:02:07.680 --> 03:02:09.359
about comments like he's not that funny

03:02:09.359 --> 03:02:11.040
i'm like what'd you say but i'm telling

03:02:11.040 --> 03:02:14.080

03:02:14.080 --> 03:02:16.319
like those guys all need each other it's

03:02:16.319 --> 03:02:18.240
crazy as that sounds like the sport

03:02:18.240 --> 03:02:20.720
needs a khabib you need a guy who's so

03:02:20.720 --> 03:02:23.359
ultra super dominant that he makes

03:02:23.359 --> 03:02:25.760
everybody else rise up yeah they're all

03:02:25.760 --> 03:02:27.840
better because of khabib nate nathan

03:02:27.840 --> 03:02:31.120
connor yeah nate

03:02:33.200 --> 03:02:35.279
he needed someone who's a no-nonsense

03:02:35.279 --> 03:02:38.080
guy because he's all about all this

03:02:38.080 --> 03:02:40.240
style and all the yeah they're [ __ ]

03:02:40.240 --> 03:02:42.240
talking to expensive watches and driving

03:02:42.240 --> 03:02:44.000
around the roles look at that's where i

03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:46.160
have that happening really three men

03:02:46.160 --> 03:02:48.319
died making this watch yeah

03:02:48.319 --> 03:02:50.000
it's like

03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:52.399
what a truly bad thing to say meanwhile

03:02:52.399 --> 03:02:57.160
he drives a toyota truck yeah

03:02:57.359 --> 03:02:58.880
it's like that kind of a person like

03:02:58.880 --> 03:02:59.920
he's not

03:02:59.920 --> 03:03:02.399
he's just about hard work man that's a

03:03:02.399 --> 03:03:03.920
wild picture man

03:03:03.920 --> 03:03:06.800
it's a wild picture now we talk it had

03:03:06.800 --> 03:03:08.880
to be oh that had to be a bummer getting

03:03:08.880 --> 03:03:10.560
hit by somebody being like now you want

03:03:10.560 --> 03:03:12.640
to talk it was a wild fight to call man

03:03:12.640 --> 03:03:14.240
because then the melee broke out after

03:03:14.240 --> 03:03:15.600
the fight because khabib wasn't done

03:03:15.600 --> 03:03:16.880
people were talking [ __ ] on the side of

03:03:16.880 --> 03:03:18.479
the ropes or the side of the cage right

03:03:18.479 --> 03:03:20.720
he jumped over the cage went after him

03:03:20.720 --> 03:03:22.240
like that's a wild [ __ ] that's

03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:24.240
the craziest thing ever wild having a

03:03:24.240 --> 03:03:26.240
fight for four rounds with conor

03:03:26.240 --> 03:03:27.760
mcgregor and then jumping over the cage

03:03:27.760 --> 03:03:30.640
and [ __ ] up people in the crowd

03:03:30.640 --> 03:03:31.520

no business

03:03:38.600 --> 03:03:40.960

03:03:48.160 --> 03:03:50.479
true though yeah of course it is hard

03:03:50.479 --> 03:03:52.800
places create hard people that's a hard

03:03:52.800 --> 03:03:55.200
[ __ ]

03:03:55.200 --> 03:03:56.960
kind of incredible

03:03:56.960 --> 03:03:59.200
people like that are so important

03:03:59.200 --> 03:04:01.040
he's one of the best for sure now i

03:04:01.040 --> 03:04:03.439
don't know about the best like

03:04:03.439 --> 03:04:05.040
no as a character

03:04:05.040 --> 03:04:06.840
the best

03:04:06.840 --> 03:04:09.359
ever but all of them

03:04:09.359 --> 03:04:10.960
you know what this is why

03:04:10.960 --> 03:04:12.560
i've never gotten into pro wrestling

03:04:12.560 --> 03:04:15.520
like these guys exist in reality yeah

03:04:15.520 --> 03:04:17.279
they're not scripted and i know people

03:04:17.279 --> 03:04:19.359
love pro wrestling and i get it and i

03:04:19.359 --> 03:04:21.680
got into these whole a e documentaries

03:04:21.680 --> 03:04:23.120
on pro wrestling it was recently they

03:04:23.120 --> 03:04:24.800
were really good i was like oh i get pro

03:04:24.800 --> 03:04:27.040
wrestling yeah but for me

03:04:27.040 --> 03:04:29.840
the real people are the fascinating ones

03:04:29.840 --> 03:04:31.760
like the re like conor mcgregor like

03:04:31.760 --> 03:04:33.680
that's who he is man

03:04:33.680 --> 03:04:36.080
dustin poy that's who he is that's

03:04:36.080 --> 03:04:38.880
what's fascinating to me francis ingano

03:04:38.880 --> 03:04:40.960
talking about working in the sand mines

03:04:40.960 --> 03:04:42.880
when he was 10 years old

03:04:42.880 --> 03:04:45.450
digging wet sand ah what the [ __ ]

03:04:45.450 --> 03:04:46.560
[Music]

03:04:46.560 --> 03:04:48.640
[ __ ] imagine can you [ __ ] imagine

03:04:48.640 --> 03:04:52.720
if you had to fight [ __ ] francis

03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:56.319
just the paralyzing fear you have you're

03:04:56.319 --> 03:04:58.880
a firefighter you're a firefighter in

03:04:58.880 --> 03:05:00.880
cleveland

03:05:00.880 --> 03:05:02.160
but he's also the greatest heavyweight

03:05:02.160 --> 03:05:04.640
of all time of course france has fought

03:05:04.640 --> 03:05:06.160
and knocked out the greatest heavyweight

03:05:06.160 --> 03:05:08.720
of all time and stephen myoches yeah

03:05:08.720 --> 03:05:11.439
it's crazy francis is a

03:05:11.439 --> 03:05:14.319

03:06:18.560 --> 03:06:20.160
he's a nice guy

03:06:20.160 --> 03:06:21.920
he doesn't want to destroy those nuts i

03:06:21.920 --> 03:06:24.000
love the fact that they are like these

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:25.680
dudes are such warriors that they're

03:06:25.680 --> 03:06:28.399
like they speak in like that's like true

03:06:28.399 --> 03:06:30.880
yeah like tribal like did he extend his

03:06:30.880 --> 03:06:32.880
legacy yet yeah because i'm about to end

03:06:32.880 --> 03:06:34.319
it

03:06:34.319 --> 03:06:36.560
well also he's well aware of what he can

03:06:36.560 --> 03:06:39.040
do to pulverize those nuts dude that

03:06:39.040 --> 03:06:40.880
yeah if he uppercuts you in the nuts

03:06:40.880 --> 03:06:42.960
that's a wrap if a girl if a kid hits

03:06:42.960 --> 03:06:44.560
you in the balls it's not good get socks

03:06:44.560 --> 03:06:46.800
by a kid

03:06:46.800 --> 03:06:48.800
i know a couple guys who lost their lost

03:06:48.800 --> 03:06:50.880
a ball from sparring

03:06:50.880 --> 03:06:52.560
like they didn't have a cup on or did

03:06:52.560 --> 03:06:53.680
something stupid one of the guys was

03:06:53.680 --> 03:06:55.120
fighting the ufc

03:06:55.120 --> 03:06:57.200
he got kicked in the nuts in a sparring

03:06:57.200 --> 03:06:59.200
session he didn't bother putting his cup

03:06:59.200 --> 03:07:00.800
on thought he was sparring light

03:07:00.800 --> 03:07:03.359
ruptured his testicle he lost it now

03:07:03.359 --> 03:07:06.800
he's got one nut he ruptured it yep

03:07:06.800 --> 03:07:08.479
got kicked to the part where it got

03:07:08.479 --> 03:07:09.760
pulverized

03:07:09.760 --> 03:07:12.160
and these are you know 170 pound men i

03:07:12.160 --> 03:07:14.479
don't know about the [ __ ]

03:07:14.479 --> 03:07:16.479
the strength of a testicle does it get

03:07:16.479 --> 03:07:18.880
larger when you get bigger i don't

03:07:18.880 --> 03:07:21.680
but if a guy's a 170 pound man he can

03:07:21.680 --> 03:07:24.319
crush your nuts what is a 270-pound man

03:07:24.319 --> 03:07:26.800
do and a 270-pound man is the most

03:07:26.800 --> 03:07:29.760
terrifying puncher or one of

03:07:29.760 --> 03:07:30.800
since

03:07:30.800 --> 03:07:32.720
you know in the history of the sport the

03:07:32.720 --> 03:07:34.560
only other guy is as terrifying as him

03:07:34.560 --> 03:07:36.000
is derek lewis

03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:38.720
who uh they were supposed to fight but

03:07:38.720 --> 03:07:40.160
now it looks like derrick lewis is going

03:07:40.160 --> 03:07:41.600
to fight um

03:07:41.600 --> 03:07:44.399
cyril gone god the interim title if they

03:07:44.399 --> 03:07:45.920
made derek it's almost like they

03:07:45.920 --> 03:07:47.840
shouldn't have heavyweights

03:07:47.840 --> 03:07:50.000
why is that it's so bad

03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:53.040
if they hit you dude it's so bad

03:07:53.040 --> 03:07:54.800
like you derek who is first in ghana

03:07:54.800 --> 03:07:55.760
yeah

03:07:55.760 --> 03:07:57.359
that's bad

03:07:57.359 --> 03:07:58.720
we shouldn't do it

03:07:58.720 --> 03:08:00.399
it's like russell peters dad would say

03:08:00.399 --> 03:08:02.080
somebody's gonna get a hurt real bad

03:08:02.080 --> 03:08:04.399
somebody one of those dudes is leaving

03:08:04.399 --> 03:08:06.080
bad but the first fight was they were

03:08:06.080 --> 03:08:08.240
both very hesitant to pull the trigger

03:08:08.240 --> 03:08:09.920
because there's somebody's gonna die the

03:08:09.920 --> 03:08:11.840
repercussions are so extreme

03:08:11.840 --> 03:08:13.920
because both guys have like super legit

03:08:13.920 --> 03:08:15.600
one punch knockout power they need to

03:08:15.600 --> 03:08:17.439
let that [ __ ] moutinho guy fight in

03:08:17.439 --> 03:08:18.720
ghana

03:08:18.720 --> 03:08:20.000
who's that the dude who was just

03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:23.200
swallowing everything o'malley had oh

03:08:23.200 --> 03:08:26.160
chris matino yeah that kid that's a

03:08:26.160 --> 03:08:28.560
tough [ __ ] kid it's crazy that's a

03:08:28.560 --> 03:08:30.319
tough time

03:08:30.319 --> 03:08:32.080
[ __ ] crazy swallowed everything and

03:08:32.080 --> 03:08:33.840
was talking [ __ ] it's just getting

03:08:33.840 --> 03:08:36.880
popped and o'malley is a sniper yeah you

03:08:36.880 --> 03:08:39.040
know o'malley had i believe i don't want

03:08:39.040 --> 03:08:40.800
to misquote this but i believe he he

03:08:40.800 --> 03:08:42.800
broke two records in that fight or came

03:08:42.800 --> 03:08:44.560
close to one record

03:08:44.560 --> 03:08:46.640
of the over a three round fight the

03:08:46.640 --> 03:08:49.680
highest percentage of accuracy yeah yeah

03:08:49.680 --> 03:08:52.160
i think he broke every jab yeah like

03:08:52.160 --> 03:08:54.560
it was in the 80

03:08:54.560 --> 03:08:56.240
somewhere in 80 percent of all the shots

03:08:56.240 --> 03:08:58.479
he threw landed and i think he landed

03:08:58.479 --> 03:09:00.640
the most amount of strikes which is

03:09:00.640 --> 03:09:03.200
crazy too that moutinho kid is chris

03:09:03.200 --> 03:09:06.080
montino is a monster he's a monster he's

03:09:06.080 --> 03:09:08.000
getting bored you can't keep doing that

03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:09.439
no

03:09:09.439 --> 03:09:10.800
no you can't

03:09:10.800 --> 03:09:12.960
that's good that was it that was good

03:09:12.960 --> 03:09:14.479
you were good for one on that one look

03:09:14.479 --> 03:09:16.640
he's a legend now no matter what if he

03:09:16.640 --> 03:09:18.080
retired for the rest of his life that

03:09:18.080 --> 03:09:19.920
kid's a legend i was just i was really

03:09:19.920 --> 03:09:21.520
shocked they stopped that fight i didn't

03:09:21.520 --> 03:09:23.840
know what to say it was 30 seconds yeah

03:09:23.840 --> 03:09:25.040
it was i think it was less i think it

03:09:25.040 --> 03:09:26.960
was in the 20s but it's like

03:09:26.960 --> 03:09:29.760
the thing is like herp dean is the best

03:09:29.760 --> 03:09:31.840
like if he stops a fight i like oh man

03:09:31.840 --> 03:09:34.080
maybe he's seeing some [ __ ] i think i

03:09:34.080 --> 03:09:36.080
think he knew

03:09:36.080 --> 03:09:38.479
o'malley had to finish him for

03:09:38.479 --> 03:09:41.120
o'malley's sake like sean o'malley was

03:09:41.120 --> 03:09:42.720
gonna go for the kill

03:09:42.720 --> 03:09:44.080
oh yeah and it was like we don't even

03:09:44.080 --> 03:09:45.760
need to waste our [ __ ] time on this i

03:09:45.760 --> 03:09:47.120
understand

03:09:47.120 --> 03:09:48.720
he went the distance

03:09:48.720 --> 03:09:50.640
but like we don't need this

03:09:50.640 --> 03:09:52.399
certainly vicious knockout that is

03:09:52.399 --> 03:09:53.840
coming i think you're probably

03:09:53.840 --> 03:09:56.399
absolutely right especially got like a

03:09:56.399 --> 03:09:58.000
guy like herb who's like super

03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:00.319
considerate and really

03:10:00.319 --> 03:10:02.399
he's about protecting fighters that

03:10:02.399 --> 03:10:05.040
aren't defending themselves

03:10:05.040 --> 03:10:06.960
he's trying his hands up but the thing

03:10:06.960 --> 03:10:08.880
is like

03:10:08.880 --> 03:10:11.040
o'malley was just sliding those punches

03:10:11.040 --> 03:10:12.720
straight through those gloves around

03:10:12.720 --> 03:10:14.880
those gloves he was laying at head kicks

03:10:14.880 --> 03:10:16.800
body kicks he was going like this yeah

03:10:16.800 --> 03:10:18.000
he's dribbling he's pretending he was

03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:19.760
joking around yeah he's like yo this

03:10:19.760 --> 03:10:21.920

so durable they're always in insane

03:11:33.120 --> 03:11:34.239
shape they don't get tired like
