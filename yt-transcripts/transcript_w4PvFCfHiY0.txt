Title: Logotherapy 4- Sources of Meaning
Description: In this video we talk about sources of meaning through what a few types of values. We also talk about how to balance outer and inner focus in terms of yourself and those around you and how a good balance of those two things can give us a sense of meaning.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
hey and welcome back this is logotherapy

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.570
4.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.869
[Music]

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.679
so in the last video we talked about why

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:16.880
so many of us in the west

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.880
lack a sense of meaning and purpose even

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.880
though science has given us so much

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.119
cool stuff and also stop babies from

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.160
dying by a lot

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.560
but despite all the awesome stuff we

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.640
have here in the west

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.400
the number of us who are opting to kill

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.480
ourselves is increasing as well

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.079
it's like yeah sure getting my phone

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.920
charger sent to my house the day i order

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.600
it is pretty sweet but that window's

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.879
looking pretty good too look

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.239
kind of want to fall out of it and land

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.399
on my neck we also talked about

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.320
certain things we can do to alleviate

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.160
the sense of meaninglessness

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.680
um which you can watch in the video

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.160
before this one logotherapy three

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.039
but logotherapy really in short victor

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.719
frankel tells people to open up a line

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.800
of communication with themselves

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.559
set aside time to just check in with

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.199
themselves and try to

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.159
tune in to the radio station that would

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:05.360
be your inner voice

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.240
if that is a if that works as an analogy

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.000
for you if it doesn't just

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.280
try to be honest with yourself is

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.840
another way to say it but

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.600
you know logotherapy wants us to try to

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.680
be a beacon fueled by our unique

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.520
inner light rather than just mirroring

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.960
what's being beamed at us

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.680
from outside it holds the view that each

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.360
human is in possession of a unique

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.200
intermission that needs to be discovered

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.799
and then carried out rather than just

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.560
scrolling social media and being like oh

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.840
wow look at this video

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.360
wow that's so crazy or i don't like that

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.759
can you guys believe this governor he

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.360
slashed the bill i heard about on the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.240
news

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.159
[Music]

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.920
do you guys know what sucks me

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.040
that's [ __ ] according to frankel

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.280
you got stuff to do and if you were to

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.720
sit there and just all day long be

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.079
concerned about stuff outside of

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.280
yourself

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.799
that has nothing to do with you most

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.240
likely you're going to experience a

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.079
sense of a lack of meaning or

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.040
purpose and try to not confuse the idea

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.759
of not

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.920
focusing on the quote stuff that has

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.679
nothing to do with you with being

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:10.800
selfish

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.120
the idea here is that our time is better

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.280
spent figuring out our own self

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.120
so that our actions can become a net

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.720
positive for whatever group we care

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.520
about serving

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.080
whether that be our squad or family or

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.440
even the entire world

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.200
what i'm saying is that focusing on the

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.120
outer stuff without doing the inner work

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.120
is like making someone a bowl of cereal

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.560
without pouring in some milk

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.560
the idea of frankel's inner focus isn't

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.120
to become self-obsessed or selfish but

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.000
instead it's to

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
refine our awareness through our own

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.920
uniqueness so that we can firm up the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.840
ground under our own feet and then

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.519
approach the world with the stuff that

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.120
only we can offer

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.040
rather than just armchair quarterbacking

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.800
the whole show in an ineffectual and

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.959
empty self-gratifying manner that we

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.239
know in our heart of hearts

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.959
only leaves us feeling blue so our

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.800
meaning comes not from forgetting

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.480
ourselves and serving the world or

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.760
forgetting the world and serving

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.280
ourselves but instead

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.519
it comes from figuring out how we can

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.760
properly align ourselves with the world

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.920
so that everyone wins or at least the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.760
people we care about so we can try to

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.599
bend the world to our personal pleasure

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.200
through conquest and control which

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.959
usually creates a ton of problems for

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.879
ourselves and everyone else or we can go

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.000
the passive route and just

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.080
try to blend in through conformity which

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.440
also leaves us empty and

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.680
doesn't really help anything logotherapy

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.440
is telling us to take the conquest

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.440
within to bend our own selves like an

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.040
archer we're pulling back on ourselves

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.040
like an archer pulling back on an arrow

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.080
and then aiming ourselves

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.440
at what we think is important or

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.519
meaningful and then

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.560
letting go that way we're not all jammed

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.840
up they were like we didn't want to do

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.280
this

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.000
[Music]

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.440
you know so you end up fully taking

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.959
responsibility for your own life

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.720
trajectory but in order to do that you

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.400
really got to go within and be honest

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.840
with yourself because if your life's

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.959
based on a bunch of

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.200
a bunch of white lies that add up with

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.599
you eventually having to adopt a false

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.439
persona in order to kind of live your

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.840
life

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.519
you will end up jammed up and

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.599
unfulfilled

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.400
so which then you start to kind of take

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.120
stuff out of you

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.599
it could have been something else need

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:14.720
whatever that's

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.160
logotherapy's like yeah that's your

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.600
fault so what are you going to do about

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.199
it

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:20.799
so it's not all about yourself it's not

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.800
all about the world it's about aligning

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.720
yourself properly so that you can then

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.040
go

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.600
serve those you care about in a way that

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.240
feels authentic and pleasing to yourself

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.880
as well it's what you call a 360 win we

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.400
also talked about some of frankel's

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.400
clinical ideas specifically the benefits

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.000
of shifting our awareness away from

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
ourselves and our short term wants

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.080
which is known as d reflection and how

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.000
it's often used in helping dudes who

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.400
lose or can't get boners stay

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.400
rock [ __ ] hard a funny story about

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.479
this idea of d reflection can be found

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.880
in joseph fabry's the pursuit of meaning

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.880
where a woman was told by her therapist

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.639
to tell her boyfriend who suffered from

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:57.919
erectile dysfunction

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.919
that due to a serious medical issue she

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.120
was unable to have

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.360
s-e-x meaning she could engage in

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.120
kissing over the pants manual

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.080
stimulation

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.639
or the fabled anal 69 but was under her

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.000
doctor's orders not to be

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.919
vaginally penetrated by her boyfriend's

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.840
penis due to gynecological issues

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.320
again her vagina was perfectly fine this

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.639
was just a plan set up by her therapist

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.479
which sounds [ __ ] nuts now that i say

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:21.280
this out loud

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.720
so the girlfriend tells her boyfriend

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.400
that her vagina's messed up and cannot

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.199
be penetrated under any circumstances

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.880
so i guess accepting that without any

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.479
further questions the couple spent a

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.240
weekend night just kissing and caressing

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.320
with no expectations and sure enough

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.639
the normally flaccid boyfriend called a

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:39.440
rager

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.039
and his girlfriend obviously stuffed it

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.199
into herself assuring him that she would

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.960
be medically okay and would explain

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.000
later

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.680
postcoitus she explained to her

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.199
boyfriend that the whole thing was made

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:50.720
up something her therapist told her to

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.440
try

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.880
and the dude went back to having a

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.800
perpetually soft bird as soon as the

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.400
focus went back on himself

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.319
and his performance so basically d

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.400
reflection is being able to focus

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.199
your intent outside of yourself on a

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:03.759
task

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:06.080
rather than how you are doing that task

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.440
because when you think about yourself

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.360
especially in a critical way

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.720
it can interfere with the thing you're

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.160
doing but if you just think of the thing

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.800
you're doing

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.960
and don't worry about yourself you end

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.080
up performing better

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.000
another variation of this idea is what

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
frank will calls paradoxical intention

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.720
meaning to wish for the outcome one most

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.199
fierce

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.039
in the case of our mush-dicked college

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:26.720
boyfriend instead of being tricked into

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.240
thinking his girlfriend's vagina is

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.600
defective in order to get hard

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.600
he could instead try his best to remain

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.160
as soft as humanly possible

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.880
focusing on maintaining total facility

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.840
that good

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.639
soft bird typically this idea of

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:44.720
paradoxical intention or of

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.960
humorously wishing for what we least

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.120
want to happen ends up reducing the

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.680
anticipatory anxiety that causes dudes

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.360
to lose their boners via

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.199
like we said the mechanism of humor

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:56.400
which according to frankl

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.319
is one of the ways humans can transcend

00:06:58.319 --> 00:06:59.599
their circumstances

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:01.599
by simply laughing at them of course

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:03.360
with paradoxical intention it's advised

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.360
to rule out any and all medical issues

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.639
so the person can be sure

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:08.720
their problem has a psychological basis

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.880
rather than an actual biological one

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.400
meaning if a person is scared they'll

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.919
suffer a heart attack you want to make

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:15.440
sure their heart is not actually going

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.560
to explode

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.319
before telling them to try their hardest

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:20.160
to bring one on by drinking coffee or

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.120
running or whatever

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.960
so to sum up all of frankel's clinical

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.560
contributions focusing all your

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.319
awareness on yourself [ __ ] up your

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:27.039
boners

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:28.560
if you direct your awareness toward

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.080
others or even a greater purpose

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.120
like your bros family society mankind or

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.759
even god and then actually do things

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:37.759
meaning using your own unique gifts and

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:39.440
talents to serve any of these greater

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.280
purposes you will experience a sense of

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:41.919
meaning

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:43.520
which is really just a boner for your

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.599
soul following this advice we can stay

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:46.879
spiritually erect

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:49.360
rather than mentally flaccid so the

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.960
question still remains

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.360
exactly where can we find meaning does

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.479
frankel talk about that

00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:56.080
and the short answer is yes frankel

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.680
offers us something of a road map in

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.000
terms

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.759
of different types of values to get us

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:02.000
started the first one is what's called

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.879
creative values one of the main sources

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:06.160
of meaning we can experience

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.080
comes from that which we create this can

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.840
be work life missions

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.919
hobbies or craft or anything really

00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:13.680
anything we generate and bring into the

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.560
world

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.400
it can be building a company being a

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.400
good parent teacher or mentor

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.160
completing beautiful works of art

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.240
inspiring social change or even just

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.160
showing up and doing our jobs hobbies or

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.599
whatever else we bring into the world

00:08:25.599 --> 00:08:26.400
through action

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.000
there's plenty of meaning to be found

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.840
through the things we do and even more

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.680
so if we're doing them for the sake of

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.519
someone or something outside of

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:34.399
ourselves

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:35.919
you can think of it like eating all of

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.599
us are happy to eat but if you've ever

00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:39.599
eaten many meals in a row alone it can

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:41.360
start to get a bit weird and depressing

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.279
for some reason the experience of eating

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:45.200
becomes enhanced when the meal is shared

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.000
with another

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.600
the same thing applies to the things we

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.680
do we don't just want to do things

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.680
we want the things we do to matter to

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.200
those around us we want to be

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.760
self-actualized

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.480
in a state of full self-expression kind

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.920
of like the western version of

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.200
enlightenment where rather than

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.640
meditating or letting go of our

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.320
worldliness we have the option to just

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.080
sell a billion cheeseburgers or design a

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.120
killer app as well

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.800
though frankel mentions this idea of

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.800
self-actualization and tries to steer us

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.480
away from the idea that we can

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.560
self-complete independent of others

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.640
frankl urges us instead to direct our

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.080
actualization outward

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.160
focusing it on tasks and missions rather

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.160
than trying to figure out where we stand

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.120
with ourselves

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.800
this way we can judge our actions in

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.640
terms of their effect on the systems

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.160
that we're part of whether it be family

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.240
community friend groups workplace etc

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.839
instead of just trying to greedily

00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:33.680
absorb as much of the world as possible

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.360
and asking yourself if it's enough which

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.680
you'll most likely reply

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.680
okay so to recap this idea creative

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.800
values are just

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.800
things you can do stuff you can bring

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.399
into the world through action that get

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:44.800
you

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.880
and others hopefully stoked your

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.880
creative values are totally up to you

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.480
they can be starting a company a

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.080
charitable organization or even

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.080
establishing one world government aided

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.680
by mass surveillance and a digital

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.519
currency linked to social credit

00:09:57.519 --> 00:10:00.320
experiential values is the second one

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.920
this is basically why girls want to

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.440
travel so [ __ ] much

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.120
the idea here is that not only can

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.959
meaning be had from creating and

00:10:06.959 --> 00:10:08.160
achieving but also

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.560
by experiencing cool stuff as well this

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.000
is the feeling we get when we're

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.839
watching an awesome movie or hearing a

00:10:13.839 --> 00:10:15.519
song that amazes us or

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:17.760
having a wild dream being deep in

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.600
meditation or even being stoned at the

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.519
beach the list goes on honestly

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:23.200
to include anything that sort of

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.120
captures your awareness in a state of

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.959
kind of absorption or

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:28.320
where you're not really thinking about

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.000
it you're just kind of like whoa you

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.519
know this could be catching a sunset

00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:33.600
while driving along the coast of maui

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.079
seeing the pyramids the coliseum the

00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:37.519
pacific coast highway

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:39.200
being at a concert or even just chilling

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.480
with your friends this is the stuff of

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.560
life that we can lose ourself in just by

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.839
being present for it

00:10:43.839 --> 00:10:45.839
frankel also stresses that a large part

00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:47.680
of this set of values can be gained from

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.519
truly experiencing a person in an

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:51.120
intimate relationship or a deep

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.880
friendship by getting to know them for

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.160
who they truly are

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.839
and also allowing them to get to know

00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:58.640
you in that same honest and open way

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.160
alright so you're making cool apps

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.839
you're recognizing your field as an

00:11:01.839 --> 00:11:03.600
uber genius and you're getting head

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.440
daily you have a group of devoted

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.519
friends and a lifelong romantic partner

00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:09.040
you've connected with on a deep

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.360
deep level who lets you bone other

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.800
people but they for some reason don't

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.079
want to bone anyone else it's like a

00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:15.760
one-way open relationship it's

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.399
really really chill but then in a

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:20.320
horrible twist of fate your app turns

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.079
out to have been secretly funded by the

00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:24.160
ccp and the government shuts it down

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.680
your friends leave you to chill with the

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.440
guy who started clubhouse and your

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.000
lifelong

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.680
partner who's super open-minded and

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.519
chill about your extramarital affairs

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:33.120
leaves you to spend the rest of their

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.640
years with mark mcgrath

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.720
the lead singer of sugar ray what do you

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.680
do

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.839
is there any meaning to be had now or

00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:41.519
should you just chop your dick off and

00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:42.640
drown yourself

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.640
frankel's third and final area of values

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.720
he covers is what's called attitudinal

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.519
values

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:49.440
which he believes are arguably the most

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.040
important source of meaning a human can

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.120
cultivate in their life this quote sums

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.000
up what he means

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
everything can be taken from a man but

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.639
one thing the last of the human freedoms

00:11:58.639 --> 00:12:00.880
to choose one's attitude in any given

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.320
set of circumstances

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.399
to choose one's own way and of course

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:06.959
hardly any of us have a

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:10.320
such a cut and dry [ __ ] up situation

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.240
to deal with usually life for the most

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.560
part is a blend of good and bad stuff

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.240
sometimes it's more good sometimes it's

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.839
more bad but for the most part we have a

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:18.639
little bit of both

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:20.720
but we all face the bad stuff at some

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.560
point and according to frankl

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.320
perhaps our greatest source of meaning

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.160
can be had in facing the stuff that

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.480
sucks with a proper attitude

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.079
think of socrates showing up knowing

00:12:30.079 --> 00:12:32.000
he's going to get poisoned christ on the

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:32.480
cross

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.160
or mel gibson re-entering the dating

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.079
scene this is the area of meaning that

00:12:36.079 --> 00:12:38.240
deals with that which we cannot change

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.839
during these times we're faced with the

00:12:39.839 --> 00:12:41.279
decision that we can either let our

00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:42.959
outer circumstances crush us

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:45.519
or we can at least in spirit nobly

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:46.240
accept them

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.079
no matter what we're confronted with we

00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:50.639
still get a choice as to how we face it

00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:52.240
and there is plenty of meaning to be

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.959
found in facing these things that could

00:12:54.959 --> 00:12:56.399
otherwise crush us

00:12:56.399 --> 00:12:58.800
with perseverance and courage one final

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.560
thing worth mentioning is frankl's view

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.079
on the passage of time and how it

00:13:02.079 --> 00:13:03.200
relates to meaning

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.959
but we need to understand another one of

00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:06.639
franco's concepts which he calls

00:13:06.639 --> 00:13:08.480
the meaning of the moment back in the

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.320
first video we mentioned how it's easier

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.480
to find sources of meaning by living our

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.360
small

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.040
seemingly insignificant moments

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.639
responsibly and with purpose

00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:18.320
but in order for the decisions we make

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.240
to have meaning we need to be aimed at

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.040
something

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.800
otherwise who cares what we do if we're

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.320
not worried about being strong and

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.000
healthy food is just something we stick

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.720
in our face

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.480
if we don't care about cultivating a

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.480
sharp mind who cares what we read or

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.120
don't read

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.040
if we're connecting with somebody solely

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.040
to jizz or friends just to kill some

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.440
time

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.120
what does it matter who we have in our

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.040
lives but according to frankel if we can

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.800
connect to that little voice within us

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.720
and figure out what it is telling us to

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.120
do

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.880
those thousands of small moments

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.560
throughout the day start to glow with

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.519
significance

00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:49.120
pizza no thanks i'm trying to be

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.399
shredded for my mom at the pool this

00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:51.040
summer

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.600
back pages hell no thank god it got shut

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.079
down

00:13:54.079 --> 00:13:55.760
should i watch another netflix series

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.279
that features gratuitous scenes of

00:13:57.279 --> 00:13:58.720
people pretending to be high schoolers

00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.760
having sex

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.160
no i'm a read kierkegaard instead and of

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.920
course it should be stated that none of

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.440
these things are based on some

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.320
moralistic

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.720
judgy overarching you know looking down

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.800
at your nose thing but instead

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.279
it's based on what brings you closer to

00:14:13.279 --> 00:14:15.279
the stuff you feel you're being called

00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:17.040
toward in some deep sense

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.279
what could you do that would perhaps

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:21.760
align you with the actualization stuff

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.519
we talked about the stuff that makes you

00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:25.199
feel alive and if eating ice cream and

00:14:25.199 --> 00:14:27.279
watching ncis does that for you then

00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:29.680
hell yeah that rules all of this depends

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.560
on you

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.480
there's no should you should that you

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.680
shouldn't this it's just

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.760
what works what doesn't work what are

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.519
the things you do when you do them

00:14:37.519 --> 00:14:38.959
you don't feel like killing yourself or

00:14:38.959 --> 00:14:40.240
you don't feel shitty or angry or

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.360
resentful or lost

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.880
and what kind of things do you feel

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.279
shitty after you do do them

00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:47.120
it's that simple it's up to you if you

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.160
want to keep doing the things that make

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.199
you feel shitty

00:14:49.199 --> 00:14:52.320
okay cool basically no one can tell you

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.240
what's meaningful or not meaningful but

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:54.639
you

00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:56.519
because you're the one who actually

00:14:56.519 --> 00:14:57.680
experiences

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.760
meaning whatever that means to you

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.680
though it does seem true that people who

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.760
experience life as meaningless tend to

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.000
attempt to fill that void with cheap

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.920
unproductive or even harmful thrills

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.920
like excessive alcohol drugs

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.240
meaningless or risky sex or the new

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.480
7-eleven jalapeno pretzel burger and on

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.240
and on and on and it just so happens

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.160
that people for the most part begin to

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.000
feel better when they pump the brakes on

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.839
all the crazy [ __ ] they're up to

00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:24.160
before and instead aim themselves at a

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.760
more constructive purpose

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.240
with more holistic fulfilling activities

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.240
i mean if i'm wrong on that i'm wrong

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.639
but i genuinely don't think i am all

00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:33.839
right so we're going to wrap up by

00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:35.360
checking out a passage written by

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.079
frankel

00:15:36.079 --> 00:15:38.240
in the doctor in the soul i believe he's

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.440
responding to the

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.279
all we are as dust and the wind types

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:42.880
people who would say we're all going to

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.800
get old and die so what's the point but

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.480
the frankl when a person is filling

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.399
their days with meaningful activity the

00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:50.399
passage of time is no big deal since

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:51.120
what we do

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.440
or don't do doesn't just fade away but

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.320
is quote

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.240
ensconced in the past for all of

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.560
eternity meaning if we live right

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.480
and again the definition of living right

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.160
is living in a way that works for both

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.240
ourselves and the systems we're a part

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:04.959
of

00:16:04.959 --> 00:16:06.800
the passage of time is something more

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.079
like a trophy case

00:16:08.079 --> 00:16:10.000
nothing can take away the things we did

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.519
as they were forever frozen in the

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:13.519
moment they once existed in

00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:16.160
here's a quote any philosophy which

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.079
keeps in mind the transitoriness of

00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:18.720
existence

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.720
need not be all pessimistic the

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.880
pessimist resembles a man who observes

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.639
with fear and sadness that his wall

00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:26.560
calendar from which he daily tears a

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.360
sheet grows

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.279
thinner with each passing day on the

00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:31.279
other hand the person who takes life in

00:16:31.279 --> 00:16:33.440
the sense suggested above is like a man

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.360
who removes every successive leaf from

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.120
his calendar and files it neatly and

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.959
carefully away with its predecessor

00:16:38.959 --> 00:16:40.959
after first having jotted a few notes on

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:43.040
the back he can reflect with pride and

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:43.680
joy on

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.920
all the richness set down in these notes

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.000
on all the life he has already lived to

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:48.880
the full

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.639
what will it matter to him if he notices

00:16:50.639 --> 00:16:52.959
he is growing old has he any reason to

00:16:52.959 --> 00:16:55.279
envy the young people whom he sees

00:16:55.279 --> 00:16:57.600
for the possibilities that young person

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.399
has

00:16:58.399 --> 00:17:00.959
the future that is in store for him no

00:17:00.959 --> 00:17:02.399
thank you he will think

00:17:02.399 --> 00:17:04.160
instead of possibilities i have

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.160
realities in my past

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.000
not only the reality of work done in

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.199
love loved but of suffering suffered

00:17:11.199 --> 00:17:12.959
these are the things of which i am most

00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:14.480
proud end quote

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.160
frankel goes on to talk about how the

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.160
past is forever fixed while the future

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.360
is forever open

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.919
quote this is not the case of a finished

00:17:21.919 --> 00:17:22.559
film

00:17:22.559 --> 00:17:24.640
or an already existent film which is

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.000
merely being unrolled

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.760
rather the film of this world is just

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.039
being shot which means

00:17:29.039 --> 00:17:31.039
nothing more nor less than the past

00:17:31.039 --> 00:17:33.120
happily is fixed while the future

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.120
happily still remains to be shaped

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.280
that is is at the disposal of man's

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.720
responsibility but what is

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.400
responsibility as frankl

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.840
and his answer is also pretty cool

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.919
something like responsibility as a key

00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:45.440
that opens the door to meaning

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.679
he writes quote in truth there is

00:17:47.679 --> 00:17:49.280
something about responsibility that

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.720
resembles an abyss

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.320
the longer and more profoundly we

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.320
consider it the more we become aware of

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.840
its awful depths

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.240
until a kind of giddiness overcomes us

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.039
there is something

00:17:59.039 --> 00:18:01.200
fearful about man's responsibility but

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.280
at the same time something glorious

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.799
it is fearful to know that at this

00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:06.559
moment we bear the responsibility for

00:18:06.559 --> 00:18:07.200
the next

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.200
that every decision from the smallest to

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.120
the largest is a decision for all of

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:11.919
eternity

00:18:11.919 --> 00:18:13.520
every moment holds thousands of

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.679
possibilities but we can choose only a

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.200
single one of these

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.440
all the others we have condemned damn to

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.240
never being

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.480
that too for all of eternity but it is

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.160
glorious to know that the future

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.919
our own and therewith the future of the

00:18:25.919 --> 00:18:28.160
things and people around us is dependent

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.720
even if only to a tiny extent upon our

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:43.840
decisions at any given moment

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.280
[Music]

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.360
you
