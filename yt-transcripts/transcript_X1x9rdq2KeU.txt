00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.360
me up and it was late so like i was

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.200
going to miss the connecting flight so

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.879
then i was going to

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.720

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.319
every flight now it's like it's a 50-50

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.680
dude it is

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.000
the air the flights are just chaos

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.480
what's their [ __ ] problem i have no

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.760
idea

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.920
i think they i think they might have

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.319
tried to do like a vaccine mandate on

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.840
pilots and personnel and they were like

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.599
half this [ __ ] thing left i don't

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:14.879
know though

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.040
yeah there there was a rumor of that i

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.720
saw they came out like that's not true

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.159
at all we're just all experiencing

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.599
momentary difficulties because of the

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:22.800
supply chain

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.200
yeah so supply chain dude

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.879
oh this is why my second flight was

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.440
delayed this uh flight attendant just

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.280
fainted what and had to go to the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.440
hospital so then they were like um we

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.120
need to wait another hour until the next

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.640
flight attendant gets here you would

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.159
think they could like

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.200
tough it out

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.280
yeah like look there's got to be a slot

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.080
in the on the flight that'll put the bet

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.280
you know when there's like a medical

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.120
emergency like

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.120
uh do we have any slots on the flight

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.319
that can

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.680
take over and serve fat old guys drinks

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.280
yo remember what was that movie with

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.959
like the bad pilot who like said the

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.799
miracle on the hudson well that was

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.560
sully he was good yeah everybody wasn't

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.720
doing like coke before no that's that's

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.159
flight flight i mean we've had this

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:05.280
discussion before because i thought

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.720
flight was real

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.560
flight's not real no he flies the plane

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.080
upside down i was like damn that guy's

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.439
the best that was the miracle in the

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.200
hudson no the miracle in the hudson was

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.599
just sully crash landing it into the

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.160
water so with denzel doing coke denzel

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160
doing coke yeah wasn't that based on the

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.400
hudson no there was it they just that

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.240
was just a fun movie they just both came

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.360
out at the same time that was like

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.840
armageddon and uh the other one yeah i

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.199
figured that was called

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.880
i for sure was like thought the guy who

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.600
landed the coat on hudson was on coke

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.000
dude sully would never do coke so that's

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.759
like that's like the my point is that's

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:38.960
like the morning of air i thought that

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.240
was like just one pilot that's the

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.800

come about

00:19:03.039 --> 00:19:05.039
um here's what i think i think it was

00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:08.000
the post family the cereal post cereal

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.039
yeah i think they built it okay or

00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:12.720
purchase it or whatever they they built

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.640
it's just a giant mansion at first and

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.120
then they gave it i think to truman

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.679
gotcha this is the rundown i got yeah

00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:21.120
and then truman used it as like it's

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.559
like supposed to be like the southern

00:19:22.559 --> 00:19:23.919
type white house where they go down and

00:19:23.919 --> 00:19:25.280
chill there okay kind of like a camp

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.640
david type thing

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.960
and then they gave it back they like

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.120

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.640
government or something i don't know the

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.000
state and then

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.799
i think trump was able to lowball them

00:19:36.799 --> 00:19:38.960
yeah and then he bought it

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.840

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.399
songs about like getting canceled and

00:29:48.399 --> 00:29:51.279
coming back and all the times

00:29:51.279 --> 00:29:52.799

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.799
he rules also to to be fair

00:29:58.799 --> 00:30:00.640
he went in for the kiss

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.480
so he's romantic as hell

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.480
he saw a girl he loved her what can you

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.480
do and he became overwhelmed with a

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.840
spirit of heroes dude

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.240

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.559

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.360
yeah what the [ __ ] was he thinking

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.880

him he's probably [ __ ] up yeah but

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.080

00:33:35.039 --> 00:33:37.120
walmart he might have to capture oh my

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.559
god i think that's the rules of walmart

00:33:38.559 --> 00:33:39.679
if you have beef with someone you can

00:33:39.679 --> 00:33:41.600
shoot them yeah yeah it's it's

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.360
international water they have beef it's

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.720
like oh they had bees oh they'd beef let

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.159
them go i just that should be like

00:33:46.159 --> 00:33:47.840
property rights

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.840
same thing it should be on your property

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.440
or if you have beef if you're in walmart

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.960
first and your enemy enters that is

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.320
trust property that is trespassing true

i didn't get to see him but he would

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.680
dude he was i was like

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:47.200
putting hammer i'm gonna put some yeah

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.480
whatever i would just put like an inch

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.920
of hash in there and he would just dong

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:54.520
it to the head go lay back down

00:43:55.359 --> 00:43:57.440
he was totally unaffected yeah it was

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.599
crazy beezer gets

00:43:59.599 --> 00:44:02.319

00:44:06.319 --> 00:44:08.960
came in and put on a clinic dude yeah i

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.200
mean if you hit if you hit the silence

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.000
he went on airplane mode

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.560
bees is on airplane mode

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.319

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:48.640
shoes are

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.559

[ __ ] is diet spaghetti

00:50:58.400 --> 00:50:59.680
so his

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:00.559
the

00:51:00.559 --> 00:51:03.119
the point of the book is just to

00:51:03.119 --> 00:51:05.119
let people know that like i'm not all

00:51:05.119 --> 00:51:06.880
the way done but it's basically there's

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:08.480
more than meets the eye to this thing

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:09.760
and he comes at it from like a

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:12.160
scientific as scientific as he can get

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:13.440
although he knows he has haters the

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:14.960
whole time he's like you might be

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:16.800
laughing at this but this is just a deal

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.040
it's pretty funny but his his thing on

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.880
consciousness is that it's good you read

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:23.119
these oh we got to reinforce this we

00:51:23.119 --> 00:51:24.559
need to you might think it's funny but

00:51:24.559 --> 00:51:26.160
this is what it is this is what it is

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.160
dude i like it don't [ __ ] laugh do

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:29.680
you guys think it's a [ __ ] joke they

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:30.960
think he's all these material he's

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.720
[ __ ] materialized i hate them i might

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:33.760
be a bit

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:37.040
you you're no way i'm grown

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.599
do you think i believe in spirituality

00:51:39.599 --> 00:51:41.280
yeah of course dude yeah what else is

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:43.200
there dude he goes he goes into the big

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.119
bang theory and how it's basically the

00:51:45.119 --> 00:51:46.640
universe is expanding but it's just a

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.720
mushroom cloud and it'll reach a point

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:50.640
where then it'll just start falling back

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.480
down on itself yeah then it condenses

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:53.920
into a black hole it blows up again and

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.200
we shoot up out the other side of a

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:56.880
white hole oh and it's just it's just

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.640
never anything that's a that's that

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:00.800
can't be his theory though that's that's

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.400
that's an old that's an old common but

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.079
in the 20s he was far he was kind that's

00:52:04.079 --> 00:52:05.359
like that was kind of a far out there

00:52:05.359 --> 00:52:07.280
true it was far out i heard that at the

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:08.960
harrisburg area community college did

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.480
you really then i went home and got

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:11.760
drunk with my friends and i was like

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:12.559
dude

00:52:12.559 --> 00:52:14.559
it expands and then comes back together

00:52:14.559 --> 00:52:16.160
yeah and you could relive this exact

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.720
life for infinity so you better make it

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.640
the most of it true black hole white

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.160
hole dude it all it

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.839
stretches space time and it gets so

00:52:23.839 --> 00:52:25.440
heavy it condenses into a tiny thing and

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.640
then it goes

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:28.000
out of the white hole

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.839
shooting into the white hole right into

00:52:29.839 --> 00:52:30.960
the black hole

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:32.400
pretty tight but he was saying

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:34.400
consciousness is just your ability to

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:36.720
respond to a stimuli so if you're like a

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.160
fish and i tap the glass it's a low

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:39.760
level of consciousness just don't agree

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.760
with that entirely so yeah pretty pretty

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.040
basic but he was saying your higher

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.960
level of consciousness is more your

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:46.800
drop-down menu when a stimuli present is

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.400
presented to you you have a larger menu

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.480
of options to respond from

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:51.760
then he starts talking about how then

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:53.280
there's like non-material bodies and

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.119
consciousness is kind of separate from

00:52:55.119 --> 00:52:56.240
the human body it's just right up my

00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:58.160
alley a lot of consciousness talk and i

00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:00.720
it's tough for me to grasp so it would

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:02.240
be when it comes to like does a rock

00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:04.160
have consciousness

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.319
and no well there's an energy exchange

00:53:06.319 --> 00:53:08.079
between rocks and plants so it's it's

00:53:08.079 --> 00:53:10.000
it's not what's that human level so it's

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.520
basically they're exchanging like uh

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:13.359
like mycelium will tap into rocks and

00:53:13.359 --> 00:53:16.079
take like the minerals it needs yeah but

00:53:16.079 --> 00:53:17.119
how does that have anything to do with

00:53:17.119 --> 00:53:18.720
the rock though the rock's there dude

00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:21.359
it's low very low level dude very but

00:53:21.359 --> 00:53:22.880
how could it have any consciousness of

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:23.599
that

00:53:23.599 --> 00:53:24.960
i don't know i don't you know i don't

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.319
know i don't get the rock having

00:53:26.319 --> 00:53:28.079
consciousness type thing it's very it's

00:53:28.079 --> 00:53:30.640
my mute dude it's very very low levels

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.079
it's just like i mean a crystal is a

00:53:32.079 --> 00:53:34.079
self-organizing structure nobody tells

00:53:34.079 --> 00:53:35.839
the crystal how to like form itself into

00:53:35.839 --> 00:53:37.440
a thing yeah but how does that have

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.800
anything to do with consciousness it's

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:41.040
self-organized it's choosing on some

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.880
level to take that shape and to kind of

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:44.079
expand this way versus i don't think

00:53:44.079 --> 00:53:46.000
it's choosing to make itself like that

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.599
wow

00:53:47.599 --> 00:53:50.400
how though what guides it

00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.160
that's a big but it's again this is all

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:53.680
i don't know enough about crystals but

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:55.440
probably whatever minerals make up the

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.040
particular crystal

00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:58.880
mineral crystals is the purest form of

00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:01.599
any mineral okay so you get whatever it

00:54:01.599 --> 00:54:03.680
whatever it's made out of

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.119
it probably just naturally does it's a

00:54:05.119 --> 00:54:06.800
mystery though we don't know exactly why

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:08.640
they as far as i know i should say yeah

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.800
you don't know why they grow this way or

00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:11.680
that way

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:14.480
so you think they are deciding

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:15.760
i don't know i

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:17.359
i don't think it's just crystals i'm not

00:54:17.359 --> 00:54:18.559
trying to like catch you here i'm trying

00:54:18.559 --> 00:54:20.319
to understand this my friend i don't i

00:54:20.319 --> 00:54:22.240
don't wear it at all my friend here's

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:23.920
here's here's where this is there you

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:27.200
dude my friend buddy

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:29.440
here's my here's the way i look at it

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.359
here's here's the way so you get a

00:54:31.359 --> 00:54:33.839
filthy materialist like o'connor saying

00:54:33.839 --> 00:54:35.839
he is human consciousness is just they

00:54:35.839 --> 00:54:37.359
call it a meta phenomenon that just

00:54:37.359 --> 00:54:39.760
rises off of a purely physical process

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:41.760
that's inherently meaningless so we just

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:44.880
have sparks and like neurotransmitters a

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:46.720
soup of things that's going on and it

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:48.640
produces our reality that's more or less

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:49.920
just this thing you can say yeah you can

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:52.720
discount it it's total [ __ ] but this

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:54.720
tiny little bit of material our brain

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.480
produces this thing called consciousness

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.319
but then you get all of the material of

00:54:58.319 --> 00:55:00.640
the universe which our brain's made from

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.240
that doesn't produce consciousness it's

00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.760
like okay

00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.680
i doubt that i highly doubt that's the

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:07.760
case what's uh who's the

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:10.400
black dork scientist

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:11.839
you ever see that tweet norm hit him

00:55:11.839 --> 00:55:13.760
with does he go against con

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:15.680
i'll tell you you're gonna like it

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:17.119
if your little brain can produce your

00:55:17.119 --> 00:55:18.720
reality you're telling me all the

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:20.559
material of the universe doesn't produce

00:55:20.559 --> 00:55:22.799
a greater larger consciousness that we

00:55:22.799 --> 00:55:24.160
can't comprehend

00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:25.680
it's like get the [ __ ] out of here neil

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:26.960
degrasse it's kind of it's like the

00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:29.359
books about stuff like that

00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:30.559
you're gonna like this tweet did he

00:55:30.559 --> 00:55:33.040
really so neil degrasse tyson tweeted

00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:35.040
the universe is blind to our sorrows and

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.599
indifferent to our pains have a nice day

00:55:37.599 --> 00:55:40.240
norm norm replied kneel this is a

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:42.400
scientific fact or is it is this a

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:43.760
scientific fact or is this just an

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:46.079
opinion i hope i don't sound combative

00:55:46.079 --> 00:55:48.079
but this blunt aphros [ __ ] that's not

00:55:48.079 --> 00:55:49.920
the right one

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.040
the hell

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:52.480
yeah

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:56.160
yeah get involved ruin it

00:55:58.799 --> 00:56:00.720
he goes neal there's a there's a logic

00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:02.559
flaw in your little aphorism that seems

00:56:02.559 --> 00:56:04.480
to be quite telling since you and i are

00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.559
part of the universe then we would also

00:56:06.559 --> 00:56:08.160
be indifferent and uncaring perhaps you

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:10.079
forgot neil that we are not superior to

00:56:10.079 --> 00:56:11.760
the universe but merely a fraction of it

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.880
nice day indeed oh

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:17.200
damn norm just chilling at home just

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:19.599
hitting with it

00:56:19.599 --> 00:56:20.850
