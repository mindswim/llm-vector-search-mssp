this now nice nice

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.400
but uh so uh the way that we open up

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.799
with all new guests on the show is uh

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.720
you have to tell a story of your very

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.119
worst dating experience preferably a

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.600
first date doesn't have to be oh okay

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.799
uh

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.799
all right well i thought about it uh i

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.560
think i don't it's not gonna be a first

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.080
date that's okay

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.600
the last first date i had is with the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.280
girl i'm dating now that one kind of

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.400

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.920
it was nice it was a really nice evening

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.960
but then it

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.280
like midway through i saw her [ __ ]

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.280
instagram story that was like throughout

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.479
the year

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.799

our first date you know it's the

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.599

take it easy

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.800
he listens to nobody shane he started

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.400
the story by saying i heard it was a

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.600
horrible date and it just assumed it was

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.360

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.639

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.320
long day yeah catching up no it's fine

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.199
but uh it's not fine she

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.880
don't encourage his behavior it was just

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.720
funny to be competitive with diplo

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.880
mentally like when she told me that then

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.320
i went home and like [ __ ] looked at

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.440
his instagram

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.040
and i was like this [ __ ] guy this

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.880
piece of [ __ ] i'm cooler than him yeah

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.320
you always assume that guys like that

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.160
aren't interesting to talk to and you're

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.199
usually right

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.919
is five foot ten yes yeah all right well

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.199
i could definitely beat the [ __ ] out of

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.680
diplo so at least have that

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.680
but yeah his life is a lot cooler but

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.160
that's that's the bad part no well i

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.520
hope these aren't the bad date stories

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.680
you're coming in with uh so she's really

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.600
like funny she's on the level of like

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.039
that guy's pretty good looking fella you

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:16.720
know what i mean that was very pretty

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.639
but she also like it was funny because

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.639
we were outside afterwards and she was

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:21.360
like

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.600
honestly i would rather be

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.600
with you right now than with diplo right

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.960
i hope so ladies

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.240
i was looking at her and i was like i'd

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.639
rather be with [ __ ] diplo than you

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.840
[ __ ] i don't want to hang out with you

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.720
but then i'd say the worst date

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.800
i was on was i was with this girl

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.720
for like three years

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.160
we broke up

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.320
i was trying so hard to get her back

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.080
like as hard as i could

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.479
i went and got our favorite sushi from

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.240
our hometown because she was at college

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.720

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.479
45 minutes to our school and where are

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:55.680

but then uh i brought it to her and

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.639
like that was a pretty [ __ ] romantic

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:13.360
thing

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.680
like i went and got our like first date

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.800
not [ __ ] warm sushi

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.319
but uh we got there and while we're

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:23.840

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.360
the opposite i feel like that's a little

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.960
bit funny if they're not doing it on

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.080
purpose and if you're laughing and

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.360
you're like

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.560

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.959
friendship

00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:20.399
but uh after i found out this one thing

00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:22.000

so anyway so

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.680

00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:55.519
uh

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:56.959
solitary confinement's the worst [ __ ]

00:14:56.959 --> 00:14:58.320
punishment makes you crazy that's a

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.839
different kind of being alone we're

00:14:59.839 --> 00:15:00.880
talking about just not being in a

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.120
relationship not being in a box that's

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.000
yeah you got i like the inbox

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.600
yeah see every now and again you brought

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.199
me in here

00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:10.880
uh no i mean i don't i don't like i

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.480
wasn't like going out like hopefully i'm

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.639
in a relationship but i'm not i don't

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:16.880
know i'm not like uh

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.240
i'm not like yeah i like to have a

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.800
girlfriend sure i feel like what happens

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.320
is because like any time i've been in a

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.920
relationship as soon as you get out of

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.040
relationship it's hard to settle into

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.040
being single so it's like if you could

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.880
just always avoid that then you're never

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.440
really comfortable being single

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.120
you know i don't know i don't know yeah

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.399
i wasn't really

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:38.560
i was okay being single after my last

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.759
girlfriend

00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:41.040
i was fine with that

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.160
for a while

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.199
how long

00:15:43.199 --> 00:15:44.720
i was probably single for like three or

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.800
four months

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.079

your car i sold her a car

00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:53.120
and then we started dating if you're not

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.560

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.920

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.440

like you just go home and see them

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.040
afterwards

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.880

dangerous yeah like he's more he's one

00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:00.959
of the more scary of my is that what

you're into danger

00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:06.480
huh what do you think of that i really

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.240
wish the camera was on you for that god

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.640
damn it

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:14.559
it's funny

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.640
oh it was i turned around and [ __ ]

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.079
shadow was up there oh [ __ ]

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:22.720
this looks like a [ __ ] cartoon

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.799
response that's great

00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:27.360
oh [ __ ] it's the little things thanks

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.200
man that's good you guys are great

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.720
you guys are great that's that killed

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.080
and that shouldn't have killed that [ __ ]

00:17:34.559 --> 00:17:37.600
it was so stupid

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.880
are you trying to uh let us know that

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.039
your cup is empty no this one's full

00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:43.039
this is a spitter he's not a [ __ ]

00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:44.640
baby in a high chair he really knocks

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.960
his bowl

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.720
so i don't um i like the uh

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.559
so the danger part is maybe a little

00:18:00.559 --> 00:18:03.039
exaggerated i like to know that in the

00:18:03.039 --> 00:18:04.240
event

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.720
a dangerous situation happens

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.720
that he is confident with taking care of

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.559
it and i know i'm safe no matter what

00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:11.840
happens

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.000
i think that's a pretty instinctual i

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.200
think that's like a reason to like a man

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.840
that's your average man yeah yeah but i

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.360
i there are plenty of guys that i've

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.039
gone on dates with that i just don't get

00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:25.039
that air from them that it's like i feel

00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:26.160
like somebody jumps out of an alley

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.720
they're gonna push you in front of them

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.360
yeah i like that story i told um

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.200
with uh that personal trainer i dated

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.120
briefly the crazy one

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.679
that uh when we um he was telling a

00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:39.200
story he was just talking about like had

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.880
he been like if someone was trying to

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.960
mug him right yeah and that his response

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.640
would be oh no please don't hurt me just

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.240
take my money yeah let me set it like

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.000
that in that voice and i'm like i mean i

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.039
can't even ever speak to you again

00:18:51.039 --> 00:18:52.480
and you said he wasn't kidding right no

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.919
it was not kidding there was no joke it

00:18:53.919 --> 00:18:55.840
was like his strategy i don't know i

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.960
don't know what i mean it's not a

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.799
terrible strategy to like don't tell

00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:00.960
someone that play a lady you know yeah

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.760
he shouldn't have told you she should

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.760
have under his hat as they say yeah

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.440
that's gross

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.600
i don't like like yeah that's it was he

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.440
like was you sure wasn't gay personal

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.960
trainer i'm pretty sure i didn't get

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.160
that vibe from spending that much time

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.000
in the gym yeah true when there's ice

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.760
cream and pizza and [ __ ] to eat if

pieces of [ __ ] like broke people with no

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.159
job and no place to live the ones that

00:20:54.159 --> 00:20:55.840
crank out a billion babies all the time

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.360
so they have people

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.400
that's true

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.240
what are you getting at it's true this

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.840
is not are you

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.679
i have no babies by the way just for the

00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:05.039
record

00:21:05.039 --> 00:21:06.480
so um

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.720
yeah so i i feel like this was though

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.640
because i've been in i feel like one in

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.039
particular relationship like this before

00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:14.720
where there was like a matching or not a

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.640
matching tattoo like he tattooed my name

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.559
on him and it was a very codependent

00:21:18.559 --> 00:21:20.159
relationship where it's like when you go

00:21:20.159 --> 00:21:22.480
in like hard and fast which is what they

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.799
did and then when it ends it's like

00:21:24.799 --> 00:21:26.240
that's the end of your world for a

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.080
little while like a really shitty thing

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.080
so i do feel bad about it but there's

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.760
not a lot of information about it i keep

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.200
looking and like both of them are kind

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.000
of taking a break from social media yeah

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.520
and what and all the do you know

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.840
something about it brian oh and uh yeah

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.520
all the articles say exactly like the

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.200
same two sentences

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.120
which is just like uh taking your time

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.039
away and she gave the ring back

00:21:47.039 --> 00:21:47.840
right

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.000
i mean according to a snapchat headline

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.080
i read he was giving signals for a long

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.080
time like that a breakup was coming i

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.000
don't know i said i read the headline i

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.760
mean i prefaced it by letting you know i

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.520
had zero information i think her yeah

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.280
her ex-boyfriend died

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.440
yeah there was that that hurts yeah she

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.039
was probably going on and on about it

00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:06.159
and he was like all right enough of this

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:07.760
yeah nonsense

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.120
get over it would you break up with him

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.200
before if he cares so much am i right

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.960
because he's an addict

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.520
not anymore

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.280
mike's like dropped out a little bit

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.320
that was great

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.840
for the listeners i hope that like

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:22.960
you're really paying attention to the

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.320
drinking game during this episode

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.679
because they are really going to get it

00:22:25.679 --> 00:22:27.360
i will bet you anything that somebody

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.640
laughed at that song what's the drinking

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.799
game so one of the rules of the drinking

00:22:30.799 --> 00:22:32.559
game is when maddie bombs you can see

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:34.159
more smirking maybe because you're

00:22:34.159 --> 00:22:35.600
[ __ ] on me too hilarious thank you

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.520
brian thank you he's so cute i didn't

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.200
see him laugh i don't think is funny

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.039
i don't think addiction's a game

00:22:43.039 --> 00:22:44.799
and i think that's [ __ ] up speaking of

00:22:44.799 --> 00:22:48.720
dude addiction brought to you by appeals

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.640
get addicted they are fantastic get

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.440
addicted and [ __ ] die

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.760
brought you by appeals life liberty

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.200
[ __ ] dying

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.120
that's our friend

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.799
[ __ ]

00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:02.240
uh yeah

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.159
so yeah you know i mean that wasn't

00:23:04.159 --> 00:23:05.440
that's not really going anywhere i feel

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.960
bad for them

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.240
i feel like everyone's talking about it

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.720
and i think it's [ __ ] i i never gave

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.440
a [ __ ] about a celebrity couple yeah and

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.360
to celebrate a celebrity couple breaking

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.400
up seems [ __ ] lame to me but also

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.600
that's just because me and my

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.240
ex-girlfriend just broke up and i don't

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.120
think breakups are very funny because i

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.280
but to like do you not exp they're like

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.720
two they're two adults who if they have

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.960
any level of intelligence whatsoever

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.120
they should assume that it will probably

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.679
go to [ __ ] as most relationships do at

00:23:37.679 --> 00:23:39.440
some point they you know what i mean

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.720
oh that was close i almost knocked my

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.159
cup over with beer in it that would have

00:23:42.159 --> 00:23:44.400
been really [ __ ] dangerous

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.559
yeah all right extra dangerous [ __ ]

00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:49.060
got him all right

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:52.420
[Laughter]

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.200
but yeah i don't know how do you feel

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.360
bad for them what's the feel neither one

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.720
of them don't feel bad but they were

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.919
[ __ ] engaged they were engaged

00:24:01.919 --> 00:24:03.360
then don't break up

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.720
one of them doesn't care you know what i

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.960
mean one of them's fine at least

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.320
you know what i'm saying maybe feel

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.440
better for one of them figure out which

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.360
one broke up with whom and then feel bad

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.120
for the other one it said she what i

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.039
read was that she was the one that that

00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:16.880
they're not like like broken up broken

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.440
up but then she said that she gave the

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.679
ring back though that's a breakup and

00:24:21.679 --> 00:24:23.840
she said that like they needed time and

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.039
that's probably because she's dealing

00:24:25.039 --> 00:24:26.640
with the death of her ex and it's a

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.720
whole thing or some other dudes in the

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.720
picture some [ __ ] good-looking fella

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.480
who also has a big dick you know what i

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.240
mean just get that one more notch above

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.840
what she had just are you just making

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.480
this out yeah i'm guessing i'm [ __ ]

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.840
i'm i'm throwing out some [ __ ]

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.039
hypotheses

00:24:41.039 --> 00:24:42.480
that's a i think that's always a

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.600
reasonable

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.799
first off that's definitely where every

00:24:44.799 --> 00:24:46.960
dude goes in a breakup like if there's a

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.159
breakup it's like probably found a guy

00:24:48.159 --> 00:24:50.080
with a bigger dick

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.840
that's just my deepest insecurity so i'm

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.600
gonna throw that out every time

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.679
how much more can she fit in that tiny

00:24:55.679 --> 00:24:57.039
little body

00:24:57.039 --> 00:24:58.559
it's not about getting it all in though

00:24:58.559 --> 00:25:00.240
shannon

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.520
that's actually getting me hard is that

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.039
what the point of this show is to see if

00:25:03.039 --> 00:25:05.200
you can get hard

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.960
you have an erection detector right

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.039
underneath the table yeah i mean like if

00:25:09.039 --> 00:25:11.039
your dick doesn't fit in your hand you

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:12.880
know over and above obviously not the

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.360
other way what do you mean

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.720
it's like you want to see more of it you

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.600
know what i mean you don't want the

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.039
whole [ __ ] thing in there it's like

00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:20.320
there's something

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.760
right am i right have you [ __ ] girls

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.440
where your dick didn't fit you aren't no

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.799
of course not that's what i was gonna

00:25:24.799 --> 00:25:25.919
say what are you doing i'm saying if i

00:25:25.919 --> 00:25:28.080
if i were a lady i would [ __ ] and it

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.679

00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:32.559
be like yeah it's [ __ ] some good dick

you can't see when you're eating ass no

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.079
but you can taste

00:45:40.079 --> 00:45:41.839

00:45:41.839 --> 00:45:43.920
ass taste unless you run into a wrong

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:46.160
ass i'm sure that's so far i'm all right

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.280
with that yeah it's never been that

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.680

i'll do it yeah

00:45:51.359 --> 00:45:54.000
it's something you enjoy doing

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.599
yeah i guess

00:45:55.599 --> 00:45:57.440
that was so hesitant like watch watch

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.440
this hold on ask me

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:02.160
yes i love it

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.920
you do love it i mean literally when i

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.839
see women walk by who are hot i'm like i

00:46:05.839 --> 00:46:07.280
don't even think about [ __ ] that my

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:08.880
first thought is i want to eat her ass

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.880
more than anything yeah you the older

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.359
the older i've gotten the more like yeah

00:46:13.359 --> 00:46:14.720
when it starts when you're a kid and

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.720
you're like i'd like to kiss her yes and

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:18.640
it just never gets better i want to suck

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.240
i want to suck her boobies and it goes

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.079
to that yeah the whole way to now i bet

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:23.680
by the time i'm 40 i'll see a girl big i

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.359
want to strangle her to death

00:46:25.359 --> 00:46:28.960
i'd like to bury her and kill her

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.359
i like that's hot yeah every girl every

00:46:31.359 --> 00:46:34.720
hydraulic might [ __ ] kill you

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:36.960
so for you you think about that before

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.960
um the other place yeah i mean she has a

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:41.359
nice stuff not enough really yeah i

00:46:41.359 --> 00:46:42.720
don't know why

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.200
like people that grew up in brooklyn for

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:49.280
some reason are not aware that this is a

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.920

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:43.280
you went through a meat grinder i just

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.559

ready to fall out it's like just

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.119
dangling

00:50:55.119 --> 00:50:57.200
you think that would feel good

00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.480
that g-spot people are always talking

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.480

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:07.520
on it though

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.119
and that's not hard though what happens

00:51:09.119 --> 00:51:11.040
when it gets hard i think that was hard

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:12.720
yeah i don't [ __ ] hope that guy was

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:14.800
hard no he was being operated on what do

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.319
they make like a fake erection to

00:51:16.319 --> 00:51:19.920

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.559
i don't know well never information

00:51:22.559 --> 00:51:24.319
right anything i wonder whose dick that

00:51:24.319 --> 00:51:26.079
was let's call him

00:51:26.079 --> 00:51:27.760
he's dying for making me look look these

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:30.160
up anyway so the so when i was at uh

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.760
eastern state penitentiary the first

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:32.960
point we went through was like the fake

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.319
haunted house part which is like you

00:51:34.319 --> 00:51:36.800
know people jumping out and whatever

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.319
but there was one part where as soon as

00:51:38.319 --> 00:51:40.960
you walk in they give you um like 3d

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:42.720
glasses and then you go through all the

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.240
stuff and everything's glowing in 3d

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.760
whatever but then there's one part where

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.040
it's like it's made to look like a

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:49.280
tunnel and things are swishing around

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:51.040
you what do you mean

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.800
like i don't like lights or however

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.400
they're doing it like it's things are

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:55.760
spinning around you so it's like you're

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.200
walking through a tunnel that's like a

00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.359
warp yeah yeah i've seen that yeah and

00:51:59.359 --> 00:52:01.040
it's hard to walk through yeah yeah yeah

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:03.040
so my my friend like the guy that was

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:05.119
with us was always like in front and he

00:52:05.119 --> 00:52:06.240
was the one because like when you go in

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.920
there you can wear like a glow necklace

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:09.359
if you're okay with being touched

00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:11.119
otherwise you don't wear one so i'm like

00:52:11.119 --> 00:52:13.040
let him go in front and like far ahead

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.559
so that they know like that this is

00:52:14.559 --> 00:52:16.000
where you don't even know i got touched

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.680
by the people dressed in bugs they

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.119

00:52:19.119 --> 00:52:20.720
touched you yep they were probably

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.200
rapists yeah i was to be honest i mean

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.960
if i'm guessing so but they know the

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:26.400
rules well they clearly went against

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.920

bell because we haven't hit it the whole

00:55:51.839 --> 00:55:53.599
episode

00:55:53.599 --> 00:55:55.359
when did you hear the beginning

00:55:55.359 --> 00:55:56.559
i didn't say the name of the show you

00:55:56.559 --> 00:55:58.240
didn't i don't think so

00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:00.640
please do now all right so this lady

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:02.640
sherry johnson this this is like way too

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:05.520
recent to uh to be a thing

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.200
but it is

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:09.200
she was raped pregnant and married by

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.559
11.

00:56:10.559 --> 00:56:13.760
guess the state utah alabama

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.680
arkansas florida

00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:18.319
florida's the you said texas brian

00:56:18.319 --> 00:56:21.280
you're wrong too fl yeah florida

00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:23.040
yeah that's the go-to for crazy [ __ ]

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.880
that sounds like a utah that sounds like

00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:27.280
a mormon yeah that that's that's a fair

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:30.799
guess for sure all right so this um they

00:56:30.799 --> 00:56:32.319
just outlawed

00:56:32.319 --> 00:56:34.000
12. it's kind of funny because i was

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000
looking up age of consent laws for

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000
marriage in uh in the country earlier

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.280
today so this kind of coincides with

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:40.559
that a little bit

00:56:40.559 --> 00:56:42.559
um

00:56:42.559 --> 00:56:44.880
for no particular reason whatsoever

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.160
but apparently you can get [ __ ] you

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:47.440
could have gotten married up until a few

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:49.280
years ago in florida at like 11 years

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:51.280
old i don't think that's true and for

00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:53.760
i'm reading it kind of

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:55.040
that's why i don't believe you but you

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.559
know what's kind of weird about the uh

00:56:56.559 --> 00:56:58.880
the country in general you can be

00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:01.680
younger as a woman and get married than

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:03.040
a man

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.319
and i was trying to figure out like why

00:57:04.319 --> 00:57:05.680
that would be

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:07.359
you don't have that answer i'm assuming

00:57:07.359 --> 00:57:09.280
no i'll have that next great story

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:12.480
that's the story no no um

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:13.920
so

00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:16.319
sorry guys i i did it again

00:57:16.319 --> 00:57:19.200
i've done it again

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:22.400
i'm so bad at doing my homework it's not

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.160

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:26.480

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:29.520
it's my turn to do crazy love

00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:32.160
any question anybody has you could just

00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:35.040

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.480
you can ask me questions and i'll have

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:38.079
the answers

00:57:38.079 --> 00:57:41.040
i'm better at what's the

00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:51.359
she was married to this guy for years

00:57:51.359 --> 00:57:53.599
but um and then she for seven years she

00:57:53.599 --> 00:57:54.720
was married to this fellow oh he's a

00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:56.640
pastor he raped her when he raped her

00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.880
when she was nine she had the baby at

00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:00.559
ten they got married at eleven and

00:58:00.559 --> 00:58:03.280
apparently you could only get married at

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.680
that age if you had a baby

00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:08.319
where's the love in this story uh

00:58:08.319 --> 00:58:10.000
clearly in the pastor's eyes hello are

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.240

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:24.160

married and staying together for the

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:56.480
rest of their lives yeah he did the

00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.240
right thing and named her so that no one

00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.200
else would fall

00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.839

together that's not a love story though

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:12.960
they might have they ended up happily
