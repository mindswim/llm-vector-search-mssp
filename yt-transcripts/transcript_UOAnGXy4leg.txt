narcs with cameras but yeah Shane Gillis

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.580
who you know from getting fired from

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.670

yeah you were fantastic thanks guys

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.489
that's uh when all that [ __ ] came out I

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.580
looked you up on Twitter and I went oh

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.459
[ __ ] he follows me yeah man yeah and

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.329
it's when it came out they someone had

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:54.370
some bipartisan news source said you

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.900
came out and they quoted some of your

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.209
bits and I go oh this is accurate cuz

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.519
it's funny yeah yeah yeah that helped a

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.579
lot the somebody came into and were just

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.470
recorded a set of mine and then quoted

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.069
it and that helped because before that

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.180
anybody that had ever heard of me had

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.700
only seen a two-minute clip of my

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.799
podcast so they were like oh this guy

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.260
sucks like he's not funny and then when

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.670
they actually transcribed some of my

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.290
stand-up people that guy that's pretty

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.209
funny that's good so that helped a lot

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.120
and I could read it hearing how you

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.930
would say it yeah I told you that I I

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.700
read two reviews of Dave Chappelle's

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.160
Netflix thing where I go wow that's it

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.530
just seems and I watched it I go oh now

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.989
I see how they [ __ ] misquoted you

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.980
which they always do even though that

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.480
article helped cuz that was the one

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.709
thing that like really hurt like I

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.079
didn't care about the like if they call

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.430
me a racist or something like that's

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.049
fine cuz I know I'm not like I Know Who

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.780
I am I'm okay with that but reading like

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.579
other comics or anybody coming out and

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.319
being like he's just not funny that's

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.209
what bothered me so that they're like

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.650
having that come out that article was

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.209
nice you know I was about to say I don't

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.750
know that I know any racists in comedy

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.019
30 years in almost I don't know any

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.220
actual racists but I America I come up

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.909
with a couple of names but they're still

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:23.650
funny yeah

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.570
of course well and they're not push

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.389
pushing a racist agenda it's very funny

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.190
like we always talked about it's you

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.860
with a bunch of comics talking you know

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.889
shop saying stuff you're not supposed to

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.530
say obviously a reporter would would

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.780
write about differently than everyone's

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.979
opinion in the room well that's the

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.000
thing that's interesting about the green

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.130
room thing is that it is done with the

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.139
context of we know we're not supposed to

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.520
say this and that's why we're saying it

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.690
right now you don't mean like that's

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.160
always a layer of like we're talking to

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.110
comics literally that was the entire

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.080
point of the podcast that we have it's

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.180
like everybody that's listening knows us

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.550
they know that we know what we're saying

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.010
is wrong that's why it's funny yeah when

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.360
you take it out of context and put it on

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.870
the news it's like telling me some quote

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.210
that they pulled where you were doing it

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.910
in an old-timey AK so yeah that was the

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.580
kudamon v quote I was using an old-time

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.460
he acted like man like I didn't do it

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.500
strong enough I guess but that's what I

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.120
was like man that's a reckon jinx live

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.820
there like that's I mean that's what it

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.460
was and then they please not say that

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.960
yeah I know my bad guys get cancelled

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.900
from Harrisburg but yeah they so that's

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.910
what happened I was on the train going

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.130
to do shows and I got a call from my

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.280
agent that was like did you say let the

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.169
[ __ ] Luther King yeah it's a word I

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:51.550
was like I would never say that I

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.410
genuinely was on the phone like no

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.389
that's wrong there's no way I [ __ ]

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:57.970
said and they played it back and I was

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.830
like hold on let me listen this clip and

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.000
I was like well that's how I said it

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.260
yeah I said it but not like that so you

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.099
know that's that happens I have so much

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:14.770
[ __ ] in podcasts actual specials Twitter

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.070
feeds myspace like if you went through

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.370
my history and took it out of context

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.410
but the only reason they [ __ ] with you

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.340
is cuz Saturday Night Live decided to

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.470
take a chance on this you don't seem

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.680
like a character guy no no not really

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.380
I don't think were you confused why they

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.050
said hey shame

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.730
yeah like throughout the process I was

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.880
like I said earlier via when you showed

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.260
up I go oh he looks like Greg Gutfeld

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.410
from Fox 5 whatever except you don't

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.800
have the horrific hatchet wound between

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.350
the top of your nose in your forehead

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.840
that makes him impossible to watch he's

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.050
a nice guy but he's terrible to look at

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:11.540
oh thanks oh thanks yeah it's so weird

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.700
because I like I I've said this on this

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.410
podcast before but I deleted my entire

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.750
Twitter because I went back and found

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.240
like really racist tweets that were like

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.520
it's like loof there's no there's not

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.590
even a funny context for this it's just

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:25.670
terrible

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:30.200
you know but it's not racist and that

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.690
you're like going where the superior

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.780
race yeah I mean it wasn't attempted

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.720
like being abrasive and like oh well

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.140
this is like trollee is like I guess so

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.210
I wouldn't even know I had like a bad

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.400
Trayvon Martin joke that just was like

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:56.900
they can't cancel Olivia grace she's

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.950
working for me I was just some kind of

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.080
but it was like just I really don't

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.010
remember it was something about like

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.050
Saturday Night Live yeah and this will

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.320
be a theme in this podcast or this and

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.380
the next one if we make it one or two

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:20.420
but you were excited to be on Saturday

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.330
Night Live which the the I've tweeted

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.300
the joke that the biggest crime that the

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.120
Trump administration has committed is

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.790
making Saturday Night Live relevant

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:35.539
again because CNN people who don't have

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:38.570
any idea of what comedy is go oh well

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.930
Saturday Night Live has Alec Baldwin

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:45.500
[ __ ] Saturday Night Live is garbage and

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.540
I know you're a youngster you're 31

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.820
years old so no one can blame you for

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.990
thinking that

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:56.060
be cool to be on that but what you were

00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:03.200
saying I don't want to how you got even

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.720
talking everyone know what was the

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.080
process of Saturday Night Live

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.420
approaching you to be like what what did

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.459
you ever do that Saturday Night Live was

00:09:13.459 --> 00:09:15.200
interested in you because you're a funny

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.330
comic and that's not really Saturday

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.450
Night Live's thing yeah I think they

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.880
just saw me do stand-up but you don't do

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.040
characters and you don't do a great

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.029
[ __ ] Dick Cheney I was trying to find

00:09:29.029 --> 00:09:32.270
a reference of anyone the aren't I don't

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.390
know I don't know yeah I mean I don't

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.950
know what to say they they they liked

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.640
that they saw on stand-up and then did

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.010
they like say well you could do that

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.589
what like can you tell us anything about

00:09:45.589 --> 00:09:48.140
the audition process yeah I mean it's

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.820
the same as every I think everybody

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.459
knows the process like you just go

00:09:51.459 --> 00:09:55.180
audition like on the stage in front of

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.329
the writers and [ __ ] first of all

00:09:58.329 --> 00:10:02.779
everyone knows the process you are stuck

00:10:02.779 --> 00:10:05.839
in a [ __ ] group of comedians that all

00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:09.410
auditioned for Saturday night lives my

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.260
group are people who audition like they

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:17.149
try to work on lines to get probation so

00:10:17.149 --> 00:10:19.250
so no one no one knows the [ __ ] I

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:23.600
audition so you go in and audition on

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.779
the stage count on the main stage you

00:10:26.779 --> 00:10:28.430
can do characters or just did five

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.410
minutes of stand-up just five minutes of

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:32.959
stand-up that's it mm-hmm that's weird

00:10:32.959 --> 00:10:34.730
they had seen me do stand-up before a

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.550
couple of times but yeah that's how you

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.200
audition they just go to it don't have

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.180
to put on a powdered wig and be Thomas

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.160
so what I would assume no I just wanted

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
to stand up that's it but someone had

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.290
vetted you they'd seen you come on -

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:56.510
well yeah they did see so though I think

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.160
what I think but I would imagine the

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.870
audition process is it's just kind of to

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:04.070
see if you [ __ ] freak out in front of

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:04.820
the camera

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.040
yeah if you can stand there and be

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.360
normal in front of the camera I think

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.770
that's what the audition process is

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.510
because in five minutes you can't decide

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.860
whether or not someone's a star or not

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.360
you know five minutes prepared material

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.370
five minutes of prepare material almost

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.910
any middle in the country could do that

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.650
but in front of a camera in front of an

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:28.100
empty room then it gets kind of how much

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.310
did you do a lot of road work as a comic

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:35.720
before this yeah yeah I I mean I just

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.550
started headlining on the road but yeah

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:40.160
but you were I just saw you recently in

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.590
Tucson Dan Soder for Sodor I've been

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.660
open for Sodor and big J for a while

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.850
you're always on the bonfire always on

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.580
the bonfire I opened for Voss for a

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.930
while I want to drop that in when I was

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:55.580
trying to take it down err on my night

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.490
off last night I was looking up I was

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.410
trying to find clips of what you said

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.660
and then now there's so many [ __ ]

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:06.560
thing and vice.com had one and the the

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.260
beginning was he says even more racist

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.770
things and I'm going through it and I

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:15.410
click on a link but it's an hour and 35

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:17.510
minute podcast I have to listen to when

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.450
he says Cinque perhaps and out of

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:23.180
context but then it closes the last

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.390
paragraph of that vice.com and they're

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.680
well respected in any community nowhere

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.110
it closes with you saying hey alright we

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.570
got to chop this out but we sound like a

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.610
bunch of white guys being racist right

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.560
now you're the voice of reason in the

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.310
entire story but the headline is how you

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.500
said even more racist [ __ ] well that's

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.030
yeah that's like the hardest part of

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.970
this is like cuz you're say you're never

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.290
gonna be able to get your side of the

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:52.940
[ __ ] story out so it's just a

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.370
headline and then that's it you know

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.040
nobody even reads the story nobody even

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.870
reads the whole story they literally

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:00.890
look at the headline they're like

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:02.120
alright great and then go about their

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.330
lives and then they create an opinion

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.640
that they can talk about got a water

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:12.140
cooler of course that's that's it a year

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.410
31 years old and you're immediately from

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:18.680
complete obscurity course into in

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:23.360
[ __ ] store yeah I think I'm like one of

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.399
the first people to ever do that but

00:13:25.399 --> 00:13:27.500
you're also have a body of work to fall

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.180
back I don't have like a special to be

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.730
like hey guys look I am funny it's just

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:35.060
this guy sucks and that's it you know I

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:39.230
mean well Roseanne Barr had a [ __ ]

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:43.370
strong history of defending everybody of

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:48.290
a weaker class probably comes off wrong

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:52.910
zoo but yeah she defends and then she

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:56.180
wrote one [ __ ] thing on and yeah yeah

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:59.270
I also have if you if you do Roseanne

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.040
any justice such and I probably

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.360
shouldn't go on a podcast and defend

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:08.750
Roseanne right away but I you know I

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.480
don't whatever with hers I was like

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.730
alright the best part that my favorite

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.290
thing when I almost tweeted it when I

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:16.760
was getting in trouble but I don't think

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.660
anybody would've got the reference

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.670
really it was just when Roseanne has

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:20.899
that one clip of her being like I

00:14:20.899 --> 00:14:25.640
thought the [ __ ] was white we know

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.120
Roseanne and now we know you alright

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.080
yeah you you put together a cohesive

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.700
[ __ ] argument but they only take outs

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:39.440
of course sound bites and but yeah you

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.930
yeah that's it what were some of your

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:43.430
best sketches you are gonna write for

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:49.130
seven I had some good ones lined up tell

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.620
us one maybe they can use you on Fridays

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:57.020
maybe yeah no he actually that was one

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.790
of his [ __ ] talking things right away as

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:02.540
I was more of a MADtv guy anyway yeah

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.070
and then somebody wrote an article about

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.290
that oh did that he literally wrote an

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.450
article today I'm sure they mentioned

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:09.500
Michael Richards

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.130
oh no that's Friday sorry they wrote in

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:15.950
on the MADtv comment which literally was

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.450
nothing behind it other than just me

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.029
talking [ __ ] was that I was like

00:15:20.029 --> 00:15:22.490
pointing to MADtv as a better product

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:30.650
because it was more racist and that's

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:35.810
what the [ __ ] are you guys doing if you

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.630
if you just do stand-up comedy you just

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:41.480
perform for the audience that likes you

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.810
to be fair to be fair that allows for

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:46.520
you to say because you've been doing it

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:50.930
yeah no I'm [ __ ] lucky but then again

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.030
you got you get it like man show you got

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:56.060
all that other stuff that builds when

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.860
you were telling me about your story I

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.590
only have a small story where when I got

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:03.590
the man show I got protested in Madison

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.540
Wisconsin by a feminist group because

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.090
it's a big you know whatever you call

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:10.610
that [ __ ] politically correct [ __ ]

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:14.720
feminists College and when you came here

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.330

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.360
pictures with the fan the people that

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.970

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:50.990
idea oh man but this was not national

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:53.420
this was twelve people in Madison he's

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.300
getting a shitstorm but still no one

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.980
knows what you look like and you look

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.230
like every other night yeah I do one

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.570
thing that's funny is I've because I'm

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.160
still poor so I still have to like take

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.650
the subway and [ __ ] in New York so like

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:07.940
I get on the subway and I like look

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.880
around and I can see it's so funny when

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:20.120
people recognize me worried about

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.770
somebody taking a picture like while I'm

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.390
on the subway of me just being like a

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:27.580
fat sad guy on a train

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:32.130
this is what became of him he was riding

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:34.530
high he's living the big life of

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.270
Saturday Night Live without a paycheck

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.910
and look at him down headphones in a

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.929
train never work today

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.429
I think that I think a point that you

00:17:44.429 --> 00:17:45.690
made that's really interesting

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:49.770
Doug was about how like the whole comedy

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.299
civil war and how people are trying to

00:17:51.299 --> 00:17:53.789
force what you say and do into two camps

00:17:53.789 --> 00:17:55.679
right now approach that's one of the

00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:58.049
things I saw in articles I read about

00:17:58.049 --> 00:18:01.260
you oh he says he didn't vote for Trump

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.120
which was a bit you were already ill oh

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.390
yeah yeah because I'm not gonna you're

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.159
in the bit but you are already doing a

00:18:08.159 --> 00:18:11.850
bit they're trying to force anyone who's

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.429
not let's just break that down in the

00:18:14.429 --> 00:18:16.890
camps they've made them anyone who's not

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:20.429
snowflake is Trump all right yeah

00:18:20.429 --> 00:18:23.190
including that [ __ ] story about the

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:27.150
bonfire this alt-right comedy podcast

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.750
network all right Julie they did that

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:36.539
about uh skanks and all that and yeah I

00:18:36.539 --> 00:18:39.450
mean it's two Jewish guys in a Puerto

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:45.480
Rican yeah the idea that because it's

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.450
not straight up like now they do say

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:49.860
[ __ ] up things like that's the whole

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.570
point is they say [ __ ] up things but

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:53.610
that's I mean did but that's no there's

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:55.350
I know for a fact none of them I've been

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:58.770
quoting a dice bit on stage about the

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:01.409
[ __ ] Japanese in the late 80s like

00:19:01.409 --> 00:19:09.030
yeah that was how's it go Dice Clay had

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.510
this bit about yeah the [ __ ] Japanese

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.820
didn't we drop two bombs on these people

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.919
a few years ago what was in those bombs

00:19:16.919 --> 00:19:21.480
fertilizer yeah that's funny and it was

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.090
funny then because it was wrong think

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:31.500
that that was funny they were buying up

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.630
all sorts of property and their economy

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:38.520
was flourishing it was not stoking 1941

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.370
Pearl Harbor animosity where people are

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.830
curb stopping Japanese they had the

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.620
power so it was punching up but if you

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.290
said that but it was still kind of

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:51.870
racist if you want to call that racist

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.120
rather than talking about race the

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.820
context of society at the time is

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.860
relevant to what's being said on stage

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.080
yeah like you've said comedy has a very

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.390
short shelf life because of that right

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.910
and now they're just trying to find

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:10.710
[ __ ] marks of what you did wrong what

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.920
do you guys think though about like is

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.800
there any validity to some of the stuff

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.929
that's being said like is there any

00:20:18.929 --> 00:20:22.140
validity to like the idea of being more

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.000
conscientious about how certain things

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.059
in sight right well I think that's what

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:31.230
I just said I was yeah you're not yeah I

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.670
don't think I've ever said anything that

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:36.270
was to incite violence or anything know

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:41.730
what I'm actually like that with this

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:45.210
[ __ ] inside violence I've honestly never

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:48.120
heard any stand-up that I thought was

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.550
doing that I've never heard any comedy

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:52.830
that I thought was possibly dog

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:55.080
whistling or any of that okay there's

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.770
even like death metal music that is all

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:04.320
right white like there's yeah there's no

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:08.040
comedy that is racist well I guess

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.780
probably in small small genres there has

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.490
to be because there is like I feel like

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:16.710
there is like some I don't know I'm not

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.540
I'm not saying that anybody has done

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:22.820
anything Olivia calm down don't panic

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.790
I'm just saying like like like I don't

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:28.380
know like I try to be conscientious of

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:29.490
it because I've been told by like

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.020
friends of mine that like certain words

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.309
actually really bother them like

00:21:32.309 --> 00:21:33.900
personally so I'm like okay well I won't

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.700
say that around you because it's it's

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.110
affected your life in a way that hasn't

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.030
affected my life I was wondering what

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:40.260
you guys think about that in terms of

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:44.100
comedy yeah well III I'm gonna side on

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:48.450
the Toni Viagra place and I'm an old guy

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.610
so I think nothing should bother you

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.440
because I've been drunk for 40 years and

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.260
I have no emotion so I think you should

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:59.040
toughen up on some level but there is I

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.620
don't even want to burn bits now this is

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.200
where I don't want you to burn bits I

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:08.190
don't want everything bits today I don't

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.790
know like I I don't use certain words on

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:15.360
stage sometimes because I don't know

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.340
who's in the audience in that case like

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:21.299
I but a like a I don't know I if I had a

00:22:21.299 --> 00:22:23.250
good bit around a word [ __ ] Eddie

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:29.850
Murphy that's reason to say yeah yeah of

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:30.600
course

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.270
now the podcast or any podcast that I'm

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:35.630
talking on I usually know the audience

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:38.070
so then I'm like alright these guys

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:41.340
aren't gonna get hurt by this word here

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.350
it is you know on stage if I don't know

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.870
the audience I'm kind of like this needs

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:47.700
to be really good if I'm gonna say it

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.890
yeah while on a podcast I can just kind

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:53.070
of [ __ ] [ __ ] right because you do

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:55.470
like you know you know the comics are

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:57.600
talking to you know the audience that

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.150
you're speaking to when louis c.k got

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:02.940
bootlegged and they released 48 minutes

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:03.630
of here

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:08.280
initially and the shitstorm was he made

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.490
fun of parkland survivors and he didn't

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:14.880
well what hurt me is I was actually

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.440
working on a bit that I'm still doing

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:20.190
I'm like [ __ ] Louie ck7 on my dick he's

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:21.570
shunned I'm gonna keep working on that

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:25.890
it's a different angle but what I

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.140
tweeted and I wanted to use tonight but

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.710
I so [ __ ] angry I saw one guy filming

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.950
you and I went into the [ __ ] audience

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.890
and I said put your [ __ ] phone in

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.049
your [ __ ] pocket I was shaking when I

00:23:40.049 --> 00:23:43.290
saw you backstage I didn't know what was

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:46.110
up you you had just come off hot from

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:48.660
like like chastising someone and then

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:49.679
you wouldn't but you told me what

00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:50.880
happened but you were getting ready to

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.470
go on when I tweeted this and it's a

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:58.140
salient point all right he made fun of

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.830
parkland survivors and their families

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:08.540
are gonna hear well and I tweeted if if

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.450
but the office says that Wendy in

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.540
accounting has a face like a wombat and

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.260
you go up and tell Wendy that he said

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.670
that where she would have not known

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:23.090
otherwise who hurt Wendy's feelings you

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:26.900
you [ __ ] narcs yeah you [ __ ] want

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.970
to be part of the problem and not part

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.710
of the solution and you're [ __ ]

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:33.230
splitting comics in half yeah I don't

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.150
know if it's the best thing for me to

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:37.460
say but that is kind of how I felt about

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:39.410
what happened with that podcast my

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:41.510
podcast clip that got out and someone

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.580
that's why in the first statement I mean

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:44.540
I was like anybody who's actually

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.310
offended yeah I would definitely

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.860
apologize yeah produce the body habeas

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.380
corpus habeas corpus produced the

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:56.090
[ __ ] person that went oh that's

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:58.490
that's so interest kid I feel like I've

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:00.020
been doing a bit about my sister who's

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.360
special needs and I feel bad about it

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.250
sometimes but this guy came up to me

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:05.690
tonight and was like I have a daughter

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:08.390
who's special needs she died when she

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:11.330
was six and I like that bit because I

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:13.130
could not stop thinking about her teeth

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:20.180
whenever she would smile like that bit

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:23.180
like I lost a brother over a similar

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.940
argument where he didn't understand what

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.490
I was saying I was do you remember the

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:33.710
burn victim in the elk our burn victim

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:35.480
friend is here and I was looking with

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.600
God the same guy I'm talking about

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.760
different burn victim but like people in

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.620
Chinatown weren't listening here's

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:49.010
podcast I made a point to make sure he

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:51.100
got in front of Olivia and he was

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.350
laughing still about her big major bit

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:56.960
about well we never know I think it was

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.180
the sutures still had like straight

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:03.020
across yeah to your point though about

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.360
like it's like a kill the messenger type

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.400
of situation like if my sister would

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.860
have never watch my stand-up unless

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:13.070
someone showed it to her so yeah and

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:15.530
that's how I felt like we were like what

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.860
about like and I understood like when

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.540
when people like people are offended and

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:21.820
I was like yeah if

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.039
if it was like an Asian kid that gets

00:26:24.039 --> 00:26:27.580
online looks on a website that's like

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.009
new SNL cast member uses racial slurs

00:26:30.009 --> 00:26:31.989
against Asians it's again maybe that

00:26:31.989 --> 00:26:33.609
does hurt his feelings and I never

00:26:33.609 --> 00:26:35.139
wanted that I would that's I knew that

00:26:35.139 --> 00:26:36.759
kid wasn't [ __ ] listening to what I

00:26:36.759 --> 00:26:39.820
was saying on the podcast and like also

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.739
that's not the contact all that but like

00:26:41.739 --> 00:26:44.259
yeah I knew my audience when I was

00:26:44.259 --> 00:26:48.039
talking it's to play devil's advocate

00:26:48.039 --> 00:26:51.190
sure easy to play devil's advocate I

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:57.690
didn't really say that well because I I

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:00.159
try to be conscientious like to the

00:27:00.159 --> 00:27:02.080
point of almost being like obsessive

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.580
about it like the other day when we went

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.279
to that Indian restaurant and on the

00:27:06.279 --> 00:27:08.200
outside it's just a great building it

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.669
looks like an office building and then

00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:11.649
you walk in and there's like gold

00:27:11.649 --> 00:27:14.499
pillars and orange flowers every it's

00:27:14.499 --> 00:27:17.529
beautiful we walked in and I went this

00:27:17.529 --> 00:27:21.009
is bananas and they did not serve us and

00:27:21.009 --> 00:27:22.929
I was like was that because I said their

00:27:22.929 --> 00:27:28.470
restaurants banana is really yourself

00:27:31.049 --> 00:27:34.570
this is all about Olivia grace being she

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:36.369
she thought we were gonna murder her for

00:27:36.369 --> 00:27:38.309
the first six months we knew her

00:27:38.309 --> 00:27:42.609
literally cocktail but my point is

00:27:42.609 --> 00:27:44.590
though I don't think any in people are a

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:47.109
sensitive as white people I'm sure they

00:27:47.109 --> 00:27:49.419
didn't care that you said that and no

00:27:49.419 --> 00:27:51.190
one in Chinatown was listening to your

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:53.769
podcast so someone who was defending

00:27:53.769 --> 00:27:57.669
them no one's really offended ever my

00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:59.320
point was do you ever think though and

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.749
this is I playing devil's advocate here

00:28:01.749 --> 00:28:03.129
but do you think since you know your

00:28:03.129 --> 00:28:04.989
audience that you're playing - do you

00:28:04.989 --> 00:28:08.769
ever worry about how they might

00:28:08.769 --> 00:28:11.619
interpret it - oh yeah for sure like I

00:28:11.619 --> 00:28:15.009
mean my whole podcast is us like joking

00:28:15.009 --> 00:28:16.960
around about like oh we love Alex Jones

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.419
and now Trump Trump's the [ __ ] man

00:28:19.419 --> 00:28:20.080
like it

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.210
it's joking but then I'll get like DMS

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:24.519
of people that are like hell yeah I'm

00:28:24.519 --> 00:28:27.009
like something like that and you're

00:28:27.009 --> 00:28:28.690
allowed to like Trump obviously that's

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:30.730
easier that's a political party but like

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:33.970
when people are like yeah I'll get I'll

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:35.200
get DMS from people

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.370
even through this whole thing I'll get

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:39.100
dm's from people that are like the very

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.500
racist against Asian people in a tweet

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.059
to me or a text to me I'm like that's

00:28:43.059 --> 00:28:46.029
not the [ __ ] I'm saying that's my

00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:49.779
[ __ ] life it's my life my last my

00:28:49.779 --> 00:28:52.210
last special that is not out yet I

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:54.370
didn't say yeah I have to say I'm not

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:55.149
racist

00:28:55.149 --> 00:28:57.370
I'm not saying this because I'm afraid

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:59.169
you're offended I'm saying this because

00:28:59.169 --> 00:29:01.480
I'm afraid you're racist and you think

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.490
I'm your friend we're not friends

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:06.490
yeah if you're reading it wrong yeah and

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:08.649
it's sad that you have to do that but

00:29:08.649 --> 00:29:12.190
it's almost like they're pushing comics

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:15.370
into two camps and no we're a third camp

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:16.690
and we always will be

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:19.059
yeah when we're talking about that's

00:29:19.059 --> 00:29:21.340
nice but when we were talking about

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:24.730
green rooms I say that about green rooms

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:27.610
I knew but I haven't really been in a

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:30.700
[ __ ] Comedy Cellar or Comedy Store

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.730
green room around what might be

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.649
happening there yeah where you have to

00:29:35.649 --> 00:29:37.510
worry it was always us against the

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:42.220
[ __ ] audience until you want to go on

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:48.090
Saturday Night Live chasing that [ __ ]

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:52.750
artistic list dick no comment

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:57.490
I don't but that's like but when you're

00:29:57.490 --> 00:29:59.679
like when you're young and you're a

00:29:59.679 --> 00:30:01.840
comic and you don't have the following

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.490
that you have you're not even young yet

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:08.440
you're 23 it's like when you don't have

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.860
your following and you are not coming up

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.289
in their 80s and 90s you can't really

00:30:14.289 --> 00:30:16.779
tour a lot and make a living like you

00:30:16.779 --> 00:30:19.090
could if SNL asked you to host you would

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:22.240
say no no I would definitely say no I'm

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.409
I would be terrified of like any kind of

00:30:26.409 --> 00:30:29.019
no I wouldn't do [ __ ] tonight's show

00:30:29.019 --> 00:30:30.970
or any of that okay yeah I mean I'm sure

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:33.399
they because it would suck yeah like I

00:30:33.399 --> 00:30:36.490
did that early that's why I goof on you

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:38.740
about being young and wanting to be on

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:41.590
Saturday Night Live I would say yes

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:44.320
but I would have no idea what to do

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.240
there and I would know that I'm gonna

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.230
suck and I

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.720
did things where I sucked cuz it wasn't

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.639
my thing but I thought that's what I'm

00:30:51.639 --> 00:30:55.179
supposed to want yo interesting okay cuz

00:30:55.179 --> 00:30:56.950
that was kind of what I was asking is

00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:58.539
because when you're like young and

00:30:58.539 --> 00:31:00.909
starting out am I talking too much no

00:31:00.909 --> 00:31:07.720
it's funny how exciting yeah well

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:17.320
because you don't read conversations

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.760
with Olivia grazer it's in my book

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.970
[ __ ] and if do it I can do it and

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:26.260
here he needs a man person makes me feel

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:30.909
so tickled yeah you're supposed to do

00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:32.559
certain things you're supposed to want

00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:35.139
certain things like Saturday Night Live

00:31:35.139 --> 00:31:40.029
I think uh it was MADtv right I remember

00:31:40.029 --> 00:31:42.220
I had to write sketches when I first it

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:46.149
was like 95 96 when I moved to LA and

00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:49.779
they would write some sketches was it

00:31:49.779 --> 00:31:51.370
with that guy wasn't even an audition

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:55.149
with that old guy no no that was a no no

00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:57.909
no this was just a write sketches like

00:31:57.909 --> 00:32:00.730
as I wrote three sketches one was very

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:04.029
racist now that I remembered it was a it

00:32:04.029 --> 00:32:08.070
was back in the day of the the if you've

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:11.049
35 cents for a couple what you've spent

00:32:11.049 --> 00:32:13.960
for a cup of coffee would feed this

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:19.980
little starving kid and wherever

00:32:20.639 --> 00:32:23.470
whatever GOP I don't know who was

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:25.659
starving there's always Somalia or

00:32:25.659 --> 00:32:28.779
Ethiopia or whatever the point was the

00:32:28.779 --> 00:32:31.480
the sketch was about when he gets fat

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:34.720
from the residuals and how he shows up

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.760
all fat because he's been on that

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.279
commercial for so it's so long and I

00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:40.870
like you gotta lose weight we can't use

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:43.779
you in court oh that's a funny [ __ ]

00:32:43.779 --> 00:32:46.860
but yeah how isn't it

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:51.909
but I build an audience now now you can

00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:55.659
just do podcasts and that's a band and

00:32:55.659 --> 00:32:58.389
stand-up you can have a very I mean

00:32:58.389 --> 00:33:01.330
Andrew Schultz do you know at all

button-down and like also he didn't have

00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:00.950

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:03.080

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.560
what we're talking about with the whole

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.210
thing with Mead like it'd be nice if I

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:39.940
did at like a special or something so

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:41.410

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:43.540
YouTube clip be like oh that's great now

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:49.080

your old stuff coming up is like well

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.090
you also have like a huge body of work

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:01.690

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:05.860
know who you are you know you're not a

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.560
racist you know what you do and that's

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.140
why you can capitalize on this cuz you

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:12.790
know what you weren't gonna get on

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:14.860
Saturday Night Live that much you're

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.990
gonna be one of those people from

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:19.780
Saturday Night Live that goes on Stern

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:21.820
[ __ ] ten years later and talks about

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:25.090
what a [ __ ] internal [ __ ] show I hate

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:27.550
that expression but [ __ ] show [ __ ]

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:30.070
daggers in the back where stand-up

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:33.280
comedy as far as I know is still pretty

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:37.720
much at least the people I know even the

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.000
[ __ ] with the whole meat to thing

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.730
yeah the people I know come and go this

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:44.860
is out of control but I write for a TV

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:46.960
show so I can ever say it on Twitter

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.750
this is out of control and no one can

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:51.400
produce the body of who's actually

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.410
offended they're trying to create

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:54.430
schisms

00:36:54.430 --> 00:37:00.610
and I say David Cross David Cross some

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:03.520
guy I talk [ __ ] about you in a book and

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:07.090
some guy was at the merch booth and you

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:10.360
signed his Bible or my book something I

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:14.620
signed it was your book and he said yeah

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:17.140
he hates my guts no I thought you hated

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:21.190
my guts so I hated your guts I hate

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:25.030
people I think hate me so yeah [ __ ]

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:27.160
let's stop [ __ ] pretending

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.970
be partisan their partisan we're [ __ ]

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:35.250
Union we are legion we are anonymous

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.830
surprise well I think the landscapes

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:41.290
changed a little bit in comedy I think

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:44.500
younger people are very very like like

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.030
the people I came up even the people I

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:47.770
came up with in Philly just literally

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:50.380
when this thing happened to [ __ ]

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:55.000
quotes against me people I was friends

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.490
with but that's the [ __ ] problem and

00:37:57.490 --> 00:37:58.570
that's that's it

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:00.520
we talked about this this is a bit I

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:03.820
used to do before me too was really a

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.470
thing and I go I get a [ __ ] bring

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:09.220
that back people who make their bones

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:12.700
out of being a victim because oh I'm not

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:13.360

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:15.820
not not burning it all right put it on

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:18.130
the stage like that's a very there are

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:19.960
people especially now like so I think

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:22.480
when you were coming up and all that it

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:26.230
wasn't as the victimhood wasn't as much

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:28.480
of a currency as it is now and so now

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.510
within comedy there are comics that I

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:34.750
wouldn't say rely on it but almost

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:40.210

the second part of this podcast which

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:32.160
was gonna be the entirety of the podcast

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.860
until uh until things worked out where

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:38.670
it became a theme we're in an

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:41.670
undisclosed location I'll buy a highway

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:44.880
somewhere out in public with my good

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.700
friend Sonny that's what we're gonna

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:52.220

also stand-up comedian dabble in it you

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.440
had a brief hiccup in your career we'll

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:05.460
get to but also you uh you suffered

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:09.210
tremendously from mental illness you

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:13.890
suffered worse in the past and I guess

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:16.230
we've known each other for over a year

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:20.670
now by it by a bit and we've wanted to

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:23.390
do this podcast for that entire time

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:25.530
let's start with the mental illness

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:27.990
what's your most current diagnosis

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:29.250
because I know they fluctuate

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:32.850
well I'm skis Oh affective disorder with

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:36.360
bipolar features so I have a thought

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:40.680
pattern that tends to stray and with

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.920
medicine and insight I'm able maintain

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:48.270
myself here how young were you when I

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:51.170
that's it exactly bingos diagnosis to

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:55.230
there's levels of everything and but

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:56.690
yeah when do you do when do you remember

00:40:56.690 --> 00:41:00.150
starting to deal with it well I was

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:01.920
originally diagnosed with bipolar

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:05.400
disorder when I got in trouble the first

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.200
time but I didn't really have any

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.210
insight into the mental illness part

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:12.030
because I was in denial hello Larry

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:16.710
I was 37 37 before you had any kind of

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:20.610
yeah notice late late in life I probably

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:22.410
had it much sooner now that I look back

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:25.470
on it in college and I've always been a

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:29.820
creative type person and I want to say

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:32.430
strategic thinker but you know I like to

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:34.470
think a different way and I like to

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:36.690
dream a lot so

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:39.030
with that it comes when you say the

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:40.590
first time you got in trouble that's

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:44.550
sure I made a threat on Facebook which

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:46.010
got me in trouble because I thought

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:50.850
people were after me and I ended up

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:52.910
going to jail for that and serving time

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:57.300
I got out of that just by making a

00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:02.400
threat yeah yep he did time yes right

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:06.990
wasn't a credible threat yeah it was to

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:08.850
make a long story short you know I

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:11.430
thought there was a conspiracy going on

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:13.980
and that's part of the mental illness

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:17.790
commonplace for the game yes and what

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:21.030
happened was it was in the midst of

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:23.040
thinking a lot of people on Facebook and

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.220
then the dark thought came over and it

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:28.680
became where I thought I was real so I

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.200
posted a threat on Facebook and then was

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:35.310
subsequently arrested for it now we when

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:38.670
when did you start doing open mics when

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:41.370
did you start doing comedy well I got I

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:43.740
got divorced and decided to take a

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:48.030
comedy club course and I went into it

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:49.590
just trying to get better at public

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:51.360
speaking because I was terrible at sales

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:55.130
I was primarily a corporate America guy

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:58.860
went into it with open arms learned that

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:00.750
very quickly the people that were there

00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:03.450
and I were like-minded thinkers and kind

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:05.670
of same struggles that I had you know I

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:08.910
was 30 in a comedy class yeah I was

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:10.200
thirty something years old when I first

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:14.030
started I ended up going through it

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:17.300
having pretty good I mean it's a very

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.680
the crowds that you get when you first

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.320
start our very supportive so it kind of

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.850
gave me a little bit of a delusion that

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:27.660
I might be good at this so this predates

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:30.930
the yeah I was gonna say just for time

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:33.600
line he said I mean we've got a lot sure

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.210
here that already got unpacked you were

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:39.240
diagnosed at 37 but you were married

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.040
before that yeah I was married before

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:45.390
that and then also where does the comedy

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:47.580
start in their comedy started after I

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:49.560
got divorced and was looking for

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:50.190
something of

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:53.580
substance in my life and I'd always been

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:55.530
a comedy fan and thought I'd be good at

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:56.160
it

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.640
I know you're a dreamer yeah no reamer I

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.910
ended up then you don't blame the

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:04.470
paranoid delusions for why you thought

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:14.610
you were good I think in general most

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:16.170
comedians are delusional until you get

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:17.430
to a certain point where you know you're

00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:20.210
able to perform the craft with some

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:23.250
level of expertise but when you're new I

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:26.700
don't like me you know the sky's the

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:29.790
limit you get punished a lot don't get

00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:32.250
me wrong it's a lot of open mics and

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:34.800
dirt bars and just seedy places that you

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.020
actually try to perform your craft and a

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.700
lot of times they're not there to see

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:41.340
you perform comedy so it kind of builds

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:43.290
you up and gives you a toughness about

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:45.600
yourself but you you got into it not

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.340
because you were a huge comedy fan but

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:48.930
for public speaking or for public

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:50.160
speaking that was worried you a big

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.830
comedy fan I was I was a big Rodney

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:54.870
Dangerfield fan I was wondering my first

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:57.510
shows I got to see him at the MGM in Las

00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:58.170
Vegas

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:01.110
and I went with a friend after a bad

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:03.300
breakup which just seems to be a theme

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.670
of my story after breakups getting into

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:09.510
comedy but I got to see him and people

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:10.680
that were sitting next to us were

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.960
foreign and you know how Rodney is he's

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.730
one line or one line or one liner and

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:17.460
just continues to just destroy your

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.920
brain and we were laughing so hard but

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.660
the foreign couple next to us didn't get

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:23.820
it and they weren't laughing so we kept

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.380
laughing even harder that they're not

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:28.110
laughing and I remember that experience

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:30.270
that happens a lot of my shows they must

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:32.190
have papered the room the only

00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:33.870
difference is the people not laughing at

00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:37.410
my shows get every word but I was able

00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:40.080
to see Rodney when he came out he played

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:42.660
craps with his young wife and a son at

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:45.120
the time and he's in flip-flops in white

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:49.110
linen suit just you know casual wear and

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:50.490
it was just really cool to see him

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:52.710
outside of the comedy and you know he is

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:55.110
similar to what he was onstage except he

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:57.060
was very much more laid-back obviously

00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:59.430
playing craps but that was my first

00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:01.170
experience and then

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:03.500
I got to see Dave Chappelle in Florida

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.640
when I was living there at some point

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:09.180
smart Club yeah no it was actually uh he

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:15.990
was this was probably in 2005 2007 so it

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:17.730
was he was in a Ruth Eckerd Hall or

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:21.000
something about her yeah Tampa st. Peter

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.670
is the Eckerd drug so yeah that's why I

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:25.980
reckon isn't it so I got to see that

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:29.670
obviously got to see Doug early on when

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:32.160
I was starting my comedy and you were a

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.349
big influence on how I approached it and

00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:37.859
the another big influence I would you

00:46:37.859 --> 00:46:40.650
know some I said to say is the Legion of

00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:42.420
skanks podcast you know I was a

00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:45.000
corporate America guy and being able to

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.609
listen to that type of comedy on a

00:46:47.609 --> 00:46:50.160
podcast and coming from a corporate

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.410
world where you're you have to say the

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:55.019
right things and do the right things it

00:46:55.019 --> 00:46:56.430
was interesting to see that type of

00:46:56.430 --> 00:47:01.829
humor but you know basically when did

00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:03.930
your obsession with Saturday Night Live

00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:06.750
start sure well I moved to New York to

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:08.910
get better at comedy I had no

00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:10.380
inclination of anything of that nature

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:13.980
of wanting to be on the show or anything

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:16.470
of that nature or not diagnosed still

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:19.619
not diagnosed I was in a comedy club and

00:47:19.619 --> 00:47:24.240
a guy approached me who I think is am I

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.460
allowed to say his name Yeshua I think

00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:27.900
it was Colin Jost but it might have been

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:30.690
a delusion and he was asking me when I

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:33.000
would be available or if I was gonna be

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.529
around in September and I guess that's

00:47:34.529 --> 00:47:37.529
when they do auditions but that's out

00:47:37.529 --> 00:47:40.349
after I was drunk at the time so I don't

00:47:40.349 --> 00:47:42.269
remember much about it and it could be a

00:47:42.269 --> 00:47:45.029
delusion to this day but then the

00:47:45.029 --> 00:47:47.430
thought process got into me that

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:50.039
what if kind of scenario did I blow up

00:47:50.039 --> 00:47:51.660
because I was drunk because I remember

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:53.099
being at the club in New York and

00:47:53.099 --> 00:47:56.190
walking outside and seeing Tracy Morgan

00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:58.619
try to park his Porsche and he's sitting

00:47:58.619 --> 00:48:00.089
there telling yelling at the staff that

00:48:00.089 --> 00:48:01.650
he wants his Porsche in a certain spot

00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:03.900
and I remember being so drunk that I was

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:06.470
like Tracy Morgan I can't believe it and

00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:09.119
I just remember going to all the comics

00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:11.009
because I listen to a lot of podcasts so

00:48:11.009 --> 00:48:13.319
you feel you have some buy-in to the

00:48:13.319 --> 00:48:14.130
comedian

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:16.349
that you listen to and a lot of them

00:48:16.349 --> 00:48:20.430
work we get it yeah you'll see that

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:24.720
tonight yeah yeah but so this festered

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:27.150
in your head as you start to become

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:30.299
unglued when your mental illness starts

00:48:30.299 --> 00:48:34.829
to to take a grasp yes to the point

00:48:34.829 --> 00:48:38.450
where you were sure that Lorne Michaels

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:40.950
wanted you on Saturday Night Live yeah

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:42.990
another incident happened when I was at

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:44.640
the club I was actually on my way to

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:47.849
open mic and I got a call from another

00:48:47.849 --> 00:48:50.400
comedian to be at the club because area

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.309
sure fear was doing a show and I

00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:55.440
remember walking into the club and I

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:57.509
thought Lauren Michaels was there and I

00:48:57.509 --> 00:48:59.910
thought he bumped me in the back and you

00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:01.289
know when you're mentally ill and you're

00:49:01.289 --> 00:49:02.789
thinking all these things they're going

00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:04.559
through your brain you're looking for

00:49:04.559 --> 00:49:06.930
any small grasps of making something

00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:09.869
true that's part of the illness that's a

00:49:09.869 --> 00:49:11.279
little bit of insight and how that's

00:49:11.279 --> 00:49:14.099
yeah that's a human illness yes people

00:49:14.099 --> 00:49:16.440
want to believe [ __ ] and they will yeah

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:19.349
yeah and there are sales it's part of

00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:22.890
everything I were you obsessed I mean

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:24.240
you obviously you were having these

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.250
tendencies to obsess it's your time

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:28.109
probably not full-blown until you got

00:49:28.109 --> 00:49:31.049
diagnosed but as those things warmed up

00:49:31.049 --> 00:49:32.609
and you started feeling that kind of

00:49:32.609 --> 00:49:34.890
energy and stuff I did was it because

00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:36.779
you were focused it was Saturday Night

00:49:36.779 --> 00:49:39.299
Live like the focus know that why you

00:49:39.299 --> 00:49:43.190
saw why you thought you may have seen

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:45.779
Michaels after the original meeting

00:49:45.779 --> 00:49:48.750
which I thought was Colin Jost it kind

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:52.529
of spurred into my brain that maybe I am

00:49:52.529 --> 00:49:54.480
doing something different in comedy that

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.180
me somebody may want that and or have

00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:00.839
that need for that show because I'm a

00:50:00.839 --> 00:50:02.309
character when I'm on stage obviously

00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:03.990
I'm new at it so that's the first thing

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:06.690
you do is you develop a character and my

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:09.000
particular character tends to inflect

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.519
into the microphone and I kind of shout

00:50:11.519 --> 00:50:15.359
much yeah I've seen early stand-up of

00:50:15.359 --> 00:50:18.200
yours and he's sound like a like a

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:21.859
wrestler trying to do one-liners yes

00:50:21.859 --> 00:50:25.420
very bombastic one-liners yes

00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:27.849
may or may not make any sense selling

00:50:27.849 --> 00:50:34.020
out bull yes so do you move back home

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:37.150
yeah well at some points I went on

00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:38.799
Facebook and I was thanking everybody

00:50:38.799 --> 00:50:40.329
because I thought I had made it to

00:50:40.329 --> 00:50:42.700
Saturday Night Live and I was thanking

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:44.500
everybody personally that were in my

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:45.880
life because it's a big experience for

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.829
young comic obviously you're getting

00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:50.650
exposure on a network TV show regardless

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:52.150
of what people think about it and the

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:55.930
polarization it has on comics to me it

00:50:55.930 --> 00:50:58.089
felt this was also back in a time where

00:50:58.089 --> 00:51:00.400
Saturday Night Live was a wastebasket

00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:04.960
show before what a wastebasket show that

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:07.650
like it was reinvented with Trump like

00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:10.240
no one watched Saturday Night Live it

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.920
wasn't polarizing as what I'm saying

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.900
back when he thought he was gonna be on

00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:18.160
it okay that was that was pre made it up

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:22.299
okay so you made that this is where you

00:51:22.299 --> 00:51:23.920
made the threat yeah we were in New York

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.500
or a bad house in New York and then I

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.049
moved back that's when I was arrested

00:51:29.049 --> 00:51:32.200
and I ended up going to jail for that

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:34.510
and serving my time I'm still on

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:37.660
probation for it but how much time it's

00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:40.299
a five-year probation so but I mean how

00:51:40.299 --> 00:51:42.400
much time is there ever months Wow that

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.290
had to be a really strong threat yeah

00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:46.030
they didn't it was you know they're

00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:48.250
taking a new stance on this because of

00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:50.049
the things that are going on in our

00:51:50.049 --> 00:51:52.960
country and they did make an example out

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.910
of me and you know I'm appreciative to

00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:57.309
the fact that at that point I wish my

00:51:57.309 --> 00:51:59.680
mental illness had gotten caught earlier

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:03.130
but it was still bit undiagnosed and I

00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:05.530
didn't you just seem like a dick yeah

00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:07.750
it's fine line between mentally ill and

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:09.970
just stick correct I mean now that's

00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:12.400
interesting do you do you Harbor I mean

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:13.839
I think you answered a little bit there

00:52:13.839 --> 00:52:14.829
by was your more specific

00:52:14.829 --> 00:52:17.950
you don't harbor any animosity for going

00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:20.109
to jail for what you did online no I do

00:52:20.109 --> 00:52:21.069
not

00:52:21.069 --> 00:52:23.470
that's important yeah it is extremely

00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:26.440
important because you you know at that

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:27.819
point I thought something was happening

00:52:27.819 --> 00:52:31.380
was real and I needed that check

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:34.000
unfortunately it leads into the next

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.990
story but I wish things had been done

00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.840
differently too

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:41.060
my mental illness at that point well

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:43.150
yeah this is where they took a turn

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:45.560
you're still convinced that you're gonna

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:47.060
be on Saturday Night Live

00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:50.900
obviously you got out of jail yeah I did

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:53.930
I sort of let that go at that point and

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:56.780
what happened was my brain started

00:52:56.780 --> 00:53:00.890
thinking the delusional part about maybe

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:03.440
people are after me because of different

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:05.450
reasons or because I posted her threat

00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:13.310
on Facebook and what happened was I

00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:17.030
started thinking very dark there were

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:18.410
things that are happening in my life

00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:24.140
that in the past that didn't make sense

00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:27.860
and I was trying to make sense of them

00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:35.380
being mentally ill what happened was I

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:39.320
eventually I hurt my mother which was

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:42.680
the summary of it all but what was your

00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:44.120
relationship with your mother at that

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:47.150
time I was a great relationship she had

00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:48.980
supported me through thick and thin

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:50.690
through my divorce

00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:53.170
through some tough times in my life she

00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:55.970
supported me in my comedy she was one of

00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:57.320
the very first people to show up to my

00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:02.840
first show at the local club and there

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:04.280
were a lot of things that she did for me

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:05.690
that I'll never be able to thank her for

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:10.660
because I ended up murdering her and

00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:12.800
that's not something that I take very

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:16.460
lightly which obviously is that's as

00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:19.100
serious a break as you can have you

00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:20.840
remember what your thinking was at the

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:23.810
time I don't because what happens is you

00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:26.780
kind of block out what happened was the

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:27.980
day of the event

00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:30.290
I was watching football and then the

00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:34.790
delusion started and I thought that she

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:37.030
was hurting other members of my family

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:40.100
and it got to be so real that I decided

00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:42.790
that something had to be done about it

00:54:42.790 --> 00:54:47.240
and that's when I hurt my mother and

00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.190
you'd still not been diagnosed I still

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:50.630
haven't been done I was diagnosed

00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:52.280
bipolar disorder

00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:55.400
after that or before before that before

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.140
that was that big after coming out of

00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:58.610
jail jail

00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:00.920
okay so jail was where you actually got

00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:03.800
diagnosed yes I was diagnosed in jail

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.960
yes yeah well it was this a matter of

00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:09.620
your meds being miss prescribed are you

00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:12.230
just not taking well the day of the

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:13.850
event I didn't take them because I

00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:15.200
thought people were tampering with them

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.420
you have to understand what mental

00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:19.400
illness it's a multi-level kind of thing

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:22.310
where it's just not one scenario it's a

00:55:22.310 --> 00:55:23.990
multiple layers you know I thought the

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:26.720
mob was after me the government you name

00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:29.960
it it came across my mind and it got to

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:31.730
a point where it became a psychotic

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:34.150
break is what happened with me

00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:39.980
so you murder your mother and then you

00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:43.910
immediately go to New York City yeah I

00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:46.900
ended up taking the her dog with me

00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:48.980
because I didn't want the dog to get

00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:51.140
hurt or be neglected and I thought

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:52.970
people were helping me through this

00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:57.110
problem mainly the government that we're

00:55:57.110 --> 00:55:58.760
trying to help me through this situation

00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:02.630
and I fled to New York I drove all the

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:04.910
way from where I lived to to directly to

00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:07.000
New York and to Rockefeller Center and

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.150
you not only thought you were gonna be

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:13.370
on Saturday Night Live you got on the

00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:18.020
set there I did I went to the front desk

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:21.290
and I asked for Pete Davidson and they

00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:23.360
had my name already in the system

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:24.980
because I had been there before thinking

00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:26.570
I was a cast member and to get the

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:29.150
audition I'd been there multiple times

00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:31.940
so to me you were really flagged

00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:35.330
probably at one point not because you

00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:36.680
had a meeting with Pete Davidson wait

00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:38.690
you have your name you had your name on

00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:40.700
the list that it was okay for you to get

00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:43.460
in or oh so you weren't red flag I want

00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:45.470
you were accidentally okay I was

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:47.090
accidentally okayed I wasn't there to

00:56:47.090 --> 00:56:48.320
hurt anybody

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:50.810
I want to say that very clearly I was

00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:53.360
there because I needed help and I

00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.950
thought that person was helping me

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:58.190
mainly Pete Davidson I got all the way

00:56:58.190 --> 00:57:00.530
up to the set and it was alcohol in the

00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:02.660
words or whatever that guy saying you

00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:04.250
can't even run your own life I'll be

00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:06.100
damned if he'll around mine

00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:09.050
Pete Davidson's gonna help you out Wow

00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:10.640
you're really [ __ ] if you're going to

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:12.290
beat David this might have been pre

00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:16.340
ariana grande he seemed a little more

00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:18.920
together before all that yeah I end up

00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:22.190
getting up there to the set people were

00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:24.530
walking by me I was sitting down waiting

00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:25.820
for him to come out and I think he

00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:27.470
eventually saw me and was like I don't

00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:30.380
know he's like the hallway of his dress

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:32.450
I think I saw a picture you cuz you were

00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:36.890
texting texting pictures to your yes to

00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:40.760
my surviving family yes it of you on the

00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:44.360
set so yeah you were pretty much walking

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:46.070
around free range free balling around

00:57:46.070 --> 00:57:48.500
Saturday Night Live I was I got asked

00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:50.540
you were you walking around

00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:52.820
what was your did you have any strategy

00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:54.650
liked how to blend in or we weren't all

00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:56.780
black like a girl or something I was

00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:59.750
wearing all black but I had my blue

00:57:59.750 --> 00:58:02.270
glasses on and my I said it was my

00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:06.140
signature stage look similar to what

00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:08.420
Jack Nicholson would wear a head clerk

00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:12.830
had Burke yep interesting so I end up

00:58:12.830 --> 00:58:14.900
yeah I think I think he saw me and then

00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:16.820
secured he grabbed me and said that I

00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:18.830
shouldn't be there and I ended up

00:58:18.830 --> 00:58:20.690
getting escorted out and then I went

00:58:20.690 --> 00:58:23.180
into the Plaza Hotel I checked into the

00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:26.180
Plaza Hotel and not a sponsor yes not

00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:30.350
open sponsor yeah went to back to

00:58:30.350 --> 00:58:32.180
Saturday Night Live the second day

00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:34.870
Monday and got back into the set and

00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:37.670
that's where I walked through the doors

00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:40.310
and played air guitar just stupid [ __ ]

00:58:40.310 --> 00:58:43.280
that emits Li Li song I was playing

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.050
probably Prince or something of that

00:58:45.050 --> 00:58:49.790
nature so even though I don't want to

00:58:49.790 --> 00:58:52.310
glamorize what I did because it was

00:58:52.310 --> 00:58:55.040
wrong but I was mentally ill at the time

00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:57.500
and I don't mind sharing with you what's

00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:59.420
going on because I think it's important

00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:02.060
that people hear this story that can

00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:04.700
maybe relate in some capacity to what

00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:06.890
I'm going through mentally where they're

00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:08.390
you know regardless if it's Saturday

00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:10.370
Night Live or the government or the

00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:13.550
Mafia and this story does have positive

00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:16.400
elements yes and

00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:19.309
I end up getting arrested a couple days

00:59:19.309 --> 00:59:20.479
later on Park Avenue

00:59:20.479 --> 00:59:24.769
I do want a a name drop he did stop by

00:59:24.769 --> 00:59:29.359
the skanks Legion his skanks or bonfire

00:59:29.359 --> 00:59:31.160
pod gassy were in the audience for well

00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:33.469
when I was in New York City doing comedy

00:59:33.469 --> 00:59:35.269
I would go to the creek in the cave when

00:59:35.269 --> 00:59:36.859
they were doing their podcast there and

00:59:36.859 --> 00:59:39.619
I spent I was religiously there every

00:59:39.619 --> 00:59:42.200
Pepa sewed and supported those guys

00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:47.420
because you know listening to them kind

00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:50.269
of engaged me comedy wise that I could

00:59:50.269 --> 00:59:53.690
do this possibly and not be a mainstream

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:56.390
act that I could possibly do things you

00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:58.339
know I work blue you know Dave Attell is

00:59:58.339 --> 01:00:01.249
a huge influence on me

01:00:01.249 --> 01:00:04.160
Dangerfield obviously you obviously are

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.930
a huge influence how long were you

01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:10.819
free-roaming New York City you see I was

01:00:10.819 --> 01:00:13.249
there for 7 months the first time and

01:00:13.249 --> 01:00:16.940
then 9 months the second time no no no

01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:18.890
after after the mother incident well

01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:20.809
after the month there's only three days

01:00:20.809 --> 01:00:22.640
yeah and then I was picked up and

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.469
arrested but you and at that time you

01:00:24.469 --> 01:00:26.329
were at the Plaza yeah actually I got

01:00:26.329 --> 01:00:27.440
kicked out of the plaza because of my

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.719
credit card expired and didn't you kick

01:00:29.719 --> 01:00:31.219
down her started out live walking around

01:00:31.219 --> 01:00:32.839
but he gets kicked out of the hotel you

01:00:32.839 --> 01:00:36.859
pay no credit no service now and then

01:00:36.859 --> 01:00:39.499
they arrested me I was booked into the

01:00:39.499 --> 01:00:41.719
tombs which is a horrible horrible jail

01:00:41.719 --> 01:00:44.210
at Rikers Island it's the one in the

01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:47.359
city it's the second jail they talk

01:00:47.359 --> 01:00:50.420
about on Law & Order all the time yeah I

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:52.430
just remember being there and I was

01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:54.589
mentally ill and they stuff you in with

01:00:54.589 --> 01:00:58.359
60 other guys into a small room and

01:00:58.359 --> 01:01:00.799
definitely a horrible experience I don't

01:01:00.799 --> 01:01:03.170
recommend it for anybody that's why it's

01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:04.999
important if you do have a mental

01:01:04.999 --> 01:01:06.469
illness or you know somebody that has a

01:01:06.469 --> 01:01:09.049
mental illness get them some type of

01:01:09.049 --> 01:01:14.239
help if you can early early and even get

01:01:14.239 --> 01:01:16.099
which is easier said than done because

01:01:16.099 --> 01:01:18.019
people don't want to admit that I have a

01:01:18.019 --> 01:01:19.130
question about that because that's

01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:21.440
fascinating to me is that you go out all

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:24.619
this way you noticed there's some energy

01:01:24.619 --> 01:01:25.700
going on in your head about things

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:27.259
you're fixated you're sure easily

01:01:27.259 --> 01:01:29.100
distracted like you said

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:31.740
and then what is what triggers them

01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.900
doing some kind of a psych eval on you

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:37.470
is it is it in jail someone some kind

01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:40.050
person goes hold on a second before well

01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:44.670
I was extremely lucky the the attorney

01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:46.590
that I ended up getting for my mother's

01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:49.260
incident is a big mental health advocate

01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:52.530
and she noticed the warning signs right

01:01:52.530 --> 01:01:55.290
off the bat when I was relocated back to

01:01:55.290 --> 01:01:58.170
the state where I was in and they did a

01:01:58.170 --> 01:02:00.990
psych evaluation of me and rendered me

01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:03.150
that I wasn't in my right mind at that

01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:06.690
point to fast forward the story I was

01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:10.170
made competent for court and I took an

01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:12.740
out guilty by reason of insanity plea

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:16.260
which saved my life I'm I owe my life to

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:17.820
that lady I don't want to mention her

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:23.010
name but she saved my life I also have

01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:25.080
to say that my extended family saved my

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:27.450
life because they had to agree to that

01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:32.280
type of that type of verdict it's not

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.080
easily it's a very small percentage that

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:37.770
actually get that verdict and the only

01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:39.780
reason I'm here today is because of that

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:43.620
incident and not only did you get lucky

01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:47.040
in that you got that you have that

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:51.090
sentence but you landed in a facility

01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:54.480
that does have adequate mental health

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:58.530
care yes which is very rare yes okay

01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:01.560
this whole thing is like like half of 1%

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:04.410
I mean even probably less than that it's

01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:07.170
so crazy that like if that gal hadn't

01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:08.940
shown up that day to take the case yeah

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:10.500
you would have got some frumpy guy that

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:11.610
was you know long yeah

01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:12.900
messed up and just pushed you through

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:16.140
the mill yes they did a thorough

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:18.390
background check I mean obviously I'm

01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:20.790
not a bad person I went through a

01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:23.250
difficult time there was a lot of stress

01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:25.290
on me I wouldn't be remiss to say that I

01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:27.480
did cash out more 401k to move to New

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:29.940
York to pursue comedy which is not very

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.340
wise to do

01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:34.260
I had my place rented out I had a

01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:37.230
mortgage I had expenses and you know New

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.660
York is not a cheap place to live but

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:41.850
it's where I thought I needed

01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:43.500
be in order to get better at comedy

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:46.020
which I did get better at comedy which

01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:50.070
might be relative to say but I don't

01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:52.230
want to be bragging or anything of that

01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:54.350
nature but I thought I did well

01:03:54.350 --> 01:03:56.970
considering the skill sets that I have

01:03:56.970 --> 01:04:00.000
early on in comedy I'm still a 10-minute

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.190
act I don't have this is one of the

01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:04.170
things I want to bring up since Anna

01:04:04.170 --> 01:04:08.220
it's Ben I know that it's been a year

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:11.010
since I first came out to visit you in

01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:14.010
the in the home whatever you call it in

01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:16.470
the facility it's like a like you have

01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:20.070
to stay there right yeah job or

01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:21.600
something yeah it's a gradual release

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:24.720
process when you get that verdict you go

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.910
to one facility before they clear you

01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:29.610
and then once you're rendered stable you

01:04:29.610 --> 01:04:30.990
move to the next phase which is the

01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:33.600
other facility but what they've done for

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:36.980
me is short of an incredible what they

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:40.560
resources the classes the insight the

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:44.190
medication the ability to do things that

01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:47.580
I like did they they not only their

01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:50.540
treatment listening to their patients

01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:54.540
they they let Sonny start an open mic

01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:57.750
night in the facility yeah he gives me

01:04:57.750 --> 01:05:00.510
updates yeah I get text messages and I

01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:03.570
named it the bingo open mic because if

01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:05.550
you've read bingos book she didn't have

01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:08.460
a very good stay at a mental health

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:11.040
facility and I wanted to do something

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.230
that would be and it's not just comedy

01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:15.690
it's any any talent you have yeah we did

01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:18.690
all open arts we did have gangster rap

01:05:18.690 --> 01:05:20.780
on there which we had to quickly uh

01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:23.310
well we had to quickly shut down just

01:05:23.310 --> 01:05:25.260
because of the language but the

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:29.400
therapeutic aspect of it the therapeutic

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:32.280
aspect of it is you don't often see

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.660
people laughing in a mental health

01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:38.270
facility and when they're supposed to be

01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:42.890
but we were able to bring that into

01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:47.130
internally and I don't know if we'd be

01:05:47.130 --> 01:05:48.960
able to play the audio at some point on

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.030
one of the podcasts but we were able to

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:53.330
probably have so okay yeah probably not

01:05:53.330 --> 01:05:55.880
HIPAA violations dream

01:05:55.880 --> 01:06:00.270
but I remember was it Thanksgiving where

01:06:00.270 --> 01:06:01.950
I said yeah you watching football and he

01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:03.990
goes no they have Jason versus Freddie

01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:06.869
on the main TV I'm like but but you put

01:06:06.869 --> 01:06:09.030
the bad language in gangster rap this

01:06:09.030 --> 01:06:12.240
get shit-canned bless ya the the the the

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:17.329
murderer movies oh yeah but they they

01:06:17.329 --> 01:06:23.250
Freddie just heard his mother just hurt

01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:27.059
six chicks with an axe they they've been

01:06:27.059 --> 01:06:30.180
very good to me and I don't know how

01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:32.339
I'll be able to pay them back except to

01:06:32.339 --> 01:06:33.900
be able to bring my message to other

01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:35.809
people that are possibly mentally ill or

01:06:35.809 --> 01:06:38.490
maybe even do an open mic at another

01:06:38.490 --> 01:06:40.920
facility where people will need you have

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.270
to understand you can get

01:06:42.270 --> 01:06:44.130
institutionalized very quickly in these

01:06:44.130 --> 01:06:47.339
facilities and like for me to be outside

01:06:47.339 --> 01:06:50.280
right now and they open and to be able

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.270
to go the show tonight

01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:53.400
these are privileges that I've been able

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:57.869
to gain through action and through going

01:06:57.869 --> 01:07:00.690
easy you've been very clear with me the

01:07:00.690 --> 01:07:02.250
whole time we've known each other that

01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:05.280
that's your biggest focal point is

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.380
trying to be able to help other people

01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:10.470
yes let's suffer with the same thing yes

01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:14.099
and I wouldn't be remiss to say how

01:07:14.099 --> 01:07:16.890
important you are to my recovery I know

01:07:16.890 --> 01:07:21.180
that you have a different style comedy

01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:23.790
and I appreciate that style but I don't

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:27.540
think people know the true Doug Stanhope

01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:38.099
that I do this brand honest sure but the

01:07:38.099 --> 01:07:40.230
emails that I sent you the phone calls

01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:44.040
the text when you're inside my family

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:46.890
mainly my dad and my stepmom have been

01:07:46.890 --> 01:07:50.490
extremely supportive of me but you just

01:07:50.490 --> 01:07:53.280
knowing you and being attached to comedy

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:57.780
in some way has helped me recover and I

01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:59.309
know that bingo

01:07:59.309 --> 01:08:00.720
obviously suffers some of the same

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:03.059
mental illness and you have some insight

01:08:03.059 --> 01:08:04.920
on what we go through because you've

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.750
seen her go through the system just as

01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:09.330
well as me yeah

01:08:09.330 --> 01:08:12.360
and I want to I want to close this

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:15.390
because uh you don't know what the

01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:17.430
beginning of this podcast was and I want

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:18.839
to tell you about it but we're gonna

01:08:18.839 --> 01:08:22.530
save that for the patreon okay cuz I

01:08:22.530 --> 01:08:26.910
really want to get your take sure from

01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:30.270
your point of view but and I don't want

01:08:30.270 --> 01:08:32.609
to I know that you still have some small

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:34.109
struggles here and again with this so I

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:35.549
don't want to spark anything cuz it

01:08:35.549 --> 01:08:37.080
wouldn't happen ever

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:40.740
correct but hypothetically if they did

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:43.650
want you on Saturday Night Live have you

01:08:43.650 --> 01:08:46.950
ever said anything racist that might

01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:48.030
stop you

01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:54.180
yeah no all right well that's so you

01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:55.950
thought you were gonna be on Saturday

01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:58.589
Night Live and we're gonna continue this

01:08:58.589 --> 01:09:01.080
