00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.960
[Music]

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.460
[Music]

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.720
I'm gonna jump ridiculously and I'm

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.460
gonna bash my teeth into the microphone

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.380
or something like that that was just so

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.750
great because it was so you gonna

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.340
watch the tape it's so perfect trying to

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:47.610
do a show from the outside and they may

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.899
be far too little I hate it so you drew

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:52.410
blood

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.610
that's basically you're drawing blood

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.590
and that's situation we'll see there's I

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.109
mean if I can get him to piss his pants

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.760
I don't know if I don't think I yeah

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.320
it's so funny because I never thought as

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.909
two friends that you two would be the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.150
ones that would match bully and ultimate

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.240
thing bully wants which is there's a

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.979
shot I'm telling you there's a shot if I

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.680
feel right now that a drip of piss came

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.659
out of my pee hole when he tickled me

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.119
it's possible I feel like it's possible

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:30.030
you check I mean are you that big of a

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.090
quick draw what how many how many

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.710
coochie-coochie-coo is would it take you

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.530
to piss now no Dan never tested

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.200
the amount of coochie coos can we do it

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.400
I'm a seven coochie-coo

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.960
I mean then you gonna know like it's

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.310
like licks of a Tootsie Pop

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.439
exactly you'll be like he's got two more

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.540
and I'm gonna blow I don't even

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.549
know it was so much looking over so much

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.140
like the reaction of tickle like the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.780
laughing I think it's like the not being

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.409
able to stop someone prodding me yeah

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.840
yeah dude I if someone touches my

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.170
ribcage I'll because I'm blonde

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.570
Shana hasn't tickled me yet but he's got

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.469
me on the things you're like oh I

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.420
 it but I hate it I hate it so

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.220
we'll see where tickle gets bad is where

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.450
you

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.910
get up under the armpits in your

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.400
just I'll never think anybody in the you

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.580
ever try that when there's locked in

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.200
they know whatever tickled in UFC they

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.400
should have they showed up they

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.930
definitely shows it on a band move to

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.280
start tickling someone just getting the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.690
 beat out of you and you just get

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.540
one thing if you go for the tickle and

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.610
that person will not ticklish you are

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:47.239
gonna get nervous that was a bad move on

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.880
Bors in or he gets tickled and pees and

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.160
then furiously beats the show that's my

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.190
fear with you if I get him if I'd make

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.650
him piss he's gonna attack it's gonna be

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.500
like like the kid in school where I'm

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.840

line the beard games Shane and Jay on

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.490
the beard game I'll get the terms dude

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.950
set the difficulty to pro computer can't

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:04.330
play defense for you the whole

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.880
time what set to set the difficulty to

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.740
Pro all that means is just easier to hit

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.530
shots yes and the computer is easier to

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.580
beat I got to beat the computer to be

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:19.480
you don't play defense you're defending

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.470
him because you do the same

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.800
thing

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:25.300
don't you I play defense play off the

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:30.580
ball by the way it's not

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.320
fully true because I try to steal the

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.150
inbound when I play your guy up but then

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:35.230
I know how to switch because I'm playing

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:36.820
the passing lanes what's wrong with that

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:41.190
I say it's real Heyman right now

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:52.600
difficulties Pro why a difficulty

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.730
definitely on Pro which is boring yeah

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:55.660
you gotta go all-star

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.370
you guys go all-star at least I'll do

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:59.470
all-star if we risk the Fiat yeah put

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:00.940
the beard on the line get it out there

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.279
because then if you beat Shane he has to

00:19:03.279 --> 00:19:05.919
grow facial hair for four weeks Oh che

00:19:05.919 --> 00:19:08.649
vuoi no Shane that's a terrible bet for

00:19:08.649 --> 00:19:10.859
me because I'm probably gonna lose

00:19:10.859 --> 00:19:12.940
there's a spread then if we're doing

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.879
