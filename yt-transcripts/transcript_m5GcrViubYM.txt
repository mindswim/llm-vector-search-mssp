segment shane you know as a stand-up

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.720
comedian as we watch the progression and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.040
then run into the the kobit situation

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.879
how much is podcasting affected the gig

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.879
of being a stand-up is it is it taken

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.280
away is it added to what's its effect

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.200
on your life um

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.680
it's it's helped me immensely i mean uh

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.319
it cost me a job but

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.920
other than that

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.760
it's been pretty good you know other

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.480
than that one huge mistake

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.480
that pogba that you know podcasting

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.319
brought down the wrath of the entire

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.400
country other than that it's been pretty

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.760
good

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.560
lauren michaels is a bully yeah i mean

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.160
you open the door we were we weren't

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.920
sure if we were going to bring it up or

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.080
or not but i mean i don't care at all

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.319
all right you you you you get saturday

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.000
night live and then you quickly lose

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.440
saturday night live but you have

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.680
rebounded from losing saturday night

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.599
live but that overall experience what

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:04.400
has that

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.080
uh been like and what how does that

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.680
affect your routine on stage and when

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.599
you're going places

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:10.560
um

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.560
you know it really if

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.120
it hasn't totally affected anything on

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.360
stage but uh yeah obviously you know

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.640
that was like a life-altering event um

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.159
i would say that you know what that's

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.760
where cove had really kind of hurt me

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.879
because

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.120
i was you know it was only four months

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.599
or whatever after i got fired from snl

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.280
that covet took place so i never really

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.799
had time to like

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.599
kind of come back at all i just had to

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.040
but that's fine with me you know i never

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.959
planned on

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.879
being famous or whatever snl would have

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.159
brought i kind of just wanted to do

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.640
stand-up and uh i've been able to do

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.879
that so that's good

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.640

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.680

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.280
the last netflix documentary you've

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.680

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.919
night stalker

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.520
well you're talking to sports talk radio

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.199
that carried on through the pandemic

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.639
we're very accustomed to talking about

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.720
what we saw on netflix so yeah no i know

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.280
part and parcel of what we do here

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.880
yeah today we talked about the tiger

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.680
woods documentary uh

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.919
you know obviously

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:54.840
that was

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.600
all i feel sorry for tiger my wife

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.800
turned to me when i was always because i

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.560
kind of feel sorry for him

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.160
i feel a lot of things i don't feel

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.400
sorry for fear

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.720
sure that's that's that's a very fair

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.639
statement i don't feel sorry

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.880
obviously i don't even think he would

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.199
want anybody to feel sorry for him it's

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.600
like i mean what you were sorry for this

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.160
millionaire best athlete at a sport had

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.520
sex too much

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.400
like

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.160
you know i don't think i feel sorry for

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.479
anybody without all those problems

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.160
but it's your legs right it takes your

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.080
legs it's amazing he came back from all

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.000
that sex

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.120
i did yeah at one time ten i mean there

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.320
were certain things in there that you're

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.840
going like seriously ten at one

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.479
time i i yeah it was pretty impressive i

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:41.759
mean it made me

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.600
yeah it was uh

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.520
i i mean i think in hindsight i think we

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.600
can all look back and be like yeah maybe

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.120
we overreacted

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.960
a little you know having press

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.919
conferences for this guy but

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.360
it was you know i was cheering for him

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.520
and i yeah it was cool it was cool it

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.639
was cool to see him win the masters

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.240
recently what was that last year two

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.919
years ago

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.319
and especially with his kiddo there uh

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.400
coming up in that recent uh

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.319
where his kid was playing i mean you

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:11.440
know i i i like the doc in the sense of

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.280
you know it showed all the all the

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.280
negative stuff as well i wish somehow

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.880
they would have had tiger be a part of

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.720
it to tell a little bit of his story but

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.680
then

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.039
you know he would have controlled too

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:22.479
much of it and we wouldn't have got what

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:23.919
we got out of that

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.400
out of those two episodes

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.400
yeah i think tiger would probably yeah

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.400
