00:50:20.499 --> 00:50:22.479
speaker shaped almost like a tombstone I

00:50:25.539 --> 00:50:26.859
we had the same exact we had the same

00:50:26.859 --> 00:50:27.400

dinner and my dad thought it'd be funny

00:50:38.739 --> 00:50:40.599
to [ __ ] with my uncle except my dad

00:50:40.599 --> 00:50:42.970
pretended he was the one farting like he

00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:44.680

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:45.789
my uncle's I could the hell are you

00:50:45.789 --> 00:50:48.640
doing stop it my dad kept like kept

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.410
hitting the button but don't remote

00:50:50.410 --> 00:50:52.150
control to the thing we lost and the

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:53.710
only way you could use it is for some

00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:56.019
reason his car remote worked for it why

00:50:56.019 --> 00:50:58.239
you pressed unlock on the remote for

00:50:58.239 --> 00:51:00.329
your car the fart machine was going off

00:51:00.329 --> 00:51:04.150
the car the fart machine perhaps there's

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:07.390
a Ford Taurus what maybe Ford's in a

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:10.359
Ford made fart machines perhaps new

00:51:10.359 --> 00:51:11.559
Tesla has a fart machine

00:51:11.559 --> 00:51:12.940
don't into it but because you were

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:16.239
hitting the unlock no what because we're

00:51:16.239 --> 00:51:17.829
hitting unlock to make the fart machine

00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:19.539
go off the cars lights were flashing

00:51:19.539 --> 00:51:24.400
[ __ ] my uncle's like your fart sir this

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.650

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:33.579
laughing he lost his [ __ ] nothing you

00:51:33.579 --> 00:51:39.819
know we're making cars Tesla is a fart

00:51:39.819 --> 00:51:41.499
machine so Tesla if you get the new

00:51:41.499 --> 00:51:43.630
Tesla you can hit it you can hit a

00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:45.400
button that's like right you can choose

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:47.440
what seat makes a fart noise because

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:48.969
Tesla's just all computerized

00:51:48.969 --> 00:51:51.099
you can literally like whatever like the

00:51:51.099 --> 00:51:52.450
speaker near the seat is you're gonna

00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:53.979
set off you just be on the screen and be

00:51:53.979 --> 00:51:55.900
like fart rear back right seat it's a

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:58.660
big boom instead I think fart right next

00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:01.930
to our mosque is a [ __ ] doofus he is

00:52:01.930 --> 00:52:04.839
the main oh he's a doofus no dude

00:52:04.839 --> 00:52:08.489
honestly after this news I want

00:52:08.489 --> 00:52:11.979
unbelievable news check your sources on

00:52:11.979 --> 00:52:15.519
this google it look I actually I stand

00:52:15.519 --> 00:52:17.680
by my sources as much Aaron Taylor sighs

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.150
I trust you though

00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:20.650
dude that you know the Tesla has this

00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:22.330
like there's there's no motor at all it

00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:23.890
obviously it's electric there's just

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:25.690
five components this is a computer wheel

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:28.060
steering wheel then like you know in

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:29.260
terms like the drive yeah there's no

00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:31.270
like gears yeah do they Tesla's are like

00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:34.120
so they're like crushing people in drag

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:35.830
races they they come off faster than

00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:37.870
like Ferraris yeah because there's none

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:40.780
of that like cylinder fire did it it all

00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:41.860
that stuff this is just like hit a

00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:45.340
button it's Russian people in races so

00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:46.300
it's funny cuz if you're hardcore

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:48.550
gearhead a lot of them are like yeah but

00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:49.930
you just can't come over the [ __ ]

00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:51.610
turbine like dude tehsils are just blown

00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:54.160
these cars off a lot so fun yeah he's

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:56.890
doing that challenge with the truck if

00:52:56.890 --> 00:52:57.760
they haven't already

00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:00.880
with his truck like a pull like a tug of

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:04.390
war with like an f-150 he's gonna crush

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:06.400
it in the Tesla truck dude there he's

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.050
gonna crush it well I guess what they

00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:12.160
cuz you won't change gears right in the

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:14.830
tug-of-war you wouldn't change gears

00:53:14.830 --> 00:53:18.040
yeah not like the f-150 wouldn't so it

00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.140
would just be it's like torque or well

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:21.490
yeah I doubt they would agree to do it

00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:22.780
if they thought they were gonna get

00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:25.720
crushed exactly these guys are

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:27.160
physicists they can just count know

00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:29.200
either one though I bet the the truck

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.570
the regular truck people are like we got

00:53:31.570 --> 00:53:33.970
a shot yet but they can get an f-150 and

00:53:33.970 --> 00:53:37.120
let's do it anyway yeah yeah so but yeah

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:38.440
those dudes can like launch it to the

00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:39.880
moon they can calculate the weight and

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:41.680
the speed of the truck yeah I feel like

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.420
f-150 Striders oh my Cowboys they're

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.160
probably like no Otto engines attention

00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:48.070

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:04.260
and then like some guy like using his

01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:06.650
body to be like maybe it's a [ __ ] buy

01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:10.890
$20 for like 10 seconds this week and it

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:14.000

Thornburg a news anchor being like this

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:41.190
I started with Fox News

01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:43.680
I was watching Tucker talkers giving you

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.600
the big talkers going there talking

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.490
about all the all of them are talking

01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:48.750
about impeachment that's all they're

01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:50.340
talking about and then the guys like

01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:52.380
Tucker's like oh yeah they had with the

01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:53.750
Russians and they're gonna do it again

01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:56.520
and he's like laughing at them to go and

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:57.510
the him and the other guy who's like

01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:59.190
laughing it up the whole time then you

01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:00.570
go to the next one they're just like I

01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:02.820
mean what do you think this what do you

01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:04.770
think the strategy here and dude no one

01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:06.510
said anything of importance no at all

01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:08.460
I'm watching it it's like well clearly

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:09.870
here we have to think about that dude

01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:11.550
it's so funny watching how the different

01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:12.870
ones like communicating that's all

01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:16.650
that's how dumb it's all like hey this

01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:20.160
is gonna play with yeah and then someone

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:23.040
will say something slightly like well I

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:24.960
mean an impeachment here's three things

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.970
about impeachment I don't know if we can

01:05:26.970 --> 01:05:28.950
do it the house is it is like all right

01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:30.420
so everybody has their favorite team

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:32.540
mm-hmm it's like watching NFL countdown

01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:34.980
that's what the news is now

01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:36.720
all the bangles play the Steelers today

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.670
spent three hours talking about the

01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:45.060
Steelers pass-rush Steelers yeah who do

01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:47.280
you thinks gonna win would spend twenty

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.230
minutes talking about that it's like we

01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:51.000
watch these guys these guys talk about a

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.250
game in three hours before we watch a

01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:55.109
[ __ ] three-hour gate like just just

01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:56.340
wait who you don't need their opinions

01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:57.960
just watch the [ __ ] game and I swear

01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:59.340
to god the moment they get to something

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:01.710
actually interesting they like we have

01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:04.020
to go to break it's like yeah break for

01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:05.340
what so then they come back and they

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:07.590
don't exactly and they don't go convert

01:06:07.590 --> 01:06:09.570
Iseman but when they come back and it's

01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:11.880
like it's always a letdown it's like

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:12.750
wait I thought you guys about the

01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:16.170
tackles I'm serious right before the

01:06:16.170 --> 01:06:20.160
commercial what was that I mean dude

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.140
there's some commercials to see what it

01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:23.910
was they were talking the stuff they

01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:25.590
were talking about like I can kind of

01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:27.570
loosely remember it I wouldn't even

01:06:27.570 --> 01:06:29.190
bring myself to discuss their talking

01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:30.810
points because it was such a waste of

01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:33.180
time yeah I got a bag on a bad vortex on

01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:34.410
the way back of like when everything

01:06:34.410 --> 01:06:36.869
sucks kind of vortex every episode of

01:06:36.869 --> 01:06:37.820
Southfork

01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:40.170
dude I was watching I was like cuz I was

01:06:40.170 --> 01:06:41.760
going through I could choose between

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.550
like whatever channels are on TV to

01:06:44.550 --> 01:06:46.080
watch and I was like there's not a

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.240
single thing on here even the news is

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:50.100
like you could be like I'll watch the

01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:51.900
news it's like it might be that might be

01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:54.560
as bad as watching [ __ ] Gold Rush

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:57.330
yeah yeah I swear to god dude there's no

01:06:57.330 --> 01:07:00.300
in terms of like substance yeah gold

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:02.250
watch is probably better better I would

01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:05.250
say yes yeah substance yeah sustance

01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:07.680
sustenance dudes I'm watching and I was

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.170
like freaked out like genuinely freaked

01:07:10.170 --> 01:07:11.880
out watching the news I had whoa people

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:12.570
[ __ ] believe this

01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:14.490
it's a freak out we watched we watched

01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:16.560
probably the worst piece of [ __ ] I've

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.840
ever seen in my life yesterday

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:21.690
well it's called six underground oh yeah

01:07:21.690 --> 01:07:23.900
it's on Netflix it's a Michael Bay movie

01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:26.580
with Ryan Reynolds and like a group of

01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:30.630
like a hot spies or some [ __ ] though I

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:33.180
steal auntie's they're hot mm-hmm it's

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:34.980
the worst [ __ ] movie I've ever seen

01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:35.609
in my life

01:07:35.609 --> 01:07:39.330
it's crazy yeah what what was this

01:07:39.330 --> 01:07:41.690
it's like a new movie on Netflix and

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:45.690
yeah the budget must have was eight 185

01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:48.040
million dollars yes like it's just sir

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:51.880
yeah dick Ulis and I mean some of the

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:53.590
violence that's over the top is kind of

01:07:53.590 --> 01:07:57.130
funny but it's like the Brian realms

01:07:57.130 --> 01:07:59.080
keeps doing that snarky thing like in

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.030
Deadpool he's almost the exact same

01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:02.440
characters dead but like I'm sitting

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:03.700
down with like a mob boss in the

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:05.410
beginning where he's like you're gonna

01:08:05.410 --> 01:08:07.210
pay me and the guys like I'm going to

01:08:07.210 --> 01:08:09.460
kill you then he's like well if you do

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:14.920
that it's gonna suck for your face it's

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:16.060
the kind of thing where like someone

01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:18.009
will have a gun to his head and be like

01:08:18.009 --> 01:08:20.080
I'm gonna kill you my mom always said

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:29.830
had a thick skull most people gross like

01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:33.240
somebody'll get shot like Oh gross yeah

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:34.930
[ __ ] Christ

01:08:34.930 --> 01:08:36.970
most people watch that and be highly

01:08:36.970 --> 01:08:38.620
entertained yeah we've looked at the

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:40.330
reviews it's not the worst reviewed

01:08:40.330 --> 01:08:42.400
movie that's so bad though people like

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:45.850
this is like a new franchise yeah yeah

01:08:45.850 --> 01:08:48.190
yes it's terrifying because you're like

01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:51.160
I'm so far from this yeah of ever

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.810
thinking of something like this and

01:08:52.810 --> 01:08:54.700
trying to pitch this to somebody it's

01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:57.759
like it's wall-to-wall garbage like the

01:08:57.759 --> 01:09:00.009
whole premise is that they're all dead

01:09:00.009 --> 01:09:01.750
yeah they all faked their own deaths

01:09:01.750 --> 01:09:03.640
okay and they're all like one's an

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.220
ex-spy one's a doctor one's a [ __ ]

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:09.270
driver one's a parkour kids in England

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:11.350
so during it's like a fast and furious

01:09:11.350 --> 01:09:13.859
style like we're family

01:09:13.859 --> 01:09:16.270
that's the message of the movie by the

01:09:16.270 --> 01:09:19.710
way at the end he's like we are family

01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:22.799
dude well I mean I know Amazon does a

01:09:22.799 --> 01:09:25.330
like original content I'm sure now

01:09:25.330 --> 01:09:26.710
they're probably they're probably

01:09:26.710 --> 01:09:29.410
bleeding in the with some of these movie

01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:31.390
scripts they're probably taking like the

01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:34.630
research from like these huge AI things

01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:36.580
and just kind of putting them in scripts

01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:38.080
because you can now write a movie as a

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.430
business thing being like this is where

01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:40.450
people are talking about this but people

01:09:40.450 --> 01:09:41.920
don't really feel like a computer wrote

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.779
this much that's what I'm saying I would

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:45.310
I would think that there people are

01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:46.870
starting to mess around with that like

01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:49.509
AI generated scripts off like all the

01:09:49.509 --> 01:09:50.770
little things that people tend to

01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:52.600
respond to yes well that makes sense

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.279
because that's who definitely put this

01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:56.680
together it was it was [ __ ] insane

01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:00.100
the product placement in it was crazy

01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:01.900
like there's like in the movie

01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:04.030
there's like they try to overthrow this

01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:06.070
middle-eastern dictator mm-hmm there's

01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:08.920
like a one scene that makes in hindsight

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:10.630
even during it I was like what why is

01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:12.909
this happening they like fake like

01:10:12.909 --> 01:10:15.130
they're with the Red Cross at this

01:10:15.130 --> 01:10:17.830
what's supposed to be Syria yeah and

01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:19.650
there's a gas attack by the government

01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:22.840
that like kills everybody yeah and then

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:25.690
it cuts to him in a casino in it like

01:10:25.690 --> 01:10:28.510
there's no point for that there was the

01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:31.690
ganache there was nothing there's there

01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:36.580
was a lot of times where you'd be you'd

01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:40.179
be ten minutes into a flashback and now

01:10:40.179 --> 01:10:41.739
it was a flash but find out that it's a

01:10:41.739 --> 01:10:45.370
flashback damn sick one of the worst

01:10:45.370 --> 01:10:47.140
movies I've ever seen the sick move in

01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:48.880
writing but oh wait it was just a dream

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:51.370
the except there wasn't even supposed to

01:10:51.370 --> 01:10:52.960
be like a twist that it was a dream it

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:55.330
wasn't like a twist yeah he's just like

01:10:55.330 --> 01:10:58.480
impossible to follow this and Becky was

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.550
like timing the shot the shots were one

01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:03.100
second long it was just clips of [ __ ]

01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:05.860
the whole movie they never kept on on

01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:08.860
the same scene for more than two seconds

01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:10.780
yeah it was just cut to like a [ __ ]

01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:12.730
helicopter flying a [ __ ] jet just

01:11:12.730 --> 01:11:14.469
sucked well that's also weird too

01:11:14.469 --> 01:11:16.210
because I feel like there's me I'm not

01:11:16.210 --> 01:11:17.679
saying you guys hate watched it but

01:11:17.679 --> 01:11:19.719
that's like a viable we hate watch it

01:11:19.719 --> 01:11:21.340
okay so you guys didn't hate totally

01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:23.380
yeah that's become a viable form of

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:25.570
entertainment dude you ever heard of the

01:11:25.570 --> 01:11:27.250
fighter and the kids subreddit it's

01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:29.110
people hate listening to that podcast

01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:30.670
just so they can talk [ __ ] on it

01:11:30.670 --> 01:11:33.429
afterwards mmm the whole entire the

01:11:33.429 --> 01:11:35.409
whole entire subreddit is dedicated to

01:11:35.409 --> 01:11:37.810
hating that podcast and then people show

01:11:37.810 --> 01:11:39.670
up to his gigs they're like if there's

01:11:39.670 --> 01:11:41.260
like if it's not that like crowded I'd

much [ __ ] somehow like I I watched like

01:12:08.530 --> 01:12:10.030
a video of people talking about how like

01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:12.370
they were like his [ __ ] brain is

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:13.870
[ __ ] and it's just like he just

01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:14.980
forgets

01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:17.830
yeah every once in a while he does ten

01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:20.590
thousand hours of content a week yeah I

01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:22.930

every single person well Nonna yeah like

01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:26.860
everybody except the trick when Patrice

died they were all like he was the

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:30.160
legend before that they would all call

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:32.620
him like a [ __ ] gorilla and crazy

01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:34.930
[ __ ] really yeah dude oh and a subreddit

they hate Anthony come here that's funny

01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:45.550
too is I'm thinking about like like

01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:46.840
being on job sites and having people

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.610
blast owene and it's thinking about like

01:12:48.610 --> 01:12:50.110
what lurks in the darkest corners of

01:12:50.110 --> 01:12:51.720
their minds and it's probably like

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:55.450
flocking nuts yeah yeah that that was it

01:12:55.450 --> 01:12:56.590
was interesting I've been following that

01:12:56.590 --> 01:12:58.150
subreddit and just watching people kind

01:12:58.150 --> 01:13:00.400
of like on walls I'm like what is this

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:01.780
what is this new form of like

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:03.310
entertainment where you just watch stuff

01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:04.750
like dude they're doing it with comedy

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:06.640
there's a whole thing with stand-up now

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:07.960
where there's a whole thing where you

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.520
just you're a journalist and you like

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:11.530
monitor comedy and you're liking this

01:13:11.530 --> 01:13:13.210
guy did it's like yeah

01:13:13.210 --> 01:13:15.550
what the [ __ ] there's like focus there's

01:13:15.550 --> 01:13:17.080
like a focused hatred now into

01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.100
entertainment where you can just like

01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:19.660
actively hate things with other people

01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:21.370
yeah and what they're doing with comedy

01:13:21.370 --> 01:13:24.280
is insane it's weird they there's a

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:25.989
group of journalists that are like this

01:13:25.989 --> 01:13:30.220
is the like frontier of the the

01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:32.770
dangerous right in this country I know

01:13:32.770 --> 01:13:33.610
like no it's not

01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:36.430
these are comedians like you go focus on

01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:38.410
a real problem now yeah yeah did

01:13:38.410 --> 01:13:40.239
Chappelle make fun of transgender beauty

01:13:40.239 --> 01:13:42.310

yeah not that that's not a thing not

01:13:45.730 --> 01:13:47.950
trying to make it a thing that is weird

01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:50.350
to be this is fascism rising I think

01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:53.980
really Louie in Israel I was lead rather

01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:55.660

01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:58.600
yeah he got a standing ovation at the

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.790
end of the show they laughed and then

01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:05.560
across the ocean somebody was like yeah

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:10.770
it's like dude get up [ __ ] life yeah

01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:16.480
by 30% yeah yeah that's uh I don't know

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:16.930
it's weird

01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:18.280
well I alway catch myself getting caught

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:19.420
up in like yeah I would like watch

01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:21.280
something yeah it sucks and like I've

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.170
just dropped that all together now yeah

01:14:23.170 --> 01:14:24.730
it's just I just don't want any part of

01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:26.410
any of it yes I was in that for a while

01:14:26.410 --> 01:14:28.039
I notice I do with pardon

01:14:28.039 --> 01:14:31.579
yeah when I'm hungover I think if I wake

01:14:31.579 --> 01:14:33.260
up and I'm super hungover I feel

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:35.059
terrible about myself I like just go on

01:14:35.059 --> 01:14:36.619
the internet I'm like this person sucks

01:14:36.619 --> 01:14:39.110
yeah this sucks and I like yeah that's

01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:41.480
kind of why I got rid of Instagram open

01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:43.400
it up and be like it's [ __ ] blows

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.199
yeah I'll tell you what I do I'll get on

01:14:45.199 --> 01:14:48.139
see like a comic post something on

01:14:48.139 --> 01:14:49.909
Twitter and they'll be like I bet they

01:14:49.909 --> 01:14:51.800
talk [ __ ] and then I'll go to their page

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:55.159
scroll for nine years back to one it

01:14:55.159 --> 01:14:57.380
happens because each one of these shitty

01:14:57.380 --> 01:15:00.409
no-name comics tweets a million times a

01:15:00.409 --> 01:15:00.619
day

01:15:00.619 --> 01:15:03.199
sure oh it's crazy human you've been

01:15:03.199 --> 01:15:05.719
building up I guess dossier dude I got

01:15:05.719 --> 01:15:07.369
the list of everyone who talked [ __ ] now

01:15:07.369 --> 01:15:08.750
I'm never gonna do anything I'm probably

01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:10.159
not sure to say anything back but you

01:15:10.159 --> 01:15:12.230
know my ladder would be like hey yeah

01:15:12.230 --> 01:15:14.289
how are you yeah

01:15:14.289 --> 01:15:18.010
yeah it's hard to hold on to a grudge I

01:15:18.010 --> 01:15:23.840
got mine no but it is like I don't know

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.750
I wish I was better at like holding on

01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:31.070
to just hating somebody know especially

01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:34.519
in comedy but it could be like a good

01:15:34.519 --> 01:15:36.530
like motivation yeah but then what

01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:37.699
though you're gonna come out and be like

01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:39.710
I'm doing it to fit well you never say

01:15:39.710 --> 01:15:42.170
it out loud chill just keep it in there

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:43.369
yeah yeah

01:15:43.369 --> 01:15:45.559
yeah I got you're saying yeah for sure

01:15:45.559 --> 01:15:47.119
so that it kind of degrade inside of you

01:15:47.119 --> 01:15:48.380
yeah but as soon as something good

01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:51.980
happens I'm like everybody's great yeah

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:55.130
any dude that yeah as soon as I started

01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:56.989
getting stuff when I moved to New York I

01:15:56.989 --> 01:15:59.989
dropped all that I was that was all I

01:15:59.989 --> 01:16:02.659
did yeah I was like [ __ ] this comic they

01:16:02.659 --> 01:16:04.670
suck [ __ ] them they suck

01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:06.650
yeah and then as soon as I started

01:16:06.650 --> 01:16:07.730
getting stuff I was like now they're

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:11.090
pretty good they're funny for sure but

01:16:11.090 --> 01:16:12.920
that's slightly different I mean yeah I

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:14.659
zero Zane it's also slightly different

01:16:14.659 --> 01:16:17.000
because like you kind of have your hat

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.500
in that ring to where you can be like I

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:20.570
can do this too and it when it's just

01:16:20.570 --> 01:16:22.909
like consumers of a product who are like

01:16:22.909 --> 01:16:24.949
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah and there is

01:16:24.949 --> 01:16:26.269
always like an element and we just

01:16:26.269 --> 01:16:27.860
watched that movie purely out of hate

01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:30.409
come on oh yeah under six underground it

01:16:30.409 --> 01:16:32.300
was like I was watching it I was like

01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:34.610
this is hurting me yeah I kept telling

01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:36.019
them like you guys this is make like

01:16:36.019 --> 01:16:38.000
physically I was angry during the movie

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.099
the whole movie I was

01:16:40.099 --> 01:16:43.309
wellhere's yeah yeah I mean it is it is

01:16:43.309 --> 01:16:46.070
upset it is upsetting well I mean in

01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:47.719
terms of art it elicits an emotional

01:16:47.719 --> 01:16:49.519
response from you guys exactly it would

01:16:49.519 --> 01:16:52.189
be which it wasn't dude it made like

01:16:52.189 --> 01:16:54.649
fast and furious he's awesome compared

01:16:54.649 --> 01:16:56.989
to this true those movies are genuinely

01:16:56.989 --> 01:16:59.479
good compared to this movie yeah how did

01:16:59.479 --> 01:17:01.459
the mechs turn now about it he didn't it

01:17:01.459 --> 01:17:02.959
was it's it's like the number one movie

01:17:02.959 --> 01:17:05.389
on Netflix it's like their front home

01:17:05.389 --> 01:17:09.079
screen it was due to again 185 million

01:17:09.079 --> 01:17:10.849
dollars to film this it's Michael Bay

01:17:10.849 --> 01:17:12.439
there were it's formers there was

01:17:12.439 --> 01:17:14.719
Netflix original content yes there were

01:17:14.719 --> 01:17:16.729
so there's so much crazy [ __ ] where like

01:17:16.729 --> 01:17:19.280
someone would be like in a pool

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.679
underwater like stuck in a pool with

01:17:21.679 --> 01:17:24.050
like guards walking around and then the

01:17:24.050 --> 01:17:25.999
next scene they'd be on the side of a

01:17:25.999 --> 01:17:28.879
building like dry as a bone that was

01:17:28.879 --> 01:17:33.309
that was truly astounding it's like

01:17:33.309 --> 01:17:35.689
British parkour kid they sent him in

01:17:35.689 --> 01:17:37.209
first to the top of the skyscraper

01:17:37.209 --> 01:17:39.829
classic glass infinity pool at the top

01:17:39.829 --> 01:17:42.260
of the skyscraper the sniper shot a hole

01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:43.729
in the side of glass room to breathe out

01:17:43.729 --> 01:17:46.039
of stuck underwater and then the next

01:17:46.039 --> 01:17:48.289
scene is him climbing the side of a

01:17:48.289 --> 01:17:50.809
building totally dry I never showed him

01:17:50.809 --> 01:17:52.820
get out of the pool nothing and there

01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:55.039
was no need for out of control any of

01:17:55.039 --> 01:17:57.050
them to fake their own death there was

01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:59.539
no need absolutely no absolutely no need

01:17:59.539 --> 01:18:02.349
for it cuz they just got fake paperwork

01:18:02.349 --> 01:18:05.239
yeah which is it well I saw I sometimes

01:18:05.239 --> 01:18:07.340
wonder if we're like drowning in a

01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:10.099
Content maze just like I saw this other

01:18:10.099 --> 01:18:11.749
