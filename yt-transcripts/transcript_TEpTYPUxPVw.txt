like the high score one kid got like 29

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.239
000 which was absurd there's no running

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.319
rule that a lot of people disobeyed

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.120
people were [ __ ] sprinting

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.879
was it was it full there or was it yeah

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.720
it was packed okay god that's so funny

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.239
it was us and a bunch of black kids

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.879
which was really funny to see my dad

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.640
i'm like dude my dad's gonna get someone

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.120
in like a hands up don't shoot situation

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.040
he's like [ __ ] you

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.319
was your dad standing in his ground the

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.160
whole time just stayed in the bag and

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.840
stood his ground he really did stand

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.760
here he defended the board

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.360
he stayed back and defended the forms

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.160
like not my neighborhood that's so funny

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.360
but uh

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.599
so right when we go in to do the rules

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.920
now we're under black lights and

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.840
everyone we're in like a semi circle

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.360
around the guy this you know he's a

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.440
teenager going over the rules and my

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.599
sister i just hear my sister say she was

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.760
like jesus christ dad

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.080

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.879
blacklight my dad's jeans

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.760

i mean it can't it you can't totally

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.200

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.360

his levi he definitely doesn't wash

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.000
those and those jeans are definitely

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.080

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.560
off like a two month or on like an

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.880

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.080
asleep

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.479
right before we went there everybody

two-month knock it off

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.000
then uh then he went to the elks

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.880
afterwards and got [ __ ] shit-faced

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.160
and then

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.919
came home and there was ufc on last

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:44.800
night

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.560
and i broke down my rules for betting on

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.400
ufc because my dad was drunk enough that

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.639
he we'd bet on ufc last night which is

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.240
fun as [ __ ] well it must be so betting

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.919
on ufc is like the most yeah we found

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.000
[ __ ] in the world

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
yeah yeah you yeah bet on mcgregor i did

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.520
it with bees or two one time it's fun as

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.120
[ __ ] when you have money on the fighter

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.120
yeah it's great but um

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.720
i broke down the rules to him i was like

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.240
look if it's a black guy versus a white

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.400
guy you go with the black eye if it's a

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.080
white guy versus asian you go with the

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.120
white guy

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.919
here's the tricky one asian versus black

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:14.800
asian

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.560
really yeah they do they trick them

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.000
really that's why

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.240
so then how to hold up three for three

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.759
and then with women's fight it's just

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:23.680
whoever's uglier yeah

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.680
true guaranteed money every time that's

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.759
actually a very that's a good uh yeah

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:28.880
that's a good system went three for

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.120
three last night black dude pounded a

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.880
norwegian

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.360

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.039

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:38.960
like right away this hot chick she was

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.560

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.479
fight was a asian

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:48.960
versus white dude the white dude just

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.240

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.720
and you think asian dudes will beat up

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.400
black jesus yeah they're tricky in ufc i

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.000
can see that they rarely get to fight

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.160
but when they do the asians that's true

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.000
oh i think a lot of the black fighters

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.360
have a lot of respect a lot of like

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.680
wooten respect for getting respect for

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.280
the asian fighters all right so that was

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.440
my weekend how about you

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.360
uh what the [ __ ] did i do i didn't do

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.120
[ __ ] i worked i worked all weekend no

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.199
nice yep i worked at my parents house

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.919
stripped the wallpaper nice and uh

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:18.160
talking to my man spade all weekend

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.840
it was a matt and spudman operation oh

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.440
[ __ ] i i didn't even get to talk about

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.080
this i fought people online all week

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.199
about the

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:26.880
chappelle thing

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.080
got to argue all week about that yeah

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.160
and i did not do myself justice every

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.360
like i would

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.560
because i would get hit with like a

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.120
three paragraph response to it

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.080
and then

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.440
each one was like yeah well i guess i

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.800
don't get offended so i wasn't really

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.560
thinking about that and every like or

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.880
like people just burn you yeah i don't

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.639
get offended see i watched the first

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:48.400
half of it and i was like oh it's

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.240
hilarious because at the very beginning

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.599
if you're watching it he's just saying

00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:53.039
like these women who are crying about

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:55.280
weinstein then like you're weak we're

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.280
tough but i heard at the end that's when

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.639
he starts letting off he starts getting

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:00.000
in 2011

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
but it's also i mean it's it's what he

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.479
does and i i said it correctly the first

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:06.479
podcast i was like

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:07.759
i listened to it again because i was

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:08.879
getting a lot of [ __ ] for it and i

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:10.080
didn't say anything wrong i was just

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.800
like

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.440
it's weird to hear a guy

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.280
because it's not hard to say white guys

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.639
suck or white people suck on on stage

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:20.240
it's weird to me though when you say

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.919
white people suck and black people are

00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:23.199
the best

00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:24.720
that's when it gets weird

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.400
if you shoot on both of them it's funny

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.400
yeah but anyway that was that was my

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.919
week who's the one guy you always says

00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:31.280
uh

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.880
that gives you a hard time

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.919
oh on dairy queen

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.080
he just chimed in and was like

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.760
jesus

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.279
what they should do with all that stuff

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:42.880
like i was reading i was like listening

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.159
to stuff about like reparations and

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.920
stuff we have to figure out who had them

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.720
dude

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.160
who that's like who had the slaves yeah

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.760
we just figured out just go down it

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.360
should be like an ancestry.com thing and

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.839
it's like norwegian english yeah you

00:08:53.839 --> 00:08:56.240
also had them like [ __ ] dude you got if

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.080
you have a big like uh you have a big

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.680
inheritance and they found out you had

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.519
them you gotta cough it up cough it up

00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:02.800
that way it's it's all out in the open

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.680
it's like

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.640
i didn't have them then you gotta

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.160
ancestry the black people and find out

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.399
who were slaves

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:10.320
that's true but there's also black

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.480
people who had them too yeah apparently

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.160
i found out that

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.839
jay-z had slaves yeah he still does

00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:18.080
donald trump has slaves too dude uh he

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.240
has slaves trump definitely has sleep he

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.839
had him he has to give it up but yeah

00:09:21.839 --> 00:09:22.959
they should do that well that was the

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:24.720
thing on chappelle show they did the

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.880
reparations oh yeah they did which was

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.120
hilarious what would happen and that was

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.200
yeah exactly chappelle used to

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.640
one thing that made chappelle show so

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.000
funny was he would make fun of black

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.440
people

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.200
and

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.120
white people were like yeah exactly

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.200
that's funny uh but when they did the

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.360
reparations thing just the black people

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.959
got all this money and just wilded the

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.200
[ __ ] out yeah it's so funny yeah like

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.399
the stocks of like platinum quadrupled

00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:51.680
and like all this [ __ ] well dude it's

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.040
funny because i think a lot of times if

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.720
you get a black dude from the suburbs

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.959
they double down hard on black power

00:09:56.959 --> 00:09:58.720
yeah because they're like

00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.920
they feel all kind of weird because they

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.800
go to the hood and everyone's like

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.000
you're from the suburbs then like

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:02.959
there's

00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:04.480
black dudes in the hood like old black

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.000
dudes that love donald trump which is

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.360
hilarious they're like mom donald

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.360
trump's good so it's like

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.880
it's weird they're like how they're

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.640
engaging all this like popular black

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.279
response by like super educated

00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:16.560
dudes

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.880
yeah where it's like you know it's like

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.800
if you take the average harvard graduate

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.399
and it's like well i'm gonna i'm gonna

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:24.320
represent white people and it's like

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.680
dude you don't represent [ __ ] white

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.040
people you want to harvard there's like

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.320
you're like 0.1 i watched uh obama on

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.079
letterman did you guys see that was he

00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:34.079
on recently no letterman has like a

00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:35.600
netflix thing where he's interviewing

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.920
people and the first one was with obama

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.000
and i was watching i was like damn dude

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.240
obama was the [ __ ] he's so much

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.240
better than donald trump yeah it's crazy

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.760
how much better you i know you hate that

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.760
no no no he's uh he's he's a very good

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.519
he's eloquent he's so much better at

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:51.440
that [ __ ] i mean socially he's so much

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.279
more aware of how to act

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:54.720
yeah like if donald trump was on that

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.320
that would have been a nightmare would

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.680
you do you see the whole fallout from

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.440
the [ __ ] countries thing

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.360
yeah i saw that yeah he's like they said

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.640
the [ __ ] countries like why do we

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.839
pee why do you need people from these

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:05.200
shitholes dude

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.800
and he's like the best is his apology

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.560
was so funny where he's like my language

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.120
was tough for sure but i didn't say [ __ ]

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.399
it's an accusation

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:15.519
in a meeting

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:17.040
and that's what they claim it's like

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.440
he's racist for that which i guess you

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.120
could paint it that way if you want

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.240
norwegians instead of haitians but yeah

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.000
his point was

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.959
haiti's a [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah and i

00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:31.200
think everybody here can agree that

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.839
haiti is definitely a [ __ ] yeah i

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:36.079
don't think the people necessarily are

00:11:36.079 --> 00:11:38.160
sure [ __ ]

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.399
it's i think it's the poorest

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:42.480
country in the western hemisphere haiti

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.959
i think probably i think haiti is the

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:46.399
worst they would have had a lot of money

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:47.839
but the clintons and the clinton

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:50.560
foundation i know sucked it right out

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.839
sucked it right out of their black

00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:53.600
french dicks

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.200

canada is like facing the reality of

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.079
being like

00:12:02.079 --> 00:12:03.680
[ __ ] we can't have everyone in here yeah

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.040

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.360
heck well i don't know it's such a weird

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.320
dynamic because they're like the

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.519
hardcore

00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:55.680
french canadians are they like

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.360
i feel like they kind of just fire off

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.040
they're not really worried about how

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.240
they look yeah i think there's two

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.120
different

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.000
distinctions there's like the french

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.399
you would say um educate them there's

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:09.279
the uh or so to speak you have the

00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:10.880
the everyday

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.200
you know hard-working canadian like yeah

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.279
like like the midwestern united states

00:13:15.279 --> 00:13:16.720
yeah it's more republican and then you

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.800
have new york city or l.a i think i

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.720
think china is a lot like that so the

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.240
french are like the cosmopolitans

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.240
definitely like the more french areas

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.760
yeah they're not really french liberals

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.680
in [ __ ] montreal i think that's what

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.279
it's like okay i didn't know if they

00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:31.040
were like way more hardcore just kind of

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.800
like [ __ ] muslims

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.720
the french no canadians i don't like

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.040
blue collar and then more like you know

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.720
new york city or else you go out to like

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.639
saskatchewan and then they're like we

00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:44.000
got to get rid of these muslims eh

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.440
i know yeah i don't know what the

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.800
dynamic is i know there is just a bunch

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.240
of weird french people i definitely have

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.600
no idea what the dynamic is i think

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.279
they're all double agents

00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:52.320
i always imagine them as like real

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.160
sneaky double agents all right all right

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.920
so let's get to

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.760
yeah the reason why we brought dano down

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.480
here

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.279
so

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:00.560
first off i don't think i ever asked you

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.360
what

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.760
why didn't you become a priest so

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.760
it's it's a great question and it's uh

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.519
probably the question maybe

00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:08.320
that

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.560
i get asked the most or that is the most

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.880
interesting maybe yeah um because you

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.680
know i think i grew up a lot like shane

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.519
uh you know we all grew up in the same

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:20.240
area all our friends and you know my

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.120
family by the way i consider myself a uh

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.680
i'd use the term staunch roman catholic

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.839
yeah and so for some people that already

00:14:27.839 --> 00:14:28.959
is already

00:14:28.959 --> 00:14:30.880
maybe uh politically incorrect you would

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.560
say with with certain viewpoints to be

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.399
religious

00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:36.880
to be religious right yeah so i'm a i'm

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.480
a roman catholic practicing roman

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.920
catholic

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.120
and uh so as a kid growing up

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.839
you know i always uh

00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:48.079
i like the church i love the church and

00:14:48.079 --> 00:14:50.000
um always

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.600
appreciated

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.360
uh church history and the mass and

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.040
everything else and you look at the

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.720
priest you know i think every guy kind

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.040
of has this to a point uh maybe even you

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.880
both i don't know um because i know

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.639
you're both catholic but you look at the

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:05.680
the perfect idea of a priest is

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.480
you know a man a self-sacrificing man

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.079
gives his life for the church and

00:15:10.079 --> 00:15:12.800
there's definitely a yeah

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.600
um

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.910
like father chat right

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.800
[Laughter]

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.680
uh

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.079
yes you don't have to batman

00:15:20.079 --> 00:15:21.120
i'll do that

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.519
but it's kind of like a soldier or

00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:25.279
you know even like a

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:27.279
an athlete you know there's that there's

00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:28.320
that courageous you know

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.440
self-sacrificing aspect to it yeah um so

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.580
i grew up in i was like beckham

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:37.839
[Laughter]

00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:39.519
some reason first person game i was

00:15:39.519 --> 00:15:41.440
andre agustin yeah like a great

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.600
self-sacrificing athlete like andre it's

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.760
funny how a lot of professions there's

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.600
like i used to work in the labor union

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.120
they're like we're the real athletes and

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.040
i was like no or not no yeah at all dude

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.800
like you're you just took three shots of

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.800
sorak before work dude

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.320
that's like the old thing like anybody

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.880
who claims to be something else

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.399
like like i remember the kids on the

00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:02.560
cross-country team would wear shirts

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.639
that were like no timeouts no [ __ ]

00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:05.600
thing

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.279
it's like this is a real sport it's like

00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:09.279
now football's harder yeah yeah you're

00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:10.800
you're basically prey you're running

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.720
yeah you're just like rugby [ __ ] no

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.880
rugby's a real bruce no timeouts this is

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.120
a real man's it literally is no black

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.800
guys are playing it so it's not we have

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.399
black ass playing it we had a black d1

00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:23.440
athlete play yeah dude rugby's a way

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.959
more brutal sport you get those suburban

00:16:24.959 --> 00:16:26.240
black dudes playing for sure now this

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.040
guy was from uh wilmington but go on

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.079
no sure

00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:33.519
so you get you have an idea

00:16:34.079 --> 00:16:35.920
you have an idea of what uh the

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.680
priesthood should be and growing up i

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.720
always knew good priests my aunt is a

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.040
religious sister here in philadelphia in

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.639
fact

00:16:44.639 --> 00:16:46.399
and uh so

00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:47.839
you know we always had priests come over

00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:50.000
we we knew priests and so i always

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.120
thought from a young age maybe that's

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.959
something i want to do and i always kind

00:16:52.959 --> 00:16:55.040
of kept it to myself because um because

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.639
it's yeah you don't you don't want to

00:16:56.639 --> 00:16:59.199
tell them there's an embarrassment to so

00:16:59.199 --> 00:17:01.759
like i remember in high school i was

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:03.440
almost pretty sure

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.199
and i didn't tell anybody like i would

00:17:05.199 --> 00:17:08.319
leave football practice uh on mondays my

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.799
senior year and go get and i'll get into

00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:12.640
this but you have to go get

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.880
psychologically tested yeah they they

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.280
check they screen you up when i started

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.120
so it was after the the sex scandal

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.600
really broke okay sure so how did they

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.520
screen you i go out i go meet a

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.439
psychologist little boys yeah

00:17:25.439 --> 00:17:26.799
they show you like a picture of a hot

00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:28.240
boy you just held your crotch you're

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.080
like no boner you're in dude

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.360
i mean

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.600
i i wish it was that simple

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.760
and then maybe we'd be better off sure

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.360
if it was that way so

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.360
how do they screen you though

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.520
to be honest with you i was i was 18 i

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.520
can't i can't really remember exactly i

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.960
know i know i went like six or seven

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.760
times and i i was like to coach boger i

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.760
was like our our high school football

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.520
coach you know if you don't mind i gotta

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.280
i gotta get out early every monday for

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.520
the next couple weeks damn and uh i

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.200
don't even think i told him what the

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.679
deal was but uh but anyway i'd go and

00:17:59.679 --> 00:18:01.360
gotta talk to you about your family what

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.039
do you think about this things they they

00:18:03.039 --> 00:18:04.640
he just talks to you talk to you like a

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.960
regular guy and he was so normal and so

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.559
good yeah uh

00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:10.720
regular guy and so there was no issue

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.120
there thank goodness but uh but there is

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.679
a uh uh and i'll get into that too like

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.840
i said but there is a level of screening

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.760
that is now done psychologically which

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.840
is kind of the way it should be so and

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.960
and uh so so um um i kept it a secret

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.559
even up until the very end and then

00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:28.240
because i was so nervous i didn't know

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.600
what i was really getting into but my

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.480
priest always said you know uh

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.440
if you give god years of your life

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.840
even when you're in college you know you

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.160
i i was i would hear our friends talk

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.320
about going to play ball or i'm gonna

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.840
have fun at this college or get this

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.600
career it's like what am i doing you

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.840
know and yeah he would always say if you

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.360
give god years of your life he won't

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.440
waste them and i said sure and you do

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.559
get a degree it's an accredited

00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:54.840
university or college i should say is it

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.559
free it is not oh wow it's not really so

00:18:58.559 --> 00:19:01.520
my i'm the youngest of seven children uh

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.440
um so you had to pick you had to pay for

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.840
it so my dad helped out and uh

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.679
yeah so so there was that who said that

00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:09.360
because i i you know how people talk

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.280
[ __ ] yeah i i just get a degree i

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.960
remember when people church is dying

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.240
yeah he's probably just going to get a

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.160
free degree that's i was when you when i

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.679
thought about 20 000 a year i was

00:19:17.679 --> 00:19:19.200
thinking at that time i was thinking

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.880
more like that's a [ __ ] great idea if

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.400
that's free i would right i'd advise

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.919
everyone to start being a priest i mean

00:19:23.919 --> 00:19:26.400
west point west point's free and that

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.799
still sucks dick yeah i think i think

00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:31.520
seminary would suck i mean i'll tell you

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.640
dick

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.320
yeah it might dude i don't know what was

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.360
the military academies actually

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.760
draw their orarium from

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.480
the seminary so for instance you wake up

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.799
you have uh it it's very regimented it's

00:19:44.799 --> 00:19:47.039
very regimented right it's a system

00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:48.720
it's true

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.000
so

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.530
i think speaking

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:56.080
[Laughter]

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.160
so there definitely is that aspect and

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.880
it was nice for someone like me i mean i

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.000
didn't give any effort at all in school

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.440
i mean i just goofed around with our

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.880
buddies i don't think i was a bad kid in

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.039
any way but no you know how early into

00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:11.200
it are they like no jerking off

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.799
is that like day one orientation

00:20:12.799 --> 00:20:14.400
literally i was just asking that i went

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.919
over to his house for dinner really

00:20:15.919 --> 00:20:18.080
earlier yeah how did they patrol that so

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.039
so um it nofa everyone's on nofap

00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:22.640
right and it's like the real world so

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.480
the church's teaching is

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.559
everyone's on nofap the entire world

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:29.039
should be right if that makes sense so

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:30.559
so yeah you might slip off it's like the

00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:32.640
real world like five guys who don't come

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.720
live together what happened

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.240
150 men live in one place

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.480
yeah and that's and my dad was on nofap

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.039
that's what happened

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.840
right before laser tag dude

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.600
i can't believe you put big pun on it

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.480
he didn't he definitely he would never

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.520
do that

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.159
his uh his handle is the gov

00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:02.559
the governor

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:04.880
and then that and nick eddie those are

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.120
his two betting gambling handles nick

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.240
eddie you played basketball at notre

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.000
dame in like the 70s

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:10.880
so

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.679
is that his golden tea that's absolutely

00:21:13.679 --> 00:21:15.840
all that yeah so take it take us i am

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.280
curious about this though so you you

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.400
just rolled up so i i went in

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.559
i joined you know you go in at uh in

00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:23.919
august just like

00:21:23.919 --> 00:21:26.320
it's a regular academic year okay and so

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.000
you go there and you know the first

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.360
thing i even knew that's going in and

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.039
this gave me the most hesitation and

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:32.799
it's not to make myself seem like i'm

00:21:32.799 --> 00:21:34.480
special in any way but

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.640
there were a lot of guys not like me not

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.640
like us you would say like shane and i

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.039
growing up and like you matt you know um

00:21:41.039 --> 00:21:42.559
i try to keep cutting you off but we've

00:21:42.559 --> 00:21:45.039
had that conversation a lot where

00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:47.440
i i had the same thing at west point

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.640
like right when i got there i was like

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.400
oh [ __ ] i'm not like any of these

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.400
[ __ ] guys what were they like well

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.640
they kind of tricked you a little bit

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.559
because they take you like when you for

00:21:56.559 --> 00:21:58.480
me when i was getting recruited there

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.400
you would go out like on a visit you go

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.679
get [ __ ] up

00:22:01.679 --> 00:22:03.760
and like get drunk and party and it's

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.480
like sick yeah this is awesome

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.159
and uh and then you

00:22:08.159 --> 00:22:10.559
get there and they are all i mean they

00:22:10.559 --> 00:22:11.919
were doing exactly what they should have

00:22:11.919 --> 00:22:13.360
been doing they were [ __ ] gung-ho

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.640
about it they were all like much [ __ ]

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.000
good and they're smart yeah and they

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.840
were all smart they were dorks too right

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.760
a lot of them were doing smart they were

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.039
smart

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:22.640
and they were all in on

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.000
being at west point and being in the

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.520
military and i was

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.880
like i think i've said this before but

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.200
like at boot camp the first day

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.200
i was like [ __ ] around and i was

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.559
talking to the guy next to me while we

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:34.080
were standing against this wall and a

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.919
drill sergeant heard it it was like who

00:22:35.919 --> 00:22:37.520
the [ __ ] is talking

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.240
and the guy next to me was like he is he

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.600
[ __ ] ratted me out right away and i

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.360
was like dude you are a [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.960
that's a bad sign yeah it was the whole

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.720
time was rough so what was it like at

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.840
the uh

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.159
at the seminary yeah so

00:22:50.159 --> 00:22:52.000
it's tough tougher to explain in this

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.640
sense but you go in and

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.200
so there's 150 guys just about

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.919
i i would say um

00:22:59.919 --> 00:23:02.080
there's a handful of guys

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.039
that

00:23:03.039 --> 00:23:04.880
remind me of anyone i've ever known

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.880
growing up yeah so you got a lot of a

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.640
lot of guys are very bright too everyone

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.600
there is very smart most of the time um

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.000
i would say there's a lot of

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.520
guys maybe who are

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.159
were like softer quieter and kind of

00:23:18.159 --> 00:23:22.480
nerdy i would say um

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.240
you have that going in so you have a lot

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.440
of guys are not like you and that

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.919
already is like uh making making me

00:23:27.919 --> 00:23:29.760
nervous you're saying a lot of like soft

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.679
wormy looking dudes yeah yeah a lot of a

00:23:31.679 --> 00:23:33.520
lot of guys that uh touchers probably

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.840
didn't have friends at

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.440
all probably never drink a beer correct

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.280
yeah virgins that's the best way to

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.960
explain it yeah no

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.480
so for instance i remember guys would

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.960
come up to me and sales

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.039
we we'd be in class and then afterward

00:23:47.039 --> 00:23:47.840
you

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.600
you leave and some guy would come up and

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.960
be like something you know i just want

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.120
to let you know that uh

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.640
what you said in class really offended

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.559
me and it was like i have no idea

00:23:56.559 --> 00:23:58.159
preschool they're busting this out yeah

00:23:58.159 --> 00:24:00.559
like guys are real sensitive in a lot of

00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:02.840
ways yeah yeah

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:06.240
um yeah it's just like some guys i

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.480
remember being uh

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.840
like masculinity oftentimes

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.159
is an issue i think it's an issue

00:24:14.159 --> 00:24:15.919
in the church today as well as it is our

00:24:15.919 --> 00:24:18.880
country i could argue so it's funny so

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.640
you can get into it but but but you were

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.110
making the seminary great again

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:24.080
[Laughter]

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.159
i wouldn't say that all i would say

00:24:26.159 --> 00:24:27.120
uh

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.720
i would say

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.520
there's a lot of guys in there

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.760
to be very masculine

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.919
often times

00:24:35.919 --> 00:24:38.000
made you different from some guys that

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.279
they wouldn't even want to look at you

00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:41.760
or approach you yeah okay but so you're

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.600
going to an open mic i mean there you go

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.440
it's a lot of like yeah in all

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.200
seriousness how many of these dudes you

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.520
think were gay who were in the seminary

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.240
i i don't know for sure but i would say

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.400
i would say

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.279
you might have been giving them the

00:24:55.279 --> 00:24:56.799
butterflies dude

00:24:56.799 --> 00:24:59.120
no that's the thing they hate you what

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.400
yeah what do you mean so

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.559
i would say guys and especially guys

00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:06.240
i've met outside the seminary too i

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.440
would say

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.840
people who are tend to be

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.120
um have homosexual orientation yeah

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.600
don't like they don't like you they i

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.919
mean i i guess there is a attraction

00:25:17.919 --> 00:25:20.320
with some but i would say you're the way

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.120
you are is not

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.279
i don't know if it's uh challenging them

00:25:25.279 --> 00:25:27.360
in any way but i think it is

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.960
a distaste for them they shy away from

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.240
do you think it's like in cells when

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.919
they see hot women or just kind of like

00:25:31.919 --> 00:25:32.559
that

00:25:32.559 --> 00:25:33.919
i don't think anybody knows what insults

00:25:33.919 --> 00:25:34.880
yeah you didn't watch the thing

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.880
volunteering voluntary celibates yeah

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.159
yeah yeah if you guys didn't do your

00:25:38.159 --> 00:25:40.480
homework

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.480
yeah

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.960
so you had basically

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.240
so these guys are hating on you because

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.080
you were just ramping up the mess well

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.600
and it's a very small percentage i would

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.039
say but at the same time like not

00:25:51.039 --> 00:25:52.320
everyone's going to like you you're

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.760
around together all the time you don't

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:54.720
leave

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.600
um

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.039
you

00:25:57.039 --> 00:25:58.320
you know people may not like my

00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.919
personality to begin with i mean not

00:25:59.919 --> 00:26:01.039
everyone's what are you talking about

00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:03.279
that would like get these dudes so i i i

00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:05.600
i can't remember that exact uh instance

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.760
but it was definitely like so you go to

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.159
college so i i gotta i have a college

00:26:10.159 --> 00:26:11.120
degree

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.039
okay and so you

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:15.840
the major's philosophy um so you take so

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.520
many so many credits you take science

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.240
math you know all those things so it's a

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.600
it's a um

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.840
a bachelor's philosophy is what i have

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.440
bachelor's of arts and philosophy yeah

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.120
is the degree i actually have okay um

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.440
but then as time goes on uh major

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.799
seminary so that's four years that's

00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:33.760
college

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.400
and then major seminary is theology

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.960
where it's more focused on uh

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:39.840
church

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.880
everything with the church and how

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.679
things go okay uh

00:26:43.679 --> 00:26:46.320
the last couple years are more practical

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.000
you would say where you get you prepare

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.919
to be a priest physically now the whole

00:26:49.919 --> 00:26:51.120
time mind you

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.679
it's all about how to

00:26:53.679 --> 00:26:55.039
you learn about everything about the

00:26:55.039 --> 00:26:56.960
church i mean you learn what a priest is

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.720
like how to live like you know what what

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.480
it's going to be like and that's where

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.880
you know from day one you come in oh so

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.120
so so you got checked out by the

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.200
psychologist you get background clear

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.240
the first thing you do is you get

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.000
background checked right what's a no-no

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.559
for a priest like what kind of stuff

00:27:12.559 --> 00:27:14.799
uh if you get like underage drinking i

00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:17.440
mean i mean i i i think you probably had

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.000
underage yeah

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:22.640
big problem with me was

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.919
i remember i got one my freshman year

00:27:23.919 --> 00:27:25.039
high school and then

00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:27.520
during football my senior year i got so

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.360
it was during the process so i was like

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.720
i went to my priest i was like father

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.880
look you know they said well look it's

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.720
all taken into consideration yeah it's

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.559
not a it's a citation i mean you don't

00:27:36.559 --> 00:27:38.080
yeah you don't get arrested or anything

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.039
but i i i just

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.640
i had to disclose that certainly um but

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.080
but you get background check

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.000
psychologist checks you out and so you

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.440
go in

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.080
and then and then you have to take these

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.000
because it was after the the sex scandal

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.080
broke you would say in the church

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:56.960
um

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.480
so the church is trying to correct that

00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.360
in

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.120
i would say maybe not the best ways in

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.880
my opinion but i would say they are

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.960
making efforts so we'd have to go to

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.960
these courses like

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.840
child abuse and and it was ins it was

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.600
yeah they're the worst like these dudes

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.039
just like don't know they're blessing

00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:15.279
kids i watch a video and it's like

00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:17.200
generic too it's meant for like anybody

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.600
like you're gonna coach sports you're

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.880
everyone in the diocese has to take

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.720
those so if you interact with children

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.039
in any way yeah like i coached peewee

00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:26.880
football for my hometown a catholic

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.320
school and yeah you had to do the same

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.080
kind of thing well this one was more in

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.279
depth so we'd have to go to these

00:28:31.279 --> 00:28:33.520
saturday three-hour video it was

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.000
terrible you'd get a guy on there who's

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.320
i mean it's not funny but he's like

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.360
looks

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.559
like an alcoholic unshaven like

00:28:42.559 --> 00:28:45.279
who was a truck driver who was like a

00:28:45.279 --> 00:28:48.480
small santa yeah at like a skating rink

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.000
like it's like all the stereotypical

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.480
yeah and he's like unshaven and it's

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.399
this guy talking about how he

00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:56.080
abused 500 kids over the course of his

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.039
life

00:28:57.039 --> 00:28:58.799
truck driver yeah it's like is this what

00:28:58.799 --> 00:29:01.679
i am like he looked like a like a drunk

00:29:01.679 --> 00:29:04.559
steve bannon he like the santa outfit it

00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:06.480
was lafayette yeah it was like it was a

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.919
bad santa dude yeah so you're sitting

00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:08.799
there

00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:10.960
and it makes you feel guilty almost for

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.919
what

00:29:11.919 --> 00:29:13.360
we'll have to sit through these child

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.600
abuse course it's like is this what i am

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.960
you know i'm just like a regular guy

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.640
trying to figure it out and i'm

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.799
confronted with this so and it's not to

00:29:20.799 --> 00:29:22.080
blame anybody but

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.760
i i see what you're saying

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.360
it'd be like a police officer having to

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.640
watch like

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.240
brutality yeah police brutality every

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.440
day and it's like wait i'm not doing

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.039
that sure sure and then and then you go

00:29:31.039 --> 00:29:33.200
out and some people you know know you're

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.559
in philadelphia they have a tough time

00:29:34.559 --> 00:29:36.559
they've had a tough time with uh with

00:29:36.559 --> 00:29:39.039
the church and sexual abuse and so you

00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:41.840
know what do you mean by a tough time

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.720
the archdiocese had a um

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.480
many priests accused

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.919
and uh how many do you think we're

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:48.960
guilty

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.559
i i don't know any of the numbers oh

00:29:50.559 --> 00:29:52.960
okay but i know it's morale is very low

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.720
i'm sorry

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.880
i mean philadelphia tough boston you

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.320
remind me of when i try to become a

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.600
realtor in the real estate market

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.880
bottomed out literally that's what

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.640
happened being a realtor was sick and i

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.000
was like oh [ __ ] the market bought them

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.919
out but if i joined a job and then like

00:30:05.919 --> 00:30:06.960
it's like oh yeah a lot of these guys

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.440
are molesters i'd be like oh [ __ ] yeah i

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.480
would be worried about that i'm not

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.600
getting any better i think i'm a [ __ ]

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:12.960
molester so

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.840
so the whole thing though is

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.840
you know the church saying okay we got

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.520
to comply legally we want to we want to

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.960
fix this we're doing we're showing

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.799
everything we can yeah and so the state

00:30:22.799 --> 00:30:25.039
says okay we'll do these things like a

00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:26.480
program's gonna yeah

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:29.120
the bottom line is

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.919
if you're a celibate man

00:30:31.919 --> 00:30:34.080
and this is my opinion i think i think

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.720
this is accurate okay okay

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:37.919
um

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:39.279
if you

00:30:39.279 --> 00:30:40.480
are not

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.279
having sexual relations with a woman or

00:30:43.279 --> 00:30:46.080
deprived of that in any way

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.159
automatically you don't get attracted to

00:30:48.159 --> 00:30:49.120
kids

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.200
i mean

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.320
you know

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.919
if you're a married man

00:30:53.919 --> 00:30:55.120
you're meant to be faithful to your

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.960
spouse okay

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.520
and there's times in a marriage where

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.559
you don't have sex maybe for for years

00:31:02.559 --> 00:31:04.559
perhaps you know let's say your wife's

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:06.080
pregnant older all these different

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.760
things right i did it yeah so what do

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:08.559
you do

00:31:08.559 --> 00:31:10.159
oh that kid's looking good that's not

00:31:10.159 --> 00:31:11.520
how it is

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.640
i think you're

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.559
the the bottom line is there's a

00:31:14.559 --> 00:31:16.880
core issue with that person

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.600
and they are not right i mean to be

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.919
sexually attracted to a child is not

00:31:21.919 --> 00:31:23.840
normal yeah so you're you're saying it's

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.799
not a result of the celibacy value not

00:31:26.799 --> 00:31:29.279
at all not at all i think it's the guys

00:31:29.279 --> 00:31:31.200
that are in francis trying to get

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.760
priests to get married so so the

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.440
celibacy in the church is what's known

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.480
as a discipline okay and and there's so

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.640
the catholic church is made up of many

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.880
rights or traditions roman catholic

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.519
being the biggest and

00:31:45.519 --> 00:31:46.720
just one of them though there's

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.360
ambrosian coptic like you're uh you know

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.880
he's orthodox how many times do you

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.240
caught having sex as a priest before

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.919
they're like dude get out well that's

00:31:53.919 --> 00:31:56.880
the thing i mean uh it

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.279
i will say this i'm sorry

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:01.679
but i've seen a lot of priests and it

00:32:01.679 --> 00:32:03.360
doesn't seem like it's that hard of a

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.679
discipline for them to be celibate

00:32:05.679 --> 00:32:07.440
and that's the other thing yeah one of

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.159
those ugly boys

00:32:15.519 --> 00:32:17.039
i will say

00:32:17.039 --> 00:32:18.480
there are

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.760
i mean i've heard many stories from

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.519
priests about women

00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:23.519
uh stalking them

00:32:23.519 --> 00:32:25.760
or coming after them yeah and they look

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.039
it's because they're on the mic dude

00:32:27.039 --> 00:32:29.200
right and and they're they're

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.360
untouchable you would say yeah so so

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.840
let's say a a woman who's having marital

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.399
issues whose husband's a bad guy

00:32:36.399 --> 00:32:37.760
comes in you're literally getting me

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.760
home

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.279
go ahead please comes in and then and

00:32:41.279 --> 00:32:44.000
then you counsel her and you show her

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.279
compassion

00:32:45.279 --> 00:32:48.799
or compassion and like and sincerity yep

00:32:48.799 --> 00:32:49.840
and then she doesn't get that at home

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.840
well there's an emotional attraction

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:52.640
yeah

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.159
so you have to distinguish those things

00:32:54.159 --> 00:32:56.080
so sometimes when there's an attraction

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:59.120
it's not um it's not love it's an

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.399
attraction yeah so so priests can have

00:33:02.399 --> 00:33:03.919
to deal with that certainly and that's

00:33:03.919 --> 00:33:05.679
why you have to have a strong prayer

00:33:05.679 --> 00:33:08.240
life and uh jesus yeah you need to have

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.200
uh

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.720
you know definitely boundaries

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.159
especially more than ever like the whole

00:33:12.159 --> 00:33:13.600
the other thing was

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.519
the other part of our

00:33:15.519 --> 00:33:17.519
those courses you had to go through

00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:18.960
half of it was

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.799
don't get accused of this and here's how

00:33:20.799 --> 00:33:21.760
not to

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.880
don't go

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.279
don't have a kid in a closed door by

00:33:25.279 --> 00:33:27.600
yourself yeah no seriously

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.080
don't have uh have a window in your door

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.440
if you have to close the door things

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.399
like that

00:33:32.399 --> 00:33:35.039
don't ever be alone with a youth and an

00:33:35.039 --> 00:33:37.120
adult because all it takes is someone to

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.720
accuse you yeah you know you don't have

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:39.600
to be

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.360
i mean the two things i've heard

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.919
recently of a priest i don't obviously i

00:33:43.919 --> 00:33:45.679
won't say them and it's a

00:33:45.679 --> 00:33:46.799
um

00:33:46.799 --> 00:33:49.200
not a public thing and shouldn't be but

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.600
there was a priest a well-known priest

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.919
whom everyone loved um

00:33:53.919 --> 00:33:56.000
he was an older man he was in his 60s

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.880
70s and uh you know was in the sac

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.720
street before mass and told

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.720
like a 17 year old kid he had a nice

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.919
haircut

00:34:03.919 --> 00:34:05.360
you know and the pair and the kid told

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.399
his parents

00:34:06.399 --> 00:34:08.320
and the parents accused his priests of

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.520
of

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:10.800
trying to start

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.639
being inappropriate and it went all the

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:14.480
way i think legal action was taken it

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.879
was thrown out but regardless it's like

00:34:16.879 --> 00:34:17.679
i mean

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:19.119
i mean what do you do at this point and

00:34:19.119 --> 00:34:20.960
then there was another story about a guy

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.000
who was uh who's a seminarian and was

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
a teenage girl

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.359
at a fax machine said that he she felt

00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:31.760
he was being inappropriate with her

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.960
and it's like ever there there were

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.639
there were like 10 people around i don't

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:36.320
know you're just talking and this guy is

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.119
the

00:34:37.119 --> 00:34:38.399
harmless

00:34:38.399 --> 00:34:40.560
kid he's a kid and there's a girl that's

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.839
probably just talking to her you know

00:34:41.839 --> 00:34:43.679
trying to he's out of paris she doesn't

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:45.040
know anybody oh yeah she told her she

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.119
had a nice haircut dude yeah right mean

00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:49.599
you put your tits on the copier oh my

00:34:49.599 --> 00:34:51.919
gosh yeah man so so there's that i mean

00:34:51.919 --> 00:34:53.359
the whole thing is you got to have

00:34:53.359 --> 00:34:55.599
witnesses things like that and that is a

00:34:55.599 --> 00:34:57.119
big part of it because that happened i

00:34:57.119 --> 00:34:58.480
was at the state i was working for the

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:01.119
state when the sandusky thing happened

00:35:01.119 --> 00:35:02.960
and all the laws that came out after

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.480
that of like if you're going to teach

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.000
your coach or anything like that it was

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.599
the same thing it's just like you're not

00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:09.680
allowed to be in the room one-on-one

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.599
yeah which is

00:35:11.599 --> 00:35:12.720
it

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.960
sucks but it's kind of necessary no no

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.119
it makes perfect sense and like even now

00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:17.920
like

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.160
you know don't for you guys for for me

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.839
for anybody don't you have to follow

00:35:21.839 --> 00:35:23.200
those same guidelines just for the

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.760
priest it's heightened scrutiny yeah now

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.839
i deserve it

00:35:27.839 --> 00:35:29.680
and that happened to me recently i was

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.480
that

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.520
during christmas i went to my

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.520
girlfriend's family in chicago and her i

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.800
was at her cousin's house and her little

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.560
cousin's like seven he's like you want

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.079
to play wii with me he's like it's in my

00:35:38.079 --> 00:35:40.720
room and i was like uh i'm like yeah you

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.359
should ask your parents bro

00:35:43.359 --> 00:35:44.880
yeah go play with him then he was like

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.160
let's play michael jackson there's like

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.480
michael jackson experience

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.240
let's play uh let's play wii sports bro

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.440
i'm not playing the michael jackson

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.040
experience with you right now

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.720
it's terrible it's funny when i was in

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.280
spain when i was leaving one of my

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.880
students one of the students came up and

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.720
it was a little it was a little girl

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.640
yeah she's probably in like third grade

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.680
she was like i'm going to miss you

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.839
here's my email yeah and i was like oh

00:36:05.839 --> 00:36:07.920
perfect i didn't even think about it and

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.680
then another teacher was like

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.280
what the [ __ ] are you doing with that

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.640
and i was like how [ __ ] dude i don't

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.640
even think about that yeah get this [ __ ]

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.000
away from me

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:16.880
and that's the other thing i know

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.800
priests experience this and and even i

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.720
did to a point but you know

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.480
there's some people who love priests and

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.880
for good reason and uh

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.079
you know their kids come up and give you

00:36:26.079 --> 00:36:28.480
a hug someone's like

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.800
and then their way and so so the bottom

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.440
line is don't initiate a hug if someone

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.119
reciprocates you know or someone does

00:36:35.119 --> 00:36:36.480
that you reciprocate it's yeah there's

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.640
all these like weird guidelines

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.040
the bottom

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:46.960
so the bottom line is a lot of it's

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.480
common sense and a lot of it's not being

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.400
a creep yeah i mean that's what it boils

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.839
and that's the whole issue here is what

00:36:51.839 --> 00:36:53.839
it boils down to so i just want to be on

00:36:53.839 --> 00:36:55.920
the record too and this is for anyone

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.920
who may be in question questioning

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.960
anything about the church but it's like

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.400
the priests who

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.160
abused

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.640
young people there's no excuse for it in

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.400
any way in fact it's

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.480
a million times worse than anyone any

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.880
other profession you would say a teacher

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:13.839
a coach

00:37:13.839 --> 00:37:15.760
yeah which there are many of those too

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.560
mind you but um when a priest does it

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.760
it's that much worse because the level

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.160
of trust and and what he stands for and

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.240
who he is yeah uh if you believe who the

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.680
priest is according to the church i mean

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.920
it's it's the worst thing you can do one

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.000
of the worst things you can do

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.760
and um

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.960
now i'll i could say maybe what uh

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.040
what i think part of the reason is you

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.160
know

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.720
and this is kind of a

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.240
hot button issue with the church and

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.920
it's not politically correct to say even

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:47.520
within the church let alone society but

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:52.079
there are hot kids many no no

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.839
there's many

00:37:53.839 --> 00:37:56.480
the majority of abuse cases

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.400
happened with

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.839
males who were

00:37:59.839 --> 00:38:01.680
adolescent

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.520
so the majority of them were with post

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.599
post pbs and boys

00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:08.079
okay so it borders on the line of

00:38:08.079 --> 00:38:10.400
sexuality pedophilia corrects

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.480
whatever that term is there's a there's

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.839
a technical term they're saying they're

00:38:13.839 --> 00:38:16.160
abusing like 17 year old boys yeah like

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.520
the whole thing is there's grass on the

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.440
field and they're playing ball right and

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.720
even

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.480
and let's say the kids like let's say

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:24.160
they're always like a five-year-old kid

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.680
the fact that you are

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:26.720
touching a

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:29.040
child yeah there is a homosexual some

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.040
homosexual action yeah because he is a

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.359
male does that make sense yeah yeah yeah

00:38:33.359 --> 00:38:34.640
i mean granted you're in the left field

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.720
you're in like another world yeah crazy

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.720
but but yeah you're saying that it

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.880
wasn't it was gayness but most of them

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.280
mostly most of the cases from what i

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.560
understand

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:47.839
which isn't talked about is

00:38:47.839 --> 00:38:49.119
was the gays

00:38:49.119 --> 00:38:50.240
most

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.400
was were boys that were that had gone

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.839
through puberty so if the kid is jacked

00:38:55.839 --> 00:38:57.760
it was a case of jacked kids yeah like

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.440
camping going camp like these weird

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.000
priests would who's a who's a weirdo you

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.520
know taking

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.440
taking uh teenage boys can't be you know

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.640
i mean like things like that like it's

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.400
insane it's still tough that's a tough

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.320
uh qualifier to be like well some of the

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.280
boys were

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.839
16 it's like yeah yeah and also also

00:39:13.839 --> 00:39:15.359
it's you're right it's it's but it is

00:39:15.359 --> 00:39:16.560
different it's a different thing it's

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.079
not true you see

00:39:18.079 --> 00:39:19.200
because

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.040
the church you guys don't have the best

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.240
relationship with the homosexuals no and

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.440
it looks like you're kind of like

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.599
it's not us it's the gays within our

00:39:29.599 --> 00:39:32.640
ranks exactly and the evil gays continue

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.000
sure

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
and here's my thing with that and and i

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.520
i understand how that could be you're

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.640
right you're right i hear what you're

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.240
saying because the kids

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:42.560
it's not pedophilia if the kid's not if

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.240
he's past puberty

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.320
by yeah by what's called something else

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.079
yeah what it is uh it's called being

00:39:48.079 --> 00:39:49.680
[ __ ] gay dude don't bring that [ __ ]

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.680
oh no if you're 16 it's still statutory

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.920
rape of course gay statutory legally

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.119
it's it's but yeah

00:39:57.119 --> 00:39:59.520
uh yeah so it's a tough one

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.440
and like are there are there homosexual

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.520
priests with the orientation def

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.440
definitely i'm pretty sure like

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.760
everybody i'd say like 40 yeah well

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.920
there's an old there's an old joke this

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.760
is kind of off color but it's like well

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.359
if the church got rid of all gay priests

00:40:13.359 --> 00:40:15.280
who would say mass true like there was a

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.920
i remember hearing that but then beating

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.440
the [ __ ] out of whoever said that to you

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.440
dude you're like i'm not gay

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.040
it's like and then you go to the

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:26.480
seminary and there's guys that are

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.640
that give off all the

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.720
homosexual typical homosexual

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.040
characteristics like what right like

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.040
they love show tunes

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:38.240
they go to broadway shows

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.079
they're they're just they're just

00:40:40.079 --> 00:40:41.760
so you were the young pope dude they're

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.640
extremely effeminate and and effeminacy

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:47.119
in the according to our standards is a

00:40:47.119 --> 00:40:48.720
lack of character

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:52.079
so so you could say that

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.960
the way i think about it always is and i

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.560
always thought about i still do there's

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.480
a lot of similarities between being a

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:03.040
father and a priest and and there's not

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.240
that's part of the reason why we call a

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.400
priest's father but you know a father of

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.680
a family

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.440
can't be this

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.359
soft guy

00:41:11.359 --> 00:41:13.440
you know that's maybe maybe has more

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.839
selfish tendency you need to be selfless

00:41:15.839 --> 00:41:17.839
sacrificing and so those characters come

00:41:17.839 --> 00:41:19.359
to i mean you think about who are the

00:41:19.359 --> 00:41:22.000
most self-sacrificing people it's not to

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.520
say that homosexual people with that

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.359
attraction you can't be that but you

00:41:25.359 --> 00:41:26.560
know what i mean there's there's a

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.480
certain like layer life on the line type

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.640
of deal like a father of a family has to

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.880
like harvey milk

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.839
oh my gosh did he laid it on the line

00:41:35.839 --> 00:41:36.960
how are they going to get all the gay

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.720
people out of the church

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.000
out of the church i mean we don't get

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.680
gay people out of church i mean what you

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:45.280
say what i would say is um

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.119
let me go back to when i was entering

00:41:47.119 --> 00:41:49.200
the seminary so there's a church there's

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.960
church documents that say these things

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.520
too uh not all of them don't say

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.500
psalms 14

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.319
[Laughter]

00:41:56.319 --> 00:41:59.119
psalm 69

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.839
there's a document after the sex scandal

00:42:01.839 --> 00:42:03.839
pope john paul and he i think he caught

00:42:03.839 --> 00:42:05.520
a lot of heat for this

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.440
he would say uh

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.920
those with deeply rooted homosexual

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.079
tendencies should not be admitted into

00:42:12.079 --> 00:42:14.720
the seminary okay so the latin term is

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.720
gravitas they use on the document that

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.960
means a deeply rooted tendency so so

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.319
let's say you had

00:42:20.319 --> 00:42:21.520
you know

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.839
if you had uh you thought you were gay

00:42:23.839 --> 00:42:26.000
at one time and yeah i don't know you

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.680
know that's not a deeply it's like a

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.520
transitional a phase are they asking

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.119
these questions in the interviewer oh

00:42:31.119 --> 00:42:33.839
yeah yeah are they do they try to

00:42:33.839 --> 00:42:35.440
sugarcoat that at all

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.880
like are they left

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.760
i can't remember because if i was gay

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.200
at one point and then i was trying to

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.160
become a priest and they're like you

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.560
ever think about sucking dicks dongs i'd

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.079
be like what

00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:47.440
no way dude

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:49.200
i mean like i said like i said it's uh

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.119
with the only love [ __ ] i mean it's

00:42:51.119 --> 00:42:52.480
an awkward thing because you can't be

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.839
like you're around people you're like

00:42:53.839 --> 00:42:56.079
i'm sure these guys are gay but yeah

00:42:56.079 --> 00:42:58.720
the other thing that comes into play is

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.240
so each the church is all about

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.720
authority so

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.640
christ and the apostles and they they

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.040
had authority and so and they were the

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.640
traditions they were celibate themselves

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.599
and that's where the tradition comes

00:43:09.599 --> 00:43:12.319
from christ with celibate the apostles

00:43:12.319 --> 00:43:14.800
were and so forth okay now the church

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.240
has gives that to their priests where

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.800
other church other rights do not so the

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.599
coptic christians can marry now there is

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:23.760
a distinction to be made bishops always

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.119
have to be celibate because it's a

00:43:25.119 --> 00:43:27.760
higher you more closely resemble christ

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.119
so the higher up you are the less you

00:43:29.119 --> 00:43:31.040
can come

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.400
right

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.079
yeah

00:43:34.079 --> 00:43:36.079
we call it gravitas but if you want to

00:43:36.079 --> 00:43:39.200
be a dick about it yeah

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:42.000
so awesome so

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.520
i i i don't know i lost my train of

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.520
thought but the bottom line is um

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.839
um

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.599
i i lost my train of thought sorry

00:43:49.599 --> 00:43:51.359
you're saying the higher up you go the

00:43:51.359 --> 00:43:54.160
more is expected basically yeah i mean

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.000
the priest is meant to resemble christ

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.079
and so christ was a celibate man now the

00:43:58.079 --> 00:44:00.079
priest does not have the priest says

00:44:00.079 --> 00:44:02.000
intimacy you would say so he has

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.359
relationships people call him father i

00:44:03.359 --> 00:44:05.440
mean that's that's an intimate term you

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.680
would say yeah mother sister brother

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.560
father

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.240
and um

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:13.359
so by not having to

00:44:13.359 --> 00:44:15.119
be an intimate relationship with a woman

00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:16.400
he's instead

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.079
able to to be a part of every

00:44:18.079 --> 00:44:19.520
relationship so that's that's kind of

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.520
that's a practical aspect yeah and

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.040
theologically too i mean there's many

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.640
reasons why the church supports that

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.160
they'll quit too if you have a kid

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.440
you're like well [ __ ] this i'm just

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.960
gonna get a job let's think it's like oh

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.599
my my kid's sick or do you say matt it's

00:44:31.599 --> 00:44:33.920
like you know it's kind of because the

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.200
priesthood conflict of interest the

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.200
priesthood's a vocation not a job yeah

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.640
so it's a state of life so there's

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:39.839
married life

00:44:39.839 --> 00:44:42.400
and yeah and and you're a shepherd of

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.640
and one of the one of the sheep can't be

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.400
your [ __ ] kid correct or you only

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.480
care about that sheep so so even in the

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.119
east they're gonna you go

00:44:51.359 --> 00:44:53.359
the other churches they do draw a line

00:44:53.359 --> 00:44:54.160
where

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.000
it's not

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.880
you're not as much

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.839
they acknowledge that it's not um

00:45:01.839 --> 00:45:03.359
celibacy is

00:45:03.359 --> 00:45:05.680
favored let's put it that way it's more

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:08.240
favorable to be celibate

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.480
catholicism in in any yeah any

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.280
sacramental so the orthodox catholic any

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.119
of the any of the rights

00:45:15.119 --> 00:45:17.200
of protestants so protest is a whole

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:18.640
different deal you [ __ ] hate

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.560
protestants don't you i you can't say

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:23.920
hate i think they're in error hell yeah

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.119
i think they're wrong i think they're

00:45:25.119 --> 00:45:26.560
wrong for a lot i think they're wrong on

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.880
the grounds and there's historical and

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.440
um nutritional and how long were you in

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:32.800
the seminary for

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.640
i was in a total of six years how many

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.840
times did you come

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:40.189
[Music]

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:42.960
every year

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.280
on st valentine's day so the idea is

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:47.359
that that no one should be there

00:45:47.359 --> 00:45:49.760
sexuality is so special and so good that

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.599
yeah it's meant for something it's good

00:45:51.599 --> 00:45:54.319
for to share uh a relationship

00:45:54.319 --> 00:45:55.839
with with the intimacy with us i agree

00:45:55.839 --> 00:45:56.800
with that

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.400
and there are practical aspects to that

00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.680
too right like you're you're more

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.000
focused you're not this you know

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.319
it can lead to your girlfriend it can

00:46:04.319 --> 00:46:05.520
lead to some

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.839
deviance you would say if it gets

00:46:07.839 --> 00:46:09.119
having it all in

00:46:09.119 --> 00:46:11.280
no not doing that yeah you know you can

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.960
have it having it build up it leads to

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.640
detail i can leave the deviants too okay

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.560
see i'm talking about like

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:18.480
if someone is habitually masturbating

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.920
and looking at problems yeah yeah you're

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.680
getting some weird stuff

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:24.079
no doubt all this catholic dogma is

00:46:24.079 --> 00:46:26.079
lining up perfect with all of matt's

00:46:26.079 --> 00:46:28.480
theories maybe you should be a priest

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.319
i would kill it as a priest i i can't be

00:46:30.319 --> 00:46:31.760
a man in the cloth

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.839
you'd have to uh fix it and you'd be

00:46:33.839 --> 00:46:35.599
good i think it's i think it's for you

00:46:35.599 --> 00:46:37.280
it's true here's a question because i

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.880
was just thinking of matt being a priest

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.119
now you're allowed to drink a little bit

00:46:41.119 --> 00:46:43.599
as a priest right he's being hammered is

00:46:43.599 --> 00:46:45.760
wrong so so for the priest he's a he's a

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.920
public person but but the same rules

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:50.640
apply so to speak the the church teaches

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:53.280
i mean first of all the jesus church

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.760
yeah christ drank

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.680
christ is known for either teaching

00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.200
people or going to parties that's all he

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.680
did okay you could say in the scriptures

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:03.680
um and it's explicitly he made water in

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.280
the wine right how did it sounds like a

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.960
[ __ ] actually

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.720
anybody that i know that's like hey this

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.000
is how you should live and then all he

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.680
does is go to parties like all right

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:14.240
string his ass

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:17.920
the parties were uh you know teaching in

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.680
themselves but yeah how was he going to

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.280
race

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.640
he had some hookers he was like yeah we

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.960
need more wine

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.400
people accused him of that though he was

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.960
a drunkard and a womanizer is that what

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:31.440
the romans and the jews yeah yeah

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.520
there's a lot of accusations here's one

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.200
hung out with prostitutes and drunks

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:39.000
yeah if you're yeah

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.480
chilling with drunkards and hookers all

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.480
day yeah it's obviously frowned upon if

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.520
you're in the barber shop dude you're

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:50.880
going to get a haircut just lining up to

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:54.720
your your dogma again though hookers

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.319
this is my this is not my this isn't my

00:47:56.319 --> 00:47:58.720
veritas it's not my veritas dude or my

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.960
gravitas

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.960
my dad launched a [ __ ] gravitas into

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.119
those dungarees

00:48:05.119 --> 00:48:07.440
but um so you

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:08.560
disagree

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.800
strongly with the protestants but you're

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.480
you're cool with the jews you think the

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:13.920
jews are all right right i mean here's

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:17.359
the thing i would say um

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:20.079
there's two different ways to look at it

00:48:20.079 --> 00:48:23.200
i mean protestants are are christian

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.400
in error

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.200
okay

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.040
jews

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.880
are

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.720
have not accepted christ as the messiah

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:33.359
so that's how you do it now what i like

00:48:33.359 --> 00:48:35.359
what i like about uh judaism though i

00:48:35.359 --> 00:48:36.720
mean

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.280
the church is started from

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:41.359
christ was a jill the apostles were jews

00:48:41.359 --> 00:48:44.400
yeah okay all of them um and so a lot of

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.000
our things are jewish so so we have the

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000
jewish scriptures we have everything the

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.520
jews did basically um

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:52.800
well pope benedict always said i always

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.160
like this he said when you see a jewish

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:56.240
person you can see physically the the

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.880
promise of god to to the world

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.720
you physically it's a manifestation

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.160
because they are the chosen people so

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.160
it's the promise so they their heritage

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.000
uh yeah all the way back you know but

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.920
they're usually hunchbacked and have

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.599
claws

00:49:09.599 --> 00:49:11.119
so i don't know yeah i know there was a

00:49:11.119 --> 00:49:12.720
lot of jewish people near the seminary

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.720
uh uh strictly

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.440
yeah yeah and uh they just spit through

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:20.160
the fence at you guys

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:24.000
it was like space invaders you guys had

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.599
old jews crashing into the fence this

00:49:25.599 --> 00:49:27.119
year the seminar was kind of wild you

00:49:27.119 --> 00:49:30.240
had like a wealthy neighborhood you had

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.000
orthodox jews you had

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.760
west philly yeah and then you had

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.440
college kids in the seminary it was like

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:38.000
a complete mix all once like a sitcom it

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.480
was wild that is that's pretty nuts the

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.160
only difference is we didn't really get

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.839
out much yeah then there's just a

00:49:43.839 --> 00:49:46.240
mansion of dudes old men come

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.319
it's just a gated off area dudes are

00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:49.680
like oh [ __ ]

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.680
what stinks is like uh you know what was

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:53.359
hard for me was you'd be around guys

00:49:53.359 --> 00:49:55.599
maybe that aren't like you and then you

00:49:55.599 --> 00:49:56.960
it's tough and it's tough you're trying

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.880
to figure everything out and and i i

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.800
love the seminar i did and um i have a

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.480
lot of still good friends who are

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:04.880
priests and who are not priests um but

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.640
then you'd leave and you know we'd go

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.960
home on thanksgiving break and i'd go to

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:11.359
a party and you'd show your ass and yeah

00:50:11.359 --> 00:50:13.200
and like i'd be like this is fun you

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.559
know and people would treat me the same

00:50:14.559 --> 00:50:15.680
you know gill is going to treat me in

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:16.960
the same way you know

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.359
and uh i would give you [ __ ] oh sure but

00:50:19.359 --> 00:50:20.880
you know whatever that's the other thing

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.319
i can't tell you how many times people

00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:24.839
called me a pedophile or whatever that

00:50:24.839 --> 00:50:26.640
was you know man like how many times i

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.800
could say that and you know you just say

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.800
no i'm not you know but i do that you're

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.880
saying you are i know i am but i know

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.160
what i am but you are whatever the thing

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.319
is

00:50:38.079 --> 00:50:41.119
i know i am but whatever you are

00:50:41.119 --> 00:50:42.880
what do you think i mean i i predict the

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:44.480
catholic church is going to

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.400
go into a period of remission for like

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.400
500 years no one else we definitely are

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:50.640
you could argue on the decline in many

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:54.160
ways so um now the church has been in

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.079
rough shape throughout its history in

00:50:56.079 --> 00:50:58.000
many different areas i mean every

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.079
historical time brings its own

00:51:00.079 --> 00:51:02.720
challenges you would say um

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:04.079
i mean

00:51:04.079 --> 00:51:05.200
yeah it's

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.599
it's looked we're pretty bad before and

00:51:07.599 --> 00:51:09.200
yeah it's looked pretty bad i think

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.280
there's a there's a there's a protestant

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.359
author i forget in england and they hate

00:51:13.359 --> 00:51:16.319
the church always having um

00:51:16.319 --> 00:51:18.160
there's a there's an attitude you know

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:19.680
the funeral prior for the church has

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.040
always been ready and the whole world's

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:23.200
been been circled and everyone's ready

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.440
to go many many times but somehow the

00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.280
the match doesn't get lit you know it

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:28.960
never for some reason churches always

00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:30.480
seem like it's in it backed into a

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:32.319
corner it somehow always makes it out

00:51:32.319 --> 00:51:33.119
sure

00:51:33.119 --> 00:51:35.280
um but but definitely is there

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:36.400
definitely is a

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:40.079
uh more unique time and people are

00:51:40.079 --> 00:51:41.440
it's almost a good thing in a certain

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:44.400
sense because uh that uh kind of

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.920
straighten things out a little bit maybe

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:49.760
sure that sam harris uh shapiro

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.280
podcast i was telling you about yeah

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.160
because they were talking about

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.319
judeo-christian virtues and like free

00:51:54.319 --> 00:51:55.920
will and all this [ __ ] but

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:57.680
one thing sam harris was talking about

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.520
and it's kind of interesting is like

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:00.559
modern

00:52:00.559 --> 00:52:03.520
like religion was always able to

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.520
geographically stay in regions because

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:06.880
they didn't really talk to the outside

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.960
world so they're like yeah we're hindu

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.880
we're right right yeah we're catholic

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.000
we're right we're muslim

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:15.520
they're gonna kill you you'll be like

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:17.040
now you're muslim

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.280
but um now that we've got the internet

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.880
and globalization and all that like i

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:22.960
mean travel everybody trap like now

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:24.000
you're starting to be like wait are

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.760
these guys right sure it's like what

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:28.480
about like yeah religion's kind of

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:31.040
now what what i like about christianity

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.640
and uh

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:34.480
you know was able to spread

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.720
um to all different cultures see chris

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.559
what the difference is with christianity

00:52:38.559 --> 00:52:40.480
i think i could say judaism i know for a

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:41.839
fact islam

00:52:41.839 --> 00:52:44.559
is it's a a political

00:52:44.559 --> 00:52:47.440
it's a it's a societal and political

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:49.839
um uh laws

00:52:49.839 --> 00:52:52.319
in addition to being a religion right so

00:52:52.319 --> 00:52:55.119
sharia law is the law for islam

00:52:55.119 --> 00:52:57.119
for the religion itself christianity

00:52:57.119 --> 00:52:58.720
doesn't have that i mean christianity

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:01.200
has been able to to exist in any culture

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:01.920
and

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.319
arguably government right you can live

00:53:04.319 --> 00:53:06.079
in a socialist even communists that can

00:53:06.079 --> 00:53:08.240
survive technically uh capitalists and

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.000
all these different what's the uh

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.760
give unto caesar

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:14.240
right what is his yeah the the pharisees

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.599
came to christ and they said uh they're

00:53:15.599 --> 00:53:17.920
gonna trick him right yeah and uh the

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.400
jews yeah the pharisee jews is this when

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.480
he flipped the tables uh that's man's

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:24.640
favorite story this is uh i think it was

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.480
i think it was a day or two before but

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.880
they they gave him a coin and they said

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.960
uh

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.079
you know what do you think of this and

00:53:32.079 --> 00:53:34.720
it was either he he says he says what do

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:36.720
you think of this coin yeah so so it had

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:39.040
caesar's caesar's uh image on it and it

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.520
said so if he the idea was

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.000
if he said no this is not good yeah then

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.280
speak out against then you speak out

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:46.640
against the romans if you say it does

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:49.280
then you are not for the jews so i

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:50.480
thought they had him and he just said

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.880
look whose image is on that you know

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:54.240
that's caesar's well given to caesar

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.680
what is caesar's under god what is god

00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.920
so the idea is that you can that he

00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.440
grabbed a beer bong and [ __ ] shark

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:00.240
wine

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:02.319
like these [ __ ] hookers

00:54:02.319 --> 00:54:04.079
get these dudes the [ __ ] out of you dude

00:54:04.079 --> 00:54:05.520
i can't believe i just thought of that

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.119
like that was crazy

00:54:07.119 --> 00:54:09.920
i keep doing that

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.640
i think that was like one of the last

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:19.680
drawings i always thought he just got

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.200
like bullied by like peter and another

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:22.640
one of those guys like yo go tell that

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:23.920
guy you're the son of god and he's like

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.440
i don't know man

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:27.760
you gotta do another butt job

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.440
all right so [ __ ] you just took his hair

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:30.800
behind his ears like all right man

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:31.920
whatever

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:34.240
uh so so so the idea is that you know

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:36.800
you can it's just to pay your taxes

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:39.680
right and you can be a christian and

00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.520
you can respect the state correct

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:43.839
whereas islam

00:54:43.839 --> 00:54:46.160
is can't exist in a democratic saying

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.680
that you can't have a government other

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.520
than islam

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.280
technically speaking yes so that so

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:52.640
that's their

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.800
that's their belief system and there is

00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:58.800
a there is a a lost system entwined with

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.559
with islamic culture i mean so that's

00:55:00.559 --> 00:55:04.000
why you go to saudi arabia and there are

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.920
you're not there's no booze right

00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:06.960
because that's what islam says well

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:09.440
that's your laws right where now

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:10.880
catholic christianity has certainly

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:13.119
influenced laws and and we would say for

00:55:13.119 --> 00:55:15.119
the better um

00:55:15.119 --> 00:55:16.880
you know um

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.559
for instance um

00:55:18.559 --> 00:55:20.160
the church started university so

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:22.160
learning you would say so every every

00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.079
college basically comes from the church

00:55:24.079 --> 00:55:25.920
um

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:28.079
in america or the university system as

00:55:28.079 --> 00:55:29.359
we know it comes from the church from

00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:30.640
the middle ages

00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:31.520
um

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:34.400
um you would say um

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.960
you know the big thing was like consent

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.800
and when you find someone guilty of

00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:39.839
something

00:55:39.839 --> 00:55:42.400
so you know is it a crime of passion

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:43.920
things like that really came about in

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:45.119
the middle ages where to figure out

00:55:45.119 --> 00:55:47.359
who's who has culpability when doing

00:55:47.359 --> 00:55:49.040
doing an action so it's kind of

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.079
interesting a lot of ways so you're

00:55:50.079 --> 00:55:52.240
saying the world's legal system comes

00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:54.640
from western western cultures is

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:58.400
extremely is from what we would say

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.079
some people coined the term i think it's

00:56:00.079 --> 00:56:02.640
nice athens and jerusalem so yeah

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:03.880
they're talking about reason

00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:05.119
[Music]

00:56:05.119 --> 00:56:07.440
reason influenced by faith

00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:08.559
yeah so

00:56:08.559 --> 00:56:11.359
so you know don't kill people why

00:56:11.359 --> 00:56:13.520
well you can see on a natural level it's

00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:16.160
bad and then if you take another aspect

00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:17.440
oh well there's faith involved so that

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:18.640
person is

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:20.400
has rights from god well it makes it

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.119
even

00:56:21.119 --> 00:56:23.280
that much worse yeah i mean so so on

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.799
that level it makes things you know

00:56:24.799 --> 00:56:26.880
that's that's where we have our western

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:29.040
laws so like liberty and those different

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:30.640
things i mean i don't know that's a very

00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:32.799
it's a very western thing when was the

00:56:32.799 --> 00:56:35.280
magna carta wasn't that 12 15. okay and

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:37.520
that was before they

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:39.119
the protestant reformation was in like

00:56:39.119 --> 00:56:41.520
process reformation started 16th 15th

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:42.559
17th

00:56:42.559 --> 00:56:44.480
martin luther halloween

00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:47.280
october 31st he that's when he

00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:49.359
started to uh publicly now there were

00:56:49.359 --> 00:56:50.799
guys before him there were always

00:56:50.799 --> 00:56:53.359
heresies in the church yeah um but they

00:56:53.359 --> 00:56:56.040
were um so caught on like this the

00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:59.200
judeo-christian the jerusalem athens

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:01.440
way of thinking laid the ground for

00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:03.280
british

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:05.200
law what's the word for that

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.119
english common law or whatever yeah yeah

00:57:07.119 --> 00:57:09.599
yeah right we're released i mean yeah it

00:57:09.599 --> 00:57:11.280
influenced that you could say human

00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:13.040
rights some people say negatively some

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:15.440
say uh probably the [ __ ] protestants

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:16.720
i don't know i don't know enough about

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:18.799
it but it took power away from the king

00:57:18.799 --> 00:57:20.559
is the idea yeah and then he was like

00:57:20.559 --> 00:57:24.000
more than the [ __ ] pope right so yeah

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.640
so you could say the western world as we

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.640
know and what i like about i mean if you

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:30.240
look at europe

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:32.559
you can bash uh you know

00:57:32.559 --> 00:57:35.040
white supremacists and you should okay

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.559
um you know

00:57:36.559 --> 00:57:38.240
you should you should bash them so like

00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.520
that guy dairy queen you're telling me

00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:41.440
about it he probably hates us but uh you

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:42.880
know i i will say this there's there's a

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:45.280
neat there's a neat um document where it

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:48.000
describes pope gregory in the sixth in

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.599
the sixth century

00:57:49.599 --> 00:57:52.319
and they had slaves someone had a slave

00:57:52.319 --> 00:57:54.400
these they weren't christian come from

00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.240
england someone had them

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.000
someone was br he found out they were

00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.520
slaves they were trying to save these

00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.359
child slaves in england and it was

00:58:01.359 --> 00:58:02.880
protestant or

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:04.480
um they were before they were

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.720
christianized so yeah and um he said

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.400
these these people look like angels we

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:09.359
got to help them out we got to send

00:58:09.359 --> 00:58:11.040
missions oh that's not good so the idea

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.440
the idea was he's not white is the point

00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:16.000
you know like he was in italy and uh so

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.280
the idea is that

00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:19.440
europe europe composed of i mean it

00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:21.040
wasn't just white people

00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:23.040
yeah maybe as we know it now though

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.880
italians aren't what you look at spanish

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:27.040
italians i mean that was the church that

00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:29.280
was the church they were jewish people

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.160
italians i mean they're very very very

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:30.319
very very very very very very very very

00:58:30.319 --> 00:58:31.599
natural

00:58:31.599 --> 00:58:33.760
pope gregory saved slaves so so they

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:34.839
were they

00:58:34.839 --> 00:58:36.799
were he's like this looks like an angel

00:58:36.799 --> 00:58:39.599
bring him to my room

00:58:41.359 --> 00:58:43.200
the big thing like like saint nicholas

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:46.000
uh like his story um

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.319
you know some people that

00:58:48.319 --> 00:58:51.280
let me back up there were

00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:52.960
instances where people had like child

00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:55.200
slavery and most of that sexual stuff

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:57.359
right and so the the legend goes saint

00:58:57.359 --> 00:58:59.440
nicholas would go at night and and leave

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:01.520
uh coins in the window and it fell into

00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:03.839
the stockings you know so the guy could

00:59:03.839 --> 00:59:05.200
give to these people instead of they

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:06.640
would take his daughters into sexual

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:08.000
slavery and that's a strong holy [ __ ]

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.040
that's a story

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:10.480
that's why we put our that's how we get

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:13.200
starburst in our stocking

00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:15.200
sister

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:16.799
that's where the tradition comes from so

00:59:16.799 --> 00:59:18.319
he was a protector of youth because he

00:59:18.319 --> 00:59:20.720
stopped he stopped people from yeah so

00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:22.720
he was the bishop of that diocese he was

00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:24.640
how did it turn into candy

00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:26.240
over the years yeah you give a gift

00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:28.799
sweet the deal give a gift yeah

00:59:28.799 --> 00:59:30.240

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:32.480
his kid for sex slaves

00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:34.319

sweet treat you're like let me suck on

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:37.680
this wait where was say nicholas getting

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:39.599
all these things

00:59:39.599 --> 00:59:41.839
he's the bishop so he has control oh so

00:59:41.839 --> 00:59:43.599
he's using the coffers yeah

00:59:43.599 --> 00:59:44.960
for the charity yeah for the little

00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:46.880
girls and the thing is the great story

00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:48.440
about saint nicholas in

00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:50.160
325

00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:52.559
council on isaiah they had a big council

00:59:52.559 --> 00:59:55.119
hey who's right on this is christ god is

00:59:55.119 --> 00:59:57.839
jesus god is not and uh it was after the

00:59:57.839 --> 01:00:00.960
roman empire legalized christianity

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.640
and so there were guys bishops who were

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.640
like tortured immune guys there's

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.720
accounts of guys having no eyes and

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:09.920
mutilated and he punched

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:12.319
arius is the big uh heresy punched him

01:00:12.319 --> 01:00:14.240
in he got fired up in the yeah i mean

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.240
punched him in the face fought him

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.480
just got off set got fired up and like

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.079
went at the guy but anyway

01:00:20.079 --> 01:00:22.160
the bottom line hey nick i have no idea

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.079
st next wild so

01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:26.319
the bottom line is the church to start

01:00:26.319 --> 01:00:28.720
off and he wasn't it wasn't britain and

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.280
ireland and yeah yeah sweden and norway

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.920
and northern germany for like the first

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.079
600 years yeah you know what i mean so

01:00:36.079 --> 01:00:38.880
it was very mediterranean very not white

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:41.760
let's say african uh ethiopia has some

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:44.240
of the ancient christians iraq yeah um

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.440
aren't those like the oldest churches

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.799
they're the oldest churches dug into the

01:00:46.799 --> 01:00:48.720
plateaus yes yes so you think about like

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.480
egypt they're the oldest they're older

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.319
christians technically speaking ireland

01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:53.200
is

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.680
came along a little bit after you know

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.839
so you're saying the earliest christians

01:00:57.839 --> 01:00:59.599
were basically from the middle east

01:00:59.599 --> 01:01:02.160
correct i mean yeah yeah very much so

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:04.079
like zeus so that's the issue now with

01:01:04.079 --> 01:01:05.599
in iraq is

01:01:05.599 --> 01:01:07.520
you know um it's not politically correct

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.760
to say it but um

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.000
you know christians are

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.920
i mean they're getting the raw deal in

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.480
iraq and with the llamas

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.599
i mean a lot of people don't like that

01:01:17.599 --> 01:01:18.480
even

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.599
christians are getting their own deal i

01:01:19.599 --> 01:01:21.200
mean we should we should help them out

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:22.960
over muslims you would say

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:25.119
they're getting that oh there you go

01:01:25.119 --> 01:01:26.720
that doesn't sound very christian in

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.640
taking in refugees so they make up a

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.319
certain population that's why trump said

01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:32.240
so you take you take in a little more

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.520
those banned countries if you're a

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.440
religious minority which is basically

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.960
just like if you're a christian exactly

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.480
they were all muslims exactly then

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.839
you're allowed in

01:01:39.839 --> 01:01:42.559
yeah so that that's the big and

01:01:42.559 --> 01:01:45.200
i know from the statistics are i think

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:48.160
in iraq now i don't know about i don't

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.160
i'm not exactly sure i think they make

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.559
up like maybe 10 of the population

01:01:52.559 --> 01:01:55.200
but yet if you're a refugee we only take

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.720
in

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.720
less than one percent of christians

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.640
right so does that make sense so there's

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:01.599
something to be said for that where

01:02:01.599 --> 01:02:03.359
they're the most ancient christians on

01:02:03.359 --> 01:02:06.160
earth oh so from a

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:07.359
we should be helping them out correct

01:02:07.359 --> 01:02:09.760
absolutely from a humanitarian aspect we

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.839
should be helping anybody we can it's

01:02:11.839 --> 01:02:14.240
it's been coined by the

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:17.359
by the by our our country as a genocide

01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:19.359
a christian genocide is going on yeah

01:02:19.359 --> 01:02:21.440
today and that's and that was when obama

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:24.079
was in office so yeah um that was and

01:02:24.079 --> 01:02:27.280
yeah yeah nothing nothing's done so yeah

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.640
there are i mean there's

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.240
i mean there's relief efforts i know the

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:32.160
knights of columbus

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.760
gives money and there's whole bishops

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:36.160
there where they're like hey look

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.079
we're dying we're not going to be around

01:02:38.079 --> 01:02:39.760
yeah you know and we've been here since

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.400
day one yeah my coptic uh coptic

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:45.520
christian brother-in-law is egyptian and

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.359
every day i'm friends with him and

01:02:47.359 --> 01:02:48.559
there's a bunch of his buddies on

01:02:48.559 --> 01:02:49.520
facebook

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.880
and like every day they're posting a

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:51.839
different

01:02:51.839 --> 01:02:52.960
bombing

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:55.119
of christians and like even i think i

01:02:55.119 --> 01:02:57.200
could be wrong on this but that that

01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:59.359
mosque that got

01:02:59.359 --> 01:03:01.119
attacked like

01:03:01.119 --> 01:03:02.400
two or three months ago it was like the

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.480
biggest yeah they put a bomb in the in

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.880
the in the church in the in the mosque

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.880
it was a mosque oh okay

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.799
muslims on muslims that's right but i

01:03:10.799 --> 01:03:12.880
believe and i could be wrong here it was

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:15.280
because the church that got bombed was

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.760
helping coptic christians damn server

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.359
they're playing bomberman dude yeah they

01:03:19.359 --> 01:03:20.640
kicked the bomb into the mosque it was

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:21.839
like

01:03:21.839 --> 01:03:23.359
dude those moss bombings are [ __ ]

01:03:23.359 --> 01:03:24.799
it's insane

01:03:24.799 --> 01:03:26.960
horrible it's just people just sitting

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.799
on [ __ ] carpets and somebody runs in

01:03:28.799 --> 01:03:30.720
and it's like sure i disagree with what

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.240
you're doing see and that's the thing i

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.760
guess the most violence is muslims

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:37.200
versus muslims of course and now um so

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.839
so yeah it's it's a tough thing um what

01:03:39.839 --> 01:03:41.359
about the

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:42.839
jews versus

01:03:42.839 --> 01:03:45.200
palestinians oh that's team jew all the

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.799
way well i'm saying didn't the

01:03:46.799 --> 01:03:49.440
palestinians get dogged by the jews so

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:51.039
now you're the palestinians dog and the

01:03:51.039 --> 01:03:52.559
jews and the palestinians dog and the

01:03:52.559 --> 01:03:54.160
christians it's like

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.240
yeah squad up dude

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.599
what us with the jews i'm not

01:03:57.599 --> 01:03:58.880
squandering i don't give a [ __ ] but i'm

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:01.119
saying like that was that it's it's

01:04:01.119 --> 01:04:03.359
pretty doggy yeah yeah yeah and i just

01:04:03.359 --> 01:04:05.200
looked it up and it's like the palace

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.440
the argument for a palestinian state is

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.119
kind of flimsy

01:04:09.119 --> 01:04:11.200
so it's like they never really had a

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.720
country ever

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:14.160
to begin with but did they live there

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.920
that's like the zuckerberg hawaii yeah

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.000
yeah zuckerberg's like well you guys had

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.599
land but it was not on paper and he took

01:04:19.599 --> 01:04:21.839
their land it's like yeah it was the

01:04:21.839 --> 01:04:23.520
ottoman empire until it was dissolved

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:26.559
and the british had the tears

01:04:28.559 --> 01:04:29.280
yeah

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.559
i get it but if you're if you're

01:04:30.559 --> 01:04:31.680
catholic and you're living somewhere

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:32.799
it's like dude you're in the [ __ ] war

01:04:32.799 --> 01:04:35.520
zone bro right it's like you know it's

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.440
doggy dog and jews have a bad too i

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.760
would say um i think everything i think

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.359
it's just to live there like i think

01:04:41.359 --> 01:04:44.240
it's like pretty fairly it sucks

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.240
in france i think there's

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.000
less and less jews

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.119
the

01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:50.960
jews are leaving that country in hordes

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.240
and they say yeah jews aren't really

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.079
liked well in europe before muslims came

01:04:54.079 --> 01:04:55.680
in there and they don't

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.359
they're not a

01:04:57.359 --> 01:04:59.599
that's not a religious sect that wants

01:04:59.599 --> 01:05:01.359
to grow right

01:05:01.359 --> 01:05:03.119
judaism yeah if you don't have jewish

01:05:03.119 --> 01:05:05.039
missionaries right

01:05:05.039 --> 01:05:07.200
it's a race yeah so you could say it's a

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:09.599
race um

01:05:09.599 --> 01:05:11.760
yeah it's uh it's it's a unique jewish

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:12.880
it's hard

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.319
yeah it's interesting it's it's a race

01:05:14.319 --> 01:05:16.559
of people as well as in it a religion

01:05:16.559 --> 01:05:18.480
it's hard to become jewish and to become

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.880
muslim all you have to do is

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:23.839
say

01:05:26.079 --> 01:05:28.480
my big thing was and this is protestants

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:32.319
hate this i think but i compare

01:05:32.319 --> 01:05:34.400
muslims to protestant christians i think

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.079
there's tons of similarities between the

01:05:36.079 --> 01:05:39.359
two how between the religious structures

01:05:39.359 --> 01:05:41.200
how the people are i would say so you

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.280
would say um

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:44.559
in in

01:05:44.559 --> 01:05:46.720
evangelical protestantism

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.960
all you say is i accept the lord jesus

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.680
christ as my lord and savior into my

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.680
heart yeah and they say that saves you

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.280
at that moment yep okay and you're

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:57.039
instantly a protestant and you're

01:05:57.039 --> 01:05:58.720
instantly a

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:01.280
they would say a um

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.200
a christian a saved christian do you

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.839
have to get baptized

01:06:06.559 --> 01:06:09.520
for some protestants [ __ ] challengers

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.440
others it's just a symbol of what you

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:12.640
already did

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:14.400
okay does that make sense

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.160
so you don't gotta get duncan so not for

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:17.680
some it's not

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:19.520
a requirement you could say but it's the

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.200
same thing with islam where you just say

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:24.319
something exactly so so both of them

01:06:24.319 --> 01:06:26.640
and this is uh you guys say hot take

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.319
this is a very catholic people are just

01:06:28.319 --> 01:06:29.119
yeah

01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:30.319
so

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:33.280
islam is a book it's based off of a book

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.960
every word in there is what everything's

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.039
based off of so too is protestant

01:06:37.039 --> 01:06:39.280
christianity they have soul of scripture

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:41.280
they have only the bible and that's it

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.880
okay and they go off those words and

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.119
that's it so it becomes an issue when

01:06:45.119 --> 01:06:47.839
like okay well how was the world created

01:06:47.839 --> 01:06:49.359
what god created in seven days there

01:06:49.359 --> 01:06:51.119
were dinosaurs and people that's why you

01:06:51.119 --> 01:06:52.480
know what i mean and it's like a crazy

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:55.680
thing when really that book is just a

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.119
it's not a scientific book it's not

01:06:57.119 --> 01:06:59.280
meant to be it never was it's just a

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.039
there's two creation stories in genesis

01:07:01.039 --> 01:07:03.440
which one's real yeah yeah i mean

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.680
science wasn't created until

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:08.000
a millennium later sure and and it's not

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.160
meant to tell you i mean there can be

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.640
truths in there but it's it's a poem

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.480
really it's a what the church would say

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:16.880
a divinely inspired text that just

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:19.039
happens to be like it's poetry you know

01:07:19.039 --> 01:07:21.440
god created the first day light god yeah

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:23.920
and it crescendos to making people

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.599
uh anyway there's a lot of beauty i mean

01:07:25.599 --> 01:07:27.599
it's very uh it's deep and rich but

01:07:27.599 --> 01:07:29.280
anyway the point is so they would say oh

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.200
no god did this and he had to do this

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.280
because it's written here yeah you know

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.720
and so too with the muslim they say you

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.640
know this is this book was written yeah

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.000
and uh and that's what that is they're

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.520
like pretty big bible

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.119
they're they're bible thumpers yeah

01:07:41.119 --> 01:07:42.400
right they're quran

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:45.200
that's right that's it and if you

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:48.000
okay so just moving on uh

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.680
you know you can't drink

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.440
right both of them are hard-lined no

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:54.160
booze yeah okay um they're very

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.920
hard-lined on a lot of issues so it's

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:58.400
this or else yeah you know what i mean

01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.760
um

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:01.599
i just think

01:08:01.599 --> 01:08:03.280
when it comes to science too you have a

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.799
lot of that and now now some people

01:08:04.799 --> 01:08:07.359
would say stick up for islamic countries

01:08:07.359 --> 01:08:09.680
and maybe they do have some aspects of

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:10.799
uh

01:08:10.799 --> 01:08:12.960
of of science and certainly throughout

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.480
the middle ages there were there were a

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:16.319
lot of stuff they did but on the whole i

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:18.000
would say it's stunted

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.159
i mean with the middle east correct what

01:08:20.159 --> 01:08:21.520
their technology and science and

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:23.120
different things i mean i mean like you

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.880
have people saying we had a flood

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:25.920
because

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.080
women aren't wearing veils you know it's

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.080
like that's why god did this because

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.400
you're right you're right in that like

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.319
and like people say god's punishing

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:36.719
united states yeah protestants would say

01:08:36.719 --> 01:08:37.679
because

01:08:37.679 --> 01:08:40.319
we have abortions yeah and that's why

01:08:40.319 --> 01:08:42.000
the hurricane came yeah it's like it's

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.759
like the same thing baptists the

01:08:43.759 --> 01:08:45.199
westborough because right yeah they're

01:08:45.199 --> 01:08:47.679
literally that way or yep they would say

01:08:47.679 --> 01:08:50.480
god hates you if you're gay yeah right

01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:52.000
what's your catholic church say like you

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.600
just not chill with it god does not hate

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:56.960
anybody in fact he loves them uh so much

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.719
we would say

01:08:58.719 --> 01:09:00.960
i mean we can get it's a whole another

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.319
yeah what is it what is the official

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:04.400
official stance like it's chill just

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.319
yeah this is uh politically correct the

01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:09.839
church would say a homosexual action

01:09:09.839 --> 01:09:10.640
is

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.799
intrinsically disordered

01:09:12.799 --> 01:09:15.679
okay so that action is not what it's

01:09:15.679 --> 01:09:18.319
meant to do and it can never be

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:20.880
it can never be that whereas let's say

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:21.920
you have

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:24.640
um sex outside of marriage

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.239
it's not the best way to do it but that

01:09:26.239 --> 01:09:27.679
action is still what it's meant to do

01:09:27.679 --> 01:09:28.719
you're just not doing it in the proper

01:09:28.719 --> 01:09:31.040
context yeah right so you need to come

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.880
into a vagina

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:34.319
that's what it's meant

01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:36.080
our sexuality is meant for that now

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:37.440
there's a beautiful aspect to that you

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.960
know i often i remember reading this

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.319
nice article about

01:09:40.319 --> 01:09:42.480
um pornography and different things and

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:43.600
uh

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.080
we talked about how men are so phys are

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:47.839
so image oriented

01:09:47.839 --> 01:09:49.279
okay that

01:09:49.279 --> 01:09:51.040
that image gets stamped on your brain

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.960
and that's why it's such a high instance

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.960
of use of pornography and masturbation

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:55.840
in men

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.679
that if you if you think about it like

01:09:57.679 --> 01:09:58.719
this

01:09:58.719 --> 01:10:00.320
and this is what this guy was saying i

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:04.080
kind of think it's nice but if you um

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.320
if you only see your wife on your

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.000
wedding night if you've never had sex

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.159
with anybody

01:10:10.159 --> 01:10:11.920
if you see your wife naked for the first

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.840
time and you guys are intimate like

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:15.679
that's that's what's on your mind and

01:10:15.679 --> 01:10:17.360
that's always like yourself you're

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.679
supposed to jerk off to your girlfriend

01:10:19.679 --> 01:10:21.679
yeah

01:10:21.679 --> 01:10:23.120
and i always do

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:25.360
same dude i can't wait

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.520
you're so you're so uh um

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:31.040
you're saying you're not your mind's not

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:45.199
dude what how do they fake how do they

01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:47.199
fit like you're in printing and stuff

01:10:47.199 --> 01:10:48.960
yeah yeah all your theories are like

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:52.080
what the church is t like no fapping

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:55.760
is t-porn is a depth of hell

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.520
it's just confusing i mean if you're if

01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.719
you're my thing is if your goal is to

01:11:00.719 --> 01:11:03.360
just be a cat about town dude [ __ ]

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.520
knock off and have a blast with the all

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:07.520
kinds of crazy porn but yeah if you want

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.120
to have like kids and stuff it's that's

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.880
a [ __ ] that's a tough one

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.840
kids porn

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:15.360
it's a tough thing to think about it

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.880
affects any relationship you have where

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.960
everything becomes sexualized too like

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.960
you know it's it's

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.880
just this is bad you just wake up in the

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.480
morning and go

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.080
i'm gonna jerk off and watch porn so

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:28.000
there's 30 minutes of your day down the

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
tubes and then five

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.360
oh you got to pick the right bit dude

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.640
you know you're down there you're edging

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:33.520
a little bit you're [ __ ] you're

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:34.960
having a good old time

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.120
so it's a bad habit you shouldn't come

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:39.120
and you shouldn't see like a girl get a

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.719
dick ram down her throat at seven a.m in

01:11:40.719 --> 01:11:42.320
the morning before work that [ __ ] your

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:44.560
whole head up dude it does i agree so

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.080
the the what the church we're teaching

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.239
about the bottom line is sexuality right

01:11:48.239 --> 01:11:49.679
that's perfect

01:11:49.679 --> 01:11:51.280
dreams are clean i don't have sexual

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.560
dreams

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.560
i get all the demons out and then have a

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.159
nice dream dude four porn stars in the

01:11:56.159 --> 01:11:57.840
latin this year have killed themselves

01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.520
probably because the protestants

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:02.960
probably muslims the prostitutes

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.280
all right um we are going long on this

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.560
but

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.000
i'll just say uh no you're fine when it

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.760
comes to homosexuality

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:12.960
homosexual attraction is not sinful

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:15.120
right i mean people tell you emotions

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.960
and feelings and you don't know what

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:19.199
what you know some people have phases

01:12:19.199 --> 01:12:20.719
like i said or you know all these

01:12:20.719 --> 01:12:22.719
different things but the action itself

01:12:22.719 --> 01:12:24.800
is disordered we would say yes and and

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:27.199
sexuality is so good the one of the

01:12:27.199 --> 01:12:29.679
highest gifts that we have it's so

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:31.120
special that it has to be used for the

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.199
proper context but squirrels have it

01:12:33.199 --> 01:12:34.560
also

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:37.040
right there and we're what we arisato

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:38.880
would call uh philosophically we're

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.880
rational animals yeah right we still

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:43.280
have we still eat you know sleep you

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.199
know you know how about procreate all

01:12:45.199 --> 01:12:46.960
those things what's the catholic church

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:50.480
now what's their stance on like hell

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:52.640
hell's real how's uh hell is real this

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:54.480
is my place yep but you can in the

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:57.760
moment before just be like my bad sure i

01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.840
mean i'm out yeah but you can say my bad

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:02.159
i think it is if you mean it

01:13:02.159 --> 01:13:03.600
in your heart if i'm about to go to hell

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:04.960
i'll [ __ ] mean it i'll be like oh my

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:07.199
god i'm so sorry in that sense god's

01:13:07.199 --> 01:13:08.880
all-knowing and would know if you're

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.960
just being like i'm afraid of my

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.320
consequence so now that's what

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:14.080
everyone's doing yeah but i think god

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.040
that's the point of hell to make you

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:17.440
scared of it and be good no

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.920
no it's it's a punishment for

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.360
thinking that way

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.880
to what i mean here

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.159
what i always think about on a natural

01:13:24.159 --> 01:13:25.360
level is

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.880
but forever he's gonna he's gonna send

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:28.800
you there forever because he's not gonna

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.400
pop you out of hell after like a couple

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.400
days you're there forever yeah what it

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.719
is is it's it's tough it's the absence

01:13:34.719 --> 01:13:36.480
of god is what hell is yeah that's what

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:37.679
i was talking about it's a place where

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:38.560
god is

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:40.239
even though he technically is there and

01:13:40.239 --> 01:13:41.520
so far as he

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.360
allows that to exist but yeah you would

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:44.880
say that's a place where

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.480
your actions choose that you do not want

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:47.840
to be with god therefore there is a

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.520
place for you so god reflects your

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:51.840
respects your freedom in its entirety

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.360
that he won't coerce you in any way so

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:55.440
you choose that that's that's all it is

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:57.280
it's godless you just go there you still

01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:58.719
rise in the ranks of hell then if you're

01:13:58.719 --> 01:14:00.320
down there i don't know how it goes down

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:03.199
there it's not good though

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.280
so this is where i have a big

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:06.960
disagreement with sure the catholic

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:09.360
church because i i've i've heard priests

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.679
say that that's all [ __ ] and that's

01:14:11.679 --> 01:14:13.280
not right i mean

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:15.760
that classic roman catholic teaching

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:17.760
that's not right but

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.360
isn't the catholic church one of the

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:20.719
good things about it it's supposed to

01:14:20.719 --> 01:14:22.719
evolve

01:14:22.719 --> 01:14:24.239
what we know now

01:14:24.239 --> 01:14:26.239
sure and and the church always always

01:14:26.239 --> 01:14:29.120
has you would say yeah um we've always

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:30.800
uh

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:33.840
that's the thing we're not hardlined by

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:36.000
a sentence in genesis you know what i

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.679
mean yeah yeah we don't we're not you

01:14:37.679 --> 01:14:39.120
know like like what you just said about

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:42.400
homosexuality i really doubt that

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:44.960
200 years ago if you asked a priest what

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:46.560
he thought of homosexuality he wouldn't

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:47.600
say

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:49.040
your thoughts

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:50.960
and what you you know how you feel about

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.960
somebody else that's not it's not your

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:55.199
fault you could argue that i'd say most

01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:57.520
likely they would they would be tougher

01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.920
on that now i the official stance is you

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.600
never treat anyone

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:03.840
you always treat people with sensitivity

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:05.679
right you're not gonna be rude to them

01:15:05.679 --> 01:15:07.040
technically we shouldn't

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.360
you're supposed to treat homosexuals

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:12.000
people with homosexual tendencies uh um

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.840
you know with that most respect um

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:18.000
the i guess what you're saying is yeah

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.280
completely right so i'll give you an

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:21.360
example suicide you know there's a

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.719
psychological understanding of what

01:15:22.719 --> 01:15:25.440
suicide is right now

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.800
that's come about so we've been able to

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:28.400
understand like so you guys aren't

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.320
saying suicides go to hell anymore well

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:32.560
no no we we would say so

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.320
so the church says that's always a grave

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.080
grave sin so you're taking a life which

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:38.000
happens to be your own right yeah

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.360
throwing away the gift god gave you

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.320
correct and you're saying there's no

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:42.560
hope for me i gotta get out now i will

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:43.440
say

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:46.000
having suicidal thoughts or anything

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.679
like that i mean you look at the saints

01:15:47.679 --> 01:15:49.360
lives i mean what the saints all have in

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:51.600
common is they all suffered horribly

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.360
physically emotionally

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:55.040
any way you can chalk it up i mean they

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.760
all suffer just like christ

01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:59.600
so

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.120
i mean there's writings there where like

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.880
i wish god would just kill me you know i

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.640
wish i could die yeah because suffering

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:06.080
is so bad what do they teach are they

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:07.760
teaching people who commit suicide go to

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:11.760
hell or no so the understanding is

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:15.120
suicide it sounds like a yes

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.719
sounds like a long way around it yet

01:16:16.719 --> 01:16:18.159
technically no they because you you

01:16:18.159 --> 01:16:19.840
can't you don't know you don't know what

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:21.920
the person experiences so for instance

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:22.800
um

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.400
if you are

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.960
if you commit suicide right

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:28.560
are you

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:30.880
is your brain working properly is that

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:32.800
are you able to freely choose that is

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:34.320
the unknown understand

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.000
you could say but did you like some

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.480
people choose it to a point but are they

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:40.000
coerced by medications maybe they think

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.360
i mean we had a guy who passed away who

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:44.239
was came back from doing two tours in

01:16:44.239 --> 01:16:46.239
iraq and afghanistan and was on 24

01:16:46.239 --> 01:16:48.480
different medications i mean he wasn't

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:49.840
you're not in control of you're not

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.679
thinking right you know so there is an

01:16:51.679 --> 01:16:53.120
ex there is a

01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:54.880
you know an excuse for that sort of

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.960
speaking well then in that case every

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:59.440
every single suicide your brain is the

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:01.360
one that's like

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.880
true like when dudes jump out the window

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.960
in the world trade center it's like they

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.640
go to hell what's the thing like do you

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:08.400
is it is it are you burdened with

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.560
suffering so much that you can't choose

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:12.640
i would say not everybody i would say

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:13.920
for for

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:15.840
i would say a lot of people maybe that

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:17.679
is the case yes so the bottom line is

01:17:17.679 --> 01:17:19.679
the church doesn't so so like you said

01:17:19.679 --> 01:17:21.360
came with the time so to speak church

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:23.760
while we say that suicide is a a grave

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:24.719
sin

01:17:24.719 --> 01:17:27.120
okay is it mortal that all these things

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:28.560
have to be there it's got to be a

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:31.120
serious engrave it's got to be freely

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:33.760
chosen yeah and you have to know what it

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:35.600
is you're doing too so so all those

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.440
things have to be there so right in a

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:39.440
certain context yeah i mean maybe not

01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:40.800
you know you're in a sense they're just

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.560
trying to like fill the seats so like

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.840
they have all these teachings and then

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:44.880
everyone's like well that's stupid and

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:45.920
they're like

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:47.760
yeah yeah no you're right

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:50.400
so come on in no i think they're i would

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.320
i said it's very reasonable probably

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:55.360
trying to find the truth right yeah

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:56.800
so but i mean how what do you think it's

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:58.560
wrong so if you're like all right the

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.320
world obviously wasn't created in seven

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.560
days but if you're bad you go down to

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:04.320
[ __ ] hill and it's like well that's

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:06.719
the same logic

01:18:06.719 --> 01:18:08.320
i would say

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:10.320
in there what i would imagine they say

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:12.000
is hell is

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.080
not a physical place

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:15.440
hopefully

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.960
this is what they say i mean i'm

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:18.640
thinking this is just stuff yeah i i

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:21.280
think i in my opinion i think the church

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.800
is just a

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:25.280
a political money machine to where like

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.800
it definitely served a huge purpose no

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:29.199
doubt but now it's kind of like

01:18:29.199 --> 01:18:30.480
i don't know i think it's more focused

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:31.600
on just like keeping people in and

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:32.480
coming

01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:34.400
keeping the money wrong that's but it's

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:36.480
been forever yeah that's why it's on

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.880
currency because if you don't have like

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:41.040
if there's they put government figures

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:43.120
in god because if you don't believe in

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:44.719
currency it's you know it's no void they

01:18:44.719 --> 01:18:45.679
put like

01:18:45.679 --> 01:18:47.280
pictures of like r2 bunker on it people

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:49.040
like what the [ __ ] is this aren't you

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.840
yeah i don't exactly understand

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.520
the whole statement you made i'm sorry i

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.800
didn't but i i would just say i mean

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.719
there is a

01:18:58.719 --> 01:19:00.719
the church has always

01:19:00.719 --> 01:19:04.880
had money you would say okay and um

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:06.480
a lot less than most people think people

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:07.840
the argument is you know why doesn't the

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.120
church just sell

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.320
all their

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:12.000
treasures in the vatican and give it

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.679
give to the poor right i mean that's

01:19:13.679 --> 01:19:16.400
what jesus would do

01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:18.239
jesus also said i mean that that's the

01:19:18.239 --> 01:19:20.640
thing like at the at the uh at the

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:22.960
banquet

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.040
the catholic church is like yeah but

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:27.040
then jesus was like keep your [ __ ] i

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:28.159
don't know i mean there's there's a

01:19:28.159 --> 01:19:29.840
thought is sick

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:32.640
the church is also the largest landowner

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:34.480
landowner and the largest charitable

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.000
organization in the whole entire world

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
more so in the red cross we teach more

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.840
people have more orphanages more

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:42.239
hospitals and and give more money than

01:19:42.239 --> 01:19:44.080
anyone else in the world okay

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:45.840
um

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:47.520
that being said there is a certain

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.040
aspect of

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.440
i mean what the vatican has too is they

01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:52.239
have

01:19:52.239 --> 01:19:55.360
cultural treasures that are priceless

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.280
it's a museum basically and anyone can

01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.560
go and see those right you're not

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.560
restricted and people go there for

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:02.320
tourism because of the beauty so you

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:04.000
could say to a certain extent the church

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.080
has just collected history

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:08.960
and you can go see it right so does is

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:10.880
it in the best interest to sell

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:11.920
um

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:13.600
leonardo da vinci's

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.920
whatever he has manuscript or whatever

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:17.840
and and give that to somebody i mean

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:20.080
sure but at the same time you can ha

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:22.159
it's like like a custodian of it like if

01:20:22.159 --> 01:20:24.080
you sell somebody the sistine chapel

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:26.080
right like what's what's going on you

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:27.520
could sell donald trump the sistine

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:29.600
chapter and what would he do to it and

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:32.239
block it off and monetize it yeah or or

01:20:32.239 --> 01:20:33.920
change it or maybe so

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:35.280
what about just little like artifacts

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:36.640
and like pictures not the assistant

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:38.880
chapel but you know cut loose a couple i

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:40.800
don't know i mean i i don't know enough

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:42.960
i should they could probably

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.080
i don't know

01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:45.679
i don't know how much it's worth but you

01:20:45.679 --> 01:20:46.800
think you'll be able to sell some of it

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.080
and take that money and start a trust

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:51.120
fund and like maybe cure world hunger

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:53.120
maybe i mean like i don't know if you

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.400
have trillions how much money do you

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:55.120
have

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:57.040
i don't know i mean it's pr can you put

01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:58.400
a money can you put a price tag on the

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:00.960
sistine chapel i mean yeah i mean not

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:02.800
that that's like a big physical place

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:04.480
what about like uh i i don't know

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:06.719
original da vinci's i mean the church

01:21:06.719 --> 01:21:08.400
gives away a lot of cash yeah that's

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:09.840
right and more than anyone else in the

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:11.920
world yeah okay now i will say i mean

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:12.640
the

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:15.199
the scripture teaching that that always

01:21:15.199 --> 01:21:17.199
is brought up is christ is at a dinner

01:21:17.199 --> 01:21:19.840
and a a prostitute comes and is begging

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:22.000
him for mercy right he's at dinner and

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.360
all the the people there are like oh

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.800
what's this guy going to do you know

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:26.560
there's a problem get her out of here

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:27.760
and she starts

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:29.679
using she got she spent all our money

01:21:29.679 --> 01:21:31.440
and had this like really nice oil and

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.120
was crying and

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:35.440
put oil on his feet like a humility

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:37.199
thing and they said

01:21:37.199 --> 01:21:38.960
and judas was there and he was like man

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.800
that could have been used to feed feed

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:43.440
the poor and christ said

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:45.120
you'll always have the poor

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.080
you know

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:46.880
people

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:49.360
smoker dude don't be gay

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:53.280
oh my god god damn i hate judas

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:55.280
god you suck he's like yeah he's like

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:56.960
you're wrong again like you're always

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.800
gonna have the poor no matter what yeah

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:01.040
it's like so and church says you know we

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:02.960
have certain beauty for everyone to

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.159
experience so like that's why our

01:22:04.159 --> 01:22:06.159
churches things have nice

01:22:06.159 --> 01:22:07.600
uh they're supposed to be artistically

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.040
beautiful like you walk into a church

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.360
like my church uh it's traditional you

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:13.440
know it's you walk in it's not a regular

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:15.760
office building it's the smells are

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.120
different everything's different about

01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:18.880
it you walk into a different world and

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:21.040
that requires i mean but matt's matt's

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.880
got a very franciscan way of thinking

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:25.120
right yeah i'm a bit i'm a big fan dude

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:26.960
same thing francis said sell that sell

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.719
it dude right that's right francis would

01:22:28.719 --> 01:22:30.320
say no don't sell it he would have fed

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.239
the animals dude he loves animals

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:34.159
that's all the cartoon fed the wolf that

01:22:34.159 --> 01:22:35.760
terrorizes the village do you know

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:37.360
that's the same phrase as a story

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:40.400
there's a wolf he fed it hack a village

01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:42.800
saint francis he find wolf he bring wolf

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:46.480
back to city he says be nice to wolf now

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:48.960
now he is a saint we uh we used to watch

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:50.800
the cartoon things of the saints i

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.560
remember saying saint francis was a

01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:54.639
young playboy and he like got dizzy in

01:22:54.639 --> 01:22:56.159
the cartoon

01:22:56.159 --> 01:22:57.679
yeah

01:22:57.679 --> 01:22:58.800
yeah

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.880
[ __ ] he hit his head

01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:02.239
so what would saint francis say he would

01:23:02.239 --> 01:23:04.000
say there's a most likely there's a

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.320
certain way of living there's certain

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:07.520
there's all different ways to follow

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:08.960
christ

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:10.960
and that's why the church is encompassed

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:12.159
by all these different things so you can

01:23:12.159 --> 01:23:14.080
follow like saint francis where you live

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:16.560
pour and beg for food or you're you know

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:19.120
you teach in a university right and all

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.600
these different ways to do things um or

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:23.120
you run it run a hospital all these

01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:24.320
different things there's nothing wrong

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:25.920
with having money it's not an evil in

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:28.800
and of itself no um

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:30.400
saint francis i mean

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:32.639
he he himself gave away things but he

01:23:32.639 --> 01:23:34.719
understood that church needs material

01:23:34.719 --> 01:23:37.040
wealth the idea is that he if you want

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.719
to do that you go fall like saint

01:23:38.719 --> 01:23:40.719
francis you can do that right saint

01:23:40.719 --> 01:23:41.920
francis was not against selling

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:43.199
everything off in the church as a matter

01:23:43.199 --> 01:23:45.280
of fact he built up a church and put

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:48.480
nice things in it you know um so i know

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:49.840
there's there's different schools of

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:52.719
thought involved in how to be catholic

01:23:52.719 --> 01:23:54.320
that's all up to what you want it to be

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:55.920
for yourself and it and it encompasses

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:57.360
the whole thing it's very diverse in

01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:59.679
that way true it's very a lot of

01:23:59.679 --> 01:24:01.120
diversity how about this here's

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:02.719
something that i've been thinking of

01:24:02.719 --> 01:24:03.600
so

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:05.120
what does the catholic church say about

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:06.719
communism

01:24:06.719 --> 01:24:09.040
church is adamantly against communism oh

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.960
yeah because it doesn't like religion

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:13.120
usually yeah well communism in addition

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:14.080
to that

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:16.960
communism

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:18.159
so

01:24:18.159 --> 01:24:20.080
what it does is it restricts the human

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:22.080
person

01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:24.239
her the human person is not able to

01:24:24.239 --> 01:24:26.239
fulfill its potential under communism it

01:24:26.239 --> 01:24:27.280
would say

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:29.040
it's god-given nature

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.960
so the church is not

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:33.040
competition it restricts everything

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:35.920
about you yeah so so the church does not

01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:38.320
endorse capitalism

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:41.280
but it allows it it is a system where

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:42.800
you can be free

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:44.400
right you need to be able to

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:45.440
to live

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:48.080
okay and you have gifts talents into

01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:50.960
achievements and different things um

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:53.120
let alone the the way they look at the

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:56.000
human person as just a literally a cog

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.199
in a wheel i mean that's what you are

01:24:57.199 --> 01:24:59.520
yeah that's what you're seen as um and

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:02.239
not even getting into any of the uh

01:25:02.239 --> 01:25:04.080
you know corruption which is in every

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:06.239
government but including the catholic

01:25:06.239 --> 01:25:08.800
church yeah oh cal church has

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:11.280
high level corruption certainly um and

01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:13.040
there's that there's that sinful

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.560
tendency when you were in control of a

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:16.719
lot of stuff you know to do those things

01:25:16.719 --> 01:25:18.159
you know i hear you how about this one i

01:25:18.159 --> 01:25:19.679
got another question we talked about

01:25:19.679 --> 01:25:21.280
this a little bit uh

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:23.440
was because i i like pope francis a

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:25.440
little bit but we were talking about

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:27.520
he's not doing enough to

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:29.840
combat the pedophilia within the

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:31.040
catholic church there's a lot of

01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.840
critiques about pope francis for

01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:36.400
how he's seen in the media today

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:37.840
is

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.360
the best thing

01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:40.560
that's ever happened in the catholic

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:42.159
church

01:25:42.159 --> 01:25:44.560
as a as a roman catholic

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.560
you know i respect the pope i pray for

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.320
him and uh

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:50.239
you know the church would also say the

01:25:50.239 --> 01:25:52.400
holy father the higher rank you are the

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:54.560
more ch you you have to be on board you

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:55.760
have to be doing what you're supposed to

01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:58.080
do or things might not you might end up

01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.199
in hell so

01:25:59.199 --> 01:26:00.639
there's an old adage and i'll get back

01:26:00.639 --> 01:26:02.960
to pope francis in a minute but um

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:05.040
st john chrysostom i think in the fifth

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.679
century said the road of hell is paved

01:26:07.679 --> 01:26:09.600
with the skulls of priests and the

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:12.400
bishops are at signposts so the idea is

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:15.040
you know they're they're held a lot more

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.360
accountable than we are as as laypeople

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:18.639
you would say so

01:26:18.639 --> 01:26:19.920
really you gotta pray that's why we

01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:22.159
always pray for the pope we respect him

01:26:22.159 --> 01:26:23.440
and

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.320
want him to do well um

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.159
pope francis gets a critique for being

01:26:28.159 --> 01:26:30.719
so revolutionary one would say

01:26:30.719 --> 01:26:32.639
you know do this he speaks off the cuff

01:26:32.639 --> 01:26:34.960
he does all these things that maybe are

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:36.960
less restrictive than what's perceived

01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:39.360
in the past but a big critique is why

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.440
you got all those guys who are

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:43.199
who allowed all this all these all these

01:26:43.199 --> 01:26:45.120
issues yeah cardinal law they gave him a

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.520
funeral it's a big critique and the

01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:49.360
argument could be

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:51.360
you know certainly there

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:53.600
the church's politics certainly even

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:56.639
within uh within the church uh arguably

01:26:56.639 --> 01:26:58.000
might be worse than other places i don't

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
know but

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.600
there's there's political factions

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:03.120
involved in everything

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:05.040
and even that i think he might be

01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:06.880
hindered by

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:08.480
certain uh other political parties

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:09.760
within the church i think it's

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:12.159
completely wrong and if you think i mean

01:27:12.159 --> 01:27:13.760
my opinion of a priest who gets in

01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:15.199
trouble for touching i think it's the

01:27:15.199 --> 01:27:16.800
worst thing ever you should be punished

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:18.480
to the full extent of the law if not

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:21.040
worse right yeah uh it's the worst thing

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.320
that they could do one of the worst

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:24.320
jokes is so much so that when i hear

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:25.920
about a priest having an affair with a

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:27.760
woman it's like oh thank god yeah thank

01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:29.600
god it wasn't a boy you know you don't

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.120
ever hear i mean i mean i don't ever

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.199
hear about a priest having sex with a

01:27:33.199 --> 01:27:34.880
above age women no one even cares

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.800
doesn't matter whatever it's not a news

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:38.159
i mean that's the other thing like you

01:27:38.159 --> 01:27:40.719
want to look at people who are i mean

01:27:40.719 --> 01:27:43.199
i literally said

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:45.280
there's a there's an issue with

01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:47.199
underage sexual abuse yeah in our

01:27:47.199 --> 01:27:48.800
culture today you would say yeah the

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.239
church is just harvard and those guys

01:27:50.239 --> 01:27:51.440
could

01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:52.880
there was a safe space for them you

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:54.159
would say they could get away with it

01:27:54.159 --> 01:27:55.840
and different things and putting under

01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:57.520
the rug

01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:59.199
it's not the best thing yeah of course i

01:27:59.199 --> 01:28:00.719
mean i say my prayers every night that

01:28:00.719 --> 01:28:02.159
the priests get

01:28:02.159 --> 01:28:04.239
above age [ __ ]

01:28:04.239 --> 01:28:05.600
every night i'm like please let all the

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:08.239
fathers just get uh get one by good

01:28:08.239 --> 01:28:10.320
beach yeah just please man that dude i'm

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:11.440
telling you

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:13.199
that's a recipe for disaster dude it's

01:28:13.199 --> 01:28:15.840
like back when you were in like 1200 and

01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:18.159
there was only like 150 people or 2 000

01:28:18.159 --> 01:28:19.360
people you might have seen your whole

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.360
life it's a lot easier not to [ __ ]

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:22.480
around but dude

01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:23.760
there's a million people around

01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:25.600
philadelphia exactly a lot of stimulus

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:26.320
dude

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:28.000
and the church would say i mean the big

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.600
thing is it's not meant for everybody

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.280
number one that's why you go to seminary

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:32.560
you figure it out so so that was my

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.159
thing oh yeah why did you leave so you

01:28:34.159 --> 01:28:36.159
go to seminary that's the first question

01:28:36.159 --> 01:28:38.400
so you see you go to seminary and it's

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:40.080
to discern if that's what god wants for

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:43.840
you right and um

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:46.239
god if that is for you god will give you

01:28:46.239 --> 01:28:47.760
the grace

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:49.600
to be like to be like christ and be

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:50.960
celibate right it's not to say it's not

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:54.320
easy in fact it's it's harder

01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:57.920
i knew a year before i left that

01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:59.040
i

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:00.560
god was not asking me to be a priest i

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:01.760
think i believe

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:04.080
and um and my confessor my preacher i

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.520
went to confession to and talked to he's

01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:07.120
a good man

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:09.040
a jesuit priest said

01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:10.880
over st joe's he would say you know give

01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:12.560
it another year just to be sure and so i

01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:14.639
did it was a good advice he gave me and

01:29:14.639 --> 01:29:15.600
uh

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:17.120
and and now everything worked out quite

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:19.280
nicely and uh i'm very happy for the

01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:20.639
seminary and everything but but the

01:29:20.639 --> 01:29:22.239
bottom line is i just knew i knew i

01:29:22.239 --> 01:29:23.600
wasn't gonna be

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:25.120
i knew it wasn't for me you know in

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:27.280
prayer you know your practical aspect

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:28.800
you know it's just for you

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:30.800
and and there's all there's motivations

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:32.880
for some men to become priests there's

01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:35.120
always a motivation of there's a

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:37.679
comfortable lifestyle yeah right people

01:29:37.679 --> 01:29:39.120

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:40.320
provided for

01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:42.320
ideally so that you can go out and serve

01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:44.880
so you can go out and yeah and and work

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:47.440

yeah no server funeral you get like 10

01:29:54.239 --> 01:29:56.000
bucks the biggest fourth grade biggest

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
gift i ever i was ever offered was a

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.120
woman offered to buy me a brand new bmw

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:03.679
i wasn't even a priest yeah now granted

01:30:03.679 --> 01:30:05.440
when someone asks you oftentimes there's

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:07.600
a there's a reason yeah she probably

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:09.440
felt bad about something she did or she

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:12.000
was trying to or touch a penis or they

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.760
um or they expect something from me when

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.840
you're a priest okay you know

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:17.360
a lot of priests holding power for like

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:19.199
construction jobs and stuff fixing stuff

01:30:19.199 --> 01:30:21.040
up right or they agree like my daughter

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:22.080
wants to get married in the church but

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:23.760
she has this can you have any sweat some

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:25.360
things like that yeah she had no it's

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:27.840
it's it's to oh man she had a divorce

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:28.719
there's there's there's all these

01:30:28.719 --> 01:30:30.239
different things going on but

01:30:30.239 --> 01:30:32.719
anyway she's a jew

01:30:32.719 --> 01:30:34.880
take

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:42.960
as long as basically if you're a priest

01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:45.199
as long as you don't touch kids you can

01:30:45.199 --> 01:30:46.960
probably get away with a lot of [ __ ]

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:48.159
it's it's gotten to the point where

01:30:48.159 --> 01:30:50.239
you're like i remember my friends always

01:30:50.239 --> 01:30:52.480
saying he'd be like he'd be like uh you

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:55.280
know just don't harm the people of god

01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:57.600
don't harm your flock and today that's

01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.040
like a good standard did you guys

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:00.480
unfortunately where we're at you guys do

01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:03.040
like uh like mass practice did you guys

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:04.560
like see i didn't get to that point so

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:06.159
like the last couple years you do that

01:31:06.159 --> 01:31:07.280
did you what about the singing did you

01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:08.800
guys practice the singing oh you guys

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:11.440
probably just guys

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:14.400
guys guys are a lot of guys see a lot of

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:16.719
guys were musically inclined there not a

01:31:16.719 --> 01:31:18.320
lot not a lot of precise i've never

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:19.679
heard a pre-sing where i was like wow

01:31:19.679 --> 01:31:20.880
that guy should be on the voice yeah but

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:22.560
these are all like weird gay dudes that

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:23.600
would definitely inquire their whole

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:25.679
lives yeah but what happens to them as

01:31:25.679 --> 01:31:27.800
they get older

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:28.160
[Music]

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:30.080
[Laughter]

01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:31.199
happens is they get older though because

01:31:31.199 --> 01:31:32.560
every priest i've ever seen it's just

01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:34.880
total monotone i don't i don't know i

01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:36.960
mean

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:38.480
there's a lot of guys who are pretty

01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:40.159
good at they're smart in a lot of ways

01:31:40.159 --> 01:31:41.120
and

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:42.239
yeah

01:31:42.239 --> 01:31:43.280
now there were guys who were really

01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:45.199
athletic the guys who were like athletes

01:31:45.199 --> 01:31:46.320
were like

01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:48.080
biggest bros on our you know they were

01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:49.440
like those are the

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:51.360
there were some good guys uh some good

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:54.239
bros in there some good bros

01:31:54.239 --> 01:31:59.719
i don't think kids are high

01:32:08.719 --> 01:32:10.560
imagine like

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:12.400
if you were just up to no good

01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:13.920
leave it at whatever it was and then you

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:15.679
had to go stand in front of 200 people

01:32:15.679 --> 01:32:18.080
and like sing and talk about god i would

01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:19.600
break down that's the thing like even if

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.040
i was like jerking off the weird [ __ ]

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:22.080
the night before and they're like all

01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:24.080
right dude it's mass time yeah yeah

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.600
like even like even like public speaking

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.280
they do everything different now i mean

01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:28.239
uh

01:32:28.239 --> 01:32:30.320
they

01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:32.320
you're really critiqued on a lot of ways

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:33.840
yeah and it's a lot better than it was

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:35.520
even like 15 years ago like seminaries

01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:37.440
are really much much much better what

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:39.360
are they i mean as far as like homilies

01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:41.199
do they say like make it as long and

01:32:41.199 --> 01:32:43.199
excruciatingly as possible

01:32:43.199 --> 01:32:45.199
i was also told the opposite

01:32:45.199 --> 01:32:46.639
dude they're those they're [ __ ]

01:32:46.639 --> 01:32:48.400
that's the thing like you got to be in i

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:50.639
don't know

01:32:50.639 --> 01:32:52.320
i don't see a lot of spark when i went

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:53.679
to church my whole life and i go there

01:32:53.679 --> 01:32:54.880
and i'll touch you if you're in touch

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:56.639
you're not going to talk for half hour

01:32:56.639 --> 01:32:57.840
yeah i feel like a lot of people that

01:32:57.840 --> 01:32:59.760
become priests are very socially out of

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:02.000
touch and are just [ __ ] weird we had

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.520
yeah and it's like it's like here's my

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:04.800
time to shine

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:06.480
it's like here i'm going to get so bored

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:09.800
about them

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:13.679
share this podcast with your friends

01:33:13.679 --> 01:33:15.840
the priest who taught us homiletics uh

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:17.760
he's a good man review us on itunes he

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:20.880
was uh he would say five minutes or less

01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:22.560
five minutes yeah never mind because

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:24.639
think about it like you're gonna and hit

01:33:24.639 --> 01:33:27.199
one issue now that's a a way of of doing

01:33:27.199 --> 01:33:28.960
it that's one one aspect but he said

01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:30.800
like hit one thing you're talking about

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:33.040
one topic because if you talk for a half

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:34.159
hour about all the different things what

01:33:34.159 --> 01:33:35.440
are you gonna take away from it you

01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:36.480
don't even know and you're going to zone

01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:37.679
out you're not going to listen

01:33:37.679 --> 01:33:39.679
especially if you're boring so yeah

01:33:39.679 --> 01:33:41.920
that's um that's been my experience i've

01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:43.040
gone to church

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:44.800
since i was little and kind of stopped

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:46.560
after going to college and it was just

01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:48.239
like i would sit through homilies and

01:33:48.239 --> 01:33:50.239
just be like oh my god there was just

01:33:50.239 --> 01:33:52.320
sure and i go back now being older and

01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:54.080
it's like what the [ __ ] is this guy

01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:55.120
talking about i don't understand what

01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:56.159
they're talking about now but it's like

01:33:56.159 --> 01:33:58.000
good god this is boring yeah it's kind

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.159
of irrelevant yeah yeah because a lot of

01:34:00.159 --> 01:34:02.000
guys are out of touch with what the [ __ ]

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.679
humans are doing i would say if you hear

01:34:03.679 --> 01:34:06.560
a guy rh who who gives a homily

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:08.080
it'll be pretty good yeah i've never

01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:09.760
seen him yeah i won't see you i i would

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:11.679
say so yeah it was all the guys i know

01:34:11.679 --> 01:34:13.920
that now i mean i i i some give homilies

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:15.520
that's like man that was awesome did any

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:17.280
of them ever do like the uh like the

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:20.800
black preacher like and then jesus huh

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:23.040
he was weirdo that was hilarious one guy

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:25.280
from one guy from north carolina and the

01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:27.920
lord said i told jesus yeah but he was

01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:29.520
also the guy to tell us like he was

01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:32.560
offended by something

01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:41.800
[Laughter]

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:45.600
i don't know why that was the voice i

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:46.880
used but whatever

01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:47.920
um

01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:49.679
yeah i was i was excited for you to

01:34:49.679 --> 01:34:51.040
become a priest because you're a normal

01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:52.800
[ __ ] guy and to the listener you

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:54.400
probably sound like a [ __ ] guy i

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:56.000
sound like a psycho

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.520
i sound like dairy queen yeah we're

01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:59.520
talking to you about catholicism so

01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:01.120
anytime you talk religion with anybody

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:03.360
it's tough an actual religious person

01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:05.120
which you are and you sound like a

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:08.239
[ __ ] weirdo but one of the big

01:35:08.239 --> 01:35:09.360
and if you don't mind i gotta go after

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:11.440
this but um one of the big things the

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:13.679
tough things for me for leaving was uh

01:35:13.679 --> 01:35:15.760
i'm letting everyone down it was that

01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:17.840
thought like you know uh

01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:19.520
people people are rooting for you you

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:22.159
know even if they may have their sure

01:35:22.159 --> 01:35:24.239
preconceived of who i was and rightfully

01:35:24.239 --> 01:35:26.400
so i mean i i don't mind anyone who

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:28.000
doesn't think highly of me for for many

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.639
different reasons but um but it's like

01:35:30.639 --> 01:35:32.719
uh you know i and i was in there for

01:35:32.719 --> 01:35:35.199
long enough and and i knew what it

01:35:35.199 --> 01:35:36.239
i know

01:35:36.239 --> 01:35:38.639
i got a glimpse of what it was like

01:35:38.639 --> 01:35:40.400
to be a good priest

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:41.920
and like you want to strive for that you

01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:43.280
want to be like that

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:44.480
um

01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:46.800
and there are guys who just don't not

01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:48.080
say i would be the best priest because i

01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:49.520
wasn't meant to be a priest right so i

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:51.199
can't say it for sure but at the same

01:35:51.199 --> 01:35:52.800
time there's guys who are just like

01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:54.000
literally there just to go through the

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.480
motions just uh yeah just to free life

01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:58.560
eat nice dinners you know that would be

01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:00.320
so annoying though dude if you

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:02.159
so you were one of seven kids you said

01:36:02.159 --> 01:36:04.239
yes six six seconds i'm one of six kids

01:36:04.239 --> 01:36:06.880
two dude and i was my mom would [ __ ]

01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:08.480
bug the [ __ ] out of me if i was a priest

01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:10.880
it would be every day like my aunt

01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:12.400
yeah it would it would be i would my mom

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:13.679
would just be my best wait didn't you

01:36:13.679 --> 01:36:17.120
say my aunt was a nun or some [ __ ] i i

01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:18.719
think i've now

01:36:18.719 --> 01:36:20.800
yeah i think like i've uh

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:22.239
yeah what are you on the line so what do

01:36:22.239 --> 01:36:24.800
you have to do

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:26.639
what do you think about

01:36:26.639 --> 01:36:28.400
a system where like

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:30.880
the priests and nuns could freely have

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:32.080
sex and then just go about their

01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:33.040
business

01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:33.920
bad

01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:35.840
fine

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:36.639
it's worse

01:36:36.639 --> 01:36:38.320
it's pure like like they would they

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:40.000
would have like masquerade sex so like

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.280
they didn't know who each other they

01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:44.639
would do mixers they were the wolf masks

01:36:44.639 --> 01:36:46.000
i mean you could do that let them have

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.600
sex and then just they go back another

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:49.679
business it's it's they have like the in

01:36:49.679 --> 01:36:51.119
church tinder and they can just like

01:36:51.119 --> 01:36:52.560
match damn dude it's like the last thing

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:54.080
you should do it's so sick matt and

01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:55.840
shane's secret podcast is religious now

01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:58.159
i don't know it'd be awesome no it's i

01:36:58.159 --> 01:36:59.840
don't know you got to let them do hand

01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:01.360
stuff

01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:03.119
at the end of the day i think the church

01:37:03.119 --> 01:37:05.360
always does things

01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:07.440
in in teaching

01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:09.360
is always

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.760
it's always a positive not a negative so

01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:13.920
don't do this just because there's never

01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:17.760
a reason for that there's always a

01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:19.040
there's no like like yeah they're not

01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:20.320
just saying don't jerk off for no reason

01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:21.920
correct it's not just because it's bad

01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:23.920
well it's bad for these reasons yeah not

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:25.440
only is it bad for you but it's bad for

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:26.960
your spouse your family every

01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:28.719
relationship you have it's not weird i

01:37:28.719 --> 01:37:30.960
mean you can go on for days about that

01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:32.800
yeah okay

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:34.320
so if that makes sense that's why the

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:35.679
rules are the way they are do you think

01:37:35.679 --> 01:37:37.760
anyone ever really went through it and

01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:39.360
never came their whole life the whole

01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:41.440
time they were increased i know a guy

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:43.280
who's just like us

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:46.719
he's the best priest and

01:37:46.719 --> 01:37:48.080
i always thought it was amazing he was

01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:50.400
like yeah i never i dated like one girl

01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:54.880
completely normal tremendous um

01:37:57.199 --> 01:38:00.719
i was gonna say football baseball player

01:38:00.719 --> 01:38:02.880
he's a man and he never he never did any

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:04.719
of that stuff he never came

01:38:04.719 --> 01:38:06.400
he's never here isn't that bad for you

01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:08.560
physically or probably no it's actually

01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:10.320
he's not in your sleep dude i've never

01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:11.440
had a wet dream dude that's how much

01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:13.199
i've jerked off in my life

01:38:13.199 --> 01:38:14.800
i think i had a couple

01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:17.760
your dad had a couple of my dad

01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:19.840
launched one so there's no there's no

01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:22.080
bad physical like my torso hurts if i

01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:23.360
don't come forward i mean you could say

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:24.960
that the people who live the longest

01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:26.880
like you look at nuns yeah i mean

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:28.800
they're they're like 100 when they die

01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:30.000
yeah because they're incubated though

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.840
they don't have any stress of life it

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:33.119
doesn't have to do with them not getting

01:38:33.119 --> 01:38:34.239
i don't know i think a lot of them

01:38:34.239 --> 01:38:35.920
they're like are around poor people all

01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:37.280
the time dude i used to go to the nun

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:38.560
house for my grade school and you just

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:39.920
sit there and drink cranberry juice and

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:41.119
they rock and rocking chairs they're

01:38:41.119 --> 01:38:43.600
[ __ ] chilling trust me some

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:44.880
i don't think the life of a nun is

01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:47.199
stressful

01:38:47.199 --> 01:38:49.199
sisters of the there was a bunch around

01:38:49.199 --> 01:38:50.880
ardmore yeah

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:52.080
that would always get their car fixed

01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:55.199
where i'm at okay sisters like the jesus

01:38:55.199 --> 01:38:57.840
christ child jesus maybe maybe from they

01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:00.480
run rosemont and they did a lot of like

01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:02.080
their whole thing was just helping poor

01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:03.600
people like every single day yeah but

01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:05.600
that's some people do that that's so

01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:07.440
they had a job which they probably did

01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:08.719
you know then but then there's people

01:39:08.719 --> 01:39:10.400
job and then family

01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:12.239
yeah and then stress of bills and money

01:39:12.239 --> 01:39:14.400
so their stress is a fraction of i think

01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:15.760
i mean there is a certain aspect where

01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:17.840
their material needs are taken care of

01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:20.400
sure but at the same time it's like

01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:21.840
you know mother teresa for instance i

01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:23.920
mean her whole thing was to take

01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:25.920
people in the caste system in india and

01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:27.280
bathe them and clean them and let them

01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:29.119
die with dignity you know what i mean

01:39:29.119 --> 01:39:30.080
also

01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:32.880
think about the stress of also believing

01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:35.520
believing that there's a [ __ ] hell

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:36.880
like there's people who do that and have

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:38.960
families and jobs think about the 100

01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:40.320
like those old ladies in those rocking

01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:42.239
chairs are like oh my god

01:39:42.239 --> 01:39:43.760
there's a crazy shirt on there all day

01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:44.639
they're just like i've been in my

01:39:44.639 --> 01:39:46.400
rocking chair i've never flicked i agree

01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:48.000
with you yeah i just think their stress

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.880
is minimal so they're back to the coming

01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:51.760
yeah

01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:53.199
that's you're saying nuns are a bad

01:39:53.199 --> 01:39:54.480
example because they don't have stress

01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:56.719
yeah nonetheless

01:39:56.719 --> 01:39:58.800
i'm talking about the dudes yeah yeah

01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:00.880
so holding in your [ __ ]

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:03.280
all right priests of long lives

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:05.520
most most of the time because of the

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:06.960
strength and discipline from holding in

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:08.560
your [ __ ] i would say i would say thank

01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:10.239
you i mean i'm all about nothing doesn't

01:40:10.239 --> 01:40:11.520
feel good i would argue from a practical

01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:13.199
standpoint the

01:40:13.199 --> 01:40:15.040
the lifestyle of a nun

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:17.360
and a priest is

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:19.199
nicer overall you're not in risky

01:40:19.199 --> 01:40:20.719
behavior you're not doing dumb stuff

01:40:20.719 --> 01:40:23.119
you're not yeah you're not a mess

01:40:23.119 --> 01:40:25.040
in any way like odds are you know what i

01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:27.040
mean yeah the normal aspect you know you

01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:28.639
lived a good life you

01:40:28.639 --> 01:40:30.239
you know you're not

01:40:30.239 --> 01:40:31.920
drinking your face off you're not eating

01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:33.520
you know if you live a normal life

01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:35.199
that's what it provides you you know

01:40:35.199 --> 01:40:37.199
yeah i guess i'm kind of alienated too

01:40:37.199 --> 01:40:38.080
though

01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:39.600
what's the thing i would say no i mean a

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:41.440
priest i mean here's the confessions of

01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:43.600
many people me as close you're meant to

01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:44.960
have friendships and relationships i

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:46.639
mean that's again they call you mother

01:40:46.639 --> 01:40:47.840
and father yeah they were always i

01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:50.080
always saw them out constantly doing

01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:51.840
[ __ ] which which i was i don't know

01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:53.840
there was a weird uh

01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:55.440
deacon that was around us that i was

01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:58.159
pretty sure he was pretty pretty gay

01:40:58.159 --> 01:40:59.679
he's not around anymore he's not around

01:40:59.679 --> 01:41:01.280
he came out nice

01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:02.880
yeah yeah you can tell him

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:04.320
and

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:06.639
and he had issues with the church and

01:41:06.639 --> 01:41:08.880
like he couldn't do what he wanted to do

01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:11.440
being who he was yeah yeah what does the

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:13.679
church i know we're [ __ ] wrong

01:41:13.679 --> 01:41:16.159
what about a nature verse nurture

01:41:16.159 --> 01:41:18.960
when it comes to being gay good question

01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:21.600
there i think the way it goes is

01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:25.040
there are certain people who are

01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:26.880
presuppositions to that like you may

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:28.480
have um

01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:30.239
whatever genetics you might have you

01:41:30.239 --> 01:41:32.480
might have some kind of um like you're

01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:34.480
less inclined to be athletic or whatever

01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:36.400
you want it whatever you want to call it

01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:39.280
i think nurture

01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:40.880
i don't know maybe you know gay guys

01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:42.800
have bigger dicks than hetero guys i

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:45.040
didn't know that yeah it's true

01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:46.639
no it's not on average they got an inch

01:41:46.639 --> 01:41:48.000
on them i don't know well then i must be

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.320
gay because my dick is huge hey

01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:52.080
you're running a risk

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:53.920
i would just say nurture is a i'd say

01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:56.400
nurture is a big part of it i would say

01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:58.639
and and some people may

01:41:58.639 --> 01:41:59.840
may have a study out there that says

01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:01.440
well it's because of society but i would

01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:02.239
say

01:42:02.239 --> 01:42:04.239
if you're a homosexual odds are you're

01:42:04.239 --> 01:42:05.840
you're statistically

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:07.920
going to have more issues in your life

01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:10.560
you know other problems going on

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:11.600
yeah

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:13.440
like your your risk for drug abuse all

01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:16.159
that stuff is like promiscuity is high

01:42:16.159 --> 01:42:17.840
it's through the roof i mean you could

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:18.960
and you could argue all those different

01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:21.280
things away but i mean that's

01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:24.719
i i would say your life may be

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:26.320
is it there's something that you're

01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:29.320
wrong

01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:39.040
i don't know i i think there's something

01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:40.719
lacking i would say it's a tough life

01:42:40.719 --> 01:42:42.560
man

01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:44.080
and again the church is you know but how

01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:46.000
about all that suffering they go through

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.679
very much that would be that would be

01:42:47.679 --> 01:42:49.280
perceived in the eyes of god as

01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:52.239
something beautiful

01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:56.639
i think there's a group and this might

01:42:56.639 --> 01:43:00.080
sound crazy there's a group of

01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:03.119
like for men who are gay trying to not

01:43:03.119 --> 01:43:04.320
have

01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:06.320
practice homosexuality yeah in the

01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:09.320
church

01:43:13.199 --> 01:43:14.560
it does suck to sit here and [ __ ] on

01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:15.920
catholicism because all the other

01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:17.360
religions are [ __ ] gay and it's funny

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:18.880
because i hate atheists they [ __ ]

01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:20.960
piss me off dude but it's so fun to make

01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:22.639
fun of the church

01:43:22.639 --> 01:43:23.760
the church has done the most for the

01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:25.040
world i would yeah i mean the whole the

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:26.480
whole that's one thing that kills about

01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:28.159
atheists is when they're like

01:43:28.159 --> 01:43:29.600
they're like we could just not have

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:31.040
religion and still be good and treat

01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:32.320
people with respect and you know love

01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:33.679
people like your neighbor yeah you got

01:43:33.679 --> 01:43:35.840
that from religion yeah also the places

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:38.320
that don't have religion the governments

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:41.119
it's called north korea communist russia

01:43:41.119 --> 01:43:44.000
yeah i mean yeah communist china yeah

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:47.460
the worst places on in the worst choice

01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:50.560
[Laughter]

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:51.920
the yeah and that's one thing that

01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:53.920
always that's true atheistic cultures

01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:55.600
are called communists i hate when uh

01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:58.159
what about nature

01:44:00.639 --> 01:44:02.639
i hate when catholics get lumped in with

01:44:02.639 --> 01:44:05.360
like uh the protestants that are like

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:07.040
building those

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:10.800
dinosaur museums and like mega churches

01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:13.040
and like uh abortion clinic bombings and

01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:15.040
like [ __ ] like that i mean when they're

01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:16.880
like christianity it's like dude all we

01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:18.719
do is [ __ ] kids that's our only bad

01:44:18.719 --> 01:44:20.880
friend that's true we haven't [ __ ] up

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:22.960
in a while ever since the pope was cool

01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:24.719
with the holocaust

01:44:24.719 --> 01:44:26.400
we've been we've been cheering yeah it's

01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:28.880
been good exactly yeah the

01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:30.800
kids were cool with the holocaust that's

01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:33.119
it i mean in terms of two strikes a

01:44:33.119 --> 01:44:35.600
belgian priest came up with the uh

01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:38.000
big bang theory i mean i was a belgian

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.280
jesuit priest

01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:42.560
uh he [ __ ] up

01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:44.000
he probably like finished a math

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.960
equation and was like whoops

01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:54.880
well up until lately

01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:56.560
has come from the catholic church right

01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:58.480
and the argument is the church stunted

01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:00.719
it was until the renaissance where

01:45:00.719 --> 01:45:02.239
learning was flourishing it's like yeah

01:45:02.239 --> 01:45:03.760
the roman empire ended and barbarians

01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:05.440
took over i mean who

01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:06.960
the church is the one monastery is the

01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:08.400
one that like hey we gotta save

01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:09.760
civilization you gotta write everything

01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:12.000
down and keep records just like starting

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.400
like the muslims in baghdad

01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:16.639
right or where was it where they saved

01:45:16.639 --> 01:45:18.639
all that [ __ ]

01:45:18.639 --> 01:45:23.040
palmyra i don't know palmyra new jersey

01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:26.480
palmyra cougars oh yeah right maybe the

01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:28.320
panthers panthers yeah

01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:30.000
the church is chill the church is nice i

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.080
mean i mean you could say um i mean we

01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:34.320
have western ideals because that comes

01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:35.920
from the church very true i think the

01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:38.000
church is well ideal so liberty all

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.679
those things that we that we have in

01:45:39.679 --> 01:45:41.600
this country ideas

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:43.679
um

01:45:43.679 --> 01:45:44.880
originally comes from the church here's

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:46.400
my question do you think at some point

01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:48.480
we'll be able to like know those ideals

01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:49.760
so well we can be like all right we can

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:52.080
stop giving like 10 of our money to the

01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:53.440
church and just like chill out on this

01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:54.880
whole thing

01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:56.320
i mean that's what i think the church's

01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:58.639
main goal is to

01:45:58.639 --> 01:46:00.960
save souls and everything else is has

01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:02.800
been secondary towards that

01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:06.239
it's so so for instance you get a um

01:46:06.239 --> 01:46:08.320
martin de poise or or

01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:10.320
a saint saint damian a molokai he went

01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:12.639
just went and lived with the lepers in

01:46:12.639 --> 01:46:14.560
in hawaii and then died of leprosy he

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:16.400
went and lived to the leper colony

01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:18.080
and uh kind of had that one coming i

01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:19.600
mean what did he yeah exactly he knew he

01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:21.119
knew what the deal was so yeah i mean

01:46:21.119 --> 01:46:23.199
his first goal was to

01:46:23.199 --> 01:46:25.440
save their souls and then in addition to

01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:27.679
help them in any way no doubt so so

01:46:27.679 --> 01:46:29.840
there's certainly that aspect so that

01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:31.440
that that's their number one business

01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:33.040
you would say everything else is the

01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:34.239
culture and everything that comes along

01:46:34.239 --> 01:46:36.080
with my thing is if the money's rolling

01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:37.600
in so in the 1600s they're like if

01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:39.040
you're gay you go to hell [ __ ] off

01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:40.159
everyone's like [ __ ] yeah and they're

01:46:40.159 --> 01:46:41.520
like nice and then like now that they

01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:43.440
get backlash you're like

01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:44.960
[ __ ] i'm seeing less people sitting in

01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:46.719
these seats they're like uh nah it's

01:46:46.719 --> 01:46:47.840
chill

01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:49.520
no it's going back baby i can tell you

01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:51.040
what maybe that 10

01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:53.760
the church is the one is like the last

01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:55.760
institution that's never given in the

01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:58.239
one that matters yeah yeah

01:46:58.239 --> 01:47:00.880
unofficially we've never given in

01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:02.159
to any

01:47:02.159 --> 01:47:04.400
of the modern ideals that are today so

01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:06.080
they're they're not giving in on

01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:07.360
and people may say different things why

01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:09.199
i heard a priest say this i mean that

01:47:09.199 --> 01:47:10.960
pope francis is very much against gay

01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:14.239
marriage um abortion all those things

01:47:14.239 --> 01:47:16.560
people think he might like he's hardly

01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:18.159
he doesn't like it but he doesn't he's

01:47:18.159 --> 01:47:20.639
not as hard against it

01:47:20.639 --> 01:47:22.239
you could drum up in his past where

01:47:22.239 --> 01:47:23.840
where he was a cardinal and bishop and

01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:25.520
he was pretty tough

01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:28.320
um i mean you could say i mean

01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:29.679
that's the thing we're not gonna we're

01:47:29.679 --> 01:47:31.840
not gonna flinch on those matters yeah

01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:33.199
and there may be speculation there

01:47:33.199 --> 01:47:34.639
always is you know you read a news

01:47:34.639 --> 01:47:36.000
article from god knows where i don't

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.600
know but it's not going to happen so i

01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:39.520
would say in response to what you said

01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:41.280
about like how the church is like ah

01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:42.560
less people are coming maybe gay

01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:44.800
marriage or yeah pope francis is like

01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:47.840
who am i to judge about people but

01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:50.159
i think that comes with the church

01:47:50.159 --> 01:47:52.159
actually evolving

01:47:52.159 --> 01:47:53.679
now you can look at it i think it's pr

01:47:53.679 --> 01:47:55.440
from a yeah yeah you can look at it from

01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:57.679
a cynical perspective of like well they

01:47:57.679 --> 01:47:58.880
just need more money so they're just

01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:00.159
saying that they don't believe that

01:48:00.159 --> 01:48:02.480
right but i do think

01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:04.560
i think the main goal of the church

01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:06.000
is to probably try to figure out the

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.440
truth of a good life and if the people

01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:10.960
are saying

01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:12.800
hey this is wrong

01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:14.560
i think it would be in their best

01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:15.920
interest if they're looking for the

01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:16.800
truth

01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:18.639
to listen

01:48:18.639 --> 01:48:20.480
the shadows are dancing across your face

01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:23.840
it gives you like a masquerade of it

01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:25.040
well you just ruined the [ __ ]

01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:27.040
sickness

01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:28.400
i think that's a very

01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:29.679
very good that's true i don't think the

01:48:29.679 --> 01:48:31.520
church is

01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:33.040
i don't know i don't look like i've seen

01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:34.239
their i've seen their twitter things

01:48:34.239 --> 01:48:36.239
where i'm like this is active pr on like

01:48:36.239 --> 01:48:37.679
just like any other company they

01:48:37.679 --> 01:48:38.800
definitely do that to me it's all the

01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:40.960
same it's all the big money right there

01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:42.560
the church to me it's the same thing

01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:44.800
there definitely is an aspect of

01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:47.040
selling the church and or or you would

01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:47.840
say

01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:50.080
getting on social media is one thing the

01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:52.159
pope oh get on social media and you can

01:48:52.159 --> 01:48:53.679
reach these followers sure i mean

01:48:53.679 --> 01:48:55.520
there's that aspect to it where you

01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:57.760
could say oh he's just trying to

01:48:57.760 --> 01:48:59.440
get more followers i mean technically

01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:00.400
yeah yeah i guess you could how many

01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:02.159
followers does he have

01:49:02.159 --> 01:49:03.920
million or something nice

01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:05.440
way more than that

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:06.480
i'll give you this example so the

01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:08.080
episcopalian church in america i think

01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:09.440
aziz has that

01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:12.159
shadow disease

01:49:12.159 --> 01:49:14.000
um

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.480
i think another disconnect comes from

01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:19.040
the church's business is saving souls

01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:20.800
well if you're a person that's like

01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:23.119
uh i don't know how real souls are or

01:49:23.119 --> 01:49:25.520
what we're saving from yeah so then

01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:27.360
you're like well they must know that

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:29.440
they must because like inherently i kind

01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:31.760
of sometimes believe like

01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:33.040
the [ __ ] you guys talking about heaven

01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:34.400
and hell right why don't you chill with

01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:35.520
that you're clearly just trying to make

01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:36.400
money

01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:37.760
but i guess if you look from a

01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:38.960
perspective of somebody that really

01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:40.800
believes having a now maybe they

01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:42.639
actually are trying to like i don't know

01:49:42.639 --> 01:49:44.159
like because i i think it's like wait

01:49:44.159 --> 01:49:45.920
you guys are adults yeah yeah what are

01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:47.440
we talking about here so i believe in

01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:49.199
souls i've seen my soul before it's like

01:49:49.199 --> 01:49:50.880
gillis it's like look at these quarters

01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:52.560
in japan like they went there for a

01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:55.199
reason i step on your jesus

01:49:55.199 --> 01:49:56.639
yeah yeah but isn't there some guy

01:49:56.639 --> 01:49:58.239
behind it all being like yeah yeah yeah

01:49:58.239 --> 01:49:59.760
you guys go over there good luck we can

01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:01.280
get 10 of their money yeah it's like

01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:02.800
yeah good luck go ahead they were

01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:04.239
involved heavily in trade routes those

01:50:04.239 --> 01:50:05.920
jesuits in japan

01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:07.840
they were intermingling in political

01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:08.960
business those are the [ __ ]

01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:10.639
protestant dutch that eventually broke

01:50:10.639 --> 01:50:12.239
in there was it really it was the dutch

01:50:12.239 --> 01:50:14.000
the protestants we got to reread shogun

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.119
because i remember the priests were over

01:50:15.119 --> 01:50:16.639
there causing a ruckus i think the

01:50:16.639 --> 01:50:18.239
priests were like hey open your [ __ ]

01:50:18.239 --> 01:50:23.159
ports so we can get some biblies in here

01:50:25.530 --> 01:50:29.119
[Laughter]

01:50:29.119 --> 01:50:30.400
but we didn't get enough biblies in

01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:31.600
there and that's how pearl harbor

01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:32.960
happened that's true and then they ended

01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:35.760
up finding god in the form of two

01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:38.480
sun bombs yeah

01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:41.440
japan was always always very atheistic

01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:44.400
in world war ii time it was very uh

01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:46.320
very much a uh

01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:47.679
i don't know they had that those

01:50:47.679 --> 01:50:49.040
tendencies i guess basically they didn't

01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:50.960
have judeo-christian ethics therefore

01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:52.880
you were you treated people terrible

01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:54.880
people's heads off yeah in fact the

01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:58.719
nazis how they treated war cr um

01:50:58.719 --> 01:51:00.080
prisoners of war

01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:01.679
was a million times better than how the

01:51:01.679 --> 01:51:03.840
japanese the way they treated it

01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:06.880
dude no it's not

01:51:08.719 --> 01:51:10.400
yeah like definitely not eastern

01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:11.760
prisoners because they treated those

01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:13.920
rooskies yeah and the russian germans

01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:16.239
would make up 80 of their prisoners

01:51:16.239 --> 01:51:18.080
correct you would say that's fine that's

01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:18.960
fair

01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:20.639
and they hated each other yeah it's you

01:51:20.639 --> 01:51:22.159
know for for many different reasons

01:51:22.159 --> 01:51:23.840
christian values were not on the eastern

01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:25.679
front correct you could say that you you

01:51:25.679 --> 01:51:27.119
could say that so there's an argument to

01:51:27.119 --> 01:51:29.280
be set for that let's say yeah so anyway

01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:31.280
we we can talk all day about this yes

01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:32.320
because

01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:34.800
being catholic rocks true guys quit

01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:36.239
[ __ ] coming

01:51:36.239 --> 01:51:38.800
could you do me a kindness

01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:40.000
could you knock off the comments that

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.920
was a great cast dude that was fun yeah

01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:43.920
i think i'm just i'm just afraid i'm not

01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:45.440
funny so it's it doesn't matter that

01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:47.440
wasn't meant to be that funny it was

01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:49.840
nice that was a nice uh we got some

01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:52.400
shitty atheist listeners we got some uh

01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:54.400
got a lot of southerners yup probably

01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:56.400
all of their dumb protestant views i

01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:57.679
don't even i don't think i've even met a

01:51:57.679 --> 01:51:58.960
protestant

01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:01.679
six sixes protestant what yeah anybody

01:52:01.679 --> 01:52:03.040
that's christian that's not catholic is

01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:04.560
protestant so basically if you ask i

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:06.320
assume everyone's catholic

01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:08.000
nobody's catholic i just i'm like

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.920
everyone's catholic or jewish dude a lot

01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:10.560
of

01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:12.400
a lot of road hacks will ask because a

01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:14.000
lot of them are like [ __ ] whops yeah

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.440
like up here in this region a lot of

01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:16.960
them are [ __ ] whopped from new york

01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:18.239
and jersey and they'll be like where are

01:52:18.239 --> 01:52:20.960
my catholics at in the comedy yeah i've

01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:22.000
heard that really yeah because then they

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:23.920
do catholic church jokes

01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:25.119
but then whenever they ask who's

01:52:25.119 --> 01:52:27.119
catholic like maybe a third of the room

01:52:27.119 --> 01:52:28.560
will clap

01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:30.239
like not many people are catholic i just

01:52:30.239 --> 01:52:31.440
figured people just were like i'm not

01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:32.560
clapping

01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:33.920
no it's it's usually because there's a

01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:35.599
ton of protestants

01:52:35.599 --> 01:52:36.960
i didn't think i knew any process every

01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:39.040
colony was protestant the forefathers

01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:40.320

i wanted to ask some more personal stuff

01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:32.159

01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:07.840

01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:18.080
interview because it's like not a lot of

01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:20.080
people know people who either were a

01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:22.080
priest or a priest you know what i mean

01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:23.520
yeah we [ __ ] up we should have asked

01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:24.800
him more about

01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:27.280
experiences he had personally with

01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:29.199
pedophilia like when he was around it he

01:59:29.199 --> 01:59:30.080
was just saying there's a bunch of

01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:31.840
[ __ ] there i've talked i like how he

01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:33.280
dressed up the language there's guys you

01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:34.320
could tell that you know they're just

01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:36.400
kind of like soft the badass spores

01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:37.840
yeah yeah yeah it's like you mean gay

01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:39.760
dudes clearly yeah well when when we

01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:41.679
were off the mic and i'm talking to him

01:59:41.679 --> 01:59:43.040
like i was just i got [ __ ] up at his

01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:44.800
house on friday yeah just drinking

01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:47.040
whiskey and eating sake it was [ __ ]

01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:48.719
sick and we sat there and we were like

01:59:48.719 --> 01:59:50.940
[ __ ] gay people [ __ ] [ __ ] up

01:59:50.940 --> 01:59:52.080
[Laughter]

01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:53.760
but i do ask him about that and he's

01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:55.920
like yeah they were [ __ ] gay like you

01:59:55.920 --> 01:59:57.360
get in there i mean you're surrounded by

01:59:57.360 --> 01:59:58.719
imagine going to the seminary and being

01:59:58.719 --> 02:00:00.239
surrounded by like

02:00:00.239 --> 02:00:02.080
first off dudes who want to be [ __ ]

02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:03.119
priests

02:00:03.119 --> 02:00:05.119
yeah that's a weird group yeah that's

02:00:05.119 --> 02:00:06.480
why it was crazy when he got into it

02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:07.920
well plus if you want to establish

02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:09.520
discipline dude it's tough to have like

02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:11.199
if you have in the hallways everyone's

02:00:11.199 --> 02:00:12.800
[ __ ] each other it's like

02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:14.400
it's tough i get that i get that part of

02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:15.440
the church i don't think people were

02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:17.360
[ __ ] each other as much in the

02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:19.440
seminary but it was just like

02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:20.880
but they could have

02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:22.480
i think they were they were looking out

02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:23.520
for if they didn't ask those

02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:25.119
pre-screening questions like how much do

02:00:25.119 --> 02:00:27.119
you love dicks like if a dick popped

02:00:27.119 --> 02:00:29.920
into a room what would you do

02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:33.760
slap it away like say francies

02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:35.679
that is a wild life dude but when you

02:00:35.679 --> 02:00:37.280
hear him talk about [ __ ] like the saint

02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:39.440
nicholas story and like dude all the

02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:41.599
weird [ __ ] that we do it's it's always

02:00:41.599 --> 02:00:43.040
weird to me to hear him talk about stuff

02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:43.920
like that

02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:45.840
where it's like practices we do every

02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:47.840
single day yeah that we don't even

02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:49.679
[ __ ] know why we're doing it and it's

02:00:49.679 --> 02:00:51.520
all because a long time ago the catholic

02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:52.960
church was like

02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:54.719
this is what you do now that's the same

02:00:54.719 --> 02:00:56.080
with passing down names a lot of them

02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:58.000
are pagan rituals too yeah passing down

02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.119
of names they used to believe that your

02:00:59.119 --> 02:01:00.560
soul inhabits your name so you take like

02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:02.000
your dad's name and then like he lives

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:03.840
forever i mean and i see where they're

02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:05.280
saying that that makes sense it's

02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:07.440
totally chill because your name people

02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:09.119
keep saying your name and you live on

02:01:09.119 --> 02:01:11.040
through that like i mean at all anyway

02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:12.080
um

02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:14.159
saint nicholas is gonna get your sister

02:01:14.159 --> 02:01:16.000
will release your sister from a sex

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.320
slave dude that's [ __ ] crazy yeah

02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:21.199
there's a there's a ton that he uh

02:01:21.199 --> 02:01:23.119
yeah it was it's it was crazy to hear

02:01:23.119 --> 02:01:24.960
him join that he was he played middle

02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:27.360
linebacker for us he was [ __ ] sick he

02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:28.960
hit like a [ __ ] and he [ __ ]

02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:31.679
bet he dude's a [ __ ] girthy boy

02:01:31.679 --> 02:01:33.840
he was like mean to people he's like a

02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:35.760
[ __ ] out there dude

02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:38.320
but uh he's probably bulldogging dudes

02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:39.920
he wasn't he's he's thicker now than he

02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:41.440
used to be he used to be just [ __ ]

02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:42.800
