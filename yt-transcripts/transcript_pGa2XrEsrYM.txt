slow them down with his hands and

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.199
people probably worked every once in a

00:14:35.199 --> 00:14:37.120
while i mean dude it stopped every once

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.760

00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:47.120
stopping us

the paper boy no that was he came to my

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.800
brother's uh

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.320
my brother's wedding i think actually we

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.839
had a little party at my parents house

00:15:07.839 --> 00:15:10.000
and he like came out he was like i have

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.360
an objection russian

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.839

00:15:13.839 --> 00:15:15.519
foot he's like hold up he was crushing

00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:16.959
beers and then my brother was like you

00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:18.160
have to get him the [ __ ] he started

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.760
wilding out too he was at a wedding he

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.959
came to my brother's wedding yeah my

00:15:20.959 --> 00:15:22.560
brother had him come out to like the

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.120
after party at my parents house and uh

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.000
at your parents house

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.680
why did he invite a homeless because

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.880
omar was just like he was like his right

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.000
hand he would always hang in the shop

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.279
with him when he wasn't drinking he was

00:15:31.279 --> 00:15:31.839
great

00:15:31.839 --> 00:15:33.120
but then when he started what did he do

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.199
with the party he just started talking

00:15:35.199 --> 00:15:36.720
[ __ ] to people like being a [ __ ]

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.399
so then i had to take him out honestly

00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:40.160
i mean yeah dude he was he when he

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.199
talked to him it was weird because he

00:15:41.199 --> 00:15:42.160
was like

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.000
he claimed that he was like a doctor in

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.440
morocco somebody like

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.360
he probably was he knew i know he like

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.800
dude and he wasn't drinking he would

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.839
tell you [ __ ] and he was like damn

00:15:49.839 --> 00:15:50.880
that's [ __ ] crazy

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.480
he also if he saw an asian person he

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.839
would go i'm on to you because he had

00:15:53.839 --> 00:15:55.040
like theories about what they were

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:55.680
really up to

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.839
what are they really up to he he had

00:15:57.839 --> 00:15:59.040
some uh he was

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.639
he was making this is omar's words he

00:16:00.639 --> 00:16:01.680
was making i just told you what they

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.800
were true

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.079
no good join the patreon he had made uh

00:16:06.079 --> 00:16:08.079
an extraterrestrial connection so he was

00:16:08.079 --> 00:16:10.240
like hitting them with like

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.000
theories on like earth versus like

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
planets and [ __ ] wait he thought asians

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.040
he was on that tip but he would sit

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.240
there and he would talk about it

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.800
like in depth that was weird he like but

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.759
he uh

00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:25.360
yeah so i took him home medicine's a

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.720
little bit different yeah

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.120
yeah that was like one-on-one yeah well

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.320
here's the deal

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.360
none of this works on it

00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:40.079
but yeah so he uh i took him home and

00:16:40.079 --> 00:16:41.519
then him and brittany argued of course

00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:42.480
the whole way home

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.720
and then brittany threatened to stab him

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.240
and then he tried to get out of my car

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.199
on 95

00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:48.880
and i was like dude you got to make it

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.720

and then brittany would say something

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.520
he'd be like yeah right

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.559

the world his battle bot revelation made

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.520

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.120
just being like dude they got 250 bots

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.799
in the tournament dude it's a big

00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:52.320
tournament this is a big dance

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.720
he's like dude he was like talking he's

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.240
like described i thought i thought

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.160
when i was young i was like battlebots

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.600
is gonna be the coolest [ __ ] thing

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.000
i've ever

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
even imagined and it sucked i thought it

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.600
was awesome that about sucked the best

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.880
move you could do is a

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.559
thing with like a ramp that was the best

00:18:06.559 --> 00:18:08.160
there was the drill there was the boar

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.679
one of them had a ramp that just flipped

00:18:09.679 --> 00:18:12.000
the other one over and it was like

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.760
one of them was literally a wedge in

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.200
fact that was probably its name was

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.559
wedge actually yeah

00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:18.559
and it was the most unstoppable there

00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:20.240
was the board the board was pretty good

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.520
the one that would just drill a hole in

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:21.919
you

00:18:21.919 --> 00:18:23.760
i don't even think they were drills

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.360
connected to remote control cars so

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.559
there was nothing like

00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:28.799
it was against steel the car would just

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:30.320
stop the metal bit

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.400
no i mean the there wasn't the wheels

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.080
there wasn't enough pressure

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.280
none of the weapons were there was like

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.799
one with like a blow torch for some

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:37.440
reason

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.000
yeah a flamethrower that did absolutely

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.640
nothing

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.160
the wedge just flipped them what are you

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.919
laughing at you like wedge because dude

00:18:43.919 --> 00:18:45.440
i [ __ ] love battlebots they hit the

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.720
one with the big slayer

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.840

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.200

right now thursdays dude holy [ __ ] but

00:18:55.919 --> 00:18:57.600
the wedge beats the hammer every wedge

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.240
is the best

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.600
the wedge is tipping the hammer over the

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.960
wedge will flip it yeah the hammer's top

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.679
heavy for sure

00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:03.280
every single one of these things is a

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.120
remote control car

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:09.520
that somebody attached a hammer to

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.799

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.400
just what's the ledge up dude find out

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.679
yeah they're gonna do the wedge is gonna

00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:38.640
get i mean it's probably a strong

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.400
contender but robotics has come a long

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:40.960
way

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.720
battle robotics has come a long way dude

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.480
is the hammer still in it hammer i

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.080
believe from one up from how many more

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.600
variations can there be

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.600
there's 250 i know but there has to be

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.559
like four different ways there's got to

00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:54.000
be like pulverizers

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.640
punches punch yeah punchers yeah

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.160
settling torch you can easily

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.840
kind of think i'd like a spiderish one

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.120
the one that walked but he would get

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.480
eviscerated oh yeah

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.880
can you imagine we're drunk carbon fiber

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.919
and light weight and that's what i'm

00:20:05.919 --> 00:20:06.559
saying here

00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:08.159
we got a spider one called black widow

00:20:08.159 --> 00:20:09.760
this year all right what do you think of

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.360
that guy yeah it's looking pretty sick

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.880
you got two you got eight legs it looks

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.000
like a black widow and it looks like a

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.679
shocks people does it have any wheels

00:20:15.679 --> 00:20:17.760
jackson yeah oh yeah probably on the

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.360
bottom it looks like on the bottom

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.039
oh see that's not good that that means

00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:22.799

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:24.640
legs but it still just goes on and it's

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.080
going to try to shock the wedge

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.760
the wedges i'm going to watch bots wedge

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.919

as like strong 1950s

00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:19.520
if we made a movie of the patreon he'd

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.159

00:24:20.159 --> 00:24:22.080
he'd be a good mario good wow oh that's

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.000
what i do

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.039
so i'll go ahead and not today

00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:30.000
dude speaking of fighting irish are

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.440

you're going to be waiting another day

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.200
i'd like to see them win

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.640
russians or have to save them we're

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.880
going to get it's just they're due for a

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.120
win

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.760
it's the rose bowl but unfortunately

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.760
it's not in pasadena obviously

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.240
in texas yeah yeah they need to get the

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.520
they need to get this came from a family

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.880
party i know a couple things for

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:03.279
football

00:25:03.279 --> 00:25:04.640
all right he's talking about the ball

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.120
games they need to squirt some covid

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.960
that's our hope because alabama gets

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.960
covered and then bring in texas a m and

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.559
then that would be a good game yeah but

00:25:12.559 --> 00:25:14.159
texas a m played alabama already and

00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:15.120
lost by about

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.520
30. notre dame's gonna get the irish

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.880
have this dude wouldn't they just play a

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.320
decimated alabama team

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.720
no well yeah maybe but it would that's

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.919
what there's a certain percentage

00:25:23.919 --> 00:25:25.679
decimated alabama team still beats notre

00:25:25.679 --> 00:25:27.279
dame i still think

00:25:27.279 --> 00:25:29.760
i'd like to see i'd like to see it would

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:30.320
rule

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.640
trust me i'm gonna watch it and and when

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.480
kickoff happens i'm gonna be like

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.799
we got a chance oh for sure and then

00:25:36.799 --> 00:25:38.640
like three plays later i'll be like holy

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.159
[ __ ] these guys are good

00:25:40.159 --> 00:25:42.000
damn it's gonna hurt it's gonna be tough

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.400
it's crazy that i let myself

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.400
get my hopes up for this like i know

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.960
also if anybody here bets

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.240
easy money you think so alabama's minus

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.240
19 and a half they're gonna win by over

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:54.880
20.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.039
i know they are really couldn't be if

00:25:57.039 --> 00:25:59.360
notre dame is within 20 that's a victory

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.679
yeah for notre dame it won't happen do

00:26:01.679 --> 00:26:02.559
you uh you're gonna have like

00:26:02.559 --> 00:26:04.000
unfortunately you need a support team

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.560
let's try stuff

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:37.920
throw it out there so i wonder if

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.320
someone went with a wedge first

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.680
wedge tank i don't know why they didn't

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.760
knocked over like a guy

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.440
like mission accomplished dude like

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.040
imagine going back in time with a wedge

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.800
that guy's muddy thinking about going

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.640
like back in like the 30s with an ak or

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.040
whenever when aks come out

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.960
like they say the 1800s with an ak it's

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.240
like dude that'd be crazy yeah

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.680
imagine going back in time with a wedge

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.079
dude yeah just rolling taking out a

00:40:00.079 --> 00:40:00.960
whole calvary

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:04.400
i'm guessing 59 for the ak-47

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.920
yeah look i i think that's a good unless

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.839
it's 1947.

00:40:07.839 --> 00:40:09.760
yeah it's gonna be like 48 for it what i

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:12.560
said 48 designed between 1946 and 1948

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.319
and it was produced in 1948.

00:40:14.319 --> 00:40:18.000
yeah so you're probably watching ak-47

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.599
now you think about it could be it's

00:40:19.599 --> 00:40:21.599
good thing we ended that war

00:40:21.599 --> 00:40:23.920
yeah before those boys got he had those

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:24.880
collisions

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.720
oh boy japanese would have been in

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.480
trouble anyway

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.520
sorry let's get back to wedges true yeah

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:34.240
dude i uh this this might be like the

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.359
dumbest thing in the world

00:40:35.359 --> 00:40:38.560
but um today i had a uh well i wouldn't

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:39.839

like wild origins i don't think he

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.400

night i said i'd never be [ __ ] that's

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.440
why they built castles back in the it's

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.800
the same reason you're building

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.560

00:44:33.359 --> 00:44:35.839
kill you [ __ ] you up so i fill the wall

00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:37.760
it'd be sweet if you got killed

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.359
zuckerberg yeah what a nasty thing for

00:44:39.359 --> 00:44:40.800
you

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.880
i think it'd be fun i'd like to see more

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.359
like assassinations i think

00:44:45.359 --> 00:44:47.760
do you think so of like tech you're just

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.880
just like you want to see jack

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:50.720
just people just like jack people being

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.079
like dog whistle

00:44:52.079 --> 00:44:54.079
just they just got too big and like now

00:44:54.079 --> 00:44:55.040
you have to kill him who do you think

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.319
would kill zuck

00:44:56.319 --> 00:44:58.960
the wedge just wedge him up that could

00:44:58.960 --> 00:44:59.440
be his

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.440
wedge him right up i would imagine

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.960
zuckerberg does run like that

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.760
boston dynamics like very weird like

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.079
falling

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.920
the wedge could [ __ ] him up i'm telling

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.119
you man

00:45:13.119 --> 00:45:14.319
cause he'd probably be like oh sweet

00:45:14.319 --> 00:45:19.040
like oh nice a wedge a bot yeah

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.720
and it just reads over his balcony it

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.400
wedges him then pops him the hydraulic

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:22.880
pop

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:25.119
sends him to his [ __ ] death in hawaii

00:45:25.119 --> 00:45:26.160
yeah he'd be

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.480
so shocked that a wedge got him yeah it

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.839
gets right under that bulletproof glass

00:45:30.839 --> 00:45:32.160
yeah just

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.280
right through the gap yeah

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.200
true dude so you didn't think about it

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.520
trojan horse

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.960
you put it on the elevator he's like

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:42.880
sweet robotics

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:46.079
bring it in it's a gift

00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:49.119
out it's a [ __ ] wedge it's just a

00:45:49.119 --> 00:45:49.599
robot

00:45:49.599 --> 00:45:51.440
box and he's like oh well turns out it's

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.440
[ __ ] cuts in half and it's two wedges

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:53.760
dude

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:57.040
whoa dude it's two yeah turned out

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.319
he's obviously gonna call a security

00:45:58.319 --> 00:46:00.000
team of bots you probably have security

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:00.560
bots

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:01.839
but if you give him like a box he's like

00:46:01.839 --> 00:46:03.839
oh a simple this is nice oh a wedge and

00:46:03.839 --> 00:46:06.400
then it splits into two wedges dude

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.880
[ __ ] one for each foot yeah just

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:11.920
takes him wherever it wants him

00:46:12.319 --> 00:46:14.480
it can't now you're a prisoner to the

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:15.760
wedge

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.000
you're at its will some 14 year old who

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:18.570
built it

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:20.640
[Laughter]

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.720
dude so i'm sitting there today and i'm

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:23.839
like

00:46:23.839 --> 00:46:25.680
i love that the wedge was the best spot

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.200
because it was definitely the

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.760
worst like some guy was like trying to

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.839
build like a hammer on top of it or like

00:46:31.839 --> 00:46:33.520
a drill and he was like

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.440
i just [ __ ] flip these other guys

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.200
[ __ ] things

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.119
this thing's unstoppable oh you're gonna

00:46:39.119 --> 00:46:40.720
own the ground yeah

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.319
i mean imagine being part of the team of

00:46:42.319 --> 00:46:44.880
the wedge the low man the team behind it

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:48.560
comes out he's like the low man

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:51.119
that's a good idea what if we just make

00:46:51.119 --> 00:46:53.380
a [ __ ] wedge that flips things over

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:59.450
[Laughter]

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:06.060
[Laughter]

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.359
is back dude i'm watching sports do they

00:47:09.359 --> 00:47:11.839
still do they do like black lives matter

00:47:11.839 --> 00:47:13.520
they do like commercials where it's like

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.359
this is the time to rise up

00:47:15.359 --> 00:47:18.160
it's just like a spider robot walking

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.240
together we rise

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.200
no more police brutality shot of the

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.160
wedge

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.760
i'll be curious to see if they actually

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.359
do that i can't dude i'm done with those

00:47:27.359 --> 00:47:27.920
commercials

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.480

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:35.200
like shut up tv those are a

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.960
multi-billion dollar corporation like

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.040
give some of the money up there you guys

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.800

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.800
that preoccupied with social justice

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.480
and being like we're going to keep

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.000
billions of dollars for ourselves

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.680
yeah it's like give fork the [ __ ]

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.520

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:52.079
you guys all those big corporations

00:47:52.079 --> 00:47:53.280

yeah i agree with that wedge is

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:58.079
definitely a hardline republican

00:47:58.079 --> 00:48:00.319
the wedge is very conservative

00:48:00.319 --> 00:48:01.760
everyone's with their new fangled

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.680
hammers and sharks biting it's like

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:08.160
old school running down their throats

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:11.280
straight ahead simple the wedge is doing

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:11.839
post

nobody every all right now this is a

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.400
this is something i'm going to admit to

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:09.200
you guys as friends

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:11.760
me and my dad we're watching commercials

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:14.319
and we're accounting

00:49:14.319 --> 00:49:17.119
we're just taking inventory of their

00:49:17.119 --> 00:49:18.319
ethnic

00:49:18.319 --> 00:49:20.400
ethnic diversity in each commercial sure

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:22.000
that's good diversity in each commercial

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.119
yeah you guys are amazing the numbers

00:49:23.119 --> 00:49:24.240
are astounding you guys are making a

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:24.800
spreadsheet

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.079
we were we made our spreadsheet we

00:49:26.079 --> 00:49:27.119
wanted to make sure there was more

00:49:27.119 --> 00:49:28.559
inclusivity i think right now we're

00:49:28.559 --> 00:49:29.760
hovering around 90

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.920
inclusivity the only chance there's not

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.440
a person of color in a commercial is if

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.040
there's no people in the commercial

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.040
or if it's like a local like do you need

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.240
new windows true

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.839
they should start diversifying those if

00:49:39.839 --> 00:49:41.359
a guy's like uh

00:49:41.359 --> 00:49:43.119

do roller derby for a couple years just

00:51:31.839 --> 00:51:33.839

put it that way

00:51:41.839 --> 00:51:44.160
it's chris

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.240
you're saying in order to cheer more

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.000
effectively she needs to unlock

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.839
her vocabulary i'm just saying that it's

00:51:51.839 --> 00:51:53.599
like she chose she chose

00:51:53.599 --> 00:51:56.559
a like a college prof i don't know what

00:51:56.559 --> 00:51:57.599
do you call that

00:51:57.599 --> 00:51:59.359
like her like sport that's a sport no

00:51:59.359 --> 00:52:01.040
they do truly i watched

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:04.960
i watched cheer i watched that show

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.559
i watched that [ __ ] m isn't competing

00:52:06.559 --> 00:52:07.680
you know she's just on the sidelines

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:08.240
again oh that's

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:09.760
natural that's a nationally competitive

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:11.280
yeah that's that's a national problem i

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:12.319

00:52:12.319 --> 00:52:18.000
i dare you to watch cheers

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.920
was she on the competition team i think

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:21.599
she i think she had either way dude she

00:52:21.599 --> 00:52:22.880
had team spirit

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.119
we've established it she's had she had

00:52:25.119 --> 00:52:26.800
the spirit she got a little excited one

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:27.680
day in high school

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:28.720
true i wonder if it was one of her high

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:33.839
school chants that she used

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.839
oh but yeah so without watching that

00:52:39.839 --> 00:52:40.480
they they

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:42.559
do that story and then they shoot yeah

00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:44.960
you got it

00:52:45.119 --> 00:52:46.240
they shoot the court like a

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:09.280
wild dreams wild visions dude i never

even finished telling you about the end

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:11.520
of my meditation

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:15.040
oh yeah dude so i i sat there and uh

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:16.719
so i think about i'm pondering the dream

01:18:16.719 --> 01:18:18.159
and i'm thinking about zuck's power and

01:18:18.159 --> 01:18:19.520
money and you know it's a classic

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:20.880
example of like

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:22.320
what would i do with all that power and

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.920
money and by you know just let your

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:24.960
brain go

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.159
first thing i thought of was just

01:18:26.159 --> 01:18:27.520
getting like you know someone who

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:29.280
obviously recently died

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.679
getting their penis transplanted onto my

01:18:31.679 --> 01:18:32.719
stomach

01:18:32.719 --> 01:18:34.640
just decorative soft dong it's just you

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.800
know sizeable so getting a dick attached

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:38.480
to my stomach something sizable

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:39.920
so you just walk around you take your

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:41.199
shirt off and i think you'd be able to

01:18:41.199 --> 01:18:42.880
show that technically

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:44.880
if you had like a decided perhaps like a

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:46.080
decorative appendage i don't know some

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:47.040
guy grew a dick

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:48.560
they grew a dick on a guy's arm you can

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:49.600
have you can just pull it out you don't

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.120
have to like sleeve your arm dick

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:52.880
yeah he had a dick on his arm that's

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.320
right so that's why i was foreign

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.480
it's true yeah didn't right yeah in like

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:58.080

commercial as me and it let him know

01:23:58.320 --> 01:23:59.360
she's really switched to the family i

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.600
see the same commercial

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:03.600
i see the same commercial every [ __ ]

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:06.000
day and it says att commercial

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.199
where this dude accidentally calls he's

01:24:09.199 --> 01:24:09.679
like

01:24:09.679 --> 01:24:12.400
mom att has a family plan now they're

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:13.679
like oh what'd you say he's like that

01:24:13.679 --> 01:24:15.360
wasn't my mom that was another guy

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:16.960
he's excited about it and then it cuts

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:18.480
to that girl with the great tits yeah

01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:19.440
and she goes

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:21.440
she looks straight at the camera and i

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.719
can't make sense of it and it's been

01:24:22.719 --> 01:24:23.840
bothering me she looks at the camera she

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:24.400
goes

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:26.480
word of mouth advertising it's what they

01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:29.199
did before commercials

01:24:29.199 --> 01:24:30.239
that's the end of the comment forward

01:24:30.239 --> 01:24:31.840
and it makes it's what they did before

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.440
the before commercials word of mouth

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:34.560
advertising

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:37.040
but the facial expression she makes

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:38.719
puzzles me

01:24:38.719 --> 01:24:40.639
so much that it genuinely bothers me

01:24:40.639 --> 01:24:41.840
there's never been a commercial that

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:43.679
actually annoyed me like it bothered me

01:24:43.679 --> 01:24:46.080
this one every time i see it i get angry

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.360
is it supposed to be like winking and

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:48.960
nodding to old people like

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.239
these young people they don't even know

01:24:50.239 --> 01:24:52.080
what word no but the face

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:55.120
she's like word of mouth advertising

01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.639
like she's like exasperated

01:24:56.639 --> 01:24:58.960
it's what they did before commercials

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:00.639
yeah it's a facebook

01:25:00.639 --> 01:25:03.199
a face that makes zero sense right yeah

01:25:03.199 --> 01:25:05.520
anyway

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:09.360
i'm watching you know notre dame get

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.440
blown out by clemson when that comes on

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.960
it's also all commercial like lady

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:14.400
you're you're speaking this is a

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:15.360
commercial

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:16.960
you're telling me about word of mouth

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:18.880
within a commercial i don't get it so

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.159
it's not word of mouth then i'm just

01:25:20.159 --> 01:25:21.679
someone who's been

01:25:21.679 --> 01:25:23.199
changed by a commercial also the thing

01:25:23.199 --> 01:25:25.199
doesn't make sense he's like mom

01:25:25.199 --> 01:25:26.639
and he's like that wasn't my mom that

01:25:26.639 --> 01:25:28.560
was a guy named randy he's excited about

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:29.360
it

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:30.880
about advertising that's what they did

01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:32.639
before commercials the

01:25:32.639 --> 01:25:34.639
dude has like a manner of speaking

01:25:34.639 --> 01:25:37.040
that's like exactly like the

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:40.480
black guy on veep yeah that guy's great

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:42.080
yeah yeah detroiters yeah but it's like

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:43.440
it almost feels like they couldn't hire

01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:44.880
that guy so they sounded they hired like

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:46.400
another black guy that sounds exactly

01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:47.360
the same

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:50.960
it's really weird anyway yeah i'm like

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:52.719
still perplexed

01:25:52.719 --> 01:25:55.920
as to how people who are very much like

01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:57.280
you know anti

01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:00.639
conspiracy theory all that stuff anti 5g

01:26:00.639 --> 01:26:02.639
who typically who are also anti

01:26:02.639 --> 01:26:04.159
patriarchy

01:26:04.159 --> 01:26:06.159
somehow all believe everything the news

01:26:06.159 --> 01:26:07.679
says it's like if if

01:26:07.679 --> 01:26:09.120
you know our whole society has been

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:11.520
dominated by evil rich white

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:14.480
racist billionaires yeah they own the

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:15.280
news

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:18.560
so why do you take the news it's never

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:19.520
been reconciled

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:21.440
that makes no [ __ ] sense bothering me

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:22.639
when they were talking about how like

01:26:22.639 --> 01:26:24.239
minorities are afraid to take the

01:26:24.239 --> 01:26:24.960
vaccine

01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:26.719
as well and they were like well there's

01:26:26.719 --> 01:26:29.760
a history here that we need to it's like

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.280
why can't they just be ignorant pieces

01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:33.600
of [ __ ] like the white people

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:36.159

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.480
is increased and we need to close that

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:21.120
gap

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:23.840
yeah and then it goes into why black

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:25.280
graduation rate like what

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.880
what can white people do to fix that

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:30.400
graduation rate yeah it's like

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:33.920
[ __ ] study that's

01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:36.800
step one study yeah they've all they've

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.679
talked about how like

01:27:37.679 --> 01:27:40.000
step two go to class they've talked

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.440
about how diversity and inclusion kind

01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:42.560
of messes people up because there might

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.239
be like a black dude who would do like

01:27:44.239 --> 01:27:46.400
fantastic at drexel but penn is like

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:47.760
yeah come here we'll take you and then

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:49.120
they they get the numbers for the

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:50.239
diversity stuff and then

01:27:50.239 --> 01:27:51.920
the dude's like just says no it'd be

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.520
like if i was at like [ __ ]

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:54.960
mit i think i don't know what the [ __ ]

01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:56.960
i'm doing but there's

01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:58.320
i don't know so you get in for the

01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.239
numbers but then the curriculum is just

01:28:00.239 --> 01:28:01.040
not for you

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:02.400
and then you end up failing out whereas

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:04.000
if you went to another school you would

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:04.400
be

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.080
fine and graduated blah blah blah well

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:07.520
and it's like yeah it's like starting on

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:08.800
like a division two team

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:10.239
and getting all the experience versus

01:28:10.239 --> 01:28:12.000
like riding the bench on division one

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:12.480
team

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:15.520
it's like you could probably go pro i

01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:16.639
don't know

01:28:16.639 --> 01:28:19.120
like it's like either way it's a fun

01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:20.800
article if you're the [ __ ] if you're the

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:21.520
[ __ ] in a

01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:24.239
in a different school it's better than

01:28:24.239 --> 01:28:25.920
struggling

01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:29.199
yeah it's also racist to be like

01:28:29.199 --> 01:28:30.480
white people what do white people need

01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:31.920
to do for this it's like exactly that's

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.360
what the whole thing was like yeah

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:36.480
what can we do to first off they said

01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:39.040
like close the gap which is like bring

01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:40.560
down that white graduation rate

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.560
is that what you mean true he like maybe

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:43.840
send me back

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:45.760
flunk them out a little bit even this

01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:46.880
thing out

01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:48.239
yeah it's just if it's just a no it's

01:28:48.239 --> 01:28:50.480
just a weird thing for espn to have on

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:51.199
there

01:28:51.199 --> 01:28:52.560
yeah well it has nothing to do with the

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.080
solving a problem it has everything to

01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:55.840
do with just announcing that you have

01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:57.280
recognized it and you know yeah

01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:59.600
it's like it's it's [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:01.280

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:34.480
like giving like dispensing reality to

01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:35.679
you it's like it might seem like they

01:29:35.679 --> 01:29:36.639

definitely we definitely will

01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:26.239
the democrats are trying to get a bunch

01:30:26.239 --> 01:30:28.080
of money to give to

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:30.880
uh like they're doing like another like

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:32.159
direct deposit thing they were trying to

01:30:32.159 --> 01:30:33.520
get like a bunch of money for that yeah

01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:35.040
and the republicans like

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:36.639
[ __ ] them hard because they're way

01:30:36.639 --> 01:30:39.440
better at politics and then uh

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:41.840
and then they took the bill to trump and

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:42.560
trump

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:44.239
and the democrats are also like [ __ ]

01:30:44.239 --> 01:30:46.159
and corporate and you [ __ ] didn't

01:30:46.159 --> 01:30:46.719
really give

01:30:46.719 --> 01:30:50.239
that anyway but then trump was like no

01:30:50.239 --> 01:30:51.600
there's not enough money in this

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:52.880
and he said i'm not gonna like [ __ ]

01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.719
sign it yeah some [ __ ] thing and

01:30:54.719 --> 01:30:55.440
then

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:57.679
then like they started like negotiating

01:30:57.679 --> 01:30:59.360
to get this potential two thousand

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:00.880
dollars out to everyone

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:02.560
and then though like the new york times

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:05.120
and stuff had to like come up with ways

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:06.480
to make

01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:09.840
it bad it's like trump saved the day

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.679
of giving the more what were they also

01:31:11.679 --> 01:31:13.440
passing this like military budget thing

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:14.560
at the same time

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:15.840
well that they did like a weird thing

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:17.760
where they rolled it all into like uh

01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:20.880
but they do that i forget

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:22.320
it wasn't the ndaa or whatever that

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:23.600
thing it's whatever yeah i know what

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:25.199
it's national letters

01:31:25.199 --> 01:31:26.719
authorization act or something it's

01:31:26.719 --> 01:31:28.400
letters that's what i remember yeah

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:29.440
but they doing that because i know

01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:31.199
they're like they do that silence they

01:31:31.199 --> 01:31:32.639
did that simultaneously military budget

01:31:32.639 --> 01:31:33.040
thing

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:35.760
yeah i believe his problem was with that

01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:36.639
yeah

01:31:36.639 --> 01:31:38.480
or like yeah it was something like that

01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:39.920
it was like money to other countries

01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:40.400
yeah

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:41.920
but like giving money to countries who

01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:43.040
are buying weapons from other countries

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:44.000
yes and his problem

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.639
was with that yeah not the the bailout

01:31:46.639 --> 01:31:48.000
or whatever this is had nothing to do

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:48.960
with that i guess

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:50.719
yeah i think that might have been two

01:31:50.719 --> 01:31:52.239
different things yeah i have no idea

01:31:52.239 --> 01:31:52.800
about anything

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:54.159
either i call i just saw like five

01:31:54.159 --> 01:31:55.600
minutes of fox news and was like oh i

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:56.080

01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:28.159
tried to half-ass it

01:33:28.159 --> 01:33:31.360
and who ended up like getting like back

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:32.880
on the grid after being off because they

01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:34.960
couldn't hack off the grid it's [ __ ]

01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:37.440

01:33:38.639 --> 01:33:39.840
can buy the equipment that makes it a

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:40.639
little easier

01:33:40.639 --> 01:33:41.840

01:36:59.679 --> 01:37:01.119
they follow drug dealers around with

01:37:01.119 --> 01:37:02.000
cameras

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.280
yeah but i mean that's the other thing

01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:04.320
too if you gave him enough money he

01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:05.679
might be able to do like vice kind of

01:37:05.679 --> 01:37:06.960
pulls it up if your boss

01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:08.400

you'd be dead but the boss is the one

01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:12.480
who's like do this [ __ ] rules

01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:13.840
young america they all see each other

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:15.920
and they go a real shitty gang might be

01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:17.360
like yeah bring a camera crew but like

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:18.639
those documentaries because tommy

01:37:18.639 --> 01:37:20.159

01:37:20.159 --> 01:37:22.480
guys like going about their day with a

01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:23.600
[ __ ] camera crew

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:25.199
i was wondering this is where we this is

01:37:25.199 --> 01:37:26.800
where we actually hide the drone

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:29.440
i was wondering this isn't real this is

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:29.840
fake

01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:30.960
i always wondered i'm like why would

01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:32.239
these guys do this unless they're

01:37:32.239 --> 01:37:33.840
getting paid a ton of money or but i

01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:34.800
mean if they're selling enough drugs

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:36.000
they don't worry about it but the ugly

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.440
americans you could be like i'll give

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:38.480
you guys like

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:40.239
dude they're they're making like i

01:37:40.239 --> 01:37:41.840
believe that i watched that voicing on

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:43.440
you get the third world of gangs like

01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:45.360
you guys 5 000 american dollars and

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:46.080
they're just like

01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:48.400
but you're also now fueling like weapons

01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:50.800
to a gang which is [ __ ] crazy

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:52.800
true you know so it's like a it's a

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:54.159
weird genre yeah

01:37:54.159 --> 01:37:55.199
but i'm right with you when they have a

01:37:55.199 --> 01:37:56.800
guy who's like i've been selling ecstasy

01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:58.639
in new york for 17 years it's like yeah

01:37:58.639 --> 01:38:00.159
why the [ __ ] would you and then you show

01:38:00.159 --> 01:38:00.400
him

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:02.159
he's like this is my safe house it's

01:38:02.159 --> 01:38:04.239
like all right no it's not

01:38:04.239 --> 01:38:05.760
it just happened once i was watching it

01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:07.280
because i watched them for years

01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:08.560
i always watch those and then one day i

01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:10.719
was like oh this is fake yeah

01:38:10.719 --> 01:38:13.520
[ __ ] dude but then again these guys they

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:14.880
get it's like how the [ __ ] would they

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:16.000
get these dudes as actors

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.880
these guys are meth heads maybe maybe in

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:20.239
that but most of the time their faces

01:38:20.239 --> 01:38:21.360
are blurred out and their voices are

01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:22.000
distorted

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.600
so literally anybody could do it yeah

01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:25.040
for sure all you have to do because you

01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:26.639
can even sound shitty and it's gonna

01:38:26.639 --> 01:38:27.360
come out fine

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.360
