00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.040
right now you know low-key besides young

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.440
john marant who is my uh he's in the nba

enjoy watching somebody play more than

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.959
yo yeah well there's i i joke around

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.360
about this with soda a lot that like the

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.760
the dudes the white dudes in the nba all

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.080
the europeans they had to invent

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.519
because they can't jump so they had to

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.599
like invent a style of basketball where

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.840
like they move the ball around and like

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.239
do euro steps and like try to figure out

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.200
how to

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.959
yeah it's been but uh

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.199
no i'm a sixers guy but when lebron

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.519
lebron with the lakers is intolerable

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.759
and tolerant i hate him wow

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:23.120
he's just like

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.960
he's i don't know i mean he's obviously

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.040
i'm not i'm not like i can still hate

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.400
him and recognize

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.240
arguably the best player of course

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.680
arguably

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.360
it's an argument it's an argument it's

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.919
actually an argument now certainly but

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.759
he's just such a [ __ ]

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.479
i don't know he's such a dork okay right

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.240
don't you do you think he's kind of a

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.440
[ __ ] dork all the time

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.919
yes or no all right so like here's the

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.240
thing for lebron for me is

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.360
lebron

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.160
is

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.720
occupying the space of

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.040
the [ __ ] black athlete that has the

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.520
platform yes use the platform

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.560
so in the [ __ ] seems phony i'm

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.320
not that's all that's all the thing

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.759
that's all i think about because it's

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.919
like it's like his whole i mean don't

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.520
get me wrong there's one thing you can

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.360
always say about lebron it's like he's

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.199
been on the cover of [ __ ] espn

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.039
magazine since he was in eighth grade

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.120
and he's never really [ __ ] up once

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.520
okay he seems like a pretty [ __ ] good

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.639
dude yes

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.039
i don't i think he gets

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:24.880
swept up in like

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.039
it's he's a brand he's a corporation at

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.919
this point and it's like

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.520
i don't know it's if he was doing the

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.120
no i don't want to say it okay it's not

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.360
good for a honkey like me to be speaking

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.720
on these things that you heard me

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.120
podcast i know i understand let's talk i

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.440
know but ain't put [ __ ] 27 people

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.919
going listen bro no yeah

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.759
that's what i thought about my podcast

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:50.560
and i ended up getting cancelled

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.000
but still you now you're the [ __ ]

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.280
phoenix right now we're going to get to

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.520
that in a second so but so so but like

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.880
you said you know and i think that's the

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.400
most important thing when we talk about

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.639
lebron yo is he's a player who we're not

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.080
going to appreciate until the [ __ ]

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.479
day he retires i agree

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.720
across the [ __ ] board i remember it

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.400
was maybe his second year he was in a

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.560
mint coat during the press conference he

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.919
had just got a speeding ticket in the

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:13.759
ferrari going like a buck 07 or

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:15.199
something like that 2 o'clock in the

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:16.479
morning he was like yeah i was going a

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:18.639
little fast i was having too much fun i

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.120
was being reckless won't happen again i

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.919
don't remember the last time lebron even

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:25.680
swung back at somebody on the court let

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.120
alone did something [ __ ] [ __ ] off the

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.039
couch no lebron is definitely without a

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:30.319
doubt like i'm i'm not talking about

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:32.160
hating him as like a human i understand

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.199
that i hate him as i hate the [ __ ]

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:37.360
i mean the complaining to the refs after

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.720
every single thing the flopping is just

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.800
so [ __ ] lame but the problem the

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.080
problem when you want to criticize

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.080
lebron's flopping is is

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.840
the amount of fouls that they don't call

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.759
against them however it's the amount of

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:51.759
calls that they don't call on him when

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:52.880
he comes through with a little

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.560
[ __ ]

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.560
i mean i just want lebron at this point

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.800
to just bulk up to like 290 bro yeah be

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.400
honest and just don't even [ __ ] run

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.000
the floor like that play power forward

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.919
yeah i mean you just [ __ ] dominate

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:05.599
out the [ __ ] low pick and roll and

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:07.759
all of that yeah there's there's no

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:09.440
there's no denying

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.680
what he's done like his body's got to be

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.520
shot like he's got i mean it's got to be

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.759
so [ __ ] physically demanding yeah

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:17.199
it's just the

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:19.520
he is corny that's the problem so let me

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.520
ask you this mj was

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.199
mean

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:25.120
he was just a [ __ ]

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.639
and that's awesome okay that's what you

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:27.520
want

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.520
i don't know that's like that's lebron

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.080
seems to want to be loved yeah

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.319
jordan didn't care that seems to be the

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:36.000
i don't know well ask yourself the same

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.440
question though cause you said he's been

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.720
on the cover of whatever since he was

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.039
14. and he's been hated ever since then

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:43.280
from a large ass contingency the

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.360
cleveland [ __ ] legendary to go back to

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.479
cleveland yeah

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:48.639
jerseys and all that [ __ ] i mean like i

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:50.479
said once he's out of there

00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:52.319
he's going to be a [ __ ] bonafide

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:54.240
legend and i think you can make the case

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.400
as far as just like being a team sports

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.039
athlete he's possibly the greatest on

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:01.120
paper accomplishment-wise temperament

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.199
the whole thing but i can understand why

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:04.720
somebody don't like lebron you know what

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.479
i'm saying it's like lebron like like

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:08.240
lebron is like drake you know what i'm

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.160
saying he's like very very [ __ ]

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.919
hateable if you don't love him yes it's

00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:14.240
not too many speeds between that it it

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.919
just for me it always depended who he

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:18.479
was against okay and what he like it's

00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:21.360
almost like kd like i used to love kd

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.800
now katie's

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.800
[ __ ] lame dude

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.039
joining that he's just constantly like

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:28.319
so this is something although you

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:30.479
probably can't isn't he from around here

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:32.399
he's from dc yeah yeah you know what i

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:34.399
mean it's two totally different worlds

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:36.080
all right good what else

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.320
i don't want to trash

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.240
i [ __ ] with kd as a player for sure he's

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.320
incredible the the golden state move

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.959
exactly after after blowing the 3-1

00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:46.640
western conference final series i

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.920
understand the decision maker i get it i

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.000
just don't [ __ ] with it like him as a

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.519
player now

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:55.360
i was like ah he got hurt these last

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.959
couple seasons is [ __ ] up now he's

00:08:56.959 --> 00:08:59.440
[ __ ] going crazy where i

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.240
moved kd into my top 10 favorite players

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.240
of favorite athletes of all time

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.080
possibly and this might be [ __ ] up for

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.000
you might present a conflict of interest

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.600
for you let me hear it it's when he

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.360
[ __ ] shot a deuce on michael rapper

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.750
poor forehead oh yeah

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.880
[Laughter]

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.720
because i know and i actually said this

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.120
on the episode of my [ __ ] before

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.720
right after it happened i was talking to

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.399

we were talking about the whole [ __ ] and

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.279
i was like yo the one thing i can't say

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:28.720
about rap before is he was the only

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.720
person i saw stand up for my man shane

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.920
and i told i

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.519

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:35.440
with you yeah and with rappaport going

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.200
into the [ __ ] belly of the beast as

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.200
far as the podcast world is concerned

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.120
and the time live quality podcast and i

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.399

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:43.839
niece or somebody but like he really

00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:46.000
defers to this to this young woman on

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.200
this episode

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.720
all of a sudden she's like really

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.720
pressing them but like that lady has a

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.200

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.120

it's running for you i understand i'm

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.040
i'm when it comes to you're talking

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.480
about lebron and drake as far as

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.560
hate-able people i'm probably up there

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.399
when i could not obviously not lebron

00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:11.760
and drake but i'm saying

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.000
if you see somebody i'm pretty hateable

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.360
if you're like if you're on the lookout

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.079
for racists i look pretty racist i'll

00:10:18.079 --> 00:10:19.200
give you that

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.200
[ __ ] ankle socks yeah the [ __ ]

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.959
saucony is assuming

00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:24.720
some casual shoes oh okay you got team

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.079
jordan's on the left

00:10:26.079 --> 00:10:27.839
my man don't worry about looking the red

00:10:27.839 --> 00:10:29.519
white and blue taper on the [ __ ]

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:33.170
shorts come on the stars

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.079
[Laughter]

00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:37.760
let's talk about that for real all right

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.120
so

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.880
this is something that me and big soda

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.279
talked about for a minute last year when

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:45.440
everything was going down just you know

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.920
kind of me explaining to him how how

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.600
differently a lot of black folks are

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.480
raised

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.079
specifically

00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:54.480
um it's just crazy how our terms get

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.079
appropriated but we'll say conscious

00:10:56.079 --> 00:10:58.640
instead of woke uh you know black folks

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.480
as far as like you were raised to to

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.920
have knowledge yourself and really

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.279
understand your history and where you

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:05.279
come from to the best of your abilities

00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:06.959
and the most of your resources of course

00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:09.040
so i come from from one of those

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.120
backgrounds that was like i was told to

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.560
not salute the flag when i went to

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.800
school type [ __ ] yeah i'm saying for xyz

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.040
reasons it's fascinating when somebody

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.360
who doesn't know big shane over here

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.040
talks about big shane because it's like

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.560
if you actually listen to the man speak

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.160
you will know how much of this history

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.079
that he actually does no

00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:28.160
it's very frustrating that somebody who

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.880
listens to you talk [ __ ] for hours at

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.320
a time and [ __ ] like that and i'm like

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.240
yo i only listen to this man because i

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.680
genuinely feel like he knows what he's

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.360
talking about when he speaks

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.720
versus the [ __ ] that he just doesn't

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.079
speak on what he doesn't [ __ ] know

00:11:40.079 --> 00:11:41.600
he's talking about i [ __ ] share that

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.519
quality and [ __ ] i'm saying all this

00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:44.640
because

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.160
for me uh

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.680
you know i was i was telling soda i was

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.959
like yo like

00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:50.959
you know fourth of july coming around

00:11:50.959 --> 00:11:52.800
[ __ ] like all the patriotic moments

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.920
and [ __ ] coming around we sitting up

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.440
here like get the [ __ ] out of here yeah

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.880
what i'm saying and i think that there's

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.959
a there's an arbitrary way that you can

00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:01.360
say it that's wrapped up in social media

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.399
now that only [ __ ] shoots out [ __ ]

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:06.560
slogans and mantras and hashtags and

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.320
[ __ ] but when we talk about the totality

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.000
of this [ __ ] that's where the whole

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.079
conversation gets real frustrating and

00:12:12.079 --> 00:12:14.160
uncomfortable and i'm talking about now

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.680
we got memorial day weekend it's the

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.680
kickoff to go america season it's about

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.920
yeah strictly baseball season it's about

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.760
to be the olympics and [ __ ] like that

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.519
you know what i mean like we're about to

00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:25.920
be [ __ ] super go america somebody

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.600
who's sitting on the outside of the

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.600
magosphere or somebody who's sitting

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.320
outside of people who grew up in

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.240
traditional [ __ ] meat and potatoes

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.760
america will say

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.480
it's very [ __ ] conflicting to sit up

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.560
there and want to actually root for the

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.959
country so how do you feel as somebody

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:45.440
who is literally a [ __ ] search result

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.000
when the word racist is [ __ ] put into

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.600
google yeah

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.360
although tony hinchcliffe just took some

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.880
heat off

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.800
yeah i googled a racist comedian it was

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.560
him i was like yes

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.560
the curse is off of me

00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.760
uh

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.920
it i don't know how i've it's it's tough

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.959
because

00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:05.040
there's two sides of it and it's always

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.320
it's like uh

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.399
it's like a enemy of my enemy is my

00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:09.920
friend type thing and in all these

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.360
[ __ ] political arguments and all

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.800
these like race arguments and all these

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.959
[ __ ] and it's like

00:13:14.959 --> 00:13:16.320
so

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.320
when i i'm from mechanicsburg

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.600
pennsylvania

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.600
and when i grew up it was just white

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.600
trash i mean i grew up in a nice house

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.800
like in a nice suburban house but like

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.639
it was shitty it was it's not shitty but

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:30.880
it's like a small town now it's been

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.839
kind of white people are getting

00:13:31.839 --> 00:13:34.079
gentrified too by the way really oh yeah

00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:36.079
now my now my town is

00:13:36.079 --> 00:13:38.399
all new brand new townhouses we'll come

00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:41.040
back today i don't want you to lose

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.399
starbucks

00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:44.800
chipotle nice grocery stores all this

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.880
[ __ ] okay um

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.040
so i grew up around conservatives

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.279
republicans right and then i'm now i do

00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:52.880
comedy so i'm always surrounded by the

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.639
most liberal people on earth and when

00:13:54.639 --> 00:13:56.320
you move to new york from [ __ ]

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.560
mechanicsburg you run into a bunch of

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.639
people that are like anybody who voted

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:02.959
for trump is a racist piece of [ __ ]

00:14:02.959 --> 00:14:04.959
they're a [ __ ] idiot they're all this

00:14:04.959 --> 00:14:06.800
and you're like no i know them they're

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.519
not i know they're not bad people okay

00:14:09.519 --> 00:14:10.720
um

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.760
some of them

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.600
in fact i would probably a lot of them

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.279
are fine now if you want to talk about

00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:18.160
systemic racism deep in their core

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.360
i don't know what they can do about that

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.760
that's original sin maybe they have it i

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.600
don't know but

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.040
so when i'm when i'm in new york and i

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.959
hear these [ __ ] liberals talking [ __ ]

00:14:26.959 --> 00:14:28.000
on that

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.079
i'm instinctively like i want to defend

00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:31.600
them i want to be like no they're not

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.279
bad people right if you voted for trump

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:34.639
that doesn't necessarily mean you're an

00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:35.920
evil person

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.000
all right okay now i see the way you're

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.519
looking at me like i'm crazy i didn't

00:14:39.519 --> 00:14:40.880
vote for you

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.079
i want you to know i'm just listening to

00:14:42.079 --> 00:14:43.199
where you're going with just whoever

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:44.959
listens this i didn't vote i'm not

00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:46.240
voting for these [ __ ] people i don't

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.720
like either of them i'm with you um

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.440
but

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.320
when it comes to supporting the country

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.000
i get how that's tough because the same

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.560
way you were raised to like hey don't

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.399
salute that like that's bad which makes

00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:01.279
perfect sense these people were raised

00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:03.199
that i was growing up with you better

00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:04.880
[ __ ] stand up and salute that [ __ ]

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.040
flag everything you have is because of

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.720
somebody that died for it or all that

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.240
stuff and i don't know how that [ __ ]

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.680
works but that's what we were taught

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.360
typically one of our ancestors so

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.600
something like yeah well some of our

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.360
ancestors died too you know in fact

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.639
every one of our ancestors is dead

00:15:20.639 --> 00:15:21.510
so you know

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.199
[Laughter]

00:15:23.199 --> 00:15:24.480
um

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.079
and we grew up you know my family's a

00:15:26.079 --> 00:15:28.720
irish catholic working class family they

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.560
grew up around some bigger generations

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.639
deep do they go in america i'm not sure

00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:35.040
i'm not sure i know my my grandma's my

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.360
mom's side was one or two generations

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.279
from ireland my dad's side was probably

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:41.839
three okay three or four so like into

00:15:41.839 --> 00:15:44.079
the 1800s late i mean

00:15:44.079 --> 00:15:46.560
no no no i would probably early

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.680
early 20th century okay yeah okay yeah

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.360
um

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.279
yeah and it's you know that they came

00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:54.880
over they were like [ __ ] mushroom

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.920
farmers in delaware okay like shitty

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.759
and then my dad's

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:01.120
you know it's they didn't grow up rich

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.199
they grow up like on a compound on a

00:16:03.199 --> 00:16:05.199
creek in mechanicsburg that they built

00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:06.959
themselves right with like seven

00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:09.920
brothers and like

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.839
so that you know then it's it's just a

00:16:11.839 --> 00:16:14.240
tough topic to

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.600
grapple with because the people that

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.839
when you break it down to each group is

00:16:19.839 --> 00:16:21.040
guilty

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.320
again i don't know i don't know how to

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.320
exactly explain this because it's

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.399
obviously the most complicated question

00:16:26.399 --> 00:16:28.959
possible right now of course um

00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:31.600
and as a white man i shouldn't i can't i

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.240
cannot speak on this because i'm i don't

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.320
understand the experience so i cannot

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.560
discuss it which you know that's that's

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.399
the best way for us to move forward well

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:42.959
i i i it's not discussing things well

00:16:42.959 --> 00:16:45.360
listen you know me at this point i mean

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.639
we've known each other for some years

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:48.720
now and [ __ ] like i wouldn't be

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.079
sitting up here having this conversation

00:16:50.079 --> 00:16:51.440
with you if i didn't feel like you were

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.360
a reasonable person right yes and i

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.959
don't feel like you have

00:16:54.959 --> 00:16:56.560
like there's there's a very big

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.199
difference bro like i i consume a pretty

00:16:59.199 --> 00:17:01.600
decent amount of comedy there's a very

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.600
specific difference when you know a

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.919
[ __ ] means that [ __ ] yeah versus

00:17:05.919 --> 00:17:09.039
when somebody is clearly joking yes even

00:17:09.039 --> 00:17:10.720
if there's a tinge of [ __ ] you in the

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.880
joke if they can [ __ ] present that

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.120
[ __ ] in a way that doesn't make me be

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.400
like oh they're trying to get some

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.120
[ __ ] over i'll give you an example

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.959
not [ __ ]

00:17:20.959 --> 00:17:22.720
because of anything besides coincidence

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.400
but [ __ ] when we were at [ __ ]

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.439
skankfest 2019 and [ __ ] kill tony is

00:17:27.439 --> 00:17:29.919
going on yeah michael chase on stage

00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:32.240
[ __ ] as a judge and [ __ ] he's sitting

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.000
on the drum set and he's [ __ ] doing

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.919
fake you know funny [ __ ] little drum

00:17:35.919 --> 00:17:38.160
jokes and [ __ ] like that all of a sudden

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.240
some dude i can't remember his name he

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.160
had some [ __ ] name

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.080
uh like the preacher or some [ __ ] like

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.240
that goes on stage and he's like yo

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.240
sometimes something and then they when

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.640
they were doing the post one minute set

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.960
[ __ ] i just remember that the dude made

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.720
a joke about planting the seed and then

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.679
[ __ ]

00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:57.120
or um

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.280
uh chad made a joke about planting the

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.720
seed and then the kid just goes yeah

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.280
watermelon seed and i'm like

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.520
see you know michael j is the only black

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.000
dude within sight right now you know

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.400
that i'm here you know what i'm saying

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.320
dante nero's whoever the [ __ ] else is

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.559
there at that moment this is clearly an

00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:16.480
audience where it's like

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.160
that's not that much of a risk to say

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.600
that there you know what i'm saying so

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.039
it's like i don't think that you're

00:18:21.039 --> 00:18:23.520
[ __ ] trying to really be funny funny

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.080
funny awesome [ __ ] like you dug deep

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.240
and [ __ ] found the mockery and the

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.720
[ __ ] i agree the most [ __ ] hack [ __ ]

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.320
you know what i'm saying of course right

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.480
of course so all i'm saying is is when

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.160
i'm talking about like consuming comedy

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.720
and consuming [ __ ] uh sketches and

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.960
and [ __ ] whatever bro it's like when

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.720
you watch gillian keebs and you watch

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.039
the [ __ ] the last white football team

00:18:45.039 --> 00:18:46.960
yeah if you don't understand that to be

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.400
a criticism yeah yeah yeah of white

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.200
people exactly 100 it's it's all it is

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.640
if that [ __ ] don't bring a tear to your

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.039
eye damn there's a black person yeah i

00:18:55.039 --> 00:18:56.400
mean the point of that

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.640
without sounding too [ __ ] corny and

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.799
liberal the the real

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:03.120
the point of the joke is white people

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.440
are racist until it's inconvenient

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.360
and that's all it is yeah they're racist

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.880
until oh [ __ ] we can't win football

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.799
games without black dudes oh i love

00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:12.799
black people so much

00:19:12.799 --> 00:19:14.160
like that's the whole point of it yeah

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.320
and like look at me look how great i am

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.440
oh um [ __ ] nailed that [ __ ] bro but

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.960
there's also some humor there i mean

00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:25.600
it's it's good i'm outside of it yeah

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.360
i'm a white guy right so i'm kind of

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.280
outside of it i can i mean i was joking

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.480
about it on stage the other night i was

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.480
like i don't care about politics right i

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.120
have white privilege i don't have to and

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.640
it feels like it would be a waste of my

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.000
white privilege if i cared about

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.840
politics wow and you don't want to waste

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.120
it

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.200
that seems that seems more disrespectful

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.799
doesn't it seem more disrespectful to

00:19:46.799 --> 00:19:49.200
waste it

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.320
hey

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:53.039

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.720
african-american and he was on stage and

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.919
he was like

00:19:59.919 --> 00:20:00.960
uh

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.559
he was talking about white privilege and

00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:04.480
he was like no but i get it if i had

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.320
white privilege i would i would not want

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.080
to give that away i'd be up there every

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.679
day just like white privilege isn't real

00:20:09.679 --> 00:20:11.120
shut the [ __ ] up

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.320
and i was like yeah there's a lot of

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.240
that well this is what's funny man it's

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.039
like

00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:16.799
you know i

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:18.720
definitely

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.720
have been around everybody in this

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.799
country like [ __ ] at least on the

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:24.240
east coast

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.120
and [ __ ]

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.080
i think the biggest problem that a lot

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.200
of people

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.480
i'm not i don't even want to say a lot

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.000
of people i'm gonna talk about me like

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.679
my whole beef with the [ __ ] trump

00:20:35.679 --> 00:20:37.280
[ __ ] and being aligned with the trump

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.200
[ __ ] ends up being

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.480
you know

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.720
i don't i do believe in a lot of the

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.280
both sides of [ __ ] [ __ ] as far as

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.880
the political parties yeah democrats or

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.440
some [ __ ] [ __ ] ass [ __ ]

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.600
most of the time through and through and

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.679
aligned with all of this [ __ ] that props

00:20:53.679 --> 00:20:55.840
up white supremacy as however we want to

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.000
define it and whatever [ __ ] context

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.840
we want to use they just [ __ ] make it

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.640
look better the republicans say [ __ ] it

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.080
and [ __ ] y'all

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.600
my thing ends up being is who are you

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.120
more offended by the person that tries

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.559
to play with you or the person that's oh

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:10.960
yeah it's a malcolm x wolf and a sheep

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.960
or a wolf in a fox type thing you know i

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.240
mean it's that

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.840
um

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.520
yeah i don't know and there's also

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.559
you got to also keep in mind there's

00:21:20.559 --> 00:21:21.919
millions of white people that are not

00:21:21.919 --> 00:21:24.400
even ever around black people ever

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.480
almost have never seen them

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.520
and then

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.039
they just hear about how bad they are

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:30.640
because they're racist to black people

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.159
all the time that's what they hear and

00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:34.080
they're like i've never even [ __ ]

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.919
what are we talking about and then they

00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:37.520
see trump go on stage and they see the

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.679
same media every single day no matter

00:21:39.679 --> 00:21:42.240
what he says say he's racist he's being

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.600
racist and they're like i can i i can

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.799
kind of identify with that because i

00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:45.919
don't think he really said anything that

00:21:45.919 --> 00:21:46.720
bad

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.919
and i know what it's like to be just

00:21:47.919 --> 00:21:49.919
called racist out of nowhere

00:21:49.919 --> 00:21:50.640
and

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.960
it's just deep i don't know it's really

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.640
[ __ ] hard to

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.400
because i i there's a part of me that

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.919
totally understands why somebody would

00:21:57.919 --> 00:22:00.720
want to vote for trump okay i get it

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.799
that [ __ ] the system is

00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:04.240
crazy

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.000
but yeah they're just not looking at it

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.600
through a lens of how how is this going

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.000
to make black people feel no i'm not

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.840
that's it they don't that's not on their

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.600
radar they're not worried about that and

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.919
that could be that's obviously an issue

00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:17.600
but

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.880
i mean that's just i don't know i don't

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.520
know how to put this and i'm not and i

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.039
really hope that i didn't [ __ ] start

00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:25.200
this by asking you to to backhandedly

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.919
defend all white people oh no no no no i

00:22:27.919 --> 00:22:30.320
and look i'm this is into a microphone

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.640
i'm putting this out like i know what

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.880
i'm doing this is i'm trying to be as

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.480
honest as possible i appreciate that

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.400
that's all you can do i don't know

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.480
if i was on here being like well yes we

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.480
need to acknowledge our privilege the

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.640
white supremacy is out of hand like i

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.799
mean that just i wouldn't i got lost in

00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:48.720
my [ __ ] whatever i was saying about

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.120
the yeah i got lost too

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.559
what i was what i was basically just

00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:55.760
going along with what that is there's

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.120
the common [ __ ] thing with the

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.039
republicans as far as most black people

00:22:59.039 --> 00:23:01.200
are concerned is like

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.159
who the [ __ ] is the kkk consistently

00:23:04.159 --> 00:23:06.240
republicans right sure who is

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.799
consistently always voting for

00:23:08.799 --> 00:23:11.280
the republicans white supremacists like

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.440
actual like defined white supremacy but

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.679
how many how many klansmen do you think

00:23:15.679 --> 00:23:17.520
there are truthfully

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.600
i would believe that there are probably

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.200
still at least hundreds of thousands

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.600
okay i believe the actual number is

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.000
about eight thousand eight thousand the

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
actual card carries yes

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.600
yeah now that's that's one thing the

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.840
media does like to well i've never met

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.600
one so this is the thing no shane is

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.480
like

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.799
i'm not i'm not being uh

00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:38.159
that's a big high school football

00:23:38.159 --> 00:23:39.919
stadium that's how many that's how many

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:42.159
clans in there [ __ ] pa and [ __ ] yeah

00:23:42.159 --> 00:23:44.080
i'm talking about [ __ ] when i use the

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.840
klan i'm saying kleenex instead of

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.760
facial tissue right yeah

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.960
i i hear you i heard in

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.690
[Music]

00:23:58.559 --> 00:24:00.240
what i'm saying with all of that man is

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.679
like

00:24:01.679 --> 00:24:03.360
when you look at who is consistently

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.679
aligned with whom right yeah i know that

00:24:05.679 --> 00:24:07.440
there's a huge second amendment

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.600
component and a lot of that [ __ ] uh

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.080
voting bloc as far as the militia type

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.240
people i know that there is but there's

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.000
also a lot of [ __ ] that's been codified

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.600
into that [ __ ] in the same way on the

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.360
[ __ ] left there's a lot of [ __ ]

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.279
that's being codified into the left like

00:24:21.279 --> 00:24:24.159
you must [ __ ] never say that abortion

00:24:24.159 --> 00:24:26.159
is scrambling a baby and vacuuming it

00:24:26.159 --> 00:24:27.840
out [ __ ] you can't say that [ __ ] out

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.559
loud yeah around somebody who's [ __ ]

00:24:30.559 --> 00:24:32.559
on the left that harder the same way you

00:24:32.559 --> 00:24:34.400
can't say whatever the [ __ ] that people

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.760
on the right can't tolerate like

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.360
kneeling for the flag or some [ __ ] like

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.200
that

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.039
my biggest problem with people on the

00:24:41.039 --> 00:24:43.919
right and and pretty much like

00:24:43.919 --> 00:24:46.000
neo liberals and [ __ ] like that anybody

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.159
who wants the status quo in the way of

00:24:48.159 --> 00:24:50.720
like this is the way that we do things

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.039
my problem ends up being is

00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:55.279
you are never voting

00:24:55.279 --> 00:24:57.200
in your own interests unless you're

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.799
extremely wealthy

00:24:58.799 --> 00:25:00.960
that doesn't need in my opinion bro like

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.720
if i'm talking about the only way i'm

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.640
gonna [ __ ] actually get some [ __ ] in

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.440
my hands for real as a person

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.000
as an as a normal average person is if i

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.520
vote for democrats

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.960
most of the time if i if i'm a

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.880
republican who's just a regular average

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.880
person i don't make a six figure [ __ ]

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.360
income in my household or whatever

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.120
they're putting in place is not going to

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.600
really help me day to day

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.960
the thing that the republicans are

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.559
typically going to do is not take [ __ ]

00:25:26.559 --> 00:25:28.159
away from me they're not going to

00:25:28.159 --> 00:25:30.159
[ __ ] try to ban menthol cigarettes

00:25:30.159 --> 00:25:32.159
[ __ ] only yeah

00:25:32.159 --> 00:25:34.559
the [ __ ] is that bro side bar bro side

00:25:34.559 --> 00:25:35.760
bar but that's the type of issue i'm

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.559
talking about shout out to condescending

00:25:38.559 --> 00:25:41.200
how condescending is this [ __ ] this is

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.360
what i'm saying bro it's like [ __ ] yo yo

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.799
talking about the democrats and all

00:25:44.799 --> 00:25:46.640
these [ __ ] coons out here [ __ ]

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.080
trying to fight you in the street if you

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.840
have the nerve to [ __ ] say yo like

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.600
[ __ ] the democrat show like oh yeah what

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.039
you just want to vote for trump then i

00:25:53.039 --> 00:25:54.320
guess you want trump for another four

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.039
years bro it's very much proven that it

00:25:57.039 --> 00:25:59.200
don't [ __ ] matter in a lot of [ __ ]

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.600
ways but what i do know is that most

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.000
average people benefited more so far

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.799
from biden's presidency than had

00:26:06.799 --> 00:26:08.720
been benefiting during the trump

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.559
presidency in the way of there weren't

00:26:10.559 --> 00:26:12.240
as many roadblocks to them getting money

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.440

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.600

an endorsement of biden nor his [ __ ]

00:26:17.679 --> 00:26:19.360
administration i'm talking about in

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.000
practice for most actual middle class

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.640
people not the the proverbial american

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.720
people that [ __ ] talk to carlson and

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.559
them talk about i'm talking about real

people teachers [ __ ] plumbers [ __ ]

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.559
like that the republicans have

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:34.640
masterfully [ __ ] been able to

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.480
convince them that they're doing [ __ ]

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.320
for them that they are just doing the

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.520
opposite of

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.200
black people who are [ __ ] so

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.640
convinced that it's not going to be the

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.039
republicans that they buy into all this

00:26:45.039 --> 00:26:47.039
fantastic [ __ ] that the democrats do for

00:26:47.039 --> 00:26:48.880
them like allow two of them to have a

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.120
job yeah like allow [ __ ] five of them

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.120

[ __ ] approve [ __ ] one extra point

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.520
in the [ __ ] me be weeby bid in the

[ __ ] government contract like is this

00:26:59.679 --> 00:27:02.080
such little [ __ ] tiny [ __ ] chain yeah

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.919
that it pisses me off when i talk about

00:27:03.919 --> 00:27:06.559
[ __ ] like nah do we want progress or

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:07.919
not and what the [ __ ] does that look

00:27:07.919 --> 00:27:09.760
like into most people whether it's the

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.400
[ __ ] white people that are [ __ ] uh

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.919
liberal that's never been around black

00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:15.919
people like in this [ __ ] area that

00:27:15.919 --> 00:27:17.679
we're in right now [ __ ] towson and

00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:19.679
timonium and [ __ ] like that but you go a

00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:21.600
little bit further [ __ ] 83 and all

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.279
that [ __ ] [ __ ] changes and i'm

00:27:23.279 --> 00:27:24.559
telling you bro like they're

00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:26.559
[ __ ] out there they are around

00:27:26.559 --> 00:27:27.760
black people you know what i'm saying

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.360
when they come down into this black ass

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.799
city they're around black people when

00:27:30.799 --> 00:27:32.559
they go to ravens games when they go to

00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:34.240
[ __ ] utah street and sitting in

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.080
pickles and [ __ ] like that the problem

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.320
ends up being for me bro is the [ __ ]

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.320
false pretenses on both sides in my

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.720
opinion do not [ __ ] even out because

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.799
the human cost of the [ __ ] republican

00:27:44.799 --> 00:27:47.120
agenda is very very real because it's

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.559
way more corporate

00:27:48.559 --> 00:27:51.039
for the average person we're not talking

00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:52.559
about the defense budget is going to be

00:27:52.559 --> 00:27:54.720
any different no matter who the party is

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.559
the [ __ ] yeah i'm saying israel israel's

00:27:56.559 --> 00:27:58.080
gonna still get paid they're getting

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.840
paid the saudis are getting there yeah

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:00.960
yeah they're gonna [ __ ] touch the

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.399
crystal ball and all of that [ __ ] yeah

00:28:02.399 --> 00:28:04.480
i'm just saying shane like

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.159
when i [ __ ] look at the [ __ ]

00:28:06.159 --> 00:28:07.440
i'm just like you're when you tell me

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.960
what you're cool with

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.039
when you tell me what you're cool with

00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:12.720
from something that you don't have to

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.039
participate in yeah

00:28:15.039 --> 00:28:16.240
i go out of your way to make

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.840
[ __ ] know how you feel it's

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.000
like all right i see where you at

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.320
it sounds to me though there's there's

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.720
the slight argument for the trump thing

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.840
okay i heard it in there the trump thing

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.799
is

00:28:28.799 --> 00:28:31.360
here's a [ __ ] grenade into the system

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.799
because the system isn't working right

00:28:32.799 --> 00:28:35.679
now or it it is but it's not working for

00:28:35.679 --> 00:28:37.520
everybody and

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.880
so crooked

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.720
trump that's my only question well i see

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.799
that's the thing the crooked thing

00:28:42.799 --> 00:28:44.480
i don't think he's

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.039
more crooked than any of those people

00:28:47.039 --> 00:28:48.640
for the most part obviously there's some

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.159
good politicians but if he's not a

00:28:50.159 --> 00:28:52.559
corrupt politician then why do we excuse

00:28:52.559 --> 00:28:54.080
his crookedness right the people who

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.760
support him if they're saying that

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.360
politicians are crooked in this whole

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.279
brand is that he's not one why do you

00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:01.200
accept him being crooked

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.640
i think him

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.320
being crooked

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.120
was i think he was fairly upfront about

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.200
it that's true like when they when they

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.960
were like did you pay taxes he's like no

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.039
i i'm good at business i found loopholes

00:29:13.039 --> 00:29:14.640
like [ __ ] like that where he would like

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.760
when he was on stage with the

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.039
republicans

00:29:17.039 --> 00:29:19.279
and he was just like raising he's like

00:29:19.279 --> 00:29:20.720
all these people took money from me

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.480
right they'll do whatever i say right

00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:25.520
he was

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.880
shining a light that none of them would

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.399
ever shine against each other ever

00:29:28.399 --> 00:29:30.320
straight up they're all

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.840
i think when you get to a point where

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.760
you're like republicans democrats are on

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.360
the same team yeah they're the same

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.039
[ __ ] thing 100 there's almost no

00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:38.000
difference

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.240
it's really tough to find glaring

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.520
differences when we're looking at an

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.240
entire spectrum of politics i agree

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.799
and then you see this guy who's like

00:29:46.799 --> 00:29:48.720
[ __ ] this and you see all these factory

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.640
workers that's where they got the white

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.799
the white people but i mean he went when

00:29:52.799 --> 00:29:54.640
he beat hillary he went to the midwest

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.559
she didn't she ignored it and he was

00:29:56.559 --> 00:29:57.679
like we're going to bring jobs back

00:29:57.679 --> 00:29:59.279
we're going to bring factories here

00:29:59.279 --> 00:30:00.720
we're giving them away the people that

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.399
are making the most money are selling

00:30:02.399 --> 00:30:04.000
them overseas

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.480
and i mean that's

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.320
i think when you get to the point where

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.440
you're like i don't really see a

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.640
difference between republicans and

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.559
democrats that's when trump starts to

00:30:12.559 --> 00:30:14.640
become more appealing or the idea of an

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.320
outsider just coming in and [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.559
up the same way bernie's appealing

00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:22.159
where it's not an outsider though right

00:30:22.159 --> 00:30:24.000
he kind of is he's i understand what

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.279
you're saying but

00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:26.960
fundamentally he's not right he's been

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.720
there i think politically he is but yeah

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.000
you know what i'm saying he's worried i

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.360
follow you though

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.320
it's the same way ron paul was

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.679
he was an outsider he's been a lifelong

00:30:35.679 --> 00:30:37.840
politician but he's he's an outsider

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.760
and and and look what happened to bernie

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.679
he was an outsider so they just they

00:30:41.679 --> 00:30:43.360
they just made it they made him kiss the

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.720
ring twice

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.480
in front of everybody it was [ __ ] it

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.440
was humiliating yeah and

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.679
uh i don't know i i did again i didn't

00:30:51.679 --> 00:30:52.880
vote for trump but i don't think that

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.480
guy obviously should have ever been a

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.600
president

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.080
but right i think what we did as a

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.159
country gave us trump and it led us to

00:31:00.159 --> 00:31:02.960
trump okay and he was kind of

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.360
the result of what we were doing the

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.880
last since world war ii okay you know

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.120
so i don't know so

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.640
i'm an idiot

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.320
just so we're clear on this on the

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.159
record you are but you're not though

00:31:16.159 --> 00:31:17.760
right because

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.000
you can't like you can't know as much

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
you as much as you know about how we got

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.760
to this place

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.080
to not understand where we get i studied

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.840
history i majored in history in college

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.080
i like history going to visit antietam

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.799
tomorrow go to the battlefield yeah yeah

00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:34.799
yeah i love the civil war

00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:36.399
i'm all about it do you play that that

00:31:36.399 --> 00:31:38.480
[ __ ] first person shooter on no i

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.080
need to though that thing looks [ __ ]

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.679
awesome it does look pretty god that

00:31:41.679 --> 00:31:43.279
thing looks good it does look like yeah

00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:44.159
yeah

00:31:44.159 --> 00:31:45.440
forget what it's called it's like war of

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.799
honor or something some [ __ ] like that

00:31:46.799 --> 00:31:48.480
yeah [ __ ] looks good yo but it's real

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.600
[ __ ] like you got really got to lose

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.039
yeah you got to pay attention like a

00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:53.360
[ __ ] yeah

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.039
but yeah the history is the most

00:31:55.039 --> 00:31:56.399
important thing when it comes to trying

00:31:56.399 --> 00:31:57.760
to figure out

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.080
why we're here right and where we're at

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.760
and there's here's one thing that's been

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.120
bothering the [ __ ] out of me okay

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.559
because i got an argument the other the

00:32:04.559 --> 00:32:05.760
other night not an argument me and my

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.240
friend were just talking he's he's his

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.559
dad's from series muslim he was talking

00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:12.840
about how the the the muslim

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:15.310
world controlled the world for

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:16.480
[Music]

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.720
almost a thousand years up until about

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.760
1800 that's when he would say

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.159
europe became the world's power and i

00:32:24.159 --> 00:32:26.240
was like i think you're off by several

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.559
centuries but

00:32:28.559 --> 00:32:30.159
i don't know he was getting his

00:32:30.159 --> 00:32:31.600
information from

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.360
the uh 1619 project okay isn't that what

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.159
it's called 1619 i have not actually

00:32:38.159 --> 00:32:39.760
read saying that american history

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.399
actually started in 1619 with like the

00:32:42.399 --> 00:32:43.919
first

00:32:43.919 --> 00:32:45.440
kind of like the first slaves that were

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.360
brought here i don't know it's very

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.480
centered on that and it's like

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.559
it's just this history of white europe

00:32:52.559 --> 00:32:55.519
invented racism that type of thing

00:32:55.519 --> 00:32:57.519
and it's very like

00:32:57.519 --> 00:32:59.039
it's just not i don't know i don't know

00:32:59.039 --> 00:33:01.200
it's a weird thing to put on

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.600
a group i like genocide

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.279
it's kind of asserted there's a show on

00:33:05.279 --> 00:33:07.200
hbo called kill all the brutes i saw the

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.440
first episode and i was just like wow

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.519
shit's wild okay once you find out the

00:33:11.519 --> 00:33:13.360
guy's from haiti you'll start to see

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.840
you'll start to see his bias okay he's

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.159
he like i would imagine he's biased if

00:33:18.159 --> 00:33:19.200
you're haitian

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.960
it's probably fair to have some bias

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.720
of course i think if you're anything

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.320
it's fair to be biased you're going to

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.960
have bias that's what happens

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.480
uh people are not allowed to have buy

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.810
shame relief of course relax relax

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:33.430
[Laughter]

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:34.799
[Music]

00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:36.799
and it's it's just like

00:33:36.799 --> 00:33:38.799
i don't know i obviously that guy

00:33:38.799 --> 00:33:40.399
without a doubt knows more about history

00:33:40.399 --> 00:33:41.679
than me the guy who made the [ __ ] who

00:33:41.679 --> 00:33:44.320
made the film yes ten times more than me

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.720
but i can still pick up on

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.080
some bias

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:48.960
and like

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.120
he he excludes so he talks in this

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.120
documentary about like genocide okay and

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.480
we're way off the [ __ ] subject i'm

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.399
sorry don't matter but he's talking

00:33:56.399 --> 00:33:58.240
about how like

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.559
white people invented genocide

00:34:00.559 --> 00:34:02.559
and it's like bro

00:34:02.559 --> 00:34:04.799
who the [ __ ] was genghis khan

00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:06.960
and

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.399
was decapitating cities not genocide and

00:34:10.399 --> 00:34:11.760
then it gets into this argument of like

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:12.960
white people invented the power

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.480
structure of race

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.919
and all this stuff and it's like i don't

00:34:15.919 --> 00:34:17.119
know

00:34:17.119 --> 00:34:20.960
i don't know when did whatever so well

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.359
[ __ ] it [ __ ] it nah nah not for real

00:34:23.359 --> 00:34:25.679
because so you know a lot about world

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:27.839
history besides just like u.s history a

00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:30.960
little bit not as much okay but yeah but

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:34.720
slavery is a human institution as far as

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.040
like since organized civilization has

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.879
existed right it's still going we've had

00:34:38.879 --> 00:34:40.879
slavery from day one

00:34:40.879 --> 00:34:43.839
until today right yes it was in africa

00:34:43.839 --> 00:34:45.760
it was in south america it was

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.200
everywhere

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.960
it was everywhere humans were humans it

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.639
was in north america before the

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:53.119
europeans got here this is correct yes

00:34:53.119 --> 00:34:54.399
so

00:34:54.399 --> 00:34:57.359
and i and i by the way um i don't mean

00:34:57.359 --> 00:34:59.920
to [ __ ] drop out of context [ __ ]

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.440
uh reference but yo when you were

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.359
[ __ ] talking about i think on one of

00:35:03.359 --> 00:35:05.920
your tar core history episodes yeah

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.160
the indigenous tribes [ __ ] expression

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.200
i mean bro when you were talking about

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.720
how they used to mash on [ __ ]

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:11.520
bro

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.440
that [ __ ] was [ __ ] crazy they ruled

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.480
but yeah um

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.800
i think that what makes

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.359
what makes american

00:35:21.359 --> 00:35:24.240
chattel slavery so unique

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.720
is the fact that you have

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.200
derelicts basically from a country

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.800
leaving the country

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.119
gangster in another country from the

00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:34.800
people that were there

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.760
under the [ __ ] guys of we are men who

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.440
need to be free

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:41.440
and i think we're talking about in a

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.160
modern context because 300 years ago in

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.800
this in the space of humanity

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.520
is a very small amount of time right

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.440
so 400 years

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.960
whatever the number is we want to say

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.880
where it becomes because what you also

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.640
probably know is that slavery in the

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.200
beginning was not race-based in america

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.119
we knew in the beginning it wasn't until

00:36:01.119 --> 00:36:04.000
1689 that slavery actually became based

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.720
on no africans who come here are slaves

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.640
yeah and do not have a pathway to buying

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.640
their freedom and you're born slaves

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.480
whereas if you came here a slave in the

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.720
beginning your children were not born

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.720
slaves automatically yes they had them

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.640
say yeah yeah yeah so this is the stuff

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.800
where we where if you want and i'm not

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.240
sticking up for the 60-19 product

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.359
because i don't i'm not familiar with it

00:36:23.359 --> 00:36:24.560
yeah other than i want to make sure it

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.480
is 16 19. i know what you're talking

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.920
about because out of bay wells on

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.440
twitter got [ __ ] heard what you call

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.119
it pulled from unc behind it i know

00:36:31.119 --> 00:36:32.800
about it i just haven't actually like

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.800
sat there studied i listened it you know

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.640
what i listened to there was a podcast

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.119
thing on it and it it's it's good it's

00:36:39.119 --> 00:36:41.200
interesting it's it's it's good [ __ ] it

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.119
is good and you learn about like i never

00:36:43.119 --> 00:36:45.200
learned about [ __ ] black farmers in

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.800
mississippi right now having a tough

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.400
time like i had no idea how that [ __ ]

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.320
worked right but yeah all right sorry

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:53.119
well what i'm all i'm saying bro um

00:36:53.119 --> 00:36:54.400
is that

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.920
the problem

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.760
i think especially now but it also is

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.680
gay i just want to include that just for

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:00.720
my boys that are definitely going to

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.160
listen to this you have 69 to practice

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.079
okay so

00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:04.900
i got to keep it real

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.839
[Laughter]

00:37:07.839 --> 00:37:09.119
yeah i'm definitely going to have some

00:37:09.119 --> 00:37:12.160
explaining to do to my people

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.220
he can't [ __ ] go upside his head

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.839
[Laughter]

00:37:15.839 --> 00:37:17.760
nah man but this is this is what it's

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.920
about bro and and

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:23.200
i think when we talk about like

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.720
you remember on south park where they

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.599
had the underpants gnomes yes and it was

00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:30.079
collect underpants something yeah

00:37:30.079 --> 00:37:31.040
question

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.400
prophet

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:36.400
america yeah white america has chosen to

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.280
make

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.960
by and large

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.119
in the aggregate at rest whatever we

00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:42.960
want to say

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.880
on a baseline

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.000
the whole black the whole chinese

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.640
the whole mexican the whole

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:53.359
[ __ ] indigenous struggle the

00:37:53.359 --> 00:37:54.720
question mark

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.720
part of the [ __ ] underpants dome

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.800
formula yeah but the only reason it's a

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.240
question mark is because they do

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.680
everything they can

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.079
to [ __ ] constantly [ __ ] draw that

00:38:04.079 --> 00:38:06.079
question mark over top of it when you

00:38:06.079 --> 00:38:08.079
got the whole state of texas saying that

00:38:08.079 --> 00:38:09.760
[ __ ] slaves become

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.359
immigrant workers in their whatever

00:38:11.359 --> 00:38:13.920
latest addition to textbooks it becomes

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.240
very disingenuous and we talk about we

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.520
understand how much we're being

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.560
programmed

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.480
to [ __ ] be consumers and to be debt

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.839
slaves and everything like that no

00:38:21.839 --> 00:38:24.160
matter what level of society we occupy

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.560
it's just a different version of that so

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.280
the way i'm looking at it as a dude who

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:32.000
[ __ ] grew up around various types of

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.160
people in various settings [ __ ] like

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.720
i have a [ __ ] frame of

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.079
reference that

00:38:38.079 --> 00:38:40.160
shows me all right like people who have

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.920
money people who don't have money slight

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.000
differences [ __ ] these people

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.920
they have [ __ ] the juice out the can

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.359
these people have the [ __ ]

00:38:47.359 --> 00:38:49.440
individual [ __ ] juice packs and [ __ ]

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.040
like all right big difference you know

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:51.760
yes

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.680
but at the end of the day

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.599
i think the problem ends up being for

00:38:55.599 --> 00:38:57.280
especially for me now bro and i don't

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.880
have no [ __ ] shame in saying this

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.640
because the [ __ ] the the case has

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.560
been made shout out to sandy darity but

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.240
[ __ ] the case has been made for the

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.400
[ __ ] cash reparations it just has

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.720
been because at this point bro if the

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.560
government has if the american

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.160
government specifically has [ __ ]

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.240
given money to the [ __ ] jews from the

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.160
holocaust that the americans supposedly

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.560
didn't even [ __ ] participate in

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.320
yeah let's go they're saying you know

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.200
let's go

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:22.720
let's get it

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.000
this is really funny too this is gonna

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.760
be another one with a hood

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:28.180
the black dudes in the white trash unite

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:30.480
[Laughter]

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.640
but no look i'm not getting anti-specks

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.640
dude i'm not either i'm not either of

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.079
course of course i'm talking about the

00:39:36.079 --> 00:39:37.760
government i'm talking about the us

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:40.079
government's history of of putting [ __ ]

00:39:40.079 --> 00:39:42.480
right or at least doing a gesture yes to

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.119
do that my thing ends up being i don't

00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:46.880
know what the number is i don't know

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.480
what the [ __ ]

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.480
what the what the payout looks like i

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.160
don't know what i don't know anything

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.040
besides it can't just be nothing it

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.040
can't just be now all of a sudden

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.800
juneteenth is a holiday and harriet

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.400
tubman's on the 20.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.320
you follow what i'm saying yes

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.720
i totally follow you and it sounds

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.720
if i mean if what i know about how we're

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.839
going to handle reparations yeah i mean

00:40:08.839 --> 00:40:10.960
dude this is this is literally

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.520
well first off no chance right step one

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.599
we need to acknowledge it's not gonna

00:40:15.599 --> 00:40:16.640
happen

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.160
i think

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.319
i would and that's just

00:40:20.319 --> 00:40:21.599
you gotta

00:40:21.599 --> 00:40:24.720
there's also think about dude would you

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.880
what if what if it turns out

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.000
you

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.359
did not have ancestors that were slaves

00:40:31.359 --> 00:40:33.920
and you have to pay

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.680
how would you feel well i think the

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.200
thing is though is it everybody have to

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.359
pay if it's coming out the government's

00:40:39.359 --> 00:40:40.480
money

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.000
well

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.319
i don't because this is my whole thing

00:40:44.319 --> 00:40:45.920
okay so yeah so that's

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.920
is fake right our money is it does not

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:49.760
exist of course they press a button all

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.280
of a sudden we all got money yeah they

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.640
press a button we ain't got no money and

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:54.880
that seems bad i don't like that i don't

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:55.920
like the

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.640
i didn't like the

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.760
i i'm interested to find out how we

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.400
would discover who had slaves right or

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:07.119
who who who came from

00:41:07.119 --> 00:41:08.560
slavery right

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.960
uh because that's

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.160
that's gonna be interesting what year

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.400
did the fugitive slave act [ __ ] get

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.720
past because they're talking dred scott

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.040
the when the fugitive slave act what did

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.800
the actual act that was passed by

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.000
congress there was like i think the

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.160
missouri compromise was like 1850 so it

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.440
was around like 1857 i think was dred

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.920
scott there was what could be wrong all

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.359
right so i just got a portrait of john

00:41:31.359 --> 00:41:32.319
brown

00:41:32.319 --> 00:41:34.240
yeah did you really yes yo shout out to

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:37.119

ruled bro shout out to [ __ ] john

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.119
brown yeah but we might have to pause

00:41:41.119 --> 00:41:43.200
and do a google yeah

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.760
john brown ducks on the road but i know

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.440
that there's a year like early in the

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.000
1800s where every slave was basically

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.079
registered with the government so there

00:41:52.079 --> 00:41:54.000
should be a birth certificate in at

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.160
least a year for just about damn i by

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.520
the way i got dred scott right it was

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.760
1857.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.880
uh-huh

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:02.480
come on

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.730
hold up hold up an honor

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:06.960
[Laughter]

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:07.920
damn

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:11.280
but [ __ ] uh

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.440
i'm saying like

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:14.640
i don't know what the number is i don't

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.839
know what the gesture is i don't know

00:42:15.839 --> 00:42:17.760
what it needs to be i know i i need them

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.160
to say you know what we studied it we're

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.880
not gonna do it because the xyz reasons

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.800
and we either sit on that [ __ ] or we

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.319
burn this whole [ __ ] death

00:42:26.319 --> 00:42:27.920
neither one of those things is gonna be

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.359
[ __ ] productive neither one of those

00:42:29.359 --> 00:42:31.040
things is gonna really square it up but

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.200
at least you can say

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.880
the worst thing they could say is no and

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.319
you really put them in the task that's

00:42:36.319 --> 00:42:37.680
where i have a problem with a lot of

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.839
hardcore black democrats is because you

00:42:39.839 --> 00:42:41.280
ain't doing nothing but pushing the gay

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.960
agenda forward pushing the anti-gun

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.440
agenda forward pushing the pro [ __ ]

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.880
uh

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.440
super over [ __ ] correction agenda

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.680
forward where i'm like it's not in the

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.440
right places from where i can see like

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.880
you're not pushing criminal justice

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.319
reform forward you're not pushing

00:42:56.319 --> 00:42:58.000
cronyism out of this [ __ ] you're not

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.480
getting money out of politics well

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.160
we want people to have no power anyway

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:03.440
it's too late

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.560
i don't know if it's too late we're

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.240
going to need something but

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.640
the money is in politics it's too it's

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.119
latched in the lobbyists all that [ __ ]

00:43:11.119 --> 00:43:13.680
it's we're pretty [ __ ] in that

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.480
um

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.400
when it comes to the oh yeah i think the

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.119
reparations thing would be so

00:43:19.119 --> 00:43:21.280
now let's say you your ancestors were

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.640
not slaves

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.960
you're owed no reparations

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.480
however that doesn't make up for the

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.640
fact that you've experienced

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.800
the racism that came behind it

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.319
but you're still not entitled to it

00:43:32.319 --> 00:43:34.640
because you technically you were not

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.880
coming from slave ancestors so it's very

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.880
complicated i think in that department

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.640
now also there's the other side of it

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:41.839
where

00:43:41.839 --> 00:43:44.240
you know my my [ __ ] food we live here

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.000
my family never owned slaves we came

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.680
over here now

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.599
we have money now so

00:43:49.599 --> 00:43:50.880
there's not really but now there's

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.160
there's families

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.560
that were poor that were always poor

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.720
they fought to abol they died abolishing

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.000
slavery

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.280
and

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.200
let's say there is some factory [ __ ]

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.280
worker in ohio

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.119
and it's like hey

00:44:05.119 --> 00:44:06.640
you know this month

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.319
this much is coming out of your paycheck

00:44:08.319 --> 00:44:09.680
to pay for

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.160
1865.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.240
and it's like bro

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.680
it's just and

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.200
it's just that it's

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.960
i can't imagine

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.200
how that would get done i can't without

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:24.160
a [ __ ] civil war which is what's like

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:26.000
which is why

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.160
black people don't salute the flag which

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:30.000
is why black people are like [ __ ] white

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.880
people because there be there comes a

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.280
moment where it's like all right yo

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.119
you know what i mean to your point

00:44:37.119 --> 00:44:39.040
we should be sending money we still set

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.160
up money to

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.319
sure we should do it all i mean america

00:44:42.319 --> 00:44:44.560
prints money there's literally

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.319
and i think that the more free money

00:44:46.319 --> 00:44:48.560
they give the less control they have the

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.000
less people give [ __ ] about doing

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.160
anything besides what they want to do

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.920
and [ __ ] whatever the [ __ ] but when

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.599
we talk about

00:44:55.599 --> 00:44:57.520
wait what did what did you mean by that

00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:58.319
so

00:44:58.319 --> 00:44:59.920
like

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.440
they're giving stimulus checks out

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.520
they're giving [ __ ] the child tax

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.200
credit which you get at tax time but

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.200
they're prorating it out and and yeah in

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.839
advance payments and all [ __ ] like that

00:45:09.839 --> 00:45:12.000
if they're putting ubi style money in

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
people's hands what we are also seeing

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.839
is now a gallon of milk is seven dollars

00:45:15.839 --> 00:45:17.920
and [ __ ] all the other little now now

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:21.760
all of a sudden we venezuela [ __ ] but

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.680
what i think in the obviously i'm joking

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:26.800
in the [ __ ] but what i'm saying is is

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.119
you know if they if they start to just

00:45:29.119 --> 00:45:31.280
let people have money then they don't

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.040
get to control people in the same way

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.640
we're seeing it right now every single

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.319
mcdonald's every single [ __ ]

00:45:36.319 --> 00:45:38.240
walmart all these places like yo please

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.760
come work for this little bush or that

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.920
starvation wages that you can't [ __ ]

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.400
live off of in any [ __ ] city

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.480
so [ __ ] like wow man is that because

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.720
of the the stimulus checks in the ubi

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.640
that i don't think it's because of that

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.760
shame okay it's because not by itself i

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.520
think that that's gonna be some [ __ ]

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:58.240
that contributes to people saying yo if

00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.920
i'm going to work you're going to pay me

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.400
because back in the [ __ ] pre

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.640
uh

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.839
pre-desegregation days

00:46:05.839 --> 00:46:08.319
you could work a [ __ ] ass job and

00:46:08.319 --> 00:46:10.800
still have a house and still have a car

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.960
out [ __ ] bundy was a [ __ ] retail

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.680
worker and that was in 1988 or whatever

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.440
the [ __ ] 1986

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.280
we're talking about this is shame why i

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:21.280
get so [ __ ] like i don't respect a

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.520
lot of people who really go hard for

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.520
republicans because i'm like yo

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.359
the [ __ ] eisenhower [ __ ] and all

00:46:27.359 --> 00:46:29.280
those [ __ ] presidents i mean

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.599
all those [ __ ] uh legislative

00:46:31.599 --> 00:46:34.319
branches that that came after jfk and

00:46:34.319 --> 00:46:36.800
came after the civil rights act and all

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.160
of that [ __ ]

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.400
was designed to say nah [ __ ] that you're

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.560
not cutting them in you're not cutting

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.160
them in we're talking about recent

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:46.319
history in our parents lifetime sure

00:46:46.319 --> 00:46:47.760
we're talking about where we will

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.760
[ __ ] crash this whole system i'm

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.000
sending my jobs to bangladesh before

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.480
[ __ ] has this job over a good god fair

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.480
white man we're talking about now we got

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.560
the unions [ __ ] building up not to

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.240
[ __ ] make sure that the work is

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.839
this and this and that is to protect the

00:47:01.839 --> 00:47:04.240
integrity of the white jedi i don't i

00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:05.599
don't think

00:47:05.599 --> 00:47:07.200
the people at the top

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.760
care if it's a poor white person or a

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.920
poor black person working i don't think

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.079
they care here let me say this okay this

00:47:14.079 --> 00:47:15.440
is this is an interesting thing because

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.680
i was i listened to this thing on the

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.839
the haitian revolution okay so it's a

00:47:19.839 --> 00:47:21.760
podcast called revolutions there's like

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:23.839
a [ __ ] 30-hour thing on the haitian

00:47:23.839 --> 00:47:26.079
revolution it's awesome it's awesome

00:47:26.079 --> 00:47:27.680
okay and

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.280
one thing that the french did this is

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.040
kind of it always brought me it always

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.480
reminded me this is

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.359
the french in order to keep haiti kind

00:47:35.359 --> 00:47:36.000
of

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.520
under control

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:39.440
was they had

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.440
there was there was poor whites and

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.720
there was

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:43.599
free

00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:46.319
black guys and slaves okay the whole

00:47:46.319 --> 00:47:48.480
island was slaves i mean it was a ton of

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.880
[ __ ] slaves like ten to one slaves on

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.599
haiti and uh

00:47:53.599 --> 00:47:55.359
one thing that the government did to

00:47:55.359 --> 00:47:58.720
ensure they didn't unite the poor whites

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.559
and the poor blacks was they started

00:48:00.559 --> 00:48:03.760
instituting these tiny laws that just

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:04.559
were

00:48:04.559 --> 00:48:05.760
racist

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.319
enough that it gave the white people

00:48:08.319 --> 00:48:10.880
some power the poor whites over the poor

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:13.280
blacks so it would be like it'd be kind

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.760
of the equivalent today of a weed charge

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.200
you know i mean if you get arrested for

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.599
for wheat it'd be like

00:48:19.599 --> 00:48:22.160
be a tiny little thing like that that

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:24.079
just gives the poor whites enough power

00:48:24.079 --> 00:48:25.839
that they want the system to stay the

00:48:25.839 --> 00:48:29.200
same precisely and i think we run into

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.720
that exact thing today where the people

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:32.800
at the top they don't give a [ __ ] who's

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.480
working the factory if the guy has white

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.319
skin or black skin but a way that they

00:48:36.319 --> 00:48:38.240
can kind of maintain staying at the top

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.920
is by dividing the

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:42.240
the bottom and and one way they do it is

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.000
kind of like because

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.319
all right i'm getting off topic

00:48:46.319 --> 00:48:48.000
i think right now i think right now

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.040
we're seeing

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.720
like the every single commercial as

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:52.720
black lives matter every single [ __ ]

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.160
show is

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:57.440
we need to like i'm i'm in a i'm at a

00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.000
baseball game and it's like end racism

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:00.880
it's like

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.920
all right for sure but i think it's

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.200
divisive

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:08.559
i think these messages are divisive

00:49:08.559 --> 00:49:09.599
because

00:49:09.599 --> 00:49:11.040
there's poor white people looking around

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:12.960
like i didn't start the war in the

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.079
middle east

00:49:14.079 --> 00:49:16.319
like i didn't [ __ ] these massive

00:49:16.319 --> 00:49:18.160
problems like i don't know it's

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.240
so check it out and it's just i'm try i

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.440
didn't the middle east part didn't make

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.440
sense but what i'm trying to say

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.280
is

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.880
like

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.599
a white dude watching tv every night

00:49:29.599 --> 00:49:31.839
he lives in [ __ ] iowa and he's just

00:49:31.839 --> 00:49:33.920
looking at this and it's like

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.680
what the [ __ ] like you're

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:36.960
you remember when the nfl was doing

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:39.599
commercials like stop hitting women

00:49:39.599 --> 00:49:42.079
it's like dude i'm not hitting women

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:43.920
why are you shoving this down my throat

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:48.319
every day i'm not hitting women right um

00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:50.240
i think it's not

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.000
that we're doing it wrong the

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.920
corporations have gotten involved with

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:56.240
the activism and they're shoving it down

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:58.400
people's throats instead of there's got

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:00.640
to be a better way for us to come about

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:03.119
handling this because this is not it i

00:50:03.119 --> 00:50:05.280
know that this is not it straight up i

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.119
i'm just certain that this can't be how

00:50:07.119 --> 00:50:08.079
it's done

00:50:08.079 --> 00:50:10.079
it's it's it's true man and we're going

00:50:10.079 --> 00:50:11.440
to go ahead and get you up out of here

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.200
as soon as we get ready for the show man

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.200
oh we got we got time yeah

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.200
yeah all right man i don't i want to end

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:20.000
on some type of unifying message before

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.720
i i feel like this conversation is unity

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.160
yeah i think it's the nature of this

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.160
conversation and the energy behind it is

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.839
unity because we're not two people who

00:50:27.839 --> 00:50:29.760
fundamentally disagree with each other

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:32.079
we're two people who i feel like can

00:50:32.079 --> 00:50:34.240
have the space to understand how easy it

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.640
feels while being more sympathetic to

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.559
the shot the [ __ ] that we identify with

00:50:38.559 --> 00:50:40.880
and grew up around so it's not it's not

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:42.640
to me like like this is this is

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.800
typically a telltale sign for me with

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.160
white dudes and whether or not they're

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:47.359
on [ __ ]

00:50:47.359 --> 00:50:50.160
is when a white person makes a black

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.160
reference there's a way that white

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.839
people who've been around black people

00:50:53.839 --> 00:50:55.520
or who at the very least understand the

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:58.240
etiquette of [ __ ] how to [ __ ] push

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:01.040
the line as a love tap versus a [ __ ]

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.960
slap in the back of the neck so if

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.960
somebody goes into their [ __ ] aunt

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:07.200
jemima voice and [ __ ] like that this is

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.960
an automatic person that i want to give

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.480
the hands you know what i'm saying like

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:11.839
i don't give a [ __ ] how funny what you

00:51:11.839 --> 00:51:14.000
said was like as soon as you go into no

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.079
but sometimes it's funny dude listen i

00:51:16.079 --> 00:51:17.839
get it listen to where i'm going shane i

00:51:17.839 --> 00:51:20.160
hear you it can be funny i know it can

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.520
be funny

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.800
i'm not saying it can't be funny

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.000
when people when people who make those

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.839
jokes though because it depends on the

00:51:29.839 --> 00:51:31.760
reference you're making shame of course

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:33.359
if you're making a reference that's like

00:51:33.359 --> 00:51:35.760
yo this is somebody who's clearly spent

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.520
time around black people

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.680
and clearly understands the [ __ ]

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.000
culture from their lens

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.480
enough to know not to overstep i can

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:46.559
accept that [ __ ] of course and actually

00:51:46.559 --> 00:51:48.240
i can [ __ ] really be a fan of that

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.400
[ __ ] yeah what i'm talking more about is

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:51.359
like

00:51:51.359 --> 00:51:53.040
when we have

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:55.200
when we have a [ __ ] whole ass

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.440
mentality about

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.520
how this [ __ ] is supposed to look in the

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:01.760
country and you have a group of people

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.520
that's consistently having a boot on

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.640
their neck

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:07.599
from a [ __ ] optical standpoint where

00:52:07.599 --> 00:52:09.520
just to look at somebody is like nah

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:11.520
chill yo that's a [ __ ] threat that's

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:12.880
this that's that

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.119
and you [ __ ] exalt enough of them to

00:52:15.119 --> 00:52:17.200
say well this person this person this

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.040
person this person exists so [ __ ]

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.640
obviously we're not [ __ ] having to

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:23.440
deal with anything now which who

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:25.520
would you say is being portrayed as a

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:27.200
threat

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.240
on today today we don't the the black

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:32.480
man and the black woman is such a

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.720
subconscious threat at this point that i

00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:36.640
don't even think you counted it's like

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:38.480
talking about the greatest receiver of

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.319
all time obviously the conversation

00:52:40.319 --> 00:52:41.040
started

00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:43.599
jerry rice

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:46.319
top five fight receivers off the door

00:52:46.319 --> 00:52:47.430
right now

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:49.119
[Laughter]

00:52:49.119 --> 00:52:53.839
tim dwight ed mccaffrey easy ed mcafee

00:52:53.839 --> 00:52:55.520
but now i'm saying all this man because

00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:57.280
it's like somebody like shane

00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:59.200
it it really curls me up when i see

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.880
shane being painted as a racist

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.400
[ __ ] where it's like bro like

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:04.240
you didn't even listen to the podcast

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.599
like you didn't even hear that they were

00:53:05.599 --> 00:53:07.839
mocking white dudes on the frontier in

00:53:07.839 --> 00:53:10.000
the bit like yeah that bothers me bro

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.280
like but at the same time it's like

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.119
it was just like on on chappelle's show

00:53:15.119 --> 00:53:17.040
when he was like sir my blackness can't

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:18.559
allow me to [ __ ] answer that question

00:53:18.559 --> 00:53:21.440
when he was on trial and [ __ ] it's like

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:23.440
shame when i see you bro i'mma [ __ ]

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:24.720
tell you how much i love you and how

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.240
much i'm [ __ ] rooting for you i

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:28.559
understand i'm not about to [ __ ] like

00:53:28.559 --> 00:53:30.240
because shane like like in that

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.720
situation it's like you don't have

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:35.040
like like

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:36.960
there's no there's not a lot of speeds

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:38.559
for [ __ ] defending white people as a

00:53:38.559 --> 00:53:41.440
black person so it's like

00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:43.280
if i'm aligned with somebody if i

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:44.559

00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.559
woman got shot to death but right it was

00:56:04.559 --> 00:56:06.000
funny when all those dudes because they

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.079

you guys aren't troops shut up

00:56:12.799 --> 00:56:15.280
but yeah i i think one thing about the

00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:17.040
conversation we had last time when i was

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.319
here was

00:56:18.319 --> 00:56:19.839
you were it was just a regular

00:56:19.839 --> 00:56:21.200
conversation we didn't record it we

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:23.440
should have it was good but it was like

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:25.359
you were like i was trying to explain

00:56:25.359 --> 00:56:28.240
how i know why my my

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.760
dad voted for trump i know why my

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:30.960
friends

00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:32.720
voted for trump yeah and i was trying to

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.319
like and then we got to this point where

00:56:34.319 --> 00:56:35.520
it was like

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.359
you know i hate to be hack and bring up

00:56:37.359 --> 00:56:40.400
chicago but it was kind of like

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:41.680
it's not like i was like where was the

00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:43.200
black lives matter protest in chicago

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:45.280
like all that and i did we did get there

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:47.280
somehow where we both agreed

00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.480
you were like yeah the media is not

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.240
covering the marches in chicago trying

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.720
to stop the violence at all ever and

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:54.079
here and

00:56:54.079 --> 00:56:56.480
so how is so how is a white guy in

00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:59.040
nebraska supposed to understand this

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.040
other than when he sees the television

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.319
it's [ __ ]

00:57:02.319 --> 00:57:04.400
looting a target because a guy got

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.440
killed

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.119
he doesn't see the the marches in

00:57:07.119 --> 00:57:08.880
chicago trying to stop the violence he

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:10.880
doesn't know about that right he doesn't

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:13.040
know so we're all getting presented

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:14.960
these narratives of each other instead

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:17.520
of ever talking to each other ever and

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:19.200
we've been presented these narratives so

00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.000
much

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.200
that like

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.400
we see each other and they're like oh

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.640
they hate me right it's out of a [ __ ]

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:26.480
self-insecurity where you're like oh

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:27.599
there's a bunch of black people here

00:57:27.599 --> 00:57:29.680
they hate me right you know and it's

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:31.280
like and then there's white people that

00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.960
feel that way and they go so over the

00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:35.760
top to be like huh i'm one of the good

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:38.640
ones and it's so [ __ ] annoying it's

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:41.280
disgusting yeah yeah and i was around

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:44.160
i'm around it so much in comedy yeah

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:46.240
it's just non-stop

00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.160
it's like the the industry that i'm in

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:49.359
yeah and that's one thing i bring up to

00:57:49.359 --> 00:57:51.680
my friends a lot and this is not race uh

00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:53.119

dollars for a decade right now i of

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:05.280
course i always had a safety net with my

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:06.799
family i could have always asked them

00:59:06.799 --> 00:59:09.200
for money i didn't but it was there i

00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:11.119
did have a safety net so me being like i

00:59:11.119 --> 00:59:12.880

00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:14.319
i could have gone home

00:59:14.319 --> 00:59:16.000
at any moment important that's important

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.040
to say that

00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:18.400
and that's that's an important thing

00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:20.319
that a lot of people

00:59:20.319 --> 00:59:22.799
when it comes to the race thing don't

00:59:22.799 --> 00:59:25.520
comprehend as much as the the family

00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.920
yeah and that's where i think a lot of

00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:29.760
the that's what my point was going to

00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:32.000
with there's a lot of confusion

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.200
where it's like

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:36.079
white not white people but like a lot of

00:59:36.079 --> 00:59:37.760
racist i don't [ __ ] i don't even want

00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:39.119
to call people racist i think that

00:59:39.119 --> 00:59:41.119
shit's played let's also say this too no

00:59:41.119 --> 00:59:43.599
individual is racist people are bigoted

00:59:43.599 --> 00:59:46.000
prejudiced systems are racist that's

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.720
[ __ ] humans are humans also like i'm

00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:50.640
gonna i've definitely said dumb [ __ ]

00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:53.040
yeah a thousand times i've said dumb

00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:53.920
[ __ ]

00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.640
i've thought dumb [ __ ] yeah and uh when

00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:58.240
we need to we need to get past the idea

00:59:58.240 --> 00:59:59.200
that

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.920
we we can't have bad thoughts right or

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.920
say dumb [ __ ] things sometimes i

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.720
agree if you say something [ __ ] dumb

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.880
like if i said something [ __ ] up about

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.160
race with you

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.160
if you were just like yo that was bad

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.920
i'd be like all right my bad you're

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.319
right i shouldn't have said that but the

01:00:16.319 --> 01:00:19.200
point i'm trying to get to is where

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.720
the the i think there's a weird thing

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.240
with the democrats and they're like

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.400
where they don't understand that

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.839
the black family had been kind of

01:00:26.839 --> 01:00:30.240
dismantled through regulations over the

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.480
last 50 years

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.160
and like

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.839
that's something we need to [ __ ] look

01:00:35.839 --> 01:00:38.079
in i mean the prison all that [ __ ] and

01:00:38.079 --> 01:00:40.079
these dudes that are trumpers these

01:00:40.079 --> 01:00:42.240
[ __ ] q anon dudes they're they're hip

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.000
to that a lot of them okay they're aware

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.119
of that

01:00:45.119 --> 01:00:47.119
so that is one there is some stuff with

01:00:47.119 --> 01:00:48.559
these like

01:00:48.559 --> 01:00:50.160
these [ __ ] right wing i mean i don't

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.200
even want to call them right when they

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.480
like i don't want to call them alt-right

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:53.760
because obviously they're not the dudes

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.960
marching saying [ __ ] about jews but

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.960
there's guys i know that are like

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.040
anti-democrat that are like

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.280
the black family was ripped apart by the

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.040
government you talk about crossover

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.720
between poor black poor white there's a

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.720
huge crossover between conspiracy white

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.240
and conspiracy black oh yeah you know

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.839
what i'm saying so there's there's

01:01:11.839 --> 01:01:13.760
there's definitely a lot of awareness

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.200
about that bro yeah and i'm not trying

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.280
to [ __ ] interrupt you but no no i've

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.599
kind of reached the i i the thing is i

01:01:19.599 --> 01:01:21.119
have good ideas and i don't know how to

01:01:21.119 --> 01:01:22.720
articulate them

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.599
nah bro if if you saw yourself on stage

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:28.079
you would disagree

01:01:28.079 --> 01:01:29.839
but [ __ ] not for real though is

01:01:29.839 --> 01:01:32.480
like i think that's that is significant

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.960
and when we're talking about our like

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.200
our generation we're born in the 80s you

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.200
know what i'm saying we [ __ ] you know

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.720
especially being more in the late 80s

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.079
where now like

01:01:42.079 --> 01:01:44.160
you know our our grandmothers have

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.000
probably been talking about black people

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.920
like our grandmothers might have been

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.160
able to actually be in a professional

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.000
work setting now and like actually have

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.760
an opportunity to get a government job

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.200
and work for social security or

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.720
unemployment office or some [ __ ] like

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:57.599
that

01:01:57.599 --> 01:01:59.440
and we have the first generation of

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:01.280
grandparents who have [ __ ] pensions

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.440
and [ __ ] like that and who have access

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.200
to military benefits and [ __ ] because

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.720
when we talk about when the middle class

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.640
was created as you know and you talk

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.559
about who didn't get the original gi

01:02:10.559 --> 01:02:12.079
bill [ __ ] provisions and [ __ ] you're

01:02:12.079 --> 01:02:13.280
talking about all these hundreds of

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.039
thousands not millions of black veterans

01:02:15.039 --> 01:02:16.720
from world war one and two at that point

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:19.359
right so [ __ ] when we talk about the

01:02:19.359 --> 01:02:22.319
creation of that safety net this is why

01:02:22.319 --> 01:02:24.160
i think when you when you were saying

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.280
earlier how are you going to explain to

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.880
that factory worker

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.319
that [ __ ]

01:02:28.319 --> 01:02:29.599
x this amount of money has to come out

01:02:29.599 --> 01:02:31.440
of his check i would counter that by

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.680
saying this much more money doesn't come

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.440
out of his check because he lives in a

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:36.960
house that his grandfather bought for

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.559
seven thousand dollars that's now worth

01:02:38.559 --> 01:02:40.559
four hundred thousand dollars or built

01:02:40.559 --> 01:02:42.799
with his [ __ ] bare hands on land that

01:02:42.799 --> 01:02:45.440
he had granted to him or [ __ ]

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.400
uh gift basically gifted to him in

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.720
comparison to how much one of my

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.400
grandfathers would have had to pay for

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.559
that same [ __ ] plot of land so when

01:02:54.559 --> 01:02:56.559
we talk about [ __ ] it's it is

01:02:56.559 --> 01:02:59.119
impossible to come up with a figure or

01:02:59.119 --> 01:03:00.880
whatever i'm a [ __ ] we're gonna end

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.319
it on some unity [ __ ] because hopefully

01:03:02.319 --> 01:03:04.640
we'll unify over this i think my idea

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.319
for reparations

01:03:06.319 --> 01:03:08.079
the framework for it and how it gets

01:03:08.079 --> 01:03:10.079
dealt out is my same framework for how

01:03:10.079 --> 01:03:12.720
we paid college athletes oh yeah we need

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:14.720
to pay college so this is my idea for

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:17.119
paying college athletes all right

01:03:17.119 --> 01:03:19.599
every athlete every sport

01:03:19.599 --> 01:03:22.240
every [ __ ] level has a base [ __ ]

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:26.160
pay badminton football bowling [ __ ]

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.720
water polo everybody right everybody

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:31.280
gets whatever the number is right 50

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:33.760
bucks a [ __ ] season yeah right

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:34.640
then

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.319
you get a [ __ ] bonus for your

01:03:36.319 --> 01:03:37.359
conference

01:03:37.359 --> 01:03:38.799
every [ __ ] player you went through

01:03:38.799 --> 01:03:40.480
the clearing house just like i did when

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:41.599
you go through the clearing house and

01:03:41.599 --> 01:03:42.960
you get your [ __ ] pin number

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:44.400
and [ __ ] that gives you your basically

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.039
your ncaa qr code as a [ __ ]

01:03:47.039 --> 01:03:50.319
contractor within the ncaa now i get my

01:03:50.319 --> 01:03:51.200
[ __ ]

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.520
i get my base ncaa [ __ ]

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:54.880
and only a percentage of that is

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.480
actually getting paid to me while i'm in

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:57.440
school

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.119
most of it is [ __ ] in an account

01:03:59.119 --> 01:04:00.880
[ __ ] and that that the day that i

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:03.039
rescind my or or renege not reneg

01:04:03.039 --> 01:04:04.720
[ __ ] uh what's the word relinquish my

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.960
eligibility and i say i'm forgoing

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.640
whatever i'm going pro

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:10.720
until i do that i can't touch most of

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:13.440
the money but they're gonna give me

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.839
whatever the amount is for being an ncaa

01:04:15.839 --> 01:04:17.839
athlete this amount of money for being

01:04:17.839 --> 01:04:19.680
in division whatever this amount of

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.839
money for being in this conference this

01:04:21.839 --> 01:04:23.760
amount of money for being at this school

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.599
this amount of money for being on this

01:04:25.599 --> 01:04:27.200
this [ __ ] team at this school this

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.960
amount of money for being all-conference

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:31.359
for being whatever a pride sticker

01:04:31.359 --> 01:04:33.520
equals money now whatever the case needs

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:36.160
to be but [ __ ] there is there's no

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.240
way in hell that the softball team at

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.000
[ __ ] elon should be getting paid as

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
much as the football team at elon and

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.760
nobody at elon should be getting paid as

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.520
much as the [ __ ] anybody at

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:47.760
michigan or [ __ ] whatever the case so

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:48.799
that's where the schools are gonna

01:04:48.799 --> 01:04:50.720
separate themselves it's already an

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.480
uneven playing field faking like it's

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.079
even sure take all the [ __ ] dark

01:04:54.079 --> 01:04:55.599
money out of this [ __ ] and make it so

01:04:55.599 --> 01:04:57.760
that yeah that five-star recruit and

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.440
[ __ ] basketball and [ __ ] football

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.119
yeah when he goes to alabama you know

01:05:01.119 --> 01:05:03.200
he's [ __ ] making 75k a season or

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.400
whatever it is

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.319
i mean it is it is

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:07.760
pretty preposterous that they're not

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:10.079
getting paid wild bro it's crazy and

01:05:10.079 --> 01:05:11.599
until

01:05:11.599 --> 01:05:14.160
if it's keeping me from getting ncaa the

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.880
video game we need to get this done

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.160
immediately

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.839
it's killing me well you know ncaa is

01:05:19.839 --> 01:05:20.839
coming back

01:05:20.839 --> 01:05:22.400
yeah [ __ ] i'm gonna die when it

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:24.240
comes out uh

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.079
yeah i mean the college athletes should

01:05:26.079 --> 01:05:28.000
be getting paid it's

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.920
i think i don't know man i i don't know

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.839
enough about how

01:05:31.839 --> 01:05:34.480
the economy works to even figure out

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:37.280
reparations at all right uh

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.680
i i do have a

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:42.160
it's tough because i think reliance on

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:43.280
the state

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.440
is bad i agree and

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:48.880
and if it i think it's weird to imagine

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:51.520
a way to wean

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.640
people off relying on the state by

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:57.680
giving them more reliance on the state

01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.839
is that if that makes like so i would

01:05:59.839 --> 01:06:01.839
say though a very very small portion of

01:06:01.839 --> 01:06:03.920
the country does not rely on the state

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:05.599
most of the country doesn't own their

01:06:05.599 --> 01:06:07.520
own contract and situation they don't

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.039
they're not their own bosses they don't

01:06:09.039 --> 01:06:11.599
have a [ __ ] pathway they're not shane

01:06:11.599 --> 01:06:13.680
who can [ __ ] like yeah carve his own

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.920
[ __ ] way and only answer to whoever

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.680
he wants to make the most money with you

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:19.039
know what i'm saying like there's a

01:06:19.039 --> 01:06:21.440
there most people belong to the system

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.280
whether it's [ __ ] because you work

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.039
for a corporation or whatever the case

01:06:25.039 --> 01:06:26.960
you're wrong yeah because if you lose

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:28.720
your job you don't have anything

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.319
versus somebody who's [ __ ] creating

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:31.839
it for themselves like that's a totally

01:06:31.839 --> 01:06:33.599
different experience i think that's a

01:06:33.599 --> 01:06:35.680
fundamental difference in the modern day

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:37.839
between the black and white experience

01:06:37.839 --> 01:06:39.920
is because most of our parents are broke

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.680
to [ __ ] put us in a situation where

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:43.119
we're not in the [ __ ] trenches and

01:06:43.119 --> 01:06:44.480
we're not [ __ ]

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:45.920
even that much more prone to be a

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.520
statistic somebody like me who always

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.200
grew up in a [ __ ] good part of the

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:51.359
city or on the outskirts of the city was

01:06:51.359 --> 01:06:53.039
[ __ ] like hey man it's the best she

01:06:53.039 --> 01:06:54.880
could do that's the best yeah my my

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.640
parents could do and [ __ ] at the end

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:59.200
of the day i feel like i was put into

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.119
all things considered good spot you know

01:07:01.119 --> 01:07:02.240
what i'm saying i have good home

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.319
training i [ __ ] have been exposed to

01:07:04.319 --> 01:07:05.760
a lot of information i've been some

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:08.079
places i've seen some things but [ __ ]

01:07:08.079 --> 01:07:10.640
i don't forget how quickly my whole [ __ ]

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.079
can be taken from me you know what i'm

01:07:12.079 --> 01:07:13.440
saying because somebody decided they

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.200
don't like me one day and if there's

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.960
gonna be a [ __ ] fundamental shift i

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.319
don't think it's ever gonna come from

01:07:18.319 --> 01:07:20.079
[ __ ] uh

01:07:20.079 --> 01:07:21.760
20 something 30 something year old white

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.680
women [ __ ] telling shane gillis that

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.680
he's racist telling somebody like me

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.119
that i'm homophobic because i don't

01:07:27.119 --> 01:07:28.880
think that [ __ ] trans athletes should

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:31.119
be playing against the [ __ ] sport

01:07:31.119 --> 01:07:32.640
that they didn't [ __ ] be birthed to

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.880
like yeah yeah that's that's [ __ ] that i

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:36.720
think is [ __ ] real [ __ ] that we have

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.079
to [ __ ] be able to talk about yeah i

01:07:38.079 --> 01:07:39.520
would rather we spend

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:42.160
17 episodes worth of conversations like

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.039
this

01:07:43.039 --> 01:07:45.680
maybe plus a [ __ ] dry erase board

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.039
where we can really start plotting some

01:07:47.039 --> 01:07:49.520
[ __ ] out but like past that shane like i

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.799
think man

01:07:50.799 --> 01:07:53.680
we have more unifying [ __ ] than ever of

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:55.280
course than ever now you know what i'm

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.400
saying so it's

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.160
i think the media talking about how they

01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:59.760
don't see they don't allow people to see

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:01.280
all the marches and stop the violence

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.880
and the hoods and stuff like that for

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:05.440
all of this time yeah but [ __ ]

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.720
where black people are sitting up here

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.319
like [ __ ] the only reason the hood

01:08:08.319 --> 01:08:10.400
exists is because of you [ __ ]

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:13.599
in the abstract agree i agree and it's

01:08:13.599 --> 01:08:15.280
but

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:18.080
there's just there's this thing of like

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:18.880
it's

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:22.000
i understand the concept of benefiting

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.159
from white supremacy it's not even

01:08:24.159 --> 01:08:26.480
necessarily a concept it is what it is

01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:27.839
right but

01:08:27.839 --> 01:08:29.920
there's also the idea of i didn't do

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.920
that of course i'm not paying for a

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.759
crime i didn't commit whether or not i

01:08:33.759 --> 01:08:35.359
benefited from it

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:37.359
i mean

01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:40.159
it's it's just a very [ __ ] and i hate

01:08:40.159 --> 01:08:42.239
to ever talk about anything seriously

01:08:42.239 --> 01:08:44.080
which is what we've done the last

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.159
[ __ ] hour and a half i hate having a

01:08:46.159 --> 01:08:47.679
serious conversation because

01:08:47.679 --> 01:08:48.880
it's good this is going to give me so

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:50.319
much anxiety

01:08:50.319 --> 01:08:51.759
i'm just going to be like man i hate

01:08:51.759 --> 01:08:53.279
[ __ ] that's why i never did an

01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:54.719
interview on the news about like when i

01:08:54.719 --> 01:08:56.000
was getting canceled like i was getting

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.759
calls from seeing i was like dude

01:08:57.759 --> 01:08:59.839
if i ever have to sit here and try to

01:08:59.839 --> 01:09:01.120
have a real conversation i'm going to

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:02.799
[ __ ] hate myself

01:09:02.799 --> 01:09:03.679
uh

01:09:03.679 --> 01:09:05.679
and i'm sure i misspoke on a ton of this

01:09:05.679 --> 01:09:06.719
[ __ ]

01:09:06.719 --> 01:09:09.839
and uh stop with the display machine

01:09:09.839 --> 01:09:11.120
i don't know if you understand as a

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.560
white man you got to have plenty of

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:13.759
disclaimers

01:09:13.759 --> 01:09:15.279
you have to

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:17.120
i don't have i literally don't have the

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.880
editing capabilities

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:20.640
yeah yeah you clip this [ __ ] properly no

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.640
it's fine no no no no play play straight

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.480
through i don't care but it's funny that

01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:25.759
was a patrice joke he was like

01:09:25.759 --> 01:09:27.600
reparations are

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.880
black people we get to say whatever we

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:30.799
want he's like that's the reparations

01:09:30.799 --> 01:09:32.719
it's like

01:09:32.719 --> 01:09:34.719
pretty funny because patrice had like

01:09:34.719 --> 01:09:36.799
you know he had a giant white fan base

01:09:36.799 --> 01:09:38.880
his fan base was from o a

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:41.520
i mean absolutely and so he was always

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:43.040
getting bombarded with white dudes

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:44.400
they're like i can't say anything

01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:45.440
anymore

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:47.920
and he i think he

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.920
his unmasked with ron bennington if you

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.279
ever get a chance to listen to it i've

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:53.279
listened to it so [ __ ] good he's the

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:55.120
[ __ ] bro and uh

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.719
i think about like my sixth listen

01:09:56.719 --> 01:09:58.080
through yeah i keep listening to

01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:59.760
everyone smile i'm like

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.679
sad i'm like i'm never gonna make it and

01:10:01.679 --> 01:10:04.080
then i listen to that i'm like

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.800
but uh i don't know if you turn on

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.040
cnn right now i guarantee they're

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:11.520
talking about racism i guarantee they're

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:13.120
talking about i mean it's just what they

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.000
do

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
and it's just talking about and foxes at

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.360
fox is on there talking about cancel

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.520
culture climate change and it's it's

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.679
just uh

01:10:21.679 --> 01:10:22.640
we're gonna

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.080
i don't know there's there's this cool

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:25.920
[ __ ] documentary called can't get you

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.920
out of my head okay it's on youtube

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.760
about kylie minogue it's

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:32.159
no it's about uh

01:10:32.159 --> 01:10:35.520
it's about just how we got here okay how

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.040
our phones and everything we're

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.920
connected to is designed to to give us

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:42.560
outrage it's designed to outrage us

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.239
because these algorithms that we all

01:10:44.239 --> 01:10:45.920
look at every day they don't care if

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:48.239
you're happy or if you're [ __ ] horny

01:10:48.239 --> 01:10:50.000
or if you're sad as long as you're

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.080
opening and looking at the screen and

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:54.080
eliciting a response making you want to

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:55.440
post something

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:56.800
making you want to interact with the

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.040
algorithm that's how it's working so our

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:01.679
entire society is fueled on outrage

01:11:01.679 --> 01:11:02.640
right now

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:04.640
it's just fueled by it

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.520
and it's

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:06.480
it

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.320
it has you know it's a really cool

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.440
[ __ ] documentary it's this british

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:10.880
dude i forget his name right now can't

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.560
get you out of my head yeah he focuses

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.080
on tupac

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:15.440
and one of the characters he focuses on

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:17.920
tupac he focuses on like

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.760
it's kind of it leads to a point where

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:21.120
it looks at how

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.360
china works and how america works when

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:25.280
it comes to the two

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:27.120
is much more individual

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.760
china's collective and it's very like

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.280
but it's the same [ __ ] algorithm it's

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:32.880
still designed to

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.800
to power the machinery yeah it's an

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.880
algorithm that we're not

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.960
hopefully we can get control of it but

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:40.960
right now it's it's out of control yeah

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:42.480
wait it's it's gone

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.320
our whole thing is fueled by outrage and

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.080
right now

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.640
racism

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:49.760
is

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:52.480
the crux of it where we're all you have

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.400
to have an opinion on it you have to

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.760
[ __ ]

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.640
you know and it's

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:00.800
it's sad but it's also it's hopeful we

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.400
can change it well

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:06.080
yeah and you know man there's a um

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.440
yeah i mean at the end of the day man i

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.199
think that there's there's going to be a

01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:11.600
time where we just have to hope that the

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.679
[ __ ] in this country

01:12:13.679 --> 01:12:15.840
on both sides of the [ __ ] spectrum

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.520
and everywhere in between

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:18.400
just

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.880
start to lose power and continue to lose

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.120
power the problem ends up being is is

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:26.080
everybody who's not who how you [ __ ]

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.239
think is one of the [ __ ] and

01:12:28.239 --> 01:12:31.040
everybody now has a space to [ __ ]

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:33.040
speak and to put their thoughts out and

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.880
there's contingencies now that exist

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:37.199
that never existed yeah i talk about

01:12:37.199 --> 01:12:39.520
this all the time when my dad is like

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.040
when do you think it was better when

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.880
y'all only had three and four new

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:45.280
sources or when we have 3 400 news

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.280
sources at a given time

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.920
you know where you can have the public

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.840
believe in so many different things and

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.199
you talk about all the [ __ ] that they

01:12:53.199 --> 01:12:54.640
used to [ __ ] sneak in with the

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:57.120
subliminal advertising and [ __ ] just

01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.719
all of the different ways that people

01:12:58.719 --> 01:13:00.320
were programmed back then the way the

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.960
information was controlled back then i

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.960
argue now that proportionately people

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.320
are dumber than they used to be because

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:07.679
we have so much more access to

01:13:07.679 --> 01:13:09.600
information yeah they'll only choose to

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.360
consume what feels best

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:14.480
i i just you know man like

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:17.360
you know we have i

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.440
i feel like i'm somebody who means well

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.840
by people in general but

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:23.679
i feel like i get really pissed off at

01:13:23.679 --> 01:13:25.760
the people who go through life

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:27.840
not [ __ ] signaling before they

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.000
[ __ ] merge like oh yeah and that's

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.760
what i think at america's and that's

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:34.080
black people

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.920
yo we're not picking on the turn signal

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:37.600
bro

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.400
bro

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:39.840

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:16.080
yourself with that [ __ ] my problem in my

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:18.480
[ __ ] situation and who i am and this

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.480
[ __ ] is like yo if you're with

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.080
that trump [ __ ] if you're with that blue

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:23.920
lives and that all live [ __ ] like you're

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:27.040
you're specifically taking a stance that

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.280
is anti a lot of [ __ ] that is at the

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:32.320
very least neutral to me if not throw me

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:34.159
i know you understand i know

01:20:34.159 --> 01:20:35.679
but this is where i have a problem with

01:20:35.679 --> 01:20:37.199
my brothers who are [ __ ] like nah

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:39.679
[ __ ] that trump [ __ ] i'm like bro like i

01:20:39.679 --> 01:20:41.199
understand that you're saying [ __ ] the

01:20:41.199 --> 01:20:42.960
democrats because so am i

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:45.760
all i'm saying is is

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:48.320
we don't [ __ ] have to align ourselves

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:50.239
with that [ __ ] either like you don't

01:20:50.239 --> 01:20:52.639
have to [ __ ] take them jokes because

01:20:52.639 --> 01:20:54.159
you want to be part of the circle and

01:20:54.159 --> 01:20:56.080
wear your little brim [ __ ] backwards

01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:58.080
american flag hat of course be cool with

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.159
them it don't have to be like that you

01:21:00.159 --> 01:21:01.440
know what i'm saying we can all get

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.199
along and be ourselves all i would say

01:21:03.199 --> 01:21:05.280
but but to tell you the truth the part

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:06.800
of

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:10.239
trump voters aren't bad people

01:21:10.239 --> 01:21:11.280
my dad

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.360
voted for trump and i know he's a good

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:16.080
person i just know he is so i know that

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.679
that's not the case

01:21:17.679 --> 01:21:20.320
i'm certain he's a good person phil is

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:21.760
feels good

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:24.000
no he's he's funny

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.639
but he's i know it is core he's a good

01:21:26.639 --> 01:21:29.280
person so whether that means

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.320
i mean

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.719
this is as corny as a guest call my dad

01:21:32.719 --> 01:21:34.239
racist but like

01:21:34.239 --> 01:21:35.760
whether or not you

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:38.000
he could be perceived as having racist

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.760
ideas right

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:42.159
that doesn't make him necessarily a bad

01:21:42.159 --> 01:21:43.199
person

01:21:43.199 --> 01:21:46.000
i it's a much more philosophical way of

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.159
approaching this yes but like

01:21:48.159 --> 01:21:49.360
we can't

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:51.840
cast everybody into the fire that

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:55.199
doesn't agree with us we gotta we gotta

01:21:55.199 --> 01:21:57.040
hopefully approach each other like this

01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:58.080
where we're having a [ __ ]

01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:59.920
conversation and it's like we're not

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:02.080
trying to advance specific ideas on each

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:03.920
other we're focusing two guys talking

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:05.840
and catching them and

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.520
again like i said last time we had a

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:09.520
conversation and i left there you told

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:11.760
me a [ __ ] up story that happened to

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:14.159
you and i was like damn that's

01:22:14.159 --> 01:22:16.000
crazy yeah you know what i mean and when

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.239
you have conversations with people that

01:22:18.239 --> 01:22:20.320
you're like all right maybe i didn't

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:22.159
know what i thought i knew

01:22:22.159 --> 01:22:24.159
it's a nice you know it helps and and

01:22:24.159 --> 01:22:25.120
right now

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:27.040
no one's having a conversation straight

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:28.800
up literally no one straight up and you

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.239
get that one of the things you got to

01:22:30.239 --> 01:22:32.239
get rid of is trump voters are evil

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:33.360
because otherwise you can't have a

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:34.960
conversation with them

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:36.880
so like if i i would i would sit down

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.560
with a [ __ ]

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:40.639
black israelite i'd love it

01:22:40.639 --> 01:22:42.719
if we had it i'd it'd be hilarious

01:22:42.719 --> 01:22:44.320
talking to a black israel it would be my

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:46.239
favorite thing in the world please

01:22:46.239 --> 01:22:47.600
that would we would unite on a lot of

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:51.199
things that would be so funny

01:22:51.199 --> 01:22:53.360
i but to your point though even even

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:54.239
still

01:22:54.239 --> 01:22:55.440
you're saying like you know you can't

01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:57.840
say trump voters are evil bro like the

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.239
the amount of victimization that the

01:23:00.239 --> 01:23:02.719
right gives itself bro like we have to

01:23:02.719 --> 01:23:04.639
also [ __ ] not pretend that they don't

01:23:04.639 --> 01:23:07.760
have hella machines bro like yeah like i

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:09.760
understand that the entertainment media

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:14.000
definitely leans super music news movies

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.679
don't don't disappear

01:23:15.679 --> 01:23:17.520
i mean i'm talking all right this i hate

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:19.440
to keep cutting off but the

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.920
what i see who's got the power when it

01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:24.480
comes to whatever uh

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:26.719
where is does power lie in the white

01:23:26.719 --> 01:23:29.120
house or does power lie in

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:31.280
culture and our culture right now is

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:33.440
very left okay

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:35.360
to

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:37.040
like our culture is

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:39.840
now when you say our you mean in as a

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:42.239
whole the united states okay

01:23:42.239 --> 01:23:44.000
um the change is depending on where you

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.040
go right

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:47.360
in within the united states which is 30

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:49.520
countries within itself yeah but when it

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:52.400
comes to television movies pop culture

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:55.600
like mass media yes mass media or phones

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:57.760
i mean every social media outlet

01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.040
everything i mean i get on to play

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.840
[ __ ] nhl

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:03.920
on my xbox and it's like it comes up

01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:05.840
right away it's like stop racism it's

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:08.560
like bro i'm i'm home

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:10.800
i'm not going to get it done right now

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:12.880
to a game play only by white dude yeah

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:15.120
it's 10 days when it's 20. yeah i mean i

01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:16.880
was watching the stanley cup playoffs

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:19.120
this week and it just cuts to

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.480
one of the three black players in the

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:23.040
nhl holding up a fist it's like bro this

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:25.920
is not it it's not this is making it

01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:27.199
worse remember when they [ __ ] all

01:24:27.199 --> 01:24:29.920
walk behind bubba wallace oh my god and

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:31.440
it turns out it wasn't a noose and

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:32.870
everyone was like

01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:34.480
[Laughter]

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:37.120
i mean it's just so like yeah and look

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:38.320
but hold on let's not lose what you were

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:39.440
saying though let's not lose because you

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:40.560
were talking about [ __ ] we're talking

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:42.000
about people being real people and good

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.600
people versus people and [ __ ] like that

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:44.719
right i

01:24:44.719 --> 01:24:46.400
i do think people are dumb right i think

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.239
a lot of people are very dumb i think

01:24:48.239 --> 01:24:50.400
i'm probably dumb on a lot of things

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.880
right but i don't think people are bad i

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:53.760
think

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:55.920
i think people are good on

01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:57.360
however you want to look at it whatever

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.719
race

01:24:58.719 --> 01:25:00.719
class whatever

01:25:00.719 --> 01:25:02.159
uh

01:25:02.159 --> 01:25:03.840
and i you know i think that's what we

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:05.360
need we do need to remember that now

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:07.040
it's again i understand the argument

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:09.199
that it's easy for me to say that

01:25:09.199 --> 01:25:11.360
because i'm outside of the [ __ ]

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:12.480
the struggle

01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:14.480
well let me ask you this though

01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:16.400
do you and i'm i promise you struggle

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:17.840
god damn it

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.120
whatever i promise you i'm not asking

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:21.040
you this to be corny either

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:22.800
do you think that

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.560
conscious ignorance

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:27.840
is malicious

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:30.400
i've it's

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:31.920
it's not a yes or no question right

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:33.760
there's levels to it but like

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:36.639
if if you're saying somebody in iowa

01:25:36.639 --> 01:25:38.880
who is who isn't fed that they're not

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:42.080
spoon-fed the [ __ ] the whole picture

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:43.679
of what's happening yeah spoon fed

01:25:43.679 --> 01:25:45.679
what's curated to them right

01:25:45.679 --> 01:25:48.400
but at rest if you say you see

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:50.400
a [ __ ] police shooting that you

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:52.000
recognize with some bush you watch

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.560
philando castile yeah get murdered in

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.560
cold blood in front of his baby and his

01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:59.040
wife for no [ __ ] reason yeah

01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:01.360
that doesn't spark a research effort you

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:02.639
know what i'm saying like that doesn't

01:26:02.639 --> 01:26:04.239
make you want to be like damn but i

01:26:04.239 --> 01:26:06.159
think like you were saying earlier it's

01:26:06.159 --> 01:26:07.760
like well i could find out about it and

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.600
then what as a white dude i think that's

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:11.280
the question that we should be asking is

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:13.600
then what because i don't think that you

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.360
know i don't know these guys but like

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.280
when i hear like the billion spuds

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:18.639
talking [ __ ] like that you know what i'm

01:26:18.639 --> 01:26:20.480
saying like i don't i've never met them

01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:22.000
i'm not calling them out or putting them

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.159
no no no but when i when somebody who i

01:26:24.159 --> 01:26:26.639
see who moves like that i don't want to

01:26:26.639 --> 01:26:29.199
[ __ ] try to convince them about like

01:26:29.199 --> 01:26:30.639
the struggle i gotta tell yourself i

01:26:30.639 --> 01:26:32.719
gotta tell you billions bud rule i

01:26:32.719 --> 01:26:34.639
believe you bro and

01:26:34.639 --> 01:26:35.760
they're

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:37.920
there's no doubt in my mind if you

01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:39.840
brought up philando castile to them

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:41.840
they'd be like that was [ __ ] up that

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.920
was terrible right now what they will

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:45.760
count would i not they i don't want to

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:47.360
speak for that right right right but

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:51.920
what i could see somebody saying back is

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:53.600
again what we talked about the other

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:54.960
time it's like well

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.400
i i

01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:57.679
how many times

01:26:57.679 --> 01:26:59.760
has a police officer been shot

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:02.560
how many times has i mean what led

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:04.560
what is it and this is kind of how it

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:06.480
always goes where it's like what led

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:08.560
them to make that choice why would why

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:09.920
is he

01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:12.639
worried about a guy pulling a gun on him

01:27:12.639 --> 01:27:13.600
is it

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.600
a disproportionate amount of crime he

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:19.040
faces from black people now you can stop

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:21.360
the argument there or you can go well

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:22.800
why is that

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:24.239
and then you can look you can it can

01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:26.159
always be a why

01:27:26.159 --> 01:27:26.960
and

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:29.120
people people always like to stop when

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:30.800
it's convenient right they like to be

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:33.280
like right well black people commit 50

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:34.880
of the violent crimes that's why he's

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:37.440
worried it's like well why

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:39.280
and then you have to ask yourself is it

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:41.920
why is the answer because you believe

01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:44.639
black people are prone to violence as

01:27:44.639 --> 01:27:46.639
humans right do you think they're

01:27:46.639 --> 01:27:49.679
biologically different than us

01:27:49.679 --> 01:27:51.679
or is there something else that's

01:27:51.679 --> 01:27:53.360
causing it why

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:56.560
and people just like to stop when it's

01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:58.159
you know when it's convenient it's easy

01:27:58.159 --> 01:28:00.000
to point to that reason instead of being

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.159
like well maybe there's

01:28:02.159 --> 01:28:04.800
some some type of economic disparity

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:06.719
right that's causing because when people

01:28:06.719 --> 01:28:08.800
are poor they commit violence right they

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:09.520
they

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:12.080
and they get punished more often for it

01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:15.280
so i mean it's just and i promise you

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:16.800
billions butter

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.239

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.040
know i know that it's just listening to

01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.639
the framework yeah yeah yeah yeah and

01:28:22.639 --> 01:28:24.639

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:39.440
like that right it's the same thing with

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:41.280
them where they you know but that's we

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:42.960

too man yeah you already know doug like

01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:57.440
this is just a conversation man of

01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.080
course i i'm gonna lie to you i i have

01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:02.320
[ __ ] three scrolls worth of [ __ ]

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:04.159
notes of [ __ ] that i wanted to [ __ ]

01:29:04.159 --> 01:29:05.920
re no i would have been kicking myself

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:07.679
if i forgot to talk to you about but we

01:29:07.679 --> 01:29:08.719
[ __ ] sitting up here talking that's

01:29:08.719 --> 01:29:10.000
how we [ __ ] talk yeah you know what

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.840
i'm saying so it's like it's you know

01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:13.840
shane like you're one of the few people

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:16.960
who i know who [ __ ] is cool with a

01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:18.719
lot of people like that who i actually

01:29:18.719 --> 01:29:20.719
believe in and i actually like will sit

01:29:20.719 --> 01:29:23.120
there and be like yo all right like

01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:24.960
if somebody who moves like this is

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.080
saying

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:28.000
chill like

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.880
yeah but like nah like on certain levels

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:34.159
then that at least can defuse

01:29:34.159 --> 01:29:35.840
the guard that i might have up this

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:37.440
doesn't say that i wouldn't [ __ ] that

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:39.040
i'm not i'm not like in any rush to

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:40.560
[ __ ] really befriend these people

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:42.159
because i know we have

01:29:42.159 --> 01:29:44.320
such fundamental differences that it's

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:46.560
gonna be an uphill battle my thing ends

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.000
up being like like i work with a dude

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.760
who's my peer at work who's like super

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:51.840
hard into that and like we i remember

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:53.280
one time we got into a conference call

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:54.800
and we had somebody who was from out

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:57.520
from uh from a red state like a deep red

01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:59.520
state who was on the call and he was

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:01.440
like this was that like they this was

01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:03.040
like a couple months back when they

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:04.800
started to lift mass mandates and all of

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:06.800
that and he was like so how's it live

01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:08.480
how's it how is it to live in a free

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:11.120
state and i was just like

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:12.560
as opposed to all the tyranny in

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:13.760
maryland like what the [ __ ] are you

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.920
talking about bro like this is what it

01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:17.199
ends up being and we're going to wrap it

01:30:17.199 --> 01:30:18.719
up i know we all wrap it up

01:30:18.719 --> 01:30:21.199
this is what ends up being

01:30:21.199 --> 01:30:22.239
where

01:30:22.239 --> 01:30:24.159
like you were like you were saying as we

01:30:24.159 --> 01:30:26.719
were talking about

01:30:26.719 --> 01:30:27.840
uh

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:29.600
that person is seeing

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:32.000
or you know somebody seeing the philando

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.440
castile situation and it's like oh damn

01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:37.360
that's [ __ ] up versus them seeing

01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:39.679
somebody protest against whatever

01:30:39.679 --> 01:30:42.000
element and seeing them really go

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.679
[ __ ] ballistic you know what i'm

01:30:43.679 --> 01:30:45.280
saying and when we talk about [ __ ]

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:46.800
like what are you really getting charged

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:47.760
up about

01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:50.480
for for white people it's about imagery

01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:51.920
it's about [ __ ] you know what i'm

01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:54.800
saying optics and and that's again in

01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:56.960
the american flag and saluting the flag

01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:58.560
and all that [ __ ] yeah y'all

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.560
[ __ ] is getting peanuts it's

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:02.960
[ __ ] buying beers it's [ __ ] taking

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:04.719
pisses and [ __ ] like that hearing that

01:31:04.719 --> 01:31:06.719
the [ __ ] whole ass stadium has the

01:31:06.719 --> 01:31:08.400
[ __ ] what you call it going on

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:10.000
i've been in hella concession stand

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.360
lines yeah of course getting [ __ ]

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.960
chicken tenders while but all of a

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:14.159
sudden somebody's wrong because they

01:31:14.159 --> 01:31:15.360
ain't [ __ ] salute to flag and [ __ ]

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:17.120
like that my problem

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:18.239
with

01:31:18.239 --> 01:31:18.960
the

01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:20.239
the

01:31:20.239 --> 01:31:22.719
both political parties specifically the

01:31:22.719 --> 01:31:24.239
people who who aren't actually

01:31:24.239 --> 01:31:26.560
politicians but are [ __ ] like the the

01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:29.760
actual voters is like yo

01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:32.480
you're such a goddamn hypocrite that i

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:34.639
can't [ __ ] tolerate you yeah there's

01:31:34.639 --> 01:31:37.600
the hypocrisy is immense on a lot of

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:39.840
sides yes a lot of things

01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:41.280
and when it comes to the protesting

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:42.000
thing

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.520
it's almost like

01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:45.280
sometimes it's how i feel about lebron

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:47.120
okay where it's like a lot of this seems

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:49.040
very performative

01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:50.400
a lot of it

01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:53.360
and and i i could be very wrong right

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:56.080
exactly and that's and look for a brand

01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:57.679
like like him

01:31:57.679 --> 01:32:00.080
even if it's performative if it helps

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:02.639
whatever but like when i when you'd see

01:32:02.639 --> 01:32:04.719
the black lives matter marches

01:32:04.719 --> 01:32:06.000
i would see a lot of the people there

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.480
and i'd be like this is [ __ ] yeah a

01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:10.719
lot of these people are fakes and it

01:32:10.719 --> 01:32:13.120
makes me not like the movement

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:14.639
and that's

01:32:14.639 --> 01:32:16.080
that's a problem

01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:18.560
you know 100 yeah i'm not a [ __ ]

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:20.800
supporter of the [ __ ] whole ass of

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:22.880
course hashtag movement by herself and

01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:24.880
all of that [ __ ] i'm a supporter of the

01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:27.199
[ __ ] being corrected yeah and hopefully

01:32:27.199 --> 01:32:28.639
over corrected as far as like the

01:32:28.639 --> 01:32:30.320
criminal justice [ __ ] and like and

01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:32.960
really specifically about like all this

01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:35.440
recidivism that is only caused by the

01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:37.040
way that the system is set up so many

01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:39.199
[ __ ] will never have a chance

01:32:39.199 --> 01:32:41.280
man you know the reason why shane the

01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:43.280
first time in the last 15 years that

01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:44.880
i've known my boys my [ __ ] hippie

01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:46.800

west virginia with my guys shane the

01:32:50.719 --> 01:32:53.040
only reason why all of this time i did

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:54.800
not go to the farm in west virginia was

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:56.560
because i did not want to go to [ __ ]

01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:58.719
jail either in western maryland or west

01:32:58.719 --> 01:32:59.840
virginia

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:02.000
awesome [ __ ] on some humble [ __ ]

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.400
awesome because i didn't obey exactly as

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:06.560
that one particular group of cops wanted

01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:09.120
me to that day yeah and i'm like yo i'm

01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:10.880

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:12.800
in west virginia yo they not [ __ ]

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:14.800

01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:17.040
playing in [ __ ] central pennsylvania

01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:18.800
yo that's a different level of toughness

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:20.239
that the [ __ ] in the smoky

01:33:20.239 --> 01:33:21.760

like that only difference is that they

01:33:30.639 --> 01:33:32.080
listen to country music instead of

01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:33.600

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:47.440
feel like you're being brainwashed from

01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:49.440
a different aspect the people who are

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:52.080
[ __ ] super liberal super [ __ ] pro

01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:54.400

01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.840
hard line stances you've been

01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:58.239
brainwashed in a different way i do

01:33:58.239 --> 01:34:02.560
think that most people who aren't rich

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:04.639
do not benefit from supporting the

01:34:04.639 --> 01:34:06.560
republicans as it is

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:10.320
as as much as they would benefit most

01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:12.239
people at rest

01:34:12.239 --> 01:34:14.480
take demographics out of it from the

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:16.560
from the agenda of the democrats i feel

01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:18.800
