one of my like big

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.120
i was always every time i was in school

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.560

me dude i'd be oh dude you don't think

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.360
i've thought about some good redemptions

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.519

white nerd at a black school

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.039
under their wing

00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:13.120

00:23:04.799 --> 00:23:06.559
watching him bug out about that would be

00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:08.400
pretty difficult i mean you know

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.080

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.840
giving up names that's how i think

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.360
that's how i think comedy journalists

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.960
are born i think it's kind of like being

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.320
molested

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.799
true you get like touched into it the

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:46.480
next thing you know you're like

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:51.840
richard walsh's highly problematic

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
i would think he was pretty bulletproof

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.080
yeah like they're gonna be like

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.480

right that's tight he caught some heat

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.919
but it was funny to like

00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:08.400
see them all bothering him and then just

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.720
yeah the way they all interact was like

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.120
seeing old [ __ ] dogs just i mean

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.679
they're grizzled [ __ ] vets yeah man

00:24:15.679 --> 00:24:19.520
seeing them chilling did and plus i mean

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.679
for them to do 20 minutes is probably

00:24:21.679 --> 00:24:22.799
there they could

00:24:22.799 --> 00:24:24.720
murder could i mean the backstage must

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.840
have been very relaxed

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.679
yeah yeah yeah it's like an open mic

clips about somebody was asking him a

00:31:05.519 --> 00:31:06.720
while ago i forget what

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.159
exactly it was it was something about

00:31:08.159 --> 00:31:10.720
like indian voters in his district and

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.960
he's like we got plenty of 7-elevens

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.320
it's like jesus christ it'd be fun to

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.720
take trump's like frontal attack and

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.760
replace it with a guy

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.080
constantly tripping over his words and

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.120
god damn it dude

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.919
him versus trump debates will be so lit

00:31:25.919 --> 00:31:26.480
that might

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.480
that might be the number one that might

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.840
be the guy to take trump

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.039
i don't think he's gonna beat him but

00:31:31.039 --> 00:31:33.039
those will be that's the if his if his

00:31:33.039 --> 00:31:34.880
racism is funnier than trump's big dude

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.360
he's in

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.679
it might be the funnier i think that's

00:31:37.679 --> 00:31:38.720
the funniest debate

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.720
combo oh that's gonna be dude that's

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.039
gonna be like elizabeth warren

00:31:43.039 --> 00:31:44.320
i don't think he'll be that funny

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.320
because then it'll get like he's making

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.000
fun of women

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.519
he already he already threw out the

00:31:49.519 --> 00:31:51.440
bombshell i mean making her

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.120
[ __ ] making her get it like

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.720
ancestry.com yeah

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.880
he already [ __ ] that was that was a

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.480
necessary political ploy

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.760
true but it's like what else you're

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.200
going to do that's fine unless he keeps

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.080
bringing that up

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.440
him versus bernie i don't think he'll be

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.159
funny that's funny if he goes no what if

00:32:06.159 --> 00:32:07.440
he goes against elizabeth warren and

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.960
just wears a [ __ ] like indian

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.559
headdress and comes out on stage he

00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:12.000
would [ __ ] elect

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.799
i mean i'm on this it's gonna be the

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:15.279
most

00:32:15.279 --> 00:32:17.279
yeah the most watched funniest [ __ ]

00:32:17.279 --> 00:32:18.720
debates dude

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.480
politics if they just completely i mean

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.000
i guess they are but if they just like

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:22.880
morph into like

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.880
boxing for geezers where they just go

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.320
out and people are like

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.159
yeah the heavyweight champ coming oh my

00:32:28.159 --> 00:32:30.159
god dude now he's got the belt dude he's

00:32:30.159 --> 00:32:30.720
ali

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:34.399
no one's taking him down yeah i mean

00:32:34.399 --> 00:32:36.399
i think they keep pulling like biden is

00:32:36.399 --> 00:32:38.240
the only hope and i don't know how

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:38.799
because he's

00:32:38.799 --> 00:32:41.360
constantly saying the most ridiculous

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.000
[ __ ]

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.039
yeah they have this i don't know there

00:32:45.039 --> 00:32:46.480
was also this lady i might have said it

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.840
last time

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.640
where this white lady came on after

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.279
booker

00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:54.080
and kamala harris both like went at

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.760
biden because he was like i

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.840
got the only one black woman in senate

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.159
yeah and she was like uh excuse me right

00:33:02.159 --> 00:33:03.440
here and he was like i said first

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:07.360
i said for he did yeah and then

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.960
afterwards like when the pundits started

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.480
talking about it she was like well it's

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.000
got to be frustrating for booker and

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.760
kamala harris to not have the black vote

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.360
the way biden does and

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:19.200

white lady you saw his speech i know

that is a weird thing to throw

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.519
yeah they're probably frustrated because

00:33:25.519 --> 00:33:27.200
the blacks should be voting for them

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.880
because they're black too

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.120
yeah but are you [ __ ] weirdo biden

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.799
[ __ ] goes down to delaware and is

00:33:32.799 --> 00:33:33.200
like

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:37.039
i know about roaches they were good men

00:33:37.039 --> 00:33:40.000
they'd be strong man i fist fought them

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:40.559
yeah

00:33:40.559 --> 00:33:42.399
we should use pipes on each other dude

00:33:42.399 --> 00:33:43.600
what the [ __ ] dude

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.960
is going down doing the [ __ ] black

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.640
rooms he's been

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.799
that's why like i mean right now trump

00:33:48.799 --> 00:33:49.760
is doing arenas

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.279

00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:53.120
the blue collar tour he's on the blue

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.240

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.000
getting it done get her done the whole

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.559

00:33:58.559 --> 00:34:01.360
yeah yeah which has a white comic it's

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.240

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.480
true that builds that sharpens your

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.399

00:34:06.399 --> 00:34:08.240
done i mean him against

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:11.200
again that that'll be we can only be so

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.800
lucky as to get that match up i think

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.919
we're getting that matchup

00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:17.440
really i think so how

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.800
i mean obviously he's definitely linked

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.240
up with like he's he's linked up with

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.760
that like clinton money and [ __ ] so

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.320
they'll make it happen

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:28.000
he's also a moderate true and warren and

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.679
bernie are a little they're very far

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:31.839

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.440
that have been committed against your

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.640
people

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.400
so you got a good sense of it i got a

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.640
good sense of what happened dude and

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.680
it's no good

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.240
damn the british were mean yeah they

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.920
were [ __ ] they're mean guys

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.760
yeah did you know that i knew yeah they

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.440
were [ __ ] really bad

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.240
yeah they were racist against other

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.280
white people the stuff they did to

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.280
ireland was like

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.920
wild it was horrible yeah it'll get you

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.440
into the mentality of

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.040
well you know the irish had it pretty

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.320
bad too which is a dangerous place to be

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:29.040
why is that so dangerous to be i don't

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.640
know i thought about a lot

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.320
when it's like when you say like the

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.760
irish are slaves too

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.119
yeah or were it's like yeah but not in

00:36:37.119 --> 00:36:37.920
america

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.400
which is where we are you know yeah so

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.839
like black people are still existing

00:36:41.839 --> 00:36:43.359
under the same government that did that

00:36:43.359 --> 00:36:43.760
to them

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.400
sure irish and america are not yeah so i

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:46.960
think that's

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:50.240
the big this is like irish people's

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.280
france

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.880
yeah the united states is like irish

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:53.920
people living in france yeah there's

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.040
like a black guy who's living in france

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.480
it'd be like oh it's not the same

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.880
yeah yeah yeah we got rid of it 40 years

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.000
before then

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.280
yeah shut up it's a fair assessment

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.480
but it is weird because if you even

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.079
bring up the fact like oh irish people

00:37:06.079 --> 00:37:08.160
kind of got [ __ ] people were like

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.599
hush well that's yeah all the although

00:37:11.599 --> 00:37:13.680
it's weird that everybody identifies now

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.880
as like

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.040
through your ancestry's victimhood yet

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.800
no one no one studies history

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.359
nobody dude so like everybody's like i'm

00:37:21.359 --> 00:37:22.079
a poc

00:37:22.079 --> 00:37:24.000
actually and it's like well your people

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.920
did some horrific [ __ ] too

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.079
what are you talking about why are we

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:30.560
why do we start the clock

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.800
at a convenient time dude i i've i never

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.000
have gotten a good answer for that why

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.680
is the moral clock started at

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.599
such a convenient time and you can do it

00:37:37.599 --> 00:37:40.560
you can fully explain

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.839
the united states through colonialism

00:37:43.839 --> 00:37:44.960
and all that stuff

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.119
but to not add the extra like oh by the

00:37:47.119 --> 00:37:48.079
way like

00:37:48.079 --> 00:37:49.680
in a greater scope of history this was

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.359
like an ongoing wave

00:37:51.359 --> 00:37:53.680
of imperialism not to be like this

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.560
started

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.920
and then colonialists like gave

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.240
non-white people the idea of oppression

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.680
and showed them how to oppress it's like

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.119
that's great that's crazy

00:38:03.119 --> 00:38:05.920
yeah that's phd level papers pushing

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.680
that through and being like

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.520
well obviously the people who weren't

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.240
the people in south america who had been

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:15.920
sacrificing virgins learned how to rape

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:16.480
through

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.520
colonizers it's like what yeah buddy you

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.640
know whatever i'm not you know i'm not

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.480
gonna get the dogs no but once

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:24.960
like if you do any and all i've looked

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.720
into it was the irish during and it's

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.000
like during the potato famine and all

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:28.560
that [ __ ]

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.640
and it's like bro we talked about a

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.160
little that [ __ ]

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.640
professor you called he was he had it

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.680
coming dude

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.440
yeah the british were bad boys during

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.040
that i might roll up

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.119
you should i might [ __ ] skirt i could

00:38:41.119 --> 00:38:42.720
be on site on that guy

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.200
dude it's definitely on site dude i mean

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.079
yeah it's like

00:38:46.079 --> 00:38:48.000
why would that guy do why what what like

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.200
i don't know

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.640
i don't know i don't know what the point

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.160
of that is like i think i'm reading it

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.160
i'm reading stuff about it now it's like

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.480
they i mean we've talked about it before

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.240
where like the potatoes went bad

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.720
yeah so then i mean there was still

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:01.760
grains

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.880
but the english were taking them

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.040
back to england yeah like guarded food

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.640
stocks with armies

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.480
and was like you can't have this then

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.000
they set up soup kitchens

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.440
and like the only way you can get soup

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.440
is if you admit you're protestant

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:18.240
so you had to deny god your god to be

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.280
able to eat

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.960
and then so like it'd be called like

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.640
taking the soup if you took the soup you

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.320
were a piece of [ __ ] dude

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.359
better not take the soup dude what yeah

00:39:27.359 --> 00:39:28.640
and like uh

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.079
it's also funny too can you take the

00:39:30.079 --> 00:39:32.160
soup and be like fingers crossed

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.160
yeah that's you're [ __ ] with a a

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.320
nation heavy with leprechaun tricks

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.839
true it's probably like if i stick my

00:39:37.839 --> 00:39:40.079

nutty for centuries just like it was

00:39:59.839 --> 00:40:01.520

00:42:13.599 --> 00:42:14.319
where it gets

00:42:14.319 --> 00:42:16.640
if it's like a hearty hearty lady with

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.400
