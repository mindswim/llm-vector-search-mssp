00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:15.599
shushed it before

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:17.360
the epstein case was shush no it was

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.120
literally it was shushed and then

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.360
it's he got a plea deal on the case that

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.280
this could never be reopened ever again

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.240
yeah and they deemed it unconstitutional

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:26.960
dude it's gonna

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.000
it's going it's crazy imagine if you got

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
trouble you had like what was it like 30

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.199
something people claiming

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:36.479
36 60 60 like 16 year olds

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:38.560

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.800
he got 13 months of

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.960
what was it house arrest or probation in

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.879
prison but he could leave for like

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:47.599
20 30 hours and 59 minutes it's a white

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:48.879

sleep there that dinesh just usually

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:52.879
got the same thing yeah dude so he left

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:54.160
and did that and then they

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.919
buried whoever else was involved with it

00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:57.599
and now it's coming out dude this is the

00:07:57.599 --> 00:07:58.400
show good god

throwing him up well he's not i don't

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:06.560

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:14.400
ten by doing that he brought attention

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.599
to the

00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:17.840
um epstein case again and then it just

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.960

00:14:08.399 --> 00:14:10.000
calling the cops and like

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.199

00:14:11.199 --> 00:14:12.320
and then wait like there's a guy with a

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.199
i mean i could have been like there's a

00:14:13.199 --> 00:14:15.360
guy in a gun headed like west on

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.120

morning and then i just

00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:25.199
could just walk the dog and i'm like i

00:14:25.199 --> 00:14:26.560

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.760
this [ __ ] guy

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.160

00:14:35.199 --> 00:14:36.880
my dilemma was like i call the cops

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.760
they're probably going to shoot this

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.720
[ __ ] guy

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.160

go shoot someone else

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.000

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.880
split

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:15.920

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.400
kid's hand yeah oh my god

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.400

baseball bat when you swing it and you

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.839
get jammed

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:27.760
my favorite is still that dude that

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.040
kicked the chick at the planned

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.280

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.160
that's realizing that min that moment

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.520
you realize you're out of antifa for

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:40.740

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.880
[Laughter]

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.400
it's a tough time for those guys

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.920
everybody on both sides of this

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.880
is it's a sad group i haven't heard much

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.319
about the other ones the proud boys are

00:40:50.319 --> 00:40:51.359
they still around

00:40:51.359 --> 00:40:54.720

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.839

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.400
they're just getting into coke

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.000
the cowboys are at the next step of

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.200
their evolution dude i just i just read

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.640
a headline i was reading about epstein

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.000
and you know like sometimes i scroll all

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.040
the way down it was like

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.960
proud boys and cocaine i was like all

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.800
right [ __ ] that's a that's a powerful

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.440
mixture

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.560
that might be a problem dude

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.319

protected slavery but then

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.720
allows prisons to use slavery so then

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.720
they did the war on drugs to arrest

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:37.599
black people so

clintons in it a lot yeah they're

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.440

three strikes your outlaw supervisor all

00:41:53.359 --> 00:41:55.280

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:58.560
and then they uh they showed like reagan

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.000

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.680
lines they did all the stuff yeah and

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.119

balancing muscle spasms or something

00:42:09.119 --> 00:42:10.800
it's just your striations yeah dude so

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:11.760
they should they go through the whole

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.400
thing and they

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.079
they do like a historical context of

00:42:14.079 --> 00:42:15.680
like dude freeing black people from

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.400
slavery

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.440
and then you just arrest them on

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.280
vagrancy laws and all that [ __ ] and then

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.160
you do all that

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.920
and then you do the like the drug cases

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.200
and you know blah blah blah

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.440
but they show the clintons and then they

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.040
at the end this is what i was trying to

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:27.839
talk about in class

00:42:27.839 --> 00:42:29.119
you know we didn't have really time for

00:42:29.119 --> 00:42:30.480
it i had to write down an index card for

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.280
next time

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.359
but it's like they it's literal

00:42:33.359 --> 00:42:34.560
propaganda dude

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.079
so it's like they show netflix oh no

00:42:36.079 --> 00:42:37.520
they show like it's a fact it's

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:38.960
historically

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.480
factual in terms of the pool they're

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.079
pulling from it's like okay yes this is

00:42:42.079 --> 00:42:42.960
a true thing

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.319
and then they get everyone all [ __ ] up

00:42:44.319 --> 00:42:46.000
with all these crazy images

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.200
and then at the end of it it's the

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.960
clinton's apologizing that we were wrong

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:49.680
for that

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.599
we did all this totally didn't mean to

00:42:51.599 --> 00:42:53.280
have fun in jail till he didn't mean to

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.119
imprison black people forever for like

00:42:55.119 --> 00:42:56.960
just [ __ ] like so sorry

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.720
and then it's them apologizing the next

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.800
shot is just trump being like

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.800
get him out of here smack him in the

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.560
face and then as he's saying that

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.079
they're showing pictures of like black

00:43:06.079 --> 00:43:08.880
guys being lynched and like assaulted

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.560
i wish it was the good old times it was

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:13.119
a good old time so they're literally

00:43:13.119 --> 00:43:14.880
literally propagandizing people where

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:16.480
it's like it's historically yes

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.560
you can't like so it's like a historical

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.920
framework and then there's the weird

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.680
stuff of imagery and emotion where it's

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:22.319
just like

00:43:22.319 --> 00:43:23.839
then it's just trump being like get him

00:43:23.839 --> 00:43:25.599
out of here i wish it was the old times

00:43:25.599 --> 00:43:26.000
and it's just

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.599
like guys getting hit with [ __ ] fire

00:43:27.599 --> 00:43:30.079
hoses in 2012 obama made

00:43:30.079 --> 00:43:32.079
um probably getting illegal against u.s

00:43:32.079 --> 00:43:34.000
citizens yes he made them legal

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.760
and then him susan rice and michelle

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:38.000
obama are now on like the board of

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.200
netflix they're like picking and

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.160
choosing this stuff and

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.640
michelle obama just came out saying that

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.079
she thinks that michael

00:43:44.079 --> 00:43:47.200
uh yeah exactly that's a dead name we

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.720
don't do that

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.280
uh she thinks that um she was telling

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.160
that one check

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.880
julie reed you know what i'm talking

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:55.280
about

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:58.000
she's like a morning host or something

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.839
for news diamond does she say yeah she

00:43:59.839 --> 00:44:01.119
said that

00:44:01.119 --> 00:44:03.040
uh she thinks that in the eyes of

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.240
america like

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.160
it was like oh yeah the presidency a

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.680
black guy did it anybody can do it and

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.280
that's why we have trump michelle obama

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.560
said that

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.560
yep that's huge what's that supposed to

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:13.839
mean dude it's

00:44:13.839 --> 00:44:15.680
definitely not a bit it's not good for

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.280
uh unity of the country

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.800
start talking like that so she said if a

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.800
black guy can do it then she's saying

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.319
that's what she feels like

00:44:22.319 --> 00:44:24.400
is going on nice i don't even i don't

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.839
even understand the logic

00:44:25.839 --> 00:44:27.920
she's saying that america is like oh

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.359

what's happening identifies as a giant

00:47:01.359 --> 00:47:02.880
you could legally give your kid roids

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:03.760
under that

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.599
like my son identifies as a jacked

00:47:05.599 --> 00:47:07.760
[ __ ] dude what if your son iden what

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.400
if your male

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.680
biologically excuse me what if your

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.079
biologically male son identifies as a

00:47:12.079 --> 00:47:13.040
girl but wants to

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:16.319
trans to be male through a physicality

00:47:16.319 --> 00:47:18.000
could you give him his steroids in he

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.359
got me lost what are you talking about

00:47:19.359 --> 00:47:19.920
okay so

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.599
gender is associated with social

00:47:21.599 --> 00:47:24.960
constructs so you haven't you have any

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.599
a boy well excuse me what america calls

00:47:27.599 --> 00:47:29.359
a boy but yeah what america calls it a

00:47:29.359 --> 00:47:30.559
biological boy

00:47:30.559 --> 00:47:32.480
okay starting out as a boy organism with

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:33.599
a penis go on

00:47:33.599 --> 00:47:36.400
boy a human with a penis yeah who is

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:38.559
identifying it for let's say

00:47:38.559 --> 00:47:40.800
as a gender-wise the social construct

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.559
yeah the expression of their biological

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:43.200
sex

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.280
as a girl okay and then as they want to

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.720
trans their

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.880
like i would say spiritual feminine

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:50.000
inclination

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.520
into a man but they need to take

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:53.280
steroids in order to like feel

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.920
like a man yeah so it is a boy

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:57.359
biologically biologically

00:47:57.359 --> 00:48:00.160
yes but then it thinks it's a girl yes

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.680
but it wants to be a boy

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:04.079
it's a trance it wants to little trans

00:48:04.079 --> 00:48:05.280
out of its gender

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.599
and so it's a biological man oh yeah so

00:48:07.599 --> 00:48:08.400
what's the gender

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.839
we're discussing now you can't even keep

00:48:09.839 --> 00:48:11.839
up with it

00:48:11.839 --> 00:48:14.880
so once it wants to change its gender my

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:15.440
cisness

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.160
is yeah it's showing dude i mean imagine

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.280
if you could get your pump

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.760
out of that way or that's not a bad idea

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.440
if your kids like i think i'm a girl

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.480
all right we'll get you hormones just

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:26.000
give them testosterone yeah let's go

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.359
just give him testosterone

00:48:27.359 --> 00:48:30.160
he's got a beard

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:35.839
they were uh it stopped

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:42.570
[Laughter]

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:46.090
i'm trying to do the dishes

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:54.710
[Laughter]

00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:01.119
[Laughter]

00:49:01.119 --> 00:49:02.640
that's what there was a big thing like

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.960
with all that logic there's um

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:08.960
like the pills that they give um

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:12.319
men to trans they wanted to give this

00:49:12.319 --> 00:49:13.440
birth control pills

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.200
well no they want to give the same thing

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.559
to um

00:49:16.559 --> 00:49:20.559
pedophiles and like alabama or uh

00:49:20.559 --> 00:49:22.079
but they wanted to give it to him and

00:49:22.079 --> 00:49:23.359
they're like you can't give them these

00:49:23.359 --> 00:49:25.280
pills because it makes them suicidal but

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.520
it's the same thing

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.440
and then they say the suicides are based

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.280
on us you're not understanding being

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.160
real

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.599
i'll tell you what a podcast like this

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.240
them

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.440
saying things like that maybe you guys

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:40.880

to go to a different country and take a

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:52.559

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.480
this is some [ __ ] that we got sciopped

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:19.120
into

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:20.800
in the 1600s there wasn't like like

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.320
romances like

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.480
and that's the girl i love and i ran and

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:25.760
i built like the notebook

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.280
if you show that to someone in the 1400s

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:28.640
they'd be like what the [ __ ] is this

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:28.960
that

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:30.480
it's not like an inherent thing that it

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:32.640
was so the cathars used to believe

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.560
that god was a woman and that if you

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:35.920
treated like wrong

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:37.679
right off the bat if you focused all

01:11:37.679 --> 01:11:39.280
your intention all the attention on a

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:40.480
woman and had like

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.880
not like a um you didn't sexualize the

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:44.239
experience you had like a

01:11:44.239 --> 01:11:45.520
i love you it's like where the knights

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:47.440
and stuff came from like i love you

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.760
you're the depressed you're the divine

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.040
you're the divine feminine you still

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.080
have sex but like

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:53.840
you just didn't like i'm trying to think

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:54.880
how to explain it when it came to your

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:56.400
interactions with women it was like

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.239
totally holy and if you did it right

01:11:58.239 --> 01:11:59.760
like the woman god would let you in and

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.199
you could just it was on dude you got in

01:12:01.199 --> 01:12:02.719
heaven it was just like [ __ ] yeah dude

01:12:02.719 --> 01:12:05.199
you got your jokes

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.960
pretty similar dude but it was just one

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.880
great goddess and then what happened was

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:09.360
they said

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.960
christianity suppresses like that dude

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.280
this just this is dumb and that's where

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:16.800
romanticism came from uh because like

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:17.360
they

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.800
just kind of couldn't do that religion

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.320
anymore so that's where they brought in

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:21.760
the whole like um what's the [ __ ] what

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:22.560
is it called the

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:24.640
chivalry thing yeah of like open a door

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.840
for a lady and do all this [ __ ] where

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:26.239
are you like

01:12:26.239 --> 01:12:27.760
you got to maintain the family union

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.600
because christianity found that

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.199
you saw that yeah we can't have all

01:12:31.199 --> 01:12:37.840
those pagans

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.199
excuse me i sometimes i go down dark

01:12:43.199 --> 01:12:44.719
holes do you see what i sound like

01:12:44.719 --> 01:12:46.719
i see that i gotta see what the [ __ ]

01:12:46.719 --> 01:12:49.199
going on dude every rose has its thorns

01:12:49.199 --> 01:12:49.520
bro

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:51.520
exactly but that's why i was last week

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:52.880
i'm like it's either you have to like

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.320
there's no thing either you get cooked

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.080
or you're polyamorous and i'm like

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.320
that's the life of a luster dude yeah

01:12:58.320 --> 01:12:59.679
you were talking about some ethical

01:12:59.679 --> 01:13:01.520
non-monog dude i did not i didn't know

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:02.239
what dude i

01:13:02.239 --> 01:13:04.800
i was i was

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.360
first of all this is an active idea

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:08.800
generation dude if you guys can't do

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:09.520
that

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:12.800
like you but dude very democratic i'm

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:13.920
talking to listeners dude

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:15.520
i had a lot of listeners turning the

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:17.199
listeners if the listeners are still in

01:13:17.199 --> 01:13:19.040
this they're still they're very low

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.960
they're still listening to this episode

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.560
they are they're beyond smart but yeah

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.480
dude

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.000
that's where it came from that's where

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.520
they think a lot of this whole like oh

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:29.199
there's a girl let me open the door it's

01:13:29.199 --> 01:13:29.520
like

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:31.360
just being mom apple pie that's all that

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.800
is that's not weird

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.640
you've been psyops as did you treat

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:36.239
women that's the remnants of it

01:13:36.239 --> 01:13:37.600
it's one thing of treating them right

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:39.280
like being like all right here's this

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.560
weird creature i'm not gonna project

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:42.480
this weird divinity or like

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.480
expect to have this um like

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:46.159
transcendental experience through my

01:13:46.159 --> 01:13:47.520
union with this person where they make

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:48.640
my life make sense

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:49.840

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:24.480

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:24.800
man

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:27.280
that's what i'm saying this is like why

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:28.880
you won't have to deal with

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:30.480
what they're talking about you know what

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:31.760
i mean like they're sitting there saying

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:38.159
outside this [ __ ]

01:17:38.159 --> 01:17:40.560

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.400
of all dude i've literally been doing

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:54.159
everything yeah it's true

01:17:54.159 --> 01:17:56.480
especially so hard dude it's just well

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:57.679
if you're a

01:17:57.679 --> 01:18:00.000
trust me crazy if you're in if you're in

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.199
relation right now if you're in a

01:18:01.199 --> 01:18:03.120
[ __ ] busan camp in a relationship

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:05.440
i think we do need to explain the busan

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:06.800
explain to busan

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:09.760
so there's the mossad the um lovely

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.360
israelis that

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:13.440
they go in and [ __ ] [ __ ] up well a

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.280
little backstage yes but

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:17.040
bill used to have a jewish girlfriend

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:19.280
okay

01:18:19.679 --> 01:18:22.000
so so that was that's how it turned into

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.640
that she was massaging him

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:26.719
yeah you know it's like beside tactics

01:18:26.719 --> 01:18:28.480
she controlled your reality a little bit

01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:30.080
they control you how they try i can't

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.520
create that's that's why i didn't i

01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:32.880
didn't understand that it wasn't a

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:34.000
single person

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.880
it's a conglomerate of women but that's

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:38.080
what the problem is here's

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.560
here's my only and [ __ ] raised dudes

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:41.440

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.159
here's the only problem single mom yeah

01:18:44.159 --> 01:18:45.360
raised dudes

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:46.960
here's the paradox though you're talking

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:49.360
about worldwide cooperation from uh yeah

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:49.679
yeah

01:18:49.679 --> 01:18:51.920
very combative but they don't know that

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:54.719
they're doing it

01:18:54.719 --> 01:18:57.280
yeah well what up guys well sorry to get

01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:58.320
some meta bro

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.640
no it's all good dude for it yeah so

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:02.000
you're underground consciousness [ __ ]

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.280
you were getting pusated

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:04.719
well they did that's the thing i've said

01:19:04.719 --> 01:19:06.560
that before is like if you're

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:07.760
if you're in a relationship where you

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:10.320
just listen i mean again if you're like

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:12.080
i don't know like getting [ __ ] up all

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.679
the time and you're like oh yeah smoking

01:19:13.679 --> 01:19:14.640
crack your girlfriend's like stop

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:16.239
smoking crack obviously take her [ __ ]

01:19:16.239 --> 01:19:16.719
advice

01:19:16.719 --> 01:19:18.159
yeah but if they're like we should go on

01:19:18.159 --> 01:19:20.320
vacation again start hitting with those

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.600
ideas and you're like

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.800
yeah we do that if you listen to all

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:24.719
those ideas just [ __ ] ruin it become

01:19:24.719 --> 01:19:26.480
a dude in west philly walking around

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.800
okay so here's the deal weak men weak

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:31.040
men disturb the balance of the force

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:33.199
with the prasad so it's like the more

01:19:33.199 --> 01:19:34.800
weak men there are the more power they

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:35.199
have

01:19:35.199 --> 01:19:36.880
true when there's strong men and there's

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.719
family and there's [ __ ] society and

01:19:38.719 --> 01:19:39.520
everything's going good

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:41.600
the passad's powerless they can't do

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:43.760
[ __ ] to us that's true but like since

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:47.120
every dude is being broken it's like

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:48.880
the [ __ ] chicks have just taken over

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:50.640
yeah they have their divine femininity

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:51.440
here they just

01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:54.159
took over the social divine femininities

01:19:54.159 --> 01:19:55.360
that's when they get in touch with their

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:56.880
divine femininity that's what they try

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.239
to say they try and make it all clear

01:19:58.239 --> 01:19:59.679
that's actually pretty cool yeah divine

01:19:59.679 --> 01:20:01.040
femininity is pretty cool dude listen to

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:01.840

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:09.199
get on

01:20:09.199 --> 01:20:11.520
this fully embraced womanhood not a

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:12.560
stereotypical way

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.320
but don't be all freaking out like dude

about minions but if they like we're

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:23.199
getting what they needed from like the

01:20:23.199 --> 01:20:24.320
male side of society

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:27.440

it is gonna be like

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.800
i think it is going to be ruined like

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.320
there's no way somebody's winning out of

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:40.639
this

01:22:40.639 --> 01:22:42.800
i don't know i think it also showed like

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.159
room in the first episode the girl was

01:22:44.159 --> 01:22:45.520

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.520
lot of dark [ __ ] [ __ ] oh they did

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:54.239

01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:57.600
that

01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.040
because she had guilt like i think

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:00.320
there's gonna there is a lot of darkness

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:00.800

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:12.000
like that oh like when it came out when

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000

uh now that's the movie it opens up with

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:22.560
a little kid getting her [ __ ] head

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.400

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.560
the supernatural

01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:46.800
the truth oh i think as you get older

01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:48.159
too you just start getting way more

01:28:48.159 --> 01:28:49.120
supernatural

01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:50.800
you get closer to death you're like

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:51.840
there better be something else they're

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:53.199
all around

01:28:53.199 --> 01:28:55.840
but mid-summer's about like a pagan cult

01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:57.600
that still follows like ancient rituals

01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:58.159
and [ __ ]

01:28:58.159 --> 01:28:59.520
and while i was watching i was like dude

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:01.360
thank god for christianity yeah thank

01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:01.840
god

01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:03.199
the romans came up they were like yo

01:29:03.199 --> 01:29:04.880
[ __ ] knock this [ __ ] off dude stop

01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:06.560
[ __ ] sacrificing people

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:08.159
that's not true that doesn't work you

01:29:08.159 --> 01:29:10.000
can't sacrifice people yeah worship

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.840
jesus he was like yo be nice no more

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:15.600
yeah that's what the romans were saying

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:17.280
yeah this is weird too though

01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:19.760
how the church now is still infallible

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:20.320
it's like

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:22.840
clear [ __ ] sign of uh i think

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:24.159
imperial people

01:29:24.159 --> 01:29:26.639
infallibility is no longer they stopped

01:29:26.639 --> 01:29:27.360
it yeah

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:29.120
i think i already know cool pope francis

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:30.639
did it i think that i think that might

01:29:30.639 --> 01:29:31.040
have been

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.639
that i thought i thought that's how they

01:29:32.639 --> 01:29:34.080
got out of uh

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:35.520
the child molester [ __ ] they're like

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:37.280
infallibility is not so they don't do

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:39.040
that anymore uh in fact that was late to

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:39.440
the game

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.760
infallibility came around like the bad

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:43.040
person could be wrong like

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:45.280
yeah that was like 1850s i thought they

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:47.199
used that somehow to their advantage in

01:29:47.199 --> 01:29:48.000
terms of the

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.760
child children shuffling around

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:51.199
shuffling around child molesters i'm not

01:29:51.199 --> 01:29:52.239
saying they wouldn't pull it out of the

01:29:52.239 --> 01:29:54.639
bullpen

01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:58.239
yeah what's that one rule we have where

01:29:58.239 --> 01:29:59.520
we're right about everything no matter

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:01.280
what plus that background i say that

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:03.600
that is a sick rule i mean it's the

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:04.800
ultimate rule

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:06.290
my

01:30:06.290 --> 01:30:08.639
[Laughter]

01:30:08.639 --> 01:30:10.239
i remember that i read somewhere that

01:30:10.239 --> 01:30:12.560
they they invoked that and like well

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:13.920
yeah we you can't get into that that

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:15.840
sounds like this is right i mean the

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:18.960
bolsheviks try to destroy catholicism

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:20.159
the left has been trying to bring down

01:30:20.159 --> 01:30:21.600
the catholic church for a long time

01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:22.719
obviously and the [ __ ]

01:30:22.719 --> 01:30:25.440
it is the time is ripe yeah this is

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:25.760
there

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:27.600
you got [ __ ] like euphoria on you know

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.120
who's winning this battle

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:31.520
you know what i mean bolsheviks exactly

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:32.960
the goddamn bolsheviks

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:34.960
come back to give us what for cultural

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:36.080
markets

01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:37.760
i'd be surprised if they if they if the

01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:39.520
catholic church pivoted it would be sick

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:39.920
if they

01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:41.280
just like went i don't know what they

01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:42.480
could do but it would be tight they

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:44.239
could pivot into hard conservatism

01:30:44.239 --> 01:30:45.760
no they could like the [ __ ] young

01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:47.280
pope dude if the young pope came around

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:49.360
i was like stop being [ __ ] gay

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:52.320
like yeah dude nah dude if if i mean

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.600
again i sound like a [ __ ]

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:55.199
one-trick pony but if they if the church

01:30:55.199 --> 01:30:56.880
went if they started giving people acid

01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:58.560
and stuff for like communion

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.480
people will get into that's it they

01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:02.000
could do it they're the big

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.760
enough powerful that would [ __ ] up

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:06.080
people's weeks

01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:09.040
microsoft microdoses but they give dad a

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:10.480
microdose of acids he'd be

01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:12.400
fine [ __ ] up they'd be fine if you

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.679
give like an average person yeah it

01:31:13.679 --> 01:31:15.120
would just go straight to

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:17.440
dad's dad's daddy's and mommy we get

01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:19.199

to a chad drinks like 90 ounces of

01:31:28.239 --> 01:31:30.080

and you you analyze all your stuff but i

01:33:36.239 --> 01:33:38.159
would say it kind of like a

01:33:38.159 --> 01:33:40.320
real quick window into suicidality and

01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:41.360
you're right back out yeah

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:43.840
true it's kind of like a hard like it's

01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:46.960
like if you fell and everyone's like

01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:49.679

01:33:49.679 --> 01:33:51.120
quick like

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:52.800

01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:20.239

guys oh yeah you're saying in life

01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:26.000
i think having exclusive just a group of

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.920
brothers is a weird dynamic with women

01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:29.840
whatever you're super badass you are

01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:31.679

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:49.440
boys catholics like if you never know

01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:50.000

01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:57.040
with you i'm saying for sure

01:58:57.040 --> 01:58:58.639
i've always thought about that about all

01:58:58.639 --> 01:59:03.760
boys high schools i went to all boys

01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:05.119
[ __ ] me up because it was like you had

01:59:05.119 --> 01:59:06.960
you hung out with your dogs all day

01:59:06.960 --> 01:59:07.840
every day

01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:10.320
and then we would go to a sister school

01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:12.080
