yeah i think so jeez time flies

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.319
when you're having crippling anxiety

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:04.319
every day

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:07.039
time flies

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.520
when every week is the same yeah you do

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.160
a bog what the [ __ ] did i say yeah time

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.080
flies me that you're actively destroying

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.240
your life

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:23.680
yeah i was getting banged up i had to i

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.520
took it east this weekend did you really

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.000
and i didn't have fun what i had to do

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.680
stand up without drinking

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.120
you gotta do it you gotta have one or

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.880
two beers that's right that's what i

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.800
said it doesn't do anything to your body

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.000
two beers

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.919
two beers is the medical limit the

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:39.680
doctors say yeah yeah that's the stuff

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.720
that's good for you that's in the

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.680
literature

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.199
you're like drink three glass of wine

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:45.199
it's good for the polyphenols it is i

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:46.720
think about that i heard that i heard

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.120
that study got funded i heard that study

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.800
big wine i think well i heard it they

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.560
found that they're like yo we arrange

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.759
the data in a way that makes it look

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:54.960
like if you have two drinks it's good

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.960
for your health and like they pitch that

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.479
study to alcohol companies they're like

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:00.080
you guys want this info

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.919
yeah we'll sell you this well i believe

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:03.840
it so i trust the science

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.840
it's not like you know could be could be

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.319
the case i'm not drinking like russian

00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:10.560
booze wine could be the socialization

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.039
aspect though so i'd be just like the

00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:14.479
fact that people who drink hang out with

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:16.720
and have pounds yeah that might help you

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.479
significantly yeah but unless you're

00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:19.840
getting hammered and fighting everybody

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.800
every night

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.160
toss in a little toss in a little

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.080
difference no big deal

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.479
so i i tried not to drink this weekend

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:28.639
in tacoma washington was that a little

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:31.280
jab at me for uh or what our

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.440
temperature oh not at all not at all but

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.959
the temperature conversation has been

00:08:34.959 --> 00:08:36.000
slightly

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.279
slightly solved even though i'm sure you

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:39.039
don't believe me

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.519
so yeah everyone smile tom will crank

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:43.919
the thermostat up as far as it goes

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.160
it's to activate the water tank tom

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.200
believes

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:47.839
and

00:08:47.839 --> 00:08:48.720
i

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.160
i'm not saying you're wrong well i am

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.080
saying you're wrong now

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.720
i i wasn't sure so art it's it's an old

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.640
shitty place so the thermostat the whole

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.839
way up just means on okay neither the

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:01.839
either the radiators are on or off

00:09:01.839 --> 00:09:03.680
there's it doesn't matter that's that

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.000
was the old way of thinking i galileoed

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.160
out i came in i said here's some new

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.480
theories and i was crucified last night

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.240
i came radiator heat you have radiators

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.720
yeah okay dude i came in here last night

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.360
and it was it was a sauna it's nice it

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.440
was i was having a good time piping hot

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.480
for three days

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.240
i adjusted my body temperature the

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.680
temperature internally and you got plant

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.760
you got plants i got plants

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.600
the girls get it me and the girls get it

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.080
good when shane's on the road dude

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.320
even the pet dude even the plants are

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.640
back there sweating like meat it was he

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.080
did bring that up it was like the plants

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.800
it's gonna be me and the plants

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.000
look it's just like mushrooms you gotta

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.519
give them three days good i hear you two

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:45.200
a day he's not true so i came in and it

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.440
was i was like in my head i was like i

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.600
know the the thermostats the entire way

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.680
up because i was like this has been an

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.760
ongoing discussion whether it's on or

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.240
off or there's some levels to it yeah

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.080
i'm more of a there's some levels to it

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.320
guy you think it's a continuum yes so i

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.079
came in i think it's the spectrum so i

00:10:02.079 --> 00:10:03.200
came in

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.200
i said in my mind i was like the

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.800
thermostat's the entire way up this

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.279
place is 900 degrees i walk over check

00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:11.440
of course it's the entire way up dude i

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.279
was like dude it is so hot you have to

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.680
do what and then he was so mad

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.079
that i said it was too hot no because it

00:10:18.079 --> 00:10:19.839
was i don't think it was i but maybe my

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:21.360
body adjusts

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.959
you guys just have like a dial no it's

00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:25.040
number number sets it to a 100 degrees

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.720
i'm telling you it does it didn't i've

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.480
been here for [ __ ] eight years nine

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.720
years and never has that thing adjusted

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.320
to a certain temperature until today

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.920
when i showed him

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.000
but until this morning when i said

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.160
here's how it works i'm talking about so

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.600
upstairs doesn't activate your [ __ ]

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.720
hands

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.720
the upstairs doesn't activate until you

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.440
get to like yes 70 times and that is

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.040
true and the upstairs neighbors we

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.480
control their heat

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.560
so they would text us and be like a

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.320
certain number on there they can't turn

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.880
their heat on and yes so what's yeah

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.320
it's a [ __ ] hundred-year-old building

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.440
i know someone who had something like

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.200
that and then the pico came out whoever

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.959
came out changing no they were like you

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:02.399
don't have to pay

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:04.399
like your electric bill at all

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:05.839
what you're not wondering if they didn't

00:11:05.839 --> 00:11:07.920
have to pay for heat you probably don't

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.040
well they're not supposed to when there

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.680
was an irish [ __ ] in the basement she

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.040
she started lumping all her [ __ ]

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.399
together and i was getting a real high

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:15.279
bill and i'm like i don't think you're

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:16.880
splitting this up in three ways and it

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.720
turns out that dagger was

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.560
he was getting in my ass yeah the money

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.399
yeah really yeah yeah old man was

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:23.839
[ __ ] me over yeah he probably saw a

00:11:23.839 --> 00:11:25.120
young italian probably had to take a

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.600
little bit off

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.120
well anyway

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.720
let's go back to the uh

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.920
the battle

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.600
there was a battle last night it wasn't

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.440
much of a battle there was no listen

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.320
we're very good with showing our chest

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.440
and moving on yes chris not good chris

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.600
no he will elevate you guys bare teeth

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.600
at each other oh yeah yeah

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.839
now we just two alphas respecting each

00:11:49.839 --> 00:11:51.920
other's stance sure you say a couple

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.160
things gritted teeth

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.360
you show eyes like this i hear you yeah

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.720
and then

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.320
and it doesn't it doesn't elevate

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.519
because it's like talking to your dad

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:02.399
going

00:12:02.399 --> 00:12:04.800
i got it the message is is there i don't

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.639
have any other ill will feelings and i

00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:08.240
don't have a hidden agenda i'm not a

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.079
passive aggressive [ __ ] if i had an

00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:11.839
issue there i could be like wait there's

00:12:11.839 --> 00:12:14.320
one why i'm sometimes no no no i was

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.600
just saying that was that was a bit of a

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.480
passion

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.839
that was a bit of a passive-aggressive

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:20.160
shot at o'connor

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.639
well he's not here so i can't yeah hold

00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:24.720
on chris hello will elevate something

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.639
and he'll say he'll insult you

00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:29.600
so hold on so this also helped the the

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.920
tent this built the tension tom's been

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.240
chilling for a couple days no roommates

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.519
when you're chilling by yourself no

00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:36.880
roommates the second someone walks in

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.120
the door you're just like [ __ ] 100 yeah

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.320
all right so he's obsessed because now

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.399
you're in my vibe i just flew across the

00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:43.760
country all day

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.600
landed on a tarmac had to sit there for

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.920
another hour for some de-icing [ __ ]

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.519
then i have to go wait for my bag for

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:51.440
another [ __ ] in 45 minutes because

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.760
jfk is a nightmare so then i get into

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.000
the house and it's 900 degrees

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
so we're both we're both coming in with

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.399
a little extra [ __ ] i'm not happy

00:13:00.399 --> 00:13:02.320
it's just me here i can fix the

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.680
temperature really quickly and then i

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.720
give you the remote and you got your

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.480
time yeah

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.880
i fixed the temperature

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.399
i was handed the remote i turned it off

00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:12.720
i said i'm going to bed

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.440
so let's let's let's get this correct

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.440
the option was yours yeah now i was

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.360
trying to make it was how's the how's

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.880

one baby this is day one yeah so this

00:13:24.959 --> 00:13:26.399
morning i got up usually when you don't

00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:28.160
turn the house down it's a lot easier to

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.519
write yeah i said it correct shout out

talked about watching oh yeah i was

00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:07.039
watching the porn no i was watching the

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:09.440
kanye concert i was watching yeezy yeah

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.799
and uh

00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:12.720
i was i got into the actual heated

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.240
dispute with my woman

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.159
because she was like kim's kim's more

00:20:16.159 --> 00:20:17.760
famous than him

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.120
or he's like gonna be known in 10 years

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.880
she's like in the future people will

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.960
remember her more than kanye stay out of

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.120
it no

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.280
and i said and she she compared her to

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.880
like marilyn monroe she's like this

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.640
generation sex symbol that's terrible

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.520
and i was like

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.360
no that actually brings up

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.320
i think

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.760
i agree with her

00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:30.480
that's what i was thinking about the

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.919
whole time was every time i'd be

00:31:31.919 --> 00:31:33.440

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.399
you remember the guy who got frozen just

00:31:38.399 --> 00:31:40.559
for eternity holding his bird

00:31:40.559 --> 00:31:41.840

00:31:47.519 --> 00:31:48.720
off with this

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.480
possibility with the possibility of

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.960
being frozen in time yeah yeah you got

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.039
to keep this active dude

00:31:55.039 --> 00:31:56.240
especially if you did it right before

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.159
you're going to [ __ ] bus dude dude

00:31:58.159 --> 00:32:00.000
imagine lining up your your bus with a

volcano blast

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.320

that'd be nice

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:04.720
that's probably what that [ __ ] was trying

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.880
to do when he got frozen

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.120

00:50:33.839 --> 00:50:36.240
unsatisfactory this is unsatisfactory

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:37.920
this is unsatisfactory but then i have

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.520
to what call or do one of them it's all

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.839
on an app dude if amazon can send you

00:50:41.839 --> 00:50:43.760
[ __ ] it gets stolen off my porch

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.440
there'll be a picture of the fact that

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:47.440
it was there yeah i'm like i didn't get

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.880
my stuff that's happened awesome and

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.160
they were like dude they'll send you it

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.440
for free

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:52.960
you just gotta keep messaging the robot

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:56.480
like please please they actually have

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:57.839
uh

00:50:57.839 --> 00:50:59.280
if you've done that like three or four

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:01.119
times in like a couple months you're

00:51:01.119 --> 00:51:03.599
flagged is that true yeah

00:51:03.599 --> 00:51:04.880
definitely yeah

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.359
because people do it it's so easy i also

00:51:07.359 --> 00:51:09.200
think there's a price point different so

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.280
like if you got delivered in oculus and

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.920
claim it wasn't delivered they'd be like

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:15.359
well look into that but if you're

00:51:15.359 --> 00:51:16.800
getting like [ __ ] shampoo or

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.800
something regular like it's coming right

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:19.920
back that's what i'm saying we'll give

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.079
it to you it's all about just keeping it

00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:23.280
flowing dude

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.720
it's all about little wins yeah mine

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:26.160
happens like once every six months i'll

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.480
get like some snacks yeah or they'll put

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.480
it down yeah we've had i've had one

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:32.160
where they take this [ __ ] you

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.319
know when they were hiring anyone to do

00:51:34.319 --> 00:51:36.559
amazon doing the quarantine the guy

00:51:36.559 --> 00:51:38.079
would take a picture upload that was

00:51:38.079 --> 00:51:40.319
delivered and one was just like cut with

00:51:40.319 --> 00:51:41.680
a razor

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.599
because it was dropping the box yeah one

00:51:43.599 --> 00:51:46.400
of the boxes had the battery

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:47.599
this is why i don't think they should do

00:51:47.599 --> 00:51:50.559
this they have a battery sticker on some

00:51:50.559 --> 00:51:51.359
of the

00:51:51.359 --> 00:51:53.040
packages yeah that's bad once the phone

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:55.920
to for the delivery meant to be a little

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.960
more protective but it also

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.559
what is fun it is funnier like you know

00:52:00.559 --> 00:52:02.400
back when they have amazon still hires

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:05.040
anyone yeah

00:52:16.079 --> 00:52:17.520
but you're also identifying what

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.599
products might be of high value so the

00:52:19.599 --> 00:52:20.480
dude went

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.240
cut it open and it was like a [ __ ] it

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.000
was like a blender it was something that

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
like got his ass he didn't yeah he

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.680
didn't need did you take it up

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:29.680
i'd yeah and they sent another one right

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:31.760
away sure and i took pictures of the

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.839
open package after he i was like i don't

00:52:33.839 --> 00:52:35.119
i don't know if you could tie this into

00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:37.119
the actual delivery guy but this guy's

00:52:37.119 --> 00:52:39.040

exactly what you call a company man yeah

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:42.000

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.079

while i was

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.319
in a tent with the sun up because it was

01:01:58.319 --> 01:02:01.200
the early show behind the parking garage

next to us yeah they did we could walk

01:02:13.359 --> 01:02:14.880
in right now what what what did he say

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.400
the point was they never really

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.480
explained we didn't have a [ __ ] side

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.640
too

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.440
exactly but they were trying to they

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:30.720
weren't worried about covet exactly

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.480
they're worried about people complaining

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.880
yeah

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.880

01:02:38.079 --> 01:02:38.880
early

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:39.839

01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:42.000
weakness maybe i i mean those guys are

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.359
great over there

like someone probably wasn't sure one

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:47.920
version
