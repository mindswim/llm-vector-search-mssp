00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.920
lbj um

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.719
first of all there's an interesting

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.320
tie-in

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.840
a person that ties together

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.440
jfk lbj and nixon is it my father's cut

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.280
it's your mother's car is it really no

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.399
it really works

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.320
no there are some parts of history your

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.160
mother's [ __ ] did not figure into

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.760
there's only a few

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.600
but the place the person who's sort of

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.760
the that combines these three figures in

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.640
an interesting way

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.520
is jackie jackie oh

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.000
because

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.119
um

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.479
first of all obviously she's connected

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.280
to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.520
jfk because he [ __ ] her yeah

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:24.560
but

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.880
there's great first of all and i i've

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.920
been to like

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.439
every presidential library not not

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.520
everyone i didn't do a lot

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.400
and

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.720
nixon's has this really weird artifact

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.159
they always have these artifacts like

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.840
the the actual written so there's these

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.479
notes it's a letter written by jackie oh

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.439
to nixon right after

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.200
uh jfk was shot

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.880
like it's one of the first things she

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.079
did

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.880
and it's like on hotel stationery

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.560
and it's just in her hand and it's like

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.560
many it's many pieces like little

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.320
notepad pieces

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.759
she sat down and wrote a letter to

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.360
richard nixon because the thing with all

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.119
these families is they all hung out

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.040
together so even if they were political

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.759
enemies like if if kennedy and nixon are

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.039

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.039
brother we used to live together and i i

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:04.400

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.840
had heard about the thing about nick

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.759
depaolo is that you say and you tell him

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:10.319

there's somewhere in asia they they love

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.560
monkey brains and the best way to enjoy

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.080
monkey brains is when they're still

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.360
alive so what there's these tables with

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.840
little like skull-shaped holes in them

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.000
yeah and they put the monkey up there

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.919
and they cut the top and you just cut it

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:29.919
open and you eat it with a little

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:31.440
stylish fork

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.199

lbj

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:46.640
was a

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.480
i mean i told you this story last time

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.920
after we stopped

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.160
but the two stories i i also read and

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.120
saw in his um library one was that a

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.440
mexican woman who lived in his

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.519
home district in texas

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:00.399
um

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:02.640
her husband died uh he was killed in

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.560
world war ii killed in action and his

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.800
coffin was sent back to her hometown and

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.240
nobody would bury it because he's

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.760
mexican

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.360
none of the undertakers none of the none

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.959
of these cemeteries would take his body

00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:14.560
because they're only white people

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.959
and so she wrote to lbj who was at the

00:09:16.959 --> 00:09:19.279
time her senator and she said is there

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:21.440
anything you can do i can't bury my war

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.880
hero husband you know he's just a

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.640
regular [ __ ] corporal who got shot

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.839
yeah you know

00:09:25.839 --> 00:09:28.080
and uh so they have this letter and then

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.320
you see his reply he says i really sorry

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.399
to inform you that i can't i can't force

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:33.600
those people to do something they don't

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.399
want to do and it i know it's not enough

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:38.959
but all i can do is bury your husband in

00:09:38.959 --> 00:09:41.680
arlington cemetery with full honors so

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.120
that guy's in arlington so that's the

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.279
kind of guy and that's a quiet story of

00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:47.680
his you know what i mean this is he was

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.000
a he was a a principled guy he was a

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.240
[ __ ] up guy he was weird

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.440
um

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.640
but that's something he did and uh

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.120
he i i asked you this before i think but

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.560
was he like

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.760
because he got the civil rights thing

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.240
going right yeah

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.519
he used jfk's death to pass everything

00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:09.680
on civil rights it was always his

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.680
intention he didn't he was a

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.160
integrationist guy he was a guy who

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.880
wanted an integration he lived in texas

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.399
and he was a southern

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:20.959
democrat yeah so he was pragmatic about

00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:22.720
it he's a big guy he was big right yeah

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.720
he i think he was yeah he was starting

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.480
to think of him as big he was a farm guy

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.959
he was a real [ __ ] country yeah guy

00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:31.200
and he did stuff like he had these dogs

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.200
and he would lift his dogs by the ears

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.200
and show the press look at my dogs and

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.640
everybody's like what the [ __ ] are you

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.160
doing don't do that i guess that's my

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.360
dog

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.720
is there anything more unsettling when

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.240
someone grips their dog up like that

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.240
yeah

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.399
look at my dogs dude it's not a puppy

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:51.839
and someone grabs by the back of them oh

00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:53.600
yeah it's like dude stop

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.720
and also he used to make a lot of his

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.519
um phone calls on the toilet and he

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:01.760
would have meetings on the toi like a

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.040
like he made a lot of big decisions

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.720
sitting on the toilet

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.240
and they'd talk to him mr president what

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.600
do you want to do about korea and he's

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.279
like i don't give a god damn or whatever

00:11:09.279 --> 00:11:11.839
you know and he and so vietnam and all

00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:13.839
that stuff and the thing about lbj that

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:15.839
to me is like an important thing is that

00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:17.519
he was an empathetic president

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:19.279
he felt when other people felt okay this

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:22.160
is my problem with some other presidents

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.279
um

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:24.640
is that they don't have that they don't

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.040
actually he there is a famous photograph

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.680
you can find of him where um

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.480
one of his i think it was his son-in-law

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.560
i think it was chuck todd

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.440
was a um who ended up being a senator

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.600
from virginia turned into a real douche

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.640
later but

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.440
um

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.680
he sent a tape of he was a lieutenant

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.839
in the army in vietnam and lieutenants

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:49.680
were just like having to take platoons

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.160
out yeah and just get them all massacred

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.720
so he just sent a reel-to-reel tape to

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.240
his father-in-law the president

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.680
describing

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.839
a bloody day in vietnam and how many

00:11:59.839 --> 00:12:02.639
guys he lost and how bad it was and the

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.880
there's a photograph of lbj listening to

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.800
this tape and he's just got his glasses

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.160
off and he's just

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.440
sobbing because yeah he knows that he's

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.760
he's in charge of this yes to somebody

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.279
kept it going he still thought it was

00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:17.279
right or he couldn't he couldn't undo it

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:19.440
i don't know i think but it made him

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.519
feel that's the conspiracies though

00:12:21.519 --> 00:12:25.040
well it reminded my i have my uncle as a

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.120
retail very retired he's his 80s but he

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.639
was a uh um a commander in the navy and

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:32.480
he was a seabee and an instruction

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.880
battalion he was an engineer and they

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.560
went to vietnam early

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.360
when we were still it was called uh yeah

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.600
uh they were just sending advisers

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.160
and so he was sent there to build for

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:44.959
them

00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:46.639
and then and he got a bunch he went

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:49.360
around to his navy friends and talked

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.279
them into going to vietnam for this

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:53.760
venture it was not a war yet

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.839
and then it turned into a war under his

00:12:55.839 --> 00:12:58.880
feet and everybody he all the [ __ ]

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.040
guys he brought over there got killed

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.920
and uh um and then he went back came

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.440
back to the states and went had to tell

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.040
all their you know apologize for their

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.480
families so like there's a lot of guys

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.079
who were like in those command positions

00:13:10.079 --> 00:13:12.480
was just you know they're in a war yeah

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.279
but so that was uh so lbj

00:13:15.279 --> 00:13:17.279
um

00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:18.720
ran

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.560
so he he

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.200
took over for jack and then he ran in

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.480
64. yeah i believe he did and he beat

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.079
who

00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:29.600
he's these are the guys i never i don't

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.240
know who lbj's vice president might have

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.399
lost to nixon his first

00:13:34.399 --> 00:13:36.320
no

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.399
no he he only ran once

00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:40.240
for president

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.639
in 64. and technically yeah he served

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:46.079
from 63 to 69. yeah so 64 who did he

00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:47.040
beat

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.560
who was the democrat who was the

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.360
republican nominee because nixon sat it

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.000
out nixon didn't run this time goldwater

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.959
coldwater barry goldberry goldwater okay

00:13:56.959 --> 00:13:59.839
so um

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:03.760
uh but then when it got to be 68

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.399
this is another he did tough things lbj

00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:07.440
like you took

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.680
he took it on the chin i mean vietnam

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.000
and civil rights are two of the biggest

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.880
i mean huge huge conflicts yeah and then

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.519
he did something that no president has i

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:19.040
don't think i mean some presidents maybe

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.240
have done but the way he did was very

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.360
dramatic

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.600
which was that in 68 he just knew he

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.839
didn't have the confidence of the people

00:14:25.839 --> 00:14:28.000
anymore he knew that he had to face it

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.560
was a very nixonian moment he had to

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.760
face that

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.360
he had lost

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.120
the confidence of the people that he he

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.720
wasn't popular anymore and he was

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.320
everything was [ __ ]

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.160
and so he made this speech where he said

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.720
i i

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.320
um i will not seek nor will i accept my

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.800
party's nomination for a second term as

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.720
president like he made he declared i'm

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.959
not running a second time that's [ __ ]

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:55.440
rare yeah that's rare most guys just do

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.600
it because you're supposed to

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.320
when i worked at a conan at conan's show

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.560
early i was i was a writer for conan the

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.639
first two years

00:15:04.639 --> 00:15:06.160
we did one bit that i love it was my

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.519
favorite video we ever did it was just

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.880
inventions so one of them and it was one

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.600
that i wrote it was a a machine that you

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.440
it's a big belt that you wear and then

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.519
there's a probe in your ass

00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:19.920
and when you fart

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.160
so you're not embarrassed by the smell i

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.199
mean by the sound yeah it pla instead of

00:15:25.199 --> 00:15:28.000
your fart you hear that speech

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.759
so we had a guy like thirty farts and

00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:32.800
you hear i will not seek nor shall i

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.240
accept

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.800
anyway so lbj didn't run again and

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.279
um in 68 and that's when everything fell

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:43.839
apart bob bobby ran

00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:44.959

and she said

00:17:32.799 --> 00:17:35.520
when martin luther king was killed

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.000
bobby kennedy was about to have a

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.840
black people's black

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.080
audience like in some city

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.559
and he got the news

00:17:46.559 --> 00:17:50.240
and he had to tell the audience

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.039
that mlk had been assassinated

00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:55.600
and he off the cuff

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.520
said some things about it and

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.679
gave a speech which was very moving and

00:17:59.679 --> 00:18:03.520
i just went you know [ __ ] rfk mlk

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.600
yeah and played it for her and she was

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.000
like she was like what is happening

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.600
yeah that's awesome i thought well i

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.200
mean i was close

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.400
with my guess

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.520
i thought your mom was gonna be like if

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.880
i could see anything in the world right

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.000
now it would be him show me him dead

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.840
so he's shown me that [ __ ] i'd

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.559
like to see it with blood on his face

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:24.799
so he was shot coming out of the through

00:18:24.799 --> 00:18:25.600
they were taking them through the

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.640
kitchen

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.240
um sarah han sirhan shoots him

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.480
and this busboy is the one who catches

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.559
him it just was in a melee of people so

00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:35.919
a guy who had nothing to do with

00:18:35.919 --> 00:18:37.120
anything

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.480
just like saying yes

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.880
he's

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.440
and he looks down at him and only he

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.919
never spoke about it like he wouldn't

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:49.840
press used to ask him he just refused to

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.280
talk about it because he felt the moment

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.799
was very personal

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:54.720
but he finally i think i thick i might

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.120
be dead but i i saw an interview with

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.200
him where he said what happened

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.840
which is that bobby said um

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.360
he just asked him do you have a rosary

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.400
he knew he would because he's [ __ ]

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.720
mexican he said do you have a rosary and

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.760
he did

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.360
and they gave him a rosary and he

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.000
basically took his last rights holy she

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.320
gave bobby a shot at a catholic little

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.360
deaf

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.640
damn

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.559
sirhan sirhan

00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:20.799
went to prison i think he's still alive

00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:23.039
i think he's still in prison

00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:26.160
so he shows up in a great book by the

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.799
guy who invented profiling in the fbi

00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:30.320
the guy who invented like you know

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.600
criminal profiling okay uh richard

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.840
kessler or something like that

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.320
this guy wrote this but he was the first

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.400
guy in the fbi to come up with the idea

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.200
of

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.200
of figuring out why killers do what they

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.039
do they didn't do that the guy for the

00:19:45.039 --> 00:19:46.799
mine hunter show yeah yeah i don't know

00:19:46.799 --> 00:19:48.880
i don't know he invented this thing yes

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.559
so uh

00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:52.480
and the book is great because it it the

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.200
book starts with a a guy who murdered um

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.559
a serial killer who killed somebody in

00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:58.559
san fran like in sacramento somewhere in

00:19:58.559 --> 00:20:00.480
some neighborhood killed a lady went in

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.159
her house killed the lady and then

00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:04.880
killed another lady the next day

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.440
and so they they flew this guy in who

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.440
had become famous for this he took one

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.120
look at the murder scene

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.720
he said you're looking for a white man

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.520
in his 40s who has a big beard he's

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.520
living in his car that's filled with

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.799
newspapers and trash from mcdonald's

00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:22.320
and uh

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.679
if you don't catch him he's gonna do

00:20:23.679 --> 00:20:25.360
this every day

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.360
and they went and found the guy exactly

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.000
on that so then when that guy was caught

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.760
he did the next part of his job which is

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.520
was he interviewed him to find out

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.200
because these guys love talking and he

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.360
asked him all the questions so they

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.280
understand these guys better and he

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.720
asked the guy

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.880
how did you pick your victims that's a

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.120
key thing that's in in finding out how

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.200
they're gonna pick the next one and he

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.400
said

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.120
um i would just go to any house and if

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.960
the door was unlocked i'd kill anybody

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.240
in there

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.400
so it wasn't like she looked like my mom

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.080
yeah and so he said i'm putting this in

00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.520
the first chapter to just tell you just

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.880
lock you you're gonna just lock your

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.520
doors please lock it yeah okay so

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.039
that's fine it's funny to just ruin the

00:21:05.039 --> 00:21:06.960
profiling thing yeah he's like oh no i

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.039
don't no i just if the door is unlocked

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:10.000
what are you talking about if you're

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.159
dumb i'll kill you but anyway all that i

00:21:12.159 --> 00:21:13.520
know i'm getting away from president the

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.440
point is that guy

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.480
uh

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.640
once he learned this thing of like

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.200
talking to the guys he realized we have

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.200
all the most notorious killers in

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.440
federal prisons i want to go talk to

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.039
them and he couldn't get permission

00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:28.799
because everyone in the fbi said that's

00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:31.600
macabre and it's your interpreter

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.280
so then he realized why am i asking it

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.799
just go to a federal prison show him

00:21:34.799 --> 00:21:37.200
he's like a gold fbi badge yeah so the

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.880
first guy he talked to was sir hans her

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:39.840
hand

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.600
he shows up and he just says i want to

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.240

he thought was you know why he did it he

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.840

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.679
why he did it and he didn't learn

00:22:03.679 --> 00:22:05.039
anything and he thought maybe this isn't

00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:06.400
a good idea he was about to give up on

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.400
the science of this and then right

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.400
before sarahan left

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.200

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.120
stopped and he took off his shirt

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.960
because he works out in prison and he

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.159

he's [ __ ] vain he's vain

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.880
he wants people to look at him

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.480
and that unlocked that's you know what i

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.280
mean yeah of course so like that uh

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.840
hannibal lecter thing what does he do

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.159

00:22:34.159 --> 00:22:36.640
incidental yeah what is the point of the

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.159
guy so anyway that's her answer your

00:22:38.159 --> 00:22:39.600
hand kill robert community

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.799
surrendering's got to be dead right

00:22:42.799 --> 00:22:44.400
he still goes out for parole every few

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.559
years he gotta let him out

00:22:46.559 --> 00:22:48.400
oh that's he's got he's got a couple

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.200
years dude yeah he's uh the best is the

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.960
guy who shot well i guess we'll get to

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.440
him well mike sweeney comedian did the

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.000
best joke ever he he wrote for conan for

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
years but he was a great stand-up and

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.280
i'm just gonna i'm i'm saying his name

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.640
so i think i can see that's a joke mike

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.679
sweeney

00:23:03.679 --> 00:23:05.360
he used to do a joke about her swordhand

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.400
sirhan

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.120
at his first parole hearing he said i

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.520
think if robert kennedy was alive today

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.840
he would say that i should be let go

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.559
and he goes boy just above all the bad

00:23:16.559 --> 00:23:17.440
luck

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.600
the one guy who would have stuck up for

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.640
him turns out it's the guy he shot

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.039
anyway sir anser hand kills robert

00:23:25.039 --> 00:23:27.520
kennedy and the democrats go to the

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.159

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.039
uh so nixon [ __ ]

00:24:23.039 --> 00:24:25.600
finally after all those years of his

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.840
long life in politics having been vice

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:28.880
president

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.679
for [ __ ] eisenhower having been

00:24:31.679 --> 00:24:34.240
um a senator and during the mccarthy

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.919
hearings all this stuff he ends up being

00:24:35.919 --> 00:24:37.600
president united states 96 and he gets

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.080
the people he does the moral majority

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.440
you know the people the or what do you

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.520
call them the silent yes george the

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.080
silent majority guys the guys

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.240
hard hats who hated hippies and he

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.760
counted on that

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.080
and uh it won and he won yeah it's

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.840
coming again we're doing the same thing

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.000
same thing exact same thing same thing

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.480
so then you get to nixon through four

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.720
years and he gets to 72. now i have a

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.640
question was the press gay back then

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.120
like they don't know

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.360
were they like totally like well it was

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.880
a different bunch you got like dan

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.440
rather and you know uh

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.400
uh

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.320
you know i mean i'm forgetting all these

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.000
guys names it was never this partisan

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:16.960
though right

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.279
no because there was there was the cbs

00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:20.320
news

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.240
which was walter cronkite

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.960
and there was uh nbc and

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.960
and abc there was that was the news was

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.760
you chose between three dudes

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.919
and there was uh david brinkley and they

00:25:31.919 --> 00:25:33.520
had to meet the press they had some

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.679
stuff they even still have now yeah but

00:25:35.679 --> 00:25:37.760
it was the only the press was

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.279
centralized there wasn't this sort of

00:25:39.279 --> 00:25:41.679
like the the written press was pretty

00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:42.799
out there

00:25:42.799 --> 00:25:44.799
but the tv news was what everybody was

00:25:44.799 --> 00:25:47.440
really following and so everyone watched

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.880
the same news

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.000
and uh then we argued so it was

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
different and and you never had a sense

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.919
that the press to answer your question

00:25:55.919 --> 00:25:57.919
no they really weren't

00:25:57.919 --> 00:25:58.960
gay

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.640
shane

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.600
i don't agree with you gay that way

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.360
he's even making me sound gay because

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.200
i'm so upset with him

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.840
my

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.840
god so

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.480
well like cronkite cronkite was a

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.320
picture to actually be gay when you're

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.559
being gay it's the best like to be mad

00:26:18.559 --> 00:26:21.120
about something get a poster for that

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.320
stop it

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.520
stop it

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:27.039
especially this angry gay stop it

00:26:27.039 --> 00:26:28.640
shane what's more terrible that would be

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.320
if you had two gay dads there would have

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.279
been one

00:26:31.279 --> 00:26:33.039
who's like shane just don't make him mad

00:26:33.039 --> 00:26:35.279
shane what the [ __ ] are you saying to

00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:36.840
him

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.120
shane it could be the most hair that's

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.440
the most scary getting yelled at

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.240
by your gay dad i knew a gay i knew a

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.240
number of gays i knew a number of gay

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.880
dads and two moms

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.200
uh when i was raising my kids a lot of

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.200
their friends had gay dancing and i saw

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.279
every it's the same as any other

00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:57.039
stereotype there are many kinds of

00:26:57.039 --> 00:26:58.640
heterosexual parents

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.919
there are soft-hearted useless

00:27:01.919 --> 00:27:03.520
heterosexual parents

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.400
there are distracted narcissistic i

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.640
think i can change my kids life parents

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.080
that are heterosexuals and there's just

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.360
[ __ ] like

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.559
got it gets it doing the tough work

00:27:14.559 --> 00:27:16.640
heterosexual parents and it's the same

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.039
in my experience with gay moms and gay

00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:20.559
dads i've known gay dads who are just

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:22.799
like hard tack [ __ ] i'm not i'm not

00:27:22.799 --> 00:27:24.720
[ __ ] this up yeah but also i know

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.720
it's his life that like i've known so

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.200
many kinds but they all sound like this

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.880
but anyway

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.799
not really kick the ball kick it tyler

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.000
yeah but so um gay dads are great

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.760
gay dads are great every single one of

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.960
them yeah

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.200
um

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.919
walter cronkite has two great moments

00:27:47.919 --> 00:27:49.760
that show you what the press was back

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:50.559
then

00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:52.480
there's the moon landing

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.399
and there's the and there's kennedy

00:27:54.399 --> 00:27:55.760
getting killed

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.600
he's in again if you're watching this on

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.760
youtube you can see both of these so the

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.320
moon landing is just you they show the

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.559
[ __ ] footage of neil

00:28:04.559 --> 00:28:06.720
touching down which didn't happen is

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.320
they didn't never land on them

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.279
and

00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:10.880
then they cut to cronkite news what's

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.799
his name it was your boy

00:28:12.799 --> 00:28:14.320
that was kubrick dude

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.000
he did the moonlight kubrick did yeah

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.039
that's why they gave him all the lenses

00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:18.880
yeah use the lenses for

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.080
barry linden

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.360
it's true

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.279
he barry lyndon is a great movie by

00:28:23.279 --> 00:28:25.120
stanley kubrick and it takes place in

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.440
like the 1600s and he wanted it to look

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.360
like that so he used no electric lights

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.360
but he needed lenses that drink a huge

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.080
amount of light and he got nasa to give

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:34.960
him

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.520
moon lenses so he did do the moonlight

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.679
yes nobody's ever been on the moon

00:28:39.679 --> 00:28:41.520
nobody's ever been on the moon

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.600
100 you see all there's some clues in

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.840
the shining huh there's clues about the

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.520
moon yeah i don't believe this i think

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.640
they would

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.159
but

00:28:50.159 --> 00:28:52.000
but

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.240
no they i think i think uh somebody was

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.760
trying to argue that in like some

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.440
chinese astronomy

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.960
they found

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.440
there's the satellite images of where

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.840
people landed yeah why would we help

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.440
cover this by the way they went up like

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.200
20 times it's not even that big a deal

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:07.919
but

00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:09.279
um

00:29:09.279 --> 00:29:12.480
but uh so cronkite when they landed on

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.000
the moon you just cut to him and he's

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.200
got this big

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.279
childish grin on his face he's just he

00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:19.120
doesn't say anything he doesn't say this

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:22.159
is a marvelous moment he just reports

00:29:22.159 --> 00:29:24.960
well and neil has landed a man has

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.960
landed on the moon he says the facts but

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.640
he's got a bit you can see the feeling

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.640
but he doesn't say it

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.200
and then the other moment that it's just

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.360
devastating is when

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.720
kennedy dies

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.520
he says uh uh he gets the report he gets

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.480
it

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.440
in his hand and he says uh president

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.000
kennedy has uh died

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:46.960
um

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.880
he died at 12 o'clock i mean and he

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.799
takes off his glasses to look at the

00:29:50.799 --> 00:29:52.799
clock above him because he's reading

00:29:52.799 --> 00:29:54.240
to look at the clock apartments and

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.840
that's three o'clock

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.480
eastern standard time he just reports to

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.720
kennedy has died and reports the time

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.399
and he looks at his

00:30:02.399 --> 00:30:04.240
block and then he

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.440
puts his glasses back on and he goes

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.799
sports

00:30:08.799 --> 00:30:12.159
and he just swallows

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.279
vice president lyndon johnson is to be

00:30:15.279 --> 00:30:17.120
sworn into he just and there's this

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.039
moment between

00:30:19.039 --> 00:30:21.279
where he's taking in that the president

00:30:21.279 --> 00:30:22.559
of the united states is dead which

00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:24.320
without even thinking about who it was

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.200
was just horrible

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.440
and then that uh

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.840
and then he probably knew him you know

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.480
so but that was his he didn't grandstand

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.399
you know you watch the news now and

00:30:36.399 --> 00:30:38.240
they're just like you know oh and

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.559
they're just feeling [ __ ] yeah and it's

00:30:40.559 --> 00:30:41.600
horrible

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.840
they are not supposed to you know like i

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.000
when i worked for letterman

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.240
we the yankees were in the world series

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.240
and i got caught caught up in it and

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.000
because i'm a new yorker i'm a boston

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.919
guy but i just got caught up it was fun

00:30:53.919 --> 00:30:56.000
so i got to we took larry bud millman

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.760
this character the letterman had to to

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.799
the game

00:30:58.799 --> 00:31:00.960
and interviewed the players and then i

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.480
got to be in the press box during the

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.919
game and me and a friend of mine was a

00:31:03.919 --> 00:31:05.360
writer we're sitting there

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.279
watching the game and we're cheering

00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:08.640
when the yankees hit and then we look

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.080
and everyone's staring at us like what

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.600
the [ __ ] are you doing

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.240
you don't cheer in the press box

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.600
like it was like we're all fans of

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.919
something but yeah shut the [ __ ] up i

00:31:17.919 --> 00:31:19.600
think that shit's gone i think that's

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.360
all really certainly

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.760
but anyway so uh

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.159
nixon serves also one more thing about

00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:28.480
kennedy dude yeah why go to the moon

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.519
it's probably that's probably my

00:31:29.519 --> 00:31:31.600
favorite speech

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.159
we go we do things yeah yeah we choose

00:31:34.159 --> 00:31:36.559
to go to the moon not because it is easy

00:31:36.559 --> 00:31:38.480
but because it is hard because it's hard

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.640
yes and he also in one of his speeches

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.559
about them he had a great job in there

00:31:42.559 --> 00:31:44.640
he goes why does rice play texas that

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.880
gets me every time i'm just like dude

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.960
why are they playing they get [ __ ]

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.320
killed every year that's right and

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.159
they're still doing it yes

00:31:52.159 --> 00:31:54.320
uh kennedy also had a great

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.080
parable he used to tell he there's a lot

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.440
of speeches that are lost because a lot

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.799
of these guys they didn't record every

00:31:58.799 --> 00:31:59.679
speech

00:31:59.679 --> 00:32:02.000
but one of his uh he liked telling jokes

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.360
about irish guys

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.760
so did uh reagan they had that in common

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:09.039
they both used i like patty jokes yeah

00:32:09.039 --> 00:32:11.919
so he tells a story in uh during his

00:32:11.919 --> 00:32:13.519
moon

00:32:13.519 --> 00:32:15.440
uh mission went trying to get the money

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.840
in the the country behind the moon

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.519
and he talks about these three irish

00:32:19.519 --> 00:32:21.200
guys walking along the leaves of

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.960
whatever you know

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.600
just crossing the the great green

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.279
grasses of ireland

00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:30.720
and then they get to a wall stone wall

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.360
and they go should we climb the wall

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.679
or should we go turn back and go home

00:32:35.679 --> 00:32:37.440
and one of them takes his friend's hat

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.039
off his head and throws it over the wall

00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:40.799
and says i guess we're going

00:32:40.799 --> 00:32:42.799
so that was part of kennedy's time it's

00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:44.799
not that good that was cool

00:32:44.799 --> 00:32:45.679
so

00:32:45.679 --> 00:32:48.559
uh and then nixon's president when

00:32:48.559 --> 00:32:50.880
they land on them

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.919
and there's a in his in his uh um

00:32:53.919 --> 00:32:55.919
library in yorba belinda california

00:32:55.919 --> 00:32:58.080
where he was born and raised in his and

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.600
the little house that he was born in is

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.519
there at the library

00:33:01.519 --> 00:33:02.559
um

00:33:02.559 --> 00:33:04.960
there's a phone which is the phone that

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.279
he talked to the moon

00:33:07.279 --> 00:33:08.080
on

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.200
the white house they took the white

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.559
house phone

00:33:10.559 --> 00:33:12.320
that he made the you know it's just a

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.720
[ __ ] beige phone with a big white

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.279
button and a big red hold button i don't

00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:19.360
know if he put them on hold

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.600
but he you know talked to you know well

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.519
it's just wonderful that you're up on

00:33:23.519 --> 00:33:25.600
the moon you're up there and jack is

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.519
dead

00:33:27.519 --> 00:33:28.960
and uh

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.679
nothing could stop me now yeah no

00:33:31.679 --> 00:33:34.320
so yeah so he uh he was president when

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.440
that happened and uh and so 68 turns

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:40.080
into the 72 and now the country's really

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.679
[ __ ] changing

00:33:41.679 --> 00:33:44.640
um everything's in color now the tv's in

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.120
color everything's you know hippies are

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.039
starting to get old yeah they're

00:33:49.039 --> 00:33:50.640
starting to wash out a little bit yes

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.480
what's better than that two things

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.399
happened to the hippies first of all

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:55.840
they killed a bunch of them they killed

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.600
a bunch of their leaders

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:01.840
um but they also got they they the drugs

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.080
started to take a bad effect they went

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.200
from

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.960
mind liberating pot

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.200
to [ __ ] you know heroin and cocaine

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.760
dark drugs they became dark dark evil

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:15.280
hippies yes and then some of them uh

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.480
grew up and

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.639
had families wanting to be rich

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:20.079
so and there's very another thing you

00:34:20.079 --> 00:34:22.240
can find on youtube that's great are the

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:24.639
debates between abby hoffman

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:26.960
and uh ruben uh

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.560
[ __ ]

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.919
he was uh

00:34:29.919 --> 00:34:32.399
jane fond his husband

00:34:32.399 --> 00:34:34.639
and he was a congressman eventually but

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:36.879
he was one of the one of the jerry rubin

00:34:36.879 --> 00:34:37.599
i think

00:34:37.599 --> 00:34:39.040
he was one of the yippies he's one of

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.440
the he was a wicked radical and he used

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.200
to be one of those guys we're not taking

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.919
his [ __ ] anymore and the president come

00:34:45.919 --> 00:34:48.800
here and kiss my [ __ ] ass yeah and uh

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.040
abby hoffman had the best congressman

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.560
yes abby hoffman was even abby hoffman

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.879
said the n word constantly during speech

00:34:56.879 --> 00:34:58.720
during his uh speeches because he would

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.720
just be with a bullhorn and talking

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.960
about [ __ ] you and he was like really

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.079
inappropriate and he was uh he was

00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:09.280
really a lit up nut abby hoffman

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.400
um

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.160
him and jerry rubin were both they were

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.400
like the east coast west coast

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.680
hippies

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:20.240
later jay rubin became a huge um

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.960
uh capitalist he became a yuppie that's

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.280
where the term yuppie came from

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.920
and the two of them debated they did

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.520
they traveled together to different

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.839
universities and they would debate

00:35:31.839 --> 00:35:33.839
their generation's new

00:35:33.839 --> 00:35:36.079
predicaments of do we keep the fight

00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:38.320
going of trying to get out of wars and

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.839
trying to be democrats and trying to

00:35:39.839 --> 00:35:41.440
liberate this country

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.440
and uh the other ones are like we got to

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.359
grow up and we gotta and and what reuben

00:35:45.359 --> 00:35:48.079
was saying was we need a candidate we

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:50.079
need to win an election so we need to go

00:35:50.079 --> 00:35:51.280
to the center

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.440
and we need to talk to big business and

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.200
small business and we need to talk about

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.839
being a practical because that's the

00:35:57.839 --> 00:35:59.280
liberal dream

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.440
and this became clinton this is where

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.280
clinton came from that

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.760
from the hippies saying okay we're not

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.280
going to just protest our whole lives

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.960
and be these losers

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.560
uh at one point they had a huge amount

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.440
of power yeah in vietnam they had a lot

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.200
of power there's this they had they held

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.599
this vigil around the uh

00:36:17.599 --> 00:36:19.760
lincoln memorial and i mean think of the

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.119
time

00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:24.000
because mlk gave the speech there and

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.720
they [ __ ] shot the guy

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.599
and

00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:29.200
i remember being at the lincoln memorial

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:32.240
with my kids and saying that this spot

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:34.079
the steps of the lincoln memorial is a

00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:36.000
huge it's a place you can really

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.400
understand american history from because

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.119
you look that way you see washington and

00:36:41.119 --> 00:36:43.200
that was the creation of our country

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.359
right and then you see the capital which

00:36:45.359 --> 00:36:47.839
was the the growth of this legislature

00:36:47.839 --> 00:36:50.240
but there was washington which was the

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.640
creation of the country in revolution

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:56.720
and then there was uh uh lincoln who was

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.280
who kept it together as a union

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.359
you know who who that was the second

00:37:01.359 --> 00:37:03.839
step yeah we're our own country but also

00:37:03.839 --> 00:37:06.160
even if millions die we need to be a

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:09.119
union okay that's what lincoln did and

00:37:09.119 --> 00:37:11.440
then who stood here and made this place

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:14.400
even uh important for a new generation

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.040
mlk stood there and there was a sea of

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.599
people and he and he had to fight for

00:37:19.599 --> 00:37:21.680
inside of that union

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.079
that lincoln preserved that washington

00:37:24.079 --> 00:37:26.560
started he said we we have to fight for

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.920
our rights in here he was the first one

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.320
to say there's a civil way

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.040
to fight for to to push for our rights

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:36.560
legally and through uh quiet you know

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.640
through uh non-violent resistance so

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.560
this is a huge place it's firing you up

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.560
dude right this country has an

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.599
incredibly romantic history

00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:46.960
and there's another way to look at all

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.480
this apparently but this is the way that

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.320
i was taught it and i i see it again as

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.560
a story of the story

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:56.240
so but then after after he'd been shot

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.480
and all that became rubble like that all

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.240
that was pushed aside and now that we're

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.720
in a [ __ ] melee war

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.280
nixon's president it feels like forever

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.280
it just feels like next nixon's never

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.560
not going to be president he was a

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.200
psychotic he's taking drugs he's

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.599
drinking a lot he's taught he was so

00:38:13.599 --> 00:38:15.680
racist he was like there's tapes of him

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:16.720
saying

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.320
about it's about italians he's like i

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.920
don't like italians they they smell

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.880
different he says that on tape

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:25.760
and who's right well you know depends on

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.680
if they've been cooking

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:30.560
but uh so nixon

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.800
so the cat the the uh mall and the uh

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:38.160
memorial is just besieged by

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:41.760
uh strung out hippies students and

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.040
veterans

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.440
veterans who came home from the war and

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.240
hate the war now and have ron ronkovic

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.240
and all these guys in wheelchairs go

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.920
what the [ __ ] did i do this for yeah

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.119
this certainly isn't world war ii what

00:38:53.119 --> 00:38:54.640
are we winning here and when is this war

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.680
going to end and they it was just a mess

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.839
and in the middle of all that in the

00:38:59.839 --> 00:39:02.079
middle of the night one night nixon got

00:39:02.079 --> 00:39:03.440
in his limo

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.000
and drove in to the middle of that he

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.520
went to the lincoln memorial do you know

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.240
this no there's footage of this too

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.640
he was looking out his window

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.599
your [ __ ] kids yeah they know

00:39:15.599 --> 00:39:17.599
but it was breaking his heart because

00:39:17.599 --> 00:39:20.079
even though he had the hard hats

00:39:20.079 --> 00:39:22.320
and even though he had the silent

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.880
majority just like now

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:27.520
nobody wants the silent majority people

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.839
want the cool people to like them

00:39:29.839 --> 00:39:32.640
twitter is like 39 people

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:36.000
and 60 000 bots it's very few people

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.400
it's a bunch of kids

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.720
that are fighting and saying this

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.119
extremist [ __ ] and the huge vast amount

00:39:43.119 --> 00:39:44.800
of the of the liberal part of this

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.520
country does is not into any of that but

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.640
nobody's satisfied with just knowing

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.280
that the average person gets it and that

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.200
when you really deal with human beings

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.880
on a real level

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.160
they're gonna do the right thing i

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.079
believe i have a lot of confidence in

00:40:00.079 --> 00:40:01.680
human uh

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:02.640
um

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.800
and american you know just the way we

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.079
are as people

00:40:06.079 --> 00:40:06.960
but

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.640
these folks that

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.520
yell and scream they really people

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.839
want them to like them and so nixon even

00:40:13.839 --> 00:40:15.839
though he he was winning by a landslide

00:40:15.839 --> 00:40:17.599
everywhere he's looking out that window

00:40:17.599 --> 00:40:18.720
and he's looking at those kids because

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.480
it's your kids it's like if everybody

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.240
likes you but your kids think you're a

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.400
piece of [ __ ] it just eats it you just

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.119
destroys you and so he got in the

00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:28.880
limousine like

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.480
and he drove into the middle of the

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.240
protesters and he got out and he talked

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.520
to them

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.520
and it's just this footage of him like

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.680
targeting's in his stupid suit

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.359
and they're like man you don't get you

00:40:39.359 --> 00:40:41.920
know man you're just like you're like an

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.480
imperialist piece of [ __ ] man he's like

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.480
well i understand your point but

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.079
i mean is there do you just think we

00:40:48.079 --> 00:40:49.520
just give up i mean what happened to

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.920
this country and they they talked they

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:55.119
really talked i don't know what um

00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:57.040
what it did to him but he did get us out

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.359
of that war he received yeah nixon did

00:40:59.359 --> 00:41:01.200
pull us out of that war now he did it in

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.680
a way that is horrible

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:05.200
which is that he bombed cambodia

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.720
cambodia

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.640
and this is the story that i heard is

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.760
that

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.079
he had this very specific strategy which

00:41:12.079 --> 00:41:14.319
was he starts bombing cambodia which

00:41:14.319 --> 00:41:16.800
came out of nowhere it was like what

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:20.160
and then he let it wasn't cambodia was

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.240
where they had the the ho chi minh trail

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.160
right i don't know i think it was i

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.359
think they knew

00:41:25.359 --> 00:41:26.960
they could use cam like they were using

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.400
these trails in other countries right

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.079
but still it was a

00:41:30.079 --> 00:41:32.240
hot country we had no problem we were

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.400
not at war with cambodia but we were

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.480
bombing cambodia as if it would be like

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.000
if people were escaping to canada and we

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.400
were like so [ __ ] it or if canadians

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.400
were at war and some of them escaped

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.000
into the states and whatever the other

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.920
country was just started bombing [ __ ]

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.000
wisconsin like dude you can't just do

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.200
that yeah

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.040
and so many people are getting killed

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:53.440
and nixon what he did is he

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.920
let it be leaked that no one could get

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.040
in touch with him like that they were

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.960
his aides were trying to tell him to

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.319
stop bombing and that he cut off

00:42:00.319 --> 00:42:01.599
communication

00:42:01.599 --> 00:42:03.680
and was that he he wanted to think he'd

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.599
gone cuckoo and that's how they got the

00:42:05.599 --> 00:42:07.920
vietnamese to the table and and got a

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.000
piece it wasn't a good piece

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.160
oh he faked that he was nuts that's what

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.280
i heard

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.680
um that's good i don't know well that's

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.520
it that's how you hear history google i

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.800
don't know

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.040
but it's another thing about the vietnam

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.200
like like eisenhower when he left was

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.400
like the military industrial complex

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.960
that was that was vietnam yes

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.599
that was and that got us to now i was

00:42:31.599 --> 00:42:33.119
like oh now we pulled out of afghanistan

00:42:33.119 --> 00:42:34.079
where these guys are going to get their

00:42:34.079 --> 00:42:36.560
money mm-hmm hey 33 billion do you

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.319
create like it's just exactly what it's

00:42:38.319 --> 00:42:40.000
another side you have your like

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
political left that has more power than

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.599
they do people right because they're

00:42:43.599 --> 00:42:46.160
captivating people's like anxiety but

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.280
then on the other right you have all

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.720
these people that have that are really

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.640
they're they're doing [ __ ] up things

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:54.160
yeah that uh that also are untouchables

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.920
um and there are only a few people with

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.040
just a little bit of interest a little

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.400
bit of money and so they're making all

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.400
this crazy stuff happen that's jumping

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.079
ahead i don't know much about it but

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:03.440
anyway

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:06.319
but so nixon um

00:43:06.319 --> 00:43:07.760
but it seems to me if you speak out

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:10.079
against it you get shot in the head or

00:43:10.079 --> 00:43:11.520
watergated

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.119
yes which is kind of what's happened i

00:43:13.119 --> 00:43:15.280
could be wrong yes that seems to be the

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.960
underlying theme like he got out of that

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.160
war and then

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.000
i they could never shine

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.040
i don't believe in conspiracies but what

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.400
i do believe is that there's a shift in

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.880
the in the hive mind of america so that

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.200
if certain people that get in a position

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.280
where they're in trouble like nixon did

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.040
the next thing that the next person he

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.119
goes to is going to be like nah man like

00:43:37.119 --> 00:43:38.160
you don't know where it's going to come

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:40.400
from yeah like the story i heard about

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.640
caligula caligula was a terrible leader

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.640
who was an absolute leader because

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:47.359
everybody behind him had built

00:43:47.359 --> 00:43:50.800
the emperorship of rome into a huge

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.480
thing you couldn't touch the emperor's

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.319
like a god yeah and caligula made

00:43:54.319 --> 00:43:55.760
himself a god and then a crazy guy

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.800
talked he was insane legally was insane

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.720
and um did he have his horse in the

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:02.240
senate or was that he made a horse's

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.079
horse

00:44:04.079 --> 00:44:07.680
that's pretty sick and uh so uh

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.960
caligula

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.839
one of the emperor's duties each day is

00:44:11.839 --> 00:44:14.160
to give the watchword to the head of the

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:17.119
army and the watchword is like the code

00:44:17.119 --> 00:44:19.599
word for the whole roman army

00:44:19.599 --> 00:44:21.200
for the for the next week or whatever

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.599
yes so he somebody asks him what do you

00:44:23.599 --> 00:44:24.560
want

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.400
to be the code today

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.079
and he and it was the head of the army

00:44:28.079 --> 00:44:30.640
this guy was like his bodyguard and he

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.319
thought it was funny so he'd say give us

00:44:32.319 --> 00:44:33.839
a kiss he wanted everybody to have to

00:44:33.839 --> 00:44:36.000
say give us a kiss

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.839
and so that all the roman guards would

00:44:37.839 --> 00:44:39.839
have to say each other give me a kiss in

00:44:39.839 --> 00:44:42.400
order to uh in order to like pass one

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.599

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.960
so watergate was uh it started as a very

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.800
simple thing which was there's some guys

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:59.520
uh that nixon had a committee the

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.200
committee to re-elect

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.000
uh

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.359
the president

00:46:03.359 --> 00:46:05.440
which is creep that was creep was

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.280
literally their acronym

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:08.880
so creep

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:13.119
sent um some burglars to the democratic

00:46:13.119 --> 00:46:14.960
national committee's office which was in

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.960
watergate hotel watergate hotel is in

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.280
like a complex of office buildings

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:22.400
and um they stole some papers from there

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.440
and

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:24.560
um

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:25.920
this kind of [ __ ] was happening a lot

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.640
but nixon had nixon was on drugs

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:31.280
paranoid had a list of enemies he just

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:34.000
went he's his thing came apart is really

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.839
what happened yeah he

00:46:35.839 --> 00:46:38.880
these guys took the um took some papers

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.880
it wasn't a big deal but he immediately

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.640
tried to control it because he was so he

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.400
was like was quashing us we're killing

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.319
this right yeah and uh somebody said

00:46:46.319 --> 00:46:48.319
well we got this guy he if he talks

00:46:48.319 --> 00:46:49.760
we're all [ __ ]

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.599
and nixon says what does he want and

00:46:51.599 --> 00:46:53.520
they have them on tape somebody says

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.119
he'll do it for a million dollars and he

00:46:55.119 --> 00:46:57.200
says can can we get the million and and

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.800
it's nixon saying that was like the

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.560
smoking gun was like we'll give him a

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.359
million if he wants it

00:47:04.079 --> 00:47:05.359
talking about if you're president you

00:47:05.359 --> 00:47:06.800
can't say that out loud it's crazy but

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.720
he had too much could he he wasn't

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.400
delegating enough and

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.359
so one by one they the the the

00:47:13.359 --> 00:47:15.119
investigative reporters at the time were

00:47:15.119 --> 00:47:15.920
really

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:18.319
diligent and they turned against a lot

00:47:18.319 --> 00:47:19.599
of pressure

00:47:19.599 --> 00:47:22.960
um they turned wit guy after guy after

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.599
guy down until finally they got the guys

00:47:25.599 --> 00:47:27.839
close to him and and uh

00:47:27.839 --> 00:47:29.599
and he didn't have he knew he was the

00:47:29.599 --> 00:47:31.040

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.720
system who just knew who saw everything

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.800

my mom only made carnation milk with

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.800
powder because the milk was always

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.319
rotten because there was no

00:51:56.319 --> 00:51:58.880

beautiful for mexico and still island

00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:06.480

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:07.280
um

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.119
which is and and the thing is they work

00:52:09.119 --> 00:52:11.839
really hard there but their government

00:52:11.839 --> 00:52:12.640
is

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.559
crazy corrupt and always has been like

00:52:14.559 --> 00:52:16.720
mexico could be japan with different

00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:19.040
organizations like that's how hard they

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.880
work and for how many hours but so i

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:22.800
lived in mexico when i was a kid and

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.559
then we moved to america and coming to

00:52:24.559 --> 00:52:26.720
america which was like this shiny

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.520
country full of cheerful people where

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.040
all the floors are straight like it's

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.480
right angles

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.319
air conditioning

00:52:34.319 --> 00:52:38.400
and just a cleanness and an um

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:41.359
and an honesty and the idea that when

00:52:41.359 --> 00:52:43.520
they told me about like the president

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:45.440
like that it's a democracy mexico was a

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:46.720
democracy but everybody knew he was

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.400
corrupt

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.559
and i got obsessed with the idea of the

00:52:50.559 --> 00:52:52.160
president of the united states that's

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.319
where it became a thing to me and the

00:52:54.319 --> 00:52:57.280
president at the time was nixon

00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:58.800
and

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.319
um

00:53:00.319 --> 00:53:03.040
i cut a picture out of him of him out of

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:05.440
the paper and i put it taped it up next

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:08.079
to the next bed yes i loved it when i

00:53:08.079 --> 00:53:09.599
was a little kid

00:53:09.599 --> 00:53:11.440
i was so about richard nixon and i wrote

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.839
a letter to my abuelita my grandma yeah

00:53:13.839 --> 00:53:15.920
and i sent her a picture of nixon said

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:17.200
this is the president united states he's

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:19.599
the greatest man in the country he's so

00:53:19.599 --> 00:53:20.800
cool he's the best i didn't know a

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.040
single thing about it any other serious

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:25.119
face and i had a dream it's the first

00:53:25.119 --> 00:53:26.319
dream i remember i don't know if you

00:53:26.319 --> 00:53:27.680
remember dreams from when you were a kid

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:29.040
at all you ever had a dream that you

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.319
would still remember

00:53:30.319 --> 00:53:31.760
i'm not sure that i do

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:34.880
so i remember one dream i was in um

00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:37.760
i the my bedroom was in the front of our

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.359
house so you looked out at the front of

00:53:39.359 --> 00:53:42.559
our house and i was asleep and it was

00:53:42.559 --> 00:53:44.319
like a sunday morning

00:53:44.319 --> 00:53:48.480
and i heard a band like a marching band

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:53.280
and i looked outside and it was nixon

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:56.400
like walking up my street just no no

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.960
spectators yeah just him walking up my

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.640
with followed by a marching band boom

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:02.880
boom boom and i came out on the front

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.280
yard we had this walkway and he got down

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:08.720
on one knee and he said louie

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:10.850
and i ran into his arms

00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:15.440
[Laughter]

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:17.680
damn you loved

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:20.319
him so much

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.880
isn't that crazy

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:26.240
i've never told anybody that no

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:29.119
heartbroken i've never told anybody that

00:54:29.119 --> 00:54:31.280
in my life

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.640
and so

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.640
worried

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:37.750
[Music]

00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:43.520
the idea of his joy because nixon was

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:46.480
such a miserable man that his joyful

00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:48.480
side was very rare there's only one time

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:50.640
i've ever seen it on film and it's when

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.720
he's playing piano he's in a tuxedo and

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:54.319
i think he's at his daughter's wedding

00:54:54.319 --> 00:54:56.160
and he was a concert pianist he was very

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.960
good and he's playing piano and he plays

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:01.520
some big crescendo and he's got this big

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.440
dumb grin on his face

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:05.119
and i think maybe i had seen that

00:55:05.119 --> 00:55:06.319
because that's the only that grin every

00:55:06.319 --> 00:55:09.280
time i see it i'm in that dream

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:11.280
so but my parents saw that i had these

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:13.280
pictures of him next to my bed and they

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.680
were like he's not a good he's not that

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:17.760
great he's not his watergate was

00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:18.960
happening

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:21.520
and every night my parents were sitting

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:24.079
in front of the tv this little [ __ ]

00:55:24.079 --> 00:55:25.280
color tv

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:26.400
watching

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.319

00:55:28.319 --> 00:55:31.200

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.200

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.400

00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:48.960
walter cronkite saying that america and

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.240

around and they had soyuz capsules and

00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:58.559
one night they met

00:55:58.559 --> 00:56:00.240

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:01.200
accident

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:04.480
and they thought what if we could duck

00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.559

[ __ ] ball it's crazy in

00:57:39.599 --> 00:57:41.760
disgrace he left

00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:44.319
the office and left a mess of just like

00:57:44.319 --> 00:57:47.200
this is all [ __ ] now this is just

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.839
all [ __ ] crooked [ __ ] what is the

00:57:49.839 --> 00:57:52.400
point and the economy was tanking and

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:54.000
then here's gerald ford who's just a

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.440
kind of like oval-headed simple dude

00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.680
didn't um he made little moves he

00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:02.079
handled it perfectly i mean he did one

00:58:02.079 --> 00:58:04.240
thing that was extremely

00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:06.160
extremely unpopular and [ __ ] up which

00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:08.720
is he pardoned richard nixon it was the

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:10.880
first thing he did everyone wanted to go

00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:13.520
after nixon and keep investigating and

00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.599
catch him and send him to jail he could

00:58:15.599 --> 00:58:17.760
have gone to prison

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:20.640
for what he did

00:58:20.839 --> 00:58:22.400
and

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:23.839
ford

00:58:23.839 --> 00:58:25.680
knew that if he

00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:26.880
pardoned him

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:29.359
he would never win an election there was

00:58:29.359 --> 00:58:31.760
no way he was going to be

00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:33.280
re-elected yeah

00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.119
because everyone would just say well you

00:58:35.119 --> 00:58:37.040
guys are just [ __ ] dirty you're just

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:39.359
pardoning each other

00:58:39.359 --> 00:58:41.200
but he knew it was the right thing to do

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.720
we needed to get there he says all right

constantly but steve martin was the

00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:09.760
first person that made me think i could

00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:12.000
be a comedian because he was so weird

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.640

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:16.480

01:04:45.119 --> 01:04:47.680
his father owned a drug store

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:48.880
and they would just take him to the

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.720
drugstore and he was just like this and

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.799

01:04:52.799 --> 01:04:54.640
know just let him sit in the corner

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.880
and nobody thought he could hear

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.720
because he looked so [ __ ] up

01:04:58.720 --> 01:04:59.760
and

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:03.839
some neighbor pointed right at him

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.319
some neighbor sitting at the counter

01:05:08.319 --> 01:05:10.160
sitting at the uh ice cream counter the

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.079
drug store pointed at dole and said to

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:19.520
oh no and dole heard this

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.440
and it was the most pitiful moment in

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.039
his life

01:05:23.039 --> 01:05:25.280
and it was the moment that turned to

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:26.720
turn him around

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.720
because he realized i gotta

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:31.520

they would kill themselves yeah and he

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:41.039
thought he felt so sorry for himself but

01:05:41.039 --> 01:05:42.720
the next thought was it's time for me to

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.400
start and he became [ __ ] almost twice

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:45.920

i met dole

01:05:48.799 --> 01:05:50.640
i've met some weird people i met him i

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.880
was a writer at conan

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.039
and dole was a guest and i remember

01:05:55.039 --> 01:05:56.880
thinking at the time [ __ ] bob dole he's

01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:58.880
the one guy i wouldn't i would be rude

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.880
to him you know like you fantasized i

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.799
wouldn't even be nice to that guy i'd be

01:06:02.799 --> 01:06:04.880
rude to that guy if i met him and i was

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.359
standing in the where the outside of the

01:06:07.359 --> 01:06:09.520
studio and the elevators open and out

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.440
comes bob dole with no entourage like

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.039
the picture he was he was at the time he

01:06:13.039 --> 01:06:14.880
was like the [ __ ] senate majority

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:15.839
leader and

01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:18.480
he came out alone he held a pen in his

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:20.400
right hand always because his right hand

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.000
was um

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.160
was uh crippled and that's why he would

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.680
shake with his left yeah because he

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.599
didn't want you to reach for his right

01:06:27.599 --> 01:06:29.599

liberal

01:07:56.799 --> 01:07:59.119
president like he's such a

01:07:59.119 --> 01:08:02.000
liberally minded president jack kennedy

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.240
had liberal politics but he was also

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.640
about being the first catholic you know

dad bought him the election just bought

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:15.039
it with a suitcase of money

01:08:15.039 --> 01:08:17.199
and he was a powerful

01:08:17.199 --> 01:08:20.000
[ __ ] guy from a from a from a legacy

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.040
of of of uh smugglers

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.960
and um

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.319
but

01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:28.480
jimmy carter was a farmer

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.960
a peanut farmer

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:33.359
from georgia who rose to be governor of

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:35.279
georgia because he was a conscientious

01:08:35.279 --> 01:08:37.040
guy and he got involved in local

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.120
politics and he made his way up he was

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:41.199
like a he was like john adams he was

01:08:41.199 --> 01:08:42.560
just a guy who

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.880
who saw problems saw ways to solve them

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.880
and he was really about helping people

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:50.080
he was really about uh um

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.640
that was his heart i'm saying right and

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:55.520
uh and his brother billy so the saddest

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:57.279
thing in the world is billy carter

01:08:57.279 --> 01:09:00.159
because billy was a joke in america when

01:09:00.159 --> 01:09:02.319
i was a kid he was a just a fun billy

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:04.159
beer was a they had a brand of beer

01:09:04.159 --> 01:09:05.279
named after him

01:09:05.279 --> 01:09:07.679
and he died alcohol poisoning jesus he

01:09:07.679 --> 01:09:10.480
was just a known drunk beer yes he was

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.199
just a known drunk idiot that everybody

01:09:13.199 --> 01:09:15.440
made fun of and i saw one interview with

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.679
jimmy where he talked about billy he was

01:09:17.679 --> 01:09:19.120
very bitter about it

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:21.920
he said billy was a very wise

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:25.440
um smart and gentle soul who never drank

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:28.400
his whole life he just wasn't a drinker

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.480
and when i became president it killed

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:31.199
him

01:09:31.199 --> 01:09:32.880
because people went down they got

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:34.239
interested in who's the president yeah

01:09:34.239 --> 01:09:35.440
he started interviewing him and she

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.520
started interviewing him and he was why

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.359
he had these little country wisdom and

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:41.759
people liked it so they started printing

01:09:41.759 --> 01:09:43.920
his things but then yeah and then he

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.000
started going on he started going on

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.679
speaking tours

01:09:47.679 --> 01:09:48.880
and it gets starts getting used by

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.880
people i could use billy carter and he's

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.120
doing speeches and he's on the road and

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.880
he starts drinking because that's the

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:56.400
lifestyle and it actually helps you get

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.640
through it and he became an alcoholic

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.159
and he says i mean

01:10:00.159 --> 01:10:01.600

footage of jimmy carter at a rally and

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:53.199
he gives a speech and then he goes off

01:11:53.199 --> 01:11:54.480
and then someone gets to him because he

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.880

01:11:58.719 --> 01:12:01.040
for gay rights which was big back then

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.000
yeah

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.199
so he's president i mean they were like

01:12:05.199 --> 01:12:07.920
hillary was voting against it in 2013

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:10.239
that's right obama till [ __ ]

01:12:10.239 --> 01:12:13.040
last second 13 yes or a it was either

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.880
obama was like i don't think two

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:15.840
men and then they passed the thing he

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.760
was like oh no i didn't maybe

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:19.840

want those fruits getting married yeah

01:12:21.679 --> 01:12:24.080
so jimmy carter way ahead of the game

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.239
a great thing about jimmy carter is that

01:12:26.239 --> 01:12:29.120
he i'd always heard this

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.480
that there's two weird things about him

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.960
one is that he caught a [ __ ] foul a

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:35.040
fly ball at a game which is really rare

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.840
yeah you're the a president it was at

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:40.239
the time he was a former president the

01:12:40.239 --> 01:12:41.840
odds of a former president catching a

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.520
[ __ ] it's insane yeah there's

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:44.719
something weird about jimmy carter

01:12:44.719 --> 01:12:47.360
because also i always heard this thing

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.840
that he saw

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:51.600
ufo and

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:52.400
that

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.159
he'll tell you if you ask him but he

01:12:54.159 --> 01:12:55.600
doesn't like talk about it but he will

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.040
tell you

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:57.840
and

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:00.400
so there's this movie out now called

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.159
phenomenon not the j not the john

01:13:02.159 --> 01:13:03.440
travolta thing

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:06.400
it's a documentary about ufos and i

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.480
don't know how real it is yeah it's just

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.480
it's all kinds of stories it comes

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:12.800
across really real

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.000
so did

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.280
close encounters i mean i don't know you

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:17.600
know you cinema can create a lot of

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.920
illusions so i don't know but it was

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:22.080
compelling but the most compelling thing

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:24.000
because it's you talk to a guy he said

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.440
what he said right yeah so in the extras

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.280
not in the movie but if you watch the

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.960
extras i don't know why this isn't in

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:33.600
the movie but there's some kid in a

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:36.480
wheelchair like you know blowing on it

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.880
one of those guys like this and you have

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.040
to list wait while he goes

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:43.520
mr president

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:44.840
can i ask you a question one of those

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:47.280
guys went to a book signing of jimmy

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:49.040
carter and you see jimmy this is footage

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.719
jimmy's signing books and then they

01:13:50.719 --> 01:13:52.880
bring over a wheelchair guy and he says

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:54.880
can i ask you a question and he wasn't

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.480
taking questions but he's like sure

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:57.840
because he's a wheelchair which means

01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.920
he's a saint only only really great

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.920
people are in wheelchairs there's no

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:05.520
[ __ ] in wheelchairs it doesn't exist

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.679
so he asks jimmy carter is it true that

01:14:07.679 --> 01:14:09.199
you

01:14:09.199 --> 01:14:10.640
saw a ufo

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:12.640
and jimmy carter goes

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.280
yes

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.080
and

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.320
he asks him what was it like and he said

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.920
it was

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.440
it's exactly how they're described yeah

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:24.239
it's like it was a strange pill-shaped

01:14:24.239 --> 01:14:25.120
thing

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:26.960
it was floating

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:29.360
not making any sound and then it just

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:32.159
vanished it just took off

01:14:32.159 --> 01:14:33.199
and

01:14:33.199 --> 01:14:35.360
he said did you tell

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.280
when you became president did you tell

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:38.239
them

01:14:38.239 --> 01:14:40.080
the state department he said yeah and

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:41.120
they said

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.679
just don't worry about it

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:45.760
don't even worry about it dude yes

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:48.320
jimmy carter also put on a sweater and

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.080
he made a speech where he said yes we

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.679
have an oil crisis but please just wear

01:14:51.679 --> 01:14:53.360
a sweater turn the heat down

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:54.480
he's like we got it we got to change the

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:56.080
way we live people don't like to be told

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.440
that in america no he's like we got to

01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:59.440
change the way we live there's less oil

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:01.040
and we're having to blow up countries in

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:02.640
the middle east because of the oil it's

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.719
a problem it's just it's it's the first

01:15:04.719 --> 01:15:06.239
energy crisis and there was gas lines

01:15:06.239 --> 01:15:07.280
around the block there were people

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:10.000
couldn't get a [ __ ] tank of gas it's

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.040
not american

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.600
americans it's not america's fault i

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.840
mean that's a tale as old as time when a

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:17.600
world leaders like even they're doing it

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.600
now with the inflation they're like yeah

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:22.239
yeah just uh don't eat as much

01:15:22.239 --> 01:15:24.320
it's like you guys are eating girls i

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:25.600
agree with that that's the part that's

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:28.239
the hard part it's like you [ __ ]

01:15:28.239 --> 01:15:30.560
just crank the handle it's like let them

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.480
eat cake it's the same thing people

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.239
aren't gonna start moving slower you're

01:15:34.239 --> 01:15:36.719
not gonna take the human race and say

01:15:36.719 --> 01:15:39.520
everybody just yeah especially all of us

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:41.520
you have to do it if this is in china

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.199
yeah india i know you're trying to like

01:15:43.199 --> 01:15:45.280
get out of like poverty i know you're

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:46.719
trying to like turn on air conditioning

01:15:46.719 --> 01:15:48.159
so you don't get malaria every five

01:15:48.159 --> 01:15:50.640
minutes but just a little yeah let's put

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.480
a little

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:54.560
so it's not it's just inevitable i think

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:56.640
the problem is that you got you got your

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.560
nerds this is american history nerds and

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:00.159
cowboys

01:16:00.159 --> 01:16:02.800
nerds figure [ __ ] out cowboys make [ __ ]

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:03.760
happen

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:06.719
but there's a divide now climate denial

01:16:06.719 --> 01:16:08.320
goes two ways

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:09.840
the cowboys are pretending that shit's

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.840
not changing and of course it's changing

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.600
and the nerds are pretending that folks

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.760
can just that it's that it's a morality

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.920
it's like we can just ah

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:19.679
just quiet down turn the lights off it's

01:16:19.679 --> 01:16:21.280
just not going to happen yeah if they

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:23.040
all came to the table and said yes this

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.440
is happening but we're not going to slow

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:27.199
down then the cowboys would fix the

01:16:27.199 --> 01:16:28.880
[ __ ] they put there'd be a big vacuum

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:29.760
cleaner

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:31.280
going yeah people talking about

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:33.440
terraforming mars

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.679
do that here i have i'm talking straight

01:16:35.679 --> 01:16:37.360
out of my ass no but i have no idea what

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:39.840
i'm talking about here uh i have no idea

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:42.480
my buddy steve gerber uninformed opinion

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:44.000
gerbies always talks about it where he's

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.199
like

01:16:45.199 --> 01:16:46.560
i mean it's not his opinion he's just

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.320
the first guy that brought to me is like

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:50.400
we need to burn the resources we have

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:53.679
now to figure out how to [ __ ] stop it

01:16:53.679 --> 01:16:56.640
like we have we can't turn it down now

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.480
right it's too late we need to work well

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.239
like i read a great interview with the

01:17:00.239 --> 01:17:01.440
guy in the wall

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:03.840
that up for derby's my best no the guy

01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:05.120
and this guy in the wall street journal

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.199
he's a um he's a

01:17:07.199 --> 01:17:10.320
pennsylvania guy who uh is a big natural

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:11.679
gas guy him and his brothers started

01:17:11.679 --> 01:17:13.280
buying natural gas and they're like the

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.920
biggest guys and he's a big proponent

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:17.920
for it as an environmentalist he says

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:19.760
way cleaner and it's it's the road to

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.760
these next things he says you can't

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:23.360
every time that you

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:26.080
regulate against natural gas you make

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.760
people burn coal

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.280
the other thing is do you know what the

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.280
number the last time i looked the number

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:34.000
four polluting industry in the whole

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.400
world number four

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.000
bitcoin

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.239
no bitcoins big farming isn't farming

01:17:40.239 --> 01:17:43.679
number one no number number four

01:17:43.679 --> 01:17:47.199
is uh the energy the [ __ ]

01:17:47.199 --> 01:17:50.159
um carbon from creating

01:17:50.159 --> 01:17:53.040
solar panels oh no because the chinese

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:54.159
do it

01:17:54.159 --> 01:17:55.920
very cheaply here to make a solar panel

01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.280
like the wafer

01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:59.520
it takes a huge amount of energy and

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:01.440
because of the regulations here we make

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.840
them very slowly and carefully make sure

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:06.080
everybody's okay and it takes a long

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.360
time and it's very expensive but the

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.920
chinese just use coal and pour it and

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.760
make these things they're super cheap

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:13.679
and then we buy them and we're buying so

01:18:13.679 --> 01:18:15.360
many of them because of the because of

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:18.400
obama's policy that it's uh

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.440
through this

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:21.679
yeah it's killing the environment to

01:18:21.679 --> 01:18:23.840
make solar panels it's

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:26.320
you know look elon musk he makes

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:27.600
electric cars

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:30.159
so you know how cap and trade works

01:18:30.159 --> 01:18:32.560
so cap and trade means that if you're an

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:35.040
auto manufacturer you have light i'm

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.400
making up numbers well let's say you can

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:39.120
put out 75 million tons

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.880
of car you can make cars that will

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:44.239
create 75 million tons of carbon

01:18:44.239 --> 01:18:46.159
that's the cap okay

01:18:46.159 --> 01:18:48.960
now if you manage to make if you manage

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.440
to actually get under 75 and you only

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:53.199
put out 50 tons

01:18:53.199 --> 01:18:56.000
you can sell 25 tons

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.920
to another car manufacturer

01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:00.080
okay so a car manufacturer that's making

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:03.040
75 tons can actually make 100 because he

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:05.280
bought your that way you just know that

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:06.719
there's three manufacturers they're

01:19:06.719 --> 01:19:09.280
putting out 75 each and that's tolerable

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:10.880
and so the way to keep them on their

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:13.360
it's an incentive you only put on 25

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.040
tons congratulations you can sell that

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:17.600
to gm and they can put out so

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.199
elon musk's cars

01:19:19.199 --> 01:19:21.440
have none they put out zero tons and

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:23.920
they sell 100 of their

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:26.480
to the so they actually are

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.960
making other they're helping

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:30.960
more carbon go into the atmosphere and

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:32.239
that's how they turn a profit that's

01:19:32.239 --> 01:19:34.480
their biggest profit point i have no

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.000
idea what i'm talking about that's all

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.360
right i have no idea [ __ ] it

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:42.600
it's interesting
