that would be funny if you die if you

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.239
made a documentary about your friend in

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.239
a week like a podcast about them and you

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.239
didn't let them know you were doing it

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.160
like dude your whole lives on a tv show

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.359
right now

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.720
have you truman showed your friend from

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.479
a distance i think that would actually

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.880
be like a nice thing to do for somebody

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.159
record them against their will

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.400
what you're doing is you're trying to

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.640
turn a mirror back into their heart what

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.840
i'm saying especially if it's someone

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.119
you had like a recent falling out with

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.759
wait do you think that would like heal

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.439
would that heal the bond or would that

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.840
be like a a weapon against them

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.880
you could do sweet or savory

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.920
you could let them know you could put

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.159
both elements in there

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.759
you could you'd edit like real [ __ ] up

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.920
stuff in there i recently sent so i was

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.200
going to send somebody a text of just

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.200
sniper rifles

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.479
i was irked at them and i was just going

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.640
to just be like just communicate like my

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.240
feelings just send them a text of sniper

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.840
rifles yeah like just checking them

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.680
out checking them out

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.439
all these sniper rifles look cool right

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:58.640
now

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.680
actually you can't even kidding about it

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.439
it's like not that far off a possibility

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.560
statistically now what do you mean

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.719
getting one of us snipe out

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.880
dudes are sniping dudes are sniping out

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.040
yeah but i mean think about how

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.879
it was so unheard of like 50 years ago

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.440
for somebody in the town to snipe out

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.640
now like if you have a town

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.640
if you have a down dude of 6 000

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.160
statistically speaking

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160
0.5 are going to

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.000
think about it

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.480
could you imagine how sick it is dinging

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.200
someone from really far away

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.360
that's gotta be the best thing just

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.120
after petting some like unlegible

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.959
manifesto

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.040
now that that works complete

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.280
oh man let's see how i do it's like that

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.120
olympic race where like they have to ski

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.640
and then they have to [ __ ]

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.959
biathlon

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.200
that's like the james bond race is crazy

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.920
[Laughter]

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.159
i got a silver medal in the odd job

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.000
yeah last night

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.959
i mean

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.319
i'm not gonna say i'm sniping there's

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.400
like there's a period in every boy's

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.080
life where there's a couple of years

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.840
where you're like convinced like if i

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.080
went the sniper route i'd be gifted at

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.879
it

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.360
you have to believe that you'd be 86

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.360
as a part of growing up dude when you

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.959

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.600
you're like you're running this open mic

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.279

prove it right i was like no at first

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.760
because uh

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.760
my uncle had given up a child for

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.800
adoption and he didn't tell his kids yet

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.040
so i thought it was

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.560
i got the wrong guy

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.000
i thought it was like his daughter that

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.160
he gave up adoption when he was like 14.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.480
right family was at the time looking

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.160
looking to reconnect with that family i

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.399
was like a child up for adoption at 14.

00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:51.600
yeah dude

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.240
14. oh my god yeah yeah

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.200
uh

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.200
so what is even that like that's like

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.200
that's he was 14 years old and had a kid

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.279
and was like i can't we can't oh he was

00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:02.320
okay yeah

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.639
he was 14 yeah he was 14 when he had the

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:06.240
kids i thought for a second that the kid

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.079
was 14 and it was all right you got it

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:09.920
he's like i've had enough of that that's

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:10.800
better

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.160
so i don't want you to know who i am

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.839
wait so why did he didn't

00:13:13.839 --> 00:13:15.040
isn't that usually like the ladies

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.320
decision

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.480
what the adoption stuff

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.560
yeah oh know they were both uh they were

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.480
both only four teams i thought you were

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.000
saying like she was like you called the

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
ball yeah like let's go adoption on this

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.210
one

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:28.240
[Laughter]

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.480
so uh can you foster your own kid like

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.240
temporarily he's like yo just i'll be

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.639
back in five years

00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:36.160
can you like can you they used to do

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.760
that in the olden days like boarding

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.560
school okay yeah yeah

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.880
yeah just being like yo i will

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.480
definitely be back i would never let the

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.399
state raise my child do you i mean

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:47.760
obviously i want to dude it'd be nuts

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.519
it'd be a terrible terrible thing to do

00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:51.839
you're you're like talking in a veiled

00:13:51.839 --> 00:13:54.320
way about the black family dynamic

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.920
[Laughter]

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.240
i was fostered in so many houses really

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.600
yeah because that's how you get that's

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.680
how people get money it can't it's like

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.680
a little bit of a little bit of a racket

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.279
yeah well you're a golden goose yeah

00:14:05.279 --> 00:14:06.240
dude

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.240
yeah so but if you if you

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.519
you know because my mom like i lived

00:14:09.519 --> 00:14:11.120
with my grandma for a little while yeah

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.560
my dad for a little while it was like

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.680
back and forth

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.959

00:14:25.839 --> 00:14:27.360
time i went to a new house they would

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.120
talk all the time about

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.279

00:14:31.279 --> 00:14:32.000

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.920

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.000
finished basement they were also

remodeling the kitchen at the time so

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.400
all like the old and new appliances were

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.400
down there while they were gutting it so

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.600
he got him so he got him he was like

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.960
sleeping

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.039
on a clean spot on the couch you know

00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:42.080
making waffles yeah yeah

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.919

00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:45.440
of waffle making was made we did it he

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.919
did a two-week stint yeah just in the

00:19:47.919 --> 00:19:50.000
basement i think it was like partially

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.720
because they had to still like talk to

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.960
remodel the kitchen yeah so that made it

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.880
easier to start like

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.960
being people with each other yeah true

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.799
unless the kitchen turned out bad no

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:01.919
it's a pretty sick kitchen that's what

00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:04.159

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.520
thinking about i never had older sisters

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.799
so i started thinking of the sick and

00:23:32.799 --> 00:23:34.400
twisted dynamic i was like there's

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.880
nobody hornier than a little brother

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.840
teasing

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.559
his older sister for having a boyfriend

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.400
horniness he's like bringing his legs up

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.320
and like flopping his feet on the floor

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.520

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.600
to put out this this was what i had like

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.840
i had to change my brain again what we

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.279
were talking about earlier you let them

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:03.440

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.600
long like general hospital and [ __ ] i'd

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.039
be like this is the

00:28:09.039 --> 00:28:11.039
most [ __ ] thing

00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:14.159
currently being produced by human beings

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:16.000
crazy i'm like i'd be saying it and

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.600

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.320
like

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.120

laughing so hard every day and then

00:28:22.559 --> 00:28:24.080

00:28:53.919 --> 00:28:55.520
less duties because like technology was

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.880
getting better yeah they were like

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.279
getting bored in the household and then

[ __ ] up when it's like like if you're

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.359
like a hot actress and all of a sudden

00:38:05.359 --> 00:38:07.359
now you're playing like now you're julia

00:38:07.359 --> 00:38:09.200
roberts and stepmom that's got to be

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.560
tough you see the young starlets and

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.160
you're like nah i'm the cool stepmom

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.480
it's like it's gotta be a you know

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.000
there's like women a lot of times hate

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.440
younger women on like just a regular

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.720
level but like once you put like full

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.200
production squads behind them

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.480
when you're in the elite of

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.440
entertainment and now suddenly it's like

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.119
you have to remember when you were

00:38:27.119 --> 00:38:28.800
considered like the hottest [ __ ]

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.200
person in the world yeah

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.200
i you know now it's like i'm not so old

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.119
that it's too horrific to look at it i'm

00:38:35.119 --> 00:38:36.800
just you know getting by it was oh

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.480
exactly that's a shame or you see like

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.200
your

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.599

00:38:41.599 --> 00:38:43.119
a little bit oh yeah although i don't i

00:38:43.119 --> 00:38:44.800
feel like they're they'd be still like

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.040
jay roberts probably striking a hard

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.320
bargain

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.160
it's probably buku bucks

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.000
yeah roberts in the movie

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:52.880

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.000
most expensive person to get into a

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.560

headlines and every time it's not going

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.359

him

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.520
yeah pretty nuts i i was uh i was under

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.640
the impression that things were going

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.880
well based off of a tweet i saw from

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:39.119
candace owens what'd she say it was like

00:40:39.119 --> 00:40:41.040
uh because amber heard is the name of

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.280
the chick yeah yeah yeah it was like

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.119
when it when when it first came out i

00:40:45.119 --> 00:40:46.800

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.839
his line

00:40:47.839 --> 00:40:49.440
so i thought maybe proof that she's yeah

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.440
but that's canada's own she's never on

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.240
the winning side you know

points

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.079
she's absolutely right

00:41:00.079 --> 00:41:01.040

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.480

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.880

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.560

yeah we're yeah we're living here we're

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.000
gonna do it alive

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.440

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.880
dude okay i want to uh

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.640
i feel like it'd be corny to say bill

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.160
murray but he does kind of live his

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:19.440
[ __ ] life however he likes

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.640
fair enough

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.319
i don't know much about him he just

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:24.079
shows up at parties and [ __ ] and just

00:45:24.079 --> 00:45:26.480
plays we'll just like [ __ ] drink with

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.160
random people

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.520
yeah and i don't know i don't know why

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.640
i've always been kind of like a

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.640
distrustful bill murray's yeah no

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.720
there's still something weird about him

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.880
no he's probably fine i just he doesn't

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.880
impress me i'm not i'm not trying to be

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.319
negative i guess you have to be honest

00:45:40.319 --> 00:45:41.599
this is the sickest dude we're talking

00:45:41.599 --> 00:45:43.200
about yeah yeah yeah and there's a lot

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:44.240
of people for now i think that would

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.160
agree with you yeah yeah but i'm a tough

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.119
i'm going to need to sell on this so i'm

00:45:47.119 --> 00:45:48.240
going to have to do a deep dive and see

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.359
what dude

00:45:49.359 --> 00:45:51.200
yeah i think if i had to put a name

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.960
forward i would go with chris cole the

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.480
skateboarder

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:56.240
he is

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:59.359
i mean i'm racking my brain and uh like

00:45:59.359 --> 00:46:00.880
this is this might be the last man

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.720
standing sickest dude in my head

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.280
chris cole chris cole yeah i uh i got to

uh

00:46:15.599 --> 00:46:18.640
so he's like one of the gnarliest

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.480
pro skaters of all time

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.079

his [ __ ] setup is like the ultimate

00:46:28.319 --> 00:46:29.839
and then uh

00:46:29.839 --> 00:46:31.280

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.440
whole time like we were friends of uh

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:36.880
his wife like and we're visiting gotcha

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:39.359

00:46:39.359 --> 00:46:41.440
he at one point he's showing me like one

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.119
of the coolest guitars i've ever seen

00:46:43.119 --> 00:46:44.880
with like a full double stack in his

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.319
house he was like hey man check this out

00:46:46.319 --> 00:46:47.680
and he turns on the guitar and he just

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:51.040
starts shredding and i was like

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.880
so on top of the hospitality and being

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:54.079
like

00:46:54.079 --> 00:46:56.800
shredded an extreme dude who like has

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.560
paid for his entire life with gigantic

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.119
cardboard checks yeah yeah

00:47:01.119 --> 00:47:02.960
he's coming to his home he's like yeah

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.880
dude here's an incredible weekend by the

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.960
way

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.880
let me just shred real quick yeah that's

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.400
that's a tough one that's the kind of

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.079
[ __ ] that i think yeah yeah we might

00:47:12.079 --> 00:47:13.760
have to have start getting video quality

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.119
in here so we can start watching so i

00:47:15.119 --> 00:47:17.440
could i could curate clips yeah that's i

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.280
think that's the move well someone is

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.480
this will be out a couple weeks in the

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:21.520
future i think we're gonna have this

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:22.960
sorted out by the time anyone sees this

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.359
sure for sure yeah so yeah hopefully we

00:47:25.359 --> 00:47:28.240

00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:56.079
different courts like in different hoods

00:52:56.079 --> 00:52:58.160
and [ __ ] and just really yeah i never

00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.920
thought about that you know what i don't

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:01.760
like is how

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:04.000
i've been seeing too many like kind of

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.720
dorky white dudes killing it like going

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.800
into like neighborhood courts

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.400
and like stunting on like the local

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:13.040
black dudes like wow nerdy white guy can

uh like a white person on site looks

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.800
like they can't do something

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:30.000
you know like that's why i like the

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.599
product i think this might be a genetic

00:53:31.599 --> 00:53:32.640
thing

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:34.559
like this is the way your brain is wired

00:53:34.559 --> 00:53:35.680
you don't think you have the oh [ __ ]

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:36.559
gene

00:53:36.559 --> 00:53:42.040
i yeah there's absolutely no [ __ ]

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:46.160
no specifically for like white white

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:47.839
incompetent dudes who can like like a

00:53:47.839 --> 00:53:49.280
fat guy that can parkour you know what i

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:51.280
mean

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:53.200

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.960
right you say wait just i'm just while

00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.880
you have it straight you're saying if a

00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.480
you're not impressed if a fat guy is

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.640
nimbly parkours i'll watch it i'll be

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:02.000
like that's pretty tight but like you're

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.520
not gonna be like you're gonna act like

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:04.800
you didn't think he couldn't do that

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:07.520
yeah yeah yeah yeah but i mean

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.200
it does get the oh [ __ ] gene does go the

00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.599
same for black people too like a fat

00:54:11.599 --> 00:54:14.240
black dude like ripping it in parkour

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.640
yeah it's true that's like damn dude

00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:18.319
that well that is better because it is

00:54:18.319 --> 00:54:19.440

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:20.400
everything

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.319

one of fat parkour yeah you know what i

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.920
mean there would be more sizzle on it

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:27.520
than the white guy did it well i think

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:28.400

00:54:50.559 --> 00:54:52.880
widely frowned upon and a lot of times

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:54.480
they're mostly micro aggressions to be

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:56.720
like it's like monsters

00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.079

black people

and redneck white people oh yeah like

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.839
the struggle the love from machinery

00:55:25.839 --> 00:55:27.760
yeah dude dirt track demolition derby

00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:30.079

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.559
very tricked out machinery yeah there's

00:55:34.559 --> 00:55:36.400
that theory that's the thomas soul book

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:37.280
uh

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:38.480

white liberal that's the yeah yeah yeah

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:47.280
wait that was a theory that like

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:49.359
a lot of american black culture can be

00:55:49.359 --> 00:55:51.920
like linguistically traced back to like

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:53.040
the like

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:55.760
weird plains of like outside of britain

lot of like hanging out basically

00:56:04.799 --> 00:56:06.160
the whole point that he's making is that

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:07.920
like hood behavior

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.440
