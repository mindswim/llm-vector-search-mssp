to get together you know once like the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.320

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.040
apocalypse dies down I don't know bro

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.270

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.619
every time I think we're out of it it

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.240
pulls us back here there's a new thing

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.030
yeah what do you think will be next

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.560
after the real we're getting locust

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.390
locusts are coming really yeah we're

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.650
gonna have a locust this summer so

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.850
that's just you know that's not a big

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.200
deal they're just kind of a nuisance and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.000
they just have a lot of like biblical

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.549
twittering off to that yeah Oh locusts

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.020
Danks 2020

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.979
yeah here's my 20/20 in regard their

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.009
main review yeah it's like yeah man I

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.810
mean I I have a theory I'm working this

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.009
is just this is just an intuitive

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.229
feeling I think I think somehow someway

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.270
protest has been spun into the new thing

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.100
of social control I think they're

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.240
controlling citizenry through protests

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.719
how so

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.579
you just really you know you get you

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.990
hype something you get people out there

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.610
you got and you kick one off and then

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.590
it's like you can have on some level

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.910
have people out there who take it to the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.200
next level and everyone's just like oh

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.190
this one

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.460
doing yeah so it's like like the uh yeah

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.380
but then what what you get to impose

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.540
martial law or something yeah yes that's

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.650
what I don't know you know I don't know

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.850
what's but it's like I'm seeing people

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.680
protest I mean I'm seeing like

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.810
groupthink protests if that makes sense

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.300
yeah and also also like clearly the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.600
media is perpetuating it yeah

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.360
like clearly showing [ __ ] up [ __ ]

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.010
non-stop I see it a dude I've been CNN

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.750
might be the worst [ __ ] I've ever seen

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.360
like at least at least Fox is like

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.640
laughable on the surface like you turn

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.350

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.050

carlson sitting there do you think why

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.990

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.200
woman and you're stupid very funny

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.950

CNN anchors all think that they're

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.190

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.310

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.670
because you're around where people are

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.620
bombing it either you're with it or get

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.330
the [ __ ] out like don't come down there

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.370
to be a tourist don't get out there like

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.220
I'm part of something right now it's

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.450
like are you willing to are you gonna

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.100
flip a cop car when that starts the

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.230
exact better be ready or just be like

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.300
people are flipping cop cars it's time

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.160
for me to go home and I got pushed in

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.900
the a humongous trouble yeah I hear I

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.240
saw this it just sucks because it's like

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.770
again everything's been reduced down to

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.260
like well if you're not 100% blindly on

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.540
this side and you're immediately this

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.770
whole other thing and that's like

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.990
alright so the nuance of national

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.460
matters are now divided into two

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.770
categories by nary categories and you

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.750
can't step outside any of them you have

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.120
to just go with one and be like I bet

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.290
that guy was like well and it's it's

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.330
like they're saying so like we were just

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.890
talking about both sides are claiming

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.520
it's white people starting this and

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.440
they're not on our side but every

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.720
protest has said whoever's done it

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.460
they've been like no it's an tyfa or its

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.680
neo-nazi yeah personally I think it's

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.280
auntie [ __ ]

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.540
mm-hmm I think it's pretty clear that

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.280
that's them and I think they're making

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.080
it very clear that hey we're the ones

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.210
doing this what you know that's what a

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.550
proc provocateur might say true anyway

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.260
what it would is annoying about it's

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.480
like and then I'll see a video of just

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.960
white people getting rocked dude just

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.970
like I visit a lady standing in front of

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.500
our business getting no [ __ ] beat oh I

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.030
thought you meant like a protester no

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.860
like I'm talking about like black dudes

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.180
beating the [ __ ] out of white people and

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.320
then it's like I'm supposed to be like

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.020
I'm with that you know that's like I

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.290
don't take the bad parts with this [ __ ]

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:26.940
it I'm you know enough people are saying

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.550
enough [ __ ] I'm just I'm not yeah yeah

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.350
being I don't need to jump in and be

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.200
like time donate to this bond company

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.000
yes like who might be who am I paying to

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.370
bail out [ __ ] anti-fog kids no [ __ ]

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.349
yeah [ __ ] them I'm not paying for them

00:08:40.349 --> 00:08:42.780
yeah I mean it's it's also it's one of

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:43.740
those things where it's like alright

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:44.880
that's cool but if you were like why

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.950
aren't you doing this it's like I don't

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.720
know I don't want to I want to see well

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.040
I also want to see what the [ __ ] going

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.240
on yeah I'd like to find out what

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.430
happens so I was trying to the because I

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:54.050
looked into the

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.040
that was the one it's like the bail

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.959
project I was looking into that to see

00:08:56.959 --> 00:08:58.430
you apparently it's like so bales

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.410
revolving so the money comes out and it

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.060
goes back into the fund so we can like

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.950
it uses the money to bail people out

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.170
again yeah you're saying like who's in

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.670
charge of who's getting bailed out what

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.260
are these people do it does it not bail

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.519
out rapists you know I'm saying like

00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:12.230
yeah I think it'd be a great idea you

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:13.519
know get people bail people out it's

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:15.290
unfair sailors have [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:16.640
says what it is it's one of those things

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.380
where you're sending money to the idea

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.690
of bail and it's like what's this what's

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.130
the pay structure like you can't find

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.279
information on nonprofits about how

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:27.050
their financial other finances work

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.149
unless you have you pay like you can get

00:09:29.149 --> 00:09:31.220
software you can pay like a hundreds of

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.930
dollars a month if you're a funder it's

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.339
all crystal clear you can see like how

00:09:34.339 --> 00:09:35.600
much is this guy getting paid how much

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.100
are they bringing in how much is ever

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.360
getting paid how much of its actually

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.350
going to the thing is supposed to go to

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:41.000
do you go

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.140
you can't [ __ ] for I tried looking

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.610
yesterday you can you can look through

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.620
the Philadelphia library but it's like

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:46.760
this shit's like shouldn't be that

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.800
mystified how like I should look up a

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.269
non-profit and they ban theirs they're

00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:53.390
fine yeah bail bondsman in Minnesota

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.490
must be like [ __ ] yeah all these people

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.050
that were never gonna pay bail I'm rich

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.720
as [ __ ] oh there's collecting 10% of

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.779
this bail bondsman aren't they like kind

00:10:02.779 --> 00:10:04.640
of like loan sharks kinda yeah so

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.240
they're getting skipped out of this end

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.440
yeah I guess if it pays the full loan

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.700
but it wouldn't pay the full loan oh

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.980
it's definitely like here's what you

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.720
would have to pay the bail bondsman to

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.839
post your bail and you know oh really I

00:10:17.839 --> 00:10:19.010
thought you just go down there with a

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.079
percentage of it I would imagine you

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:24.110
yeah you pay the bail bondsman like 10

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:25.670
percent and then he covers the heat

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.520
fronts the rest for you I thought it was

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.810
you just pay the state ten percent I

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.430
thought when you get in bail maybe I'm

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.630
yeah you just come up with like if it's

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:33.950
like fifty thousand dollars you come up

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.360
with like five minutes yeah then you

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.709
give the state five grand and they hold

00:10:36.709 --> 00:10:39.199
that five grand so like your bail those

00:10:39.199 --> 00:10:40.730
like bail was set at a million dollars

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.470
oh yeah it's probably all the sirens or

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.300
it's kicking off your bail set at a

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.470
million dollars you gotta come up with a

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.270
hundred G's bail said it like five

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:48.380
thousand you gotta come up five hundred

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.610
bucks so these there's dudes in there

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.829
who are hung up on like they'll get hung

00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:54.079
up on like 80 bucks the other bail set

00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:56.829
at five thousand they're just jammed on

00:10:56.829 --> 00:10:58.940
504 a year because they can't nobody

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.740
they know can come over 500 bucks to

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.750
bail them out so that's where it's like

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:05.149
yeah that's [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah like I

00:11:05.149 --> 00:11:06.350
have you got a and then you got

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.360
go to trial in a jumpsuit yeah which is

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.510
it's a bad look you need a nice suit oh

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.250
yeah you're coming out yeah yeah you're

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.200
going into your trial from jail like a

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.490
haunted you like it's like a haunted

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:21.170
attraction yeah man I mean again it's

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:22.490
just none of this stuff's gonna hell

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:23.900
it's not gonna help anything of people

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.550
just being like again watching getting

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.590
programmed by the news whichever flavor

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.990
of it they like and then being like no

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.490
this is reality

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:35.150
it's like it's fine yeah but either way

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.640
that uh I'm right now though it's like

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.440
the fact that everything's in such

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.010
disarray

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.320
I feel like oddly calm because I'm like

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.670
well this is kind of my internal state

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.490
24/7 so I'm like this is how I it's like

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.770
how I feels Ben externalized it was like

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.590
I know everybody's life sucks yeah all

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.150
right well this is yeah this is this is

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:54.920
how I view the world is like what I

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.180
think is happening when I'm not looking

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.280
so I'm just kind of like yeah okay I

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.160
knew I was right about that yeah it's

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.290

surveillance state we're going full

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.960

gonna take a while yeah yeah it's just

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.040
the whole thing is just so [ __ ] corny

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.270
and then it's like you get on social

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:47.570

you think one of them has probably got

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.850
to be like that's weird we all always

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.830
agree politically we're a political

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.770
party yeah exact AMA D become a

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.830
political party exactly it's we're all

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:07.950
morons but know that it's it's now up to

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:09.660
you as a fledgling or even if you're an

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.720
established comedian you're like I got

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.120
it I gotta make my work put my word out

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.340
there and it's like imagine if dude

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:18.930
imagine like 10 years ago the [ __ ]

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.210
mailman was like I've been silent too

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:22.980
long I don't know if you like I did

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.870
[ __ ] I was getting DMS from people

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:25.980
that were like you're not using your

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.870
platform to speak up and it's like did

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.820
you shut the [ __ ] up well that's the I

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.830
shut up that's the problem there's like

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.210
there's so there's people who see this

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.350
and they they feel it in their hearts

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:35.460
and they're like I have to express

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.250
myself and then there's people who see

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:39.750
other people doing that and like oh [ __ ]

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.820
I better say you have to oh [ __ ] I

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.380
better say something now so then you get

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.390
like it's not activism it's like this

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:46.500
weird peer pressure

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.760
dude that was peer pressure there's a

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.310
peer there was so I was talking doing

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:51.630
the church of dogology it's highly

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:53.250
secretive highly exclusive your very

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:54.780
secretive we were doing it's just a live

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:55.830
stream that this doesn't get recorded

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:57.720
there's no we're good but some guy was

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.880
some guy was saying that his daughters

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.460
in grade school and they're being

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.100
bullied so they're they like they moved

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.900
from like a liberal area to like Trump

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.730
land and they were getting she's like

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.170
dude Mike like don't get bullied for

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:11.940
like not being not loving Trump and it's

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.500
the reverse will probably happen I'm

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.730
sure well if you're like can't even

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.620
imagine if you if you had a kid that was

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.690
like if you were a Republican and moved

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:23.280
to New York Jesus Christ yeah these

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.430
people like [ __ ] it's it's crazy I was

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.350
just up there for the majendie in eighth

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:29.790
grade and they're just like you probably

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:31.030
like [ __ ] a

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.220
like whoever they're like bitching about

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.690
like you like Elizabeth Warren with it's

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.180
like dude I was saying I still don't

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.670
know how the Senate works I'm 34 yeah my

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.250
life's going just fine yeah you don't

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.140
need it the fact that egg eighth graders

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.250
are bullying each other on like

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.110
political stances it obviously is being

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.340
their parents are joining this [ __ ] in

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.830
their head so it's like dude imagine

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:52.780
your mom coming home every day whacked

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.490
out about the news that's final [ __ ]

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.140
your kid up dude yeah every day and then

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.430
coming home being like you're gay aren't

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.850
you

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:00.370
it's like their kid dick you sure you're

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:01.450
not gay you sure you don't want to

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:02.980
experiment you're allowed to experience

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.240
you don't you wear any shoes in this

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.500
house that you want you don't have to

I mean if you combine it all this is my

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.620
problem maybe again I'm either a psycho

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.540
or I'm right I can't tell but it's like

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.730
you combined the pressure of the ability

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.650
to go viral the social pressure to

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.570
conform to like you know whatever things

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:23.590
are being pushed out especially if

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:24.910
you're an agenda as person which there's

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:26.470
nobody more agendized than [ __ ]

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.630
people people in comedy or entertainment

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:30.520
I sort of got yeah I've hung out with

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.680
almost every spectrum of life and I've

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.440
never met anyone more like you 24/7 to

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.180
spin their gears like how can I make

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.950
this happen to have it pretty much

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:40.060
everyone else is going to work and

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.440
coming home and like drinking a beer me

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.300
like finally that [ __ ] works over

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.770
yeah I can go sit I can sit in the

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.110
above-ground pool chill drink a Coors

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.360
Light but there you're like a fledge

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.410

us sounds good bro I'm telling ya that

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:53.800

the most likes ever got you

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.080
automatically adjusted your behavior

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.430
you're getting a dopamine fix because

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.290

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:07.150
change yeah you have that in Mass you

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.709
have this weird behavioral modification

00:17:08.709 --> 00:17:10.360
based on like very real addictive

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.880
platforms and it's it's presenting

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.170
itself physically into the world now

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:15.939
with like one-upsmanship of being filmed

00:17:15.939 --> 00:17:17.620
knowing you're being filmed then you

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:18.939
couple that with the self righteousness

00:17:18.939 --> 00:17:21.910
of like I'm changing the world it's like

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.819
I mean yeah that it's something's

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:26.589
getting changed for sure but it's like I

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:29.020
don't know man I just don't know how

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.580
much I buy into the authenticity of

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.510
let's just say 40% of participants

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:36.040

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.830
yeah it's just like don't get me wrong

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.440
obviously you know now you got to be

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.910
[ __ ] careful with words and [ __ ]

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:43.539

terms of like what they decide to do and

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.350
how they feel based off events that they

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.090
weren't there to witness and are getting

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:23.070
an information stream that's highly

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:24.750
suited to making them feel validated

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.030
with ever weird prejudice they have so

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.350
it's like again the lady and the dog you

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.030
were talking about last week yeah said

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.430
the kid was apparently like went real

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.620
deep into that he was saying that what

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.030
happened was the and this was from the

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:38.070
guy's personal Facebook he was like hey

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.330
like you said you gotta get your dog out

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.940
of this park or whatever because you

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.950
know the dog can't be about qpo parties

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:46.140
the lady was like well my dog has been

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.580
cooped up and there's nowhere else for

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.320
me to go so I'm have to do it here I'm

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.940
sorry and he was like there's a place

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.140
right over there you can do it she was

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.360
like well I'm not gonna do it and he's

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.380
like well alright you can do what you

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.460
want but you're not gonna like what I'm

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.550
about to do yeah then according to his

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.900
Facebook post he pulled in he was

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.970
pulling out dog treats yeah so I'm like

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:04.620
maybe he was like not he didn't realize

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.770
how ominous it sounded but he was doing

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.720
I'm gonna do come here what's your dog

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.880

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.590

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:15.030
Lee maybe one point get sexually

being like you don't like what I'm gonna

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.140
do but I think the other part is if he

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.610
had said that with a smile and she

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:25.080
misread it and he was like pulling out

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.310
treats and she was like I'll call the

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:28.650
[ __ ] cops he was like what the [ __ ]

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:30.420

on neither person said but you have

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.840
people who again it I can't get over the

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.450
fact that people pay money to have read

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:38.250
the reality stewarded to them and it

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.600

seconds to process national events and

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.120

almost always staffed by gay black dudes

00:25:22.569 --> 00:25:24.789
yeah you something I noticed a long time

00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:27.219
ago you'd think they'd be akin to get in

00:25:27.219 --> 00:25:28.779
there [ __ ] [ __ ] up no but I'm saying

00:25:28.779 --> 00:25:29.949
they went in there and they just held

00:25:29.949 --> 00:25:31.179
they like gave they probably held the

00:25:31.179 --> 00:25:32.709
spoons up and like crossed the [ __ ]

00:25:32.709 --> 00:25:34.419
box Palin saying like dude we're [ __ ]

00:25:34.419 --> 00:25:36.009
part of the movement they're just like

00:25:36.009 --> 00:25:38.039
oh [ __ ] bullet Joe alright let me uh

00:25:38.039 --> 00:25:42.059
I'll have beans I guess and box a dollar

00:25:42.059 --> 00:25:44.829
that's [ __ ] up dude you're right it's

00:25:44.829 --> 00:25:49.239
not it's not a dollar yeah you're right

00:25:49.239 --> 00:25:51.969
yeah man I and there's also a part

00:25:51.969 --> 00:25:53.679
there's also a part I understand the

00:25:53.679 --> 00:25:56.039
argument I kind of if you're gonna be

00:25:56.039 --> 00:25:58.749
insight change through this you gotta

00:25:58.749 --> 00:26:01.329
take money so it is good kind of to do

00:26:01.329 --> 00:26:03.039
property damage for sure the only people

00:26:03.039 --> 00:26:04.329
the people at the top are only gonna

00:26:04.329 --> 00:26:06.699
care about money yes but you know maybe

00:26:06.699 --> 00:26:08.199
destroy some federal buildings I'm not

00:26:08.199 --> 00:26:10.629
calling for that on the box sure but if

00:26:10.629 --> 00:26:12.429
you could do it do it right [ __ ] yeah

00:26:12.429 --> 00:26:13.389
I mean that was that's what I was

00:26:13.389 --> 00:26:16.149
thinking is ahead with the money yeah it

00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:17.529
is what it works yeah when they're like

00:26:17.529 --> 00:26:19.089
this isn't what works they're like this

00:26:19.089 --> 00:26:20.229
isn't the answer I'm like no that's a

00:26:20.229 --> 00:26:21.699
problem this is actually the person

00:26:21.699 --> 00:26:22.839
actually the answer you have to

00:26:22.839 --> 00:26:24.099
certainly blowing [ __ ] up like we don't

00:26:24.099 --> 00:26:25.629
go [ __ ] around in other countries until

00:26:25.629 --> 00:26:27.190
people start blowing [ __ ] up and then

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:28.719
we're like alright what are these

00:26:28.719 --> 00:26:30.459
[ __ ] guys want if we do it let's just

00:26:30.459 --> 00:26:31.870
see let's let them come to the chain

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:34.029
to them alright fine there's this like a

00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:35.529
big insurance company or they just like

00:26:35.529 --> 00:26:36.400
now you want to control and dominate

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.840
everything and then you blow [ __ ] up and

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.789
they're like can we kill them and it's

00:26:39.789 --> 00:26:42.760
like a happy no no like I will give it I

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:46.750
[ __ ] it as long as we keep power I stay

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:49.779
in office yes yeah I [ __ ] find can we

00:26:49.779 --> 00:26:50.770
use them all right perfect

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:52.090
yeah I mean that's what they do they

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:53.260
find people blowing [ __ ] up in other

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.840
countries and they're like here here's

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.220
weapons we don't like yeah we actually

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:58.570
don't like your president so here you go

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:01.600
yeah but it's literally it's why they

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.659
reign supreme why America right because

00:27:04.659 --> 00:27:06.610
we have a military who if it comes to it

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:09.549
we can blow everything up and break

00:27:09.549 --> 00:27:11.559
stuff and people are like breaking stuff

00:27:11.559 --> 00:27:13.179
now and it's like this isn't what it's

00:27:13.179 --> 00:27:15.010
like dude if everyone went and stood

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:16.270
there people have been going and

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.279
standing there and being like it's

00:27:18.279 --> 00:27:19.390
enough of this and they go back and

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:21.460
sweet that's over back to normal but as

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.370
soon as you start breaking [ __ ] like

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:25.090
this will work

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:27.279
so yeah exactly this is gonna change

00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:28.929
things it work I believe this will

00:27:28.929 --> 00:27:30.940
definitely make a difference no it's not

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.890
gonna change entirely obviously but

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:34.179
let's launch us into a surveillance

00:27:34.179 --> 00:27:37.740
state go you know go burn down some I

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.480
mean it is lamed break break they uh

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.250
they broke into the pharmacy not too far

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:45.429
from me like the drugs getting stolen

00:27:45.429 --> 00:27:46.870
yeah but you know those were highly

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:48.850
priced although you know maybe some sick

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:50.380
people had their prescription down there

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:51.700
and needed it yeah man I mean there's

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:53.409
when you're on your way get into the

00:27:53.409 --> 00:27:55.240
perks dude it's like obviously some

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.500
blood pressure medications getting

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.720
crushed up and thrown out yeah I mean

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.640
dude it's just you know look this is a

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.350
[ __ ] nobody wants to think about this is

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:05.169
a [ __ ] where it's like hey you're you

00:28:05.169 --> 00:28:06.370
know you're not as safe as you think

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:08.169
you're like well what about people who

00:28:08.169 --> 00:28:11.340
are need medication like they might die

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.080
that's what happens when we fall into

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.029
utter chaos people who are like hanging

00:28:16.029 --> 00:28:18.250
on by a limb of like this weird system

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:19.450
keeping people with like tons of

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:21.549
diseases afloat it's again when the [ __ ]

00:28:21.549 --> 00:28:23.080
gets cut off they definitely die so yeah

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.460
yeah they're in trouble yeah they're

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.750
[ __ ] what about this person it's like

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.000
they'll probably perish bro what

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.679
happened to during the Ice Age if they

00:28:29.679 --> 00:28:31.570
froze and died floods came people died

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:32.980
it's like this is this is what happens

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.020
dude you're you know you're an animal

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:37.419
walking around on earth [ __ ] happens

00:28:37.419 --> 00:28:40.210
sometimes people die yeah a lot of times

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:42.580
my my friend who was down there also was

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:45.700

sala video rolled it towards the police

00:28:53.019 --> 00:28:54.669
I thought the cop I thought the cop was

00:28:54.669 --> 00:28:56.980

protesters that are clearly not doing

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:15.820
anything but you're also surrounding a

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.799
man yeah so these cops are like

00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:19.450
surrounded by people screaming at them

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:21.340

like um if I'm I I've done I've seen

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:35.950
[ __ ] like that before and like when the

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:37.690
obviously when the Phillies won it was

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:39.370
like it's fun I was down there like

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.200
things were like it was crazy there was

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.269
no rules going on people was in a deli

00:29:43.269 --> 00:29:45.010
just drinking beers basically looting a

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:46.840
deli but like as they sit was kind of

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:47.889
orderly like everyone waiting in the

00:29:47.889 --> 00:29:49.029
line to buy something would drink like

00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:50.200
you know four extra beers while they

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.669
waited yeah that was like polite it was

00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:53.049
polite looting there's some of those

00:29:53.049 --> 00:29:54.970
horrible compare that there's

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:56.470
comparisons they're really [ __ ] annoy

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.600
me because right now the left can't be

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.250
wrong on like Twitter yeah like no

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:01.630
matter what they say it's just like oh

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:03.490
yeah for sure like this is exactly like

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:05.830
the Boston Tea Party this is very

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:08.289
similar yeah it's like yeah yeah this is

00:30:08.289 --> 00:30:10.149
exactly like it's like how come when

00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:12.970
white folks riot like they did after

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:15.100
every Super Bowl nobody cares

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.480
like well the did they burn down

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.860
residential buildings immediately yeah

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.570
it's like cause if they did then yeah

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:25.450
that was probably a problem yeah and

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:29.590
it's like yeah you can't be like well

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:31.659
you know you you're putting that out and

00:30:31.659 --> 00:30:33.880
it's [ __ ] right you can't just be

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.559
like excuse me that's [ __ ] what you

00:30:35.559 --> 00:30:37.000
just said I mean it's also not nobody

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.500
cares they're like oh they they [ __ ]

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:39.850
up the city so you know there's

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:41.320
something personal and it's also not

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.210
tied to it it's like it's tied to like

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:44.620
the Phillies won everyone's drunk

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.090
freaking out it's agreed that it's

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:48.309
[ __ ] to go out and break up the [ __ ]

00:30:48.309 --> 00:30:50.440
after a sports team wins but then it

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.820
just it just immediately stops and goes

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.559
away this is something you know it's tie

00:30:53.559 --> 00:30:54.730

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:58.210
[ __ ] cool yeah but that's Emma it's

00:32:58.210 --> 00:32:59.950
the same thing I'm it's humans if you

00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:01.659
have a gun and you're all of a sudden

00:33:01.659 --> 00:33:03.159
you're getting hit with rocks and shed

00:33:03.159 --> 00:33:04.389
people surround it like you think you're

00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:06.220
gonna get torn apart yeah there could be

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:08.320
there could be moments of that happening

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.389
where like yeah it might open some fire

00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:12.129

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:35.650
they're saying like well the guy

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:37.180
according to autopsies like the guy

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:38.490
didn't die from death by asphyxiation

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.750
they're working on their work you know

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:43.120
they got the best day off to get the

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.680
best lawyers on there so it's like yeah

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.850

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:47.290
first saw the video I saw a video of the

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:48.610
guy getting yanked out of a car so I'm

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:50.170
like you have it you're sitting there

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:51.970
you have to physically budge people as a

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:54.070
live for a living which is I don't ever

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:55.300
trying to move somebody in so will you

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.710

you want to move it [ __ ] makes you

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:04.420

nuance of like physically interacting

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.800

today so they dove I've seen this they

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.130
go like extra

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:28.660
where you can just kind of roll up like

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.760

like shut up corny ass [ __ ] god damn it

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:39.910
I'm going viral if I was a I would just

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:41.860

[ __ ] you dude it's a yeah what up dudes

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:47.290
yes yeah but that's the thing but then

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:49.720
you have a boss he was like no no like

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.280
you got to physically get those people

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.860
to move and they say no your only other

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:56.110
options like Kent the [ __ ] hockey

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:57.430
stick check and the come on get out of

00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:59.920
here and then again keep your cool the

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.610
whole entire time

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:03.340
it's like again it's not putting the guy

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.170
was a [ __ ] it's also funny to think

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:07.960
about like the guy was a totally oh this

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.270
is my whole point so it's like you have

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:11.800
that going on that's the guy's job the

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.140
guy's also a raging [ __ ] [ __ ] so

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.120
as a raging [ __ ] with a job that at

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.710
raging [ __ ] most likely should be

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.390
screened out of like really easily and

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:20.530
quickly but once you get in there it's

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:21.790
like you're part of a unions really we

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:23.860
got you buddy you [ __ ] hit a guy in

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:25.930
the head with a bat the other day we got

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:27.010
you it's like the Catholic Church

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:28.450
they've instead of pedophiles they have

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:30.640
like psycho psycho [ __ ] sociopath so

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.890
they constantly like shuffle shuffle

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:34.810
around even desk work and then they're

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:36.520
just incontinence so that guy we're

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:41.860
putting you back up yeah they're all if

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:44.170
I go you need a lawyer on retainer but

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:45.670
this guy even if the guy said that the

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:46.600
whole argument said well he didn't die

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.100
by strangulation he had drugs in his

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.620
system it's like all right as a dude who

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:52.330
just had basically a panic attack I'm

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:53.650
struggling too much weed yesterday that

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:55.360
can happen to anybody anyone could be in

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.280
the dangerous car do you know if I was

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.020
if I was as high as it was yesterday and

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:00.610
the cops pulled me out of my Honda Civic

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:02.800
I might die have a heart attack - yeah

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.420
so it's like look you know if you're

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.100
ready to send him to death dude think

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.660
what would you sue if it was me dude I

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.760
was high and I was going for jury duty

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.570
out of my Ford Explorer oh but it was

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:15.940
you if I got really the news would be

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.130
like local idiot dies of a heart attack

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:22.570
while under speeding a cop cop

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:24.280
definitely didn't do anything well it

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.270
was the things they're trying to be

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:26.320
they're trying to build the argument

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.730
like well the cop technically yeah he

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:29.440
was wrong but he didn't kill a guy it's

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:32.050
like but even if okay so the guy didn't

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:33.910
die but if he didn't die by asphyxiation

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:36.760
if your job is to like get move people

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.080

that's a gross you know but again it's

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:52.900
like [ __ ] dude it's like for that

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.010

next slide roll with a crew we roll

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:24.460
together in affinity groups before the

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:26.230
March share your contact info legal

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:28.720
above have each other's back in the

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.090
streets leave together it's a cartoon of

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:33.220
three women all different races

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.170
apparently and one holding up a sign

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:37.930
that says [ __ ] the police staying the

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:40.000
streets together this is going the

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.370
streets are our voice pigs will work to

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:44.590
split us apart to try to get us on the

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:47.740
sidewalk it's just like they threw out

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:48.970
the whole thing it calls themselves

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:51.460
comrades pigs and it's like a nice

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.950
cartoon of white women and snow hats I

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:56.890
mean dude this this I I can't help but

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:59.260
my my conspiratorial part of my brain to

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:02.200
be like this seems not overtly

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.180
controlled and like step a step B step C

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.680
but it seems like this has been guided

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.750
by I personally think this might be like

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:10.710
Russian or some foreign government

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:12.550
because they apparently they said

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:15.310
foreign governments are infiltrated the

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:16.840
social sciences and started like

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.370
publishing all this like pro-communist

00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:22.290
[ __ ] so I don't know so this one's

00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:24.430
diversity of tactics so it's different

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:25.780
ways you can do it one of them is just

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.270
jumping over a turnstile throwing smoke

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:31.590
spray paint doughnuts by clocks these

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:33.850
throw in a trash can ones just mooning

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:35.650
mooning the police and then bottom left

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:40.540
is Drake pointing that mean I mean as we

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.040
don't police each other's actions or

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.720
snitch on each other to pigs or the

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.930
media at the same time we we take care

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:48.640
not to endanger others with our actions

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.100
also imagine if you have to learn how to

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:52.990
like participate in protest from a meme

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:56.020
it's like what what like what level of

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:57.670
non-thinking are you to where you're

00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:59.170
relying on the Internet to go like I'm

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:00.940
gonna see how I should move about in

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.500
public in protests I need to bring water

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:05.230
and snack bars it's like dude stay the

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:06.430
[ __ ] at home if you think you need a

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:07.400
snack

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.200
yeah you're a protester that like well

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.229
I'm gonna need a snack a knack while I

00:42:12.229 --> 00:42:13.940
fighting the cops like dude you don't

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:15.229
want to fight it if you have snacks

00:42:15.229 --> 00:42:16.880
don't worry

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.519
you have gushers in a [ __ ] fanny pack

00:42:19.519 --> 00:42:22.549
some dude is gonna hit you with in the

00:42:22.549 --> 00:42:27.140
face with a stick imagine if someone

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:28.729
gets hit in like the [ __ ] pocket

00:42:28.729 --> 00:42:38.390
although yeah there's a lot of bad ideas

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:40.400
getting tossed around right now I wanted

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.069
the one of the suburbs is that's that's

00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:45.529
that's when a race war starts and again

00:42:45.529 --> 00:42:47.269
that's a bad thing that's one of those

00:42:47.269 --> 00:42:49.160
things where if there are people who are

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.839
who do have some sort of interest in

00:42:50.839 --> 00:42:52.489
like causing as much chaos as possible

00:42:52.489 --> 00:42:54.589
you set up a fake account you go on it's

00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:55.819
already did happen - black lives matter

00:42:55.819 --> 00:42:57.229
before the Russians infiltrated I'm

00:42:57.229 --> 00:42:59.420
instead of like fake stuff well they

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:01.039
were just set up they'd be like hey this

00:43:01.039 --> 00:43:02.269
is where we're having a protest and then

00:43:02.269 --> 00:43:04.309
they'd set up a white rally at the same

00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:07.670
spot exactly Facebook event like oh this

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:08.809
is we're hanging out yeah so you just

00:43:08.809 --> 00:43:10.190
you just set it up like we're going to

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:11.900
the suburbs there's like yeah [ __ ] yeah

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:13.249
they see a meme obviously they don't

00:43:13.249 --> 00:43:14.539
think for themselves so they obey what

00:43:14.539 --> 00:43:15.680
they see on the internet you do the same

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.359
thing to people like they're coming for

00:43:17.359 --> 00:43:17.539
us

00:43:17.539 --> 00:43:18.950
check this out they're all saying that

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:21.229
and all of a sudden you have absolute

00:43:21.229 --> 00:43:23.869
morons fighting because they were just

00:43:23.869 --> 00:43:25.519
like watching they watch the wrong thing

00:43:25.519 --> 00:43:28.309
and believed it then they go the suburbs

00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:30.049
it's gonna be it's gonna it would be it

00:43:30.049 --> 00:43:31.849
wouldn't last very long at all because

00:43:31.849 --> 00:43:33.229
they would just know it would be people

00:43:33.229 --> 00:43:34.969
will be shooting sober versus guns

00:43:34.969 --> 00:43:36.650
yeah that's people that it will be guns

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:39.380
especially rightfully so if you're going

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:42.319
into people's houses yes would happen if

00:43:42.319 --> 00:43:43.489
you're gonna start attacking that's a

00:43:43.489 --> 00:43:44.779
battle that's a bad on that point yeah

00:43:44.779 --> 00:43:45.979
you start invading someone so that's

00:43:45.979 --> 00:43:47.630
like now we're going back just watch

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:50.089
Apocalypto I just watched it I watched

00:43:50.089 --> 00:43:51.529
it two nights ago did I just watch it a

00:43:51.529 --> 00:43:55.039
lot yesterday morning yeah and then I

00:43:55.039 --> 00:43:56.299
went for a [ __ ] run pretty much

00:43:56.299 --> 00:43:58.849
Jaguar Paul thank you dude [ __ ]

00:43:58.849 --> 00:44:01.009
things remind me a lot of Jaguar oh dude

00:44:01.009 --> 00:44:02.989
holy [ __ ] no one said anything that nice

00:44:02.989 --> 00:44:04.880
to me and like three weeks out you're

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:05.869
thinking of while you're watching it

00:44:05.869 --> 00:44:07.999
you're like that's that's BAE and my

00:44:07.999 --> 00:44:09.650
baby down the well I'm pretty much

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:11.749
obviously dude I [ __ ] went out and I

00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:14.719
took a run I ran further I ran I I made

00:44:14.719 --> 00:44:16.789
it my bragging point six miles dude

00:44:16.789 --> 00:44:18.049
usually I make it point four before I

00:44:18.049 --> 00:44:20.810
guess after I watch apocalypse Oh

00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:23.540
you think identified with that in the

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:26.450
movie I'm trying to think so there was

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:31.630
the guy who couldn't get the girl yes a

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:33.920
hundred percent I'm cheering for that

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.750
guy the whole time he ruled he did we

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:37.040
got the hot peppers on his dick hot

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:41.510
peppers on his dick in her mouth funny I

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:42.740
like the first time I tried to watch

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:44.660
that [ __ ] people up during the [ __ ]

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:47.750
knows I was pissed he ran he didn't turn

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:49.010
around and try to fight all the dudes

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:51.470
what when he got shot the end yeah I did

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:53.270
then again I was like to be fair you

00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:55.310
know as jagwire Paul yeah you know I'd

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:56.660
probably have you know the guy in my

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.340
dream told me to run someone run yeah I

00:44:58.340 --> 00:44:59.450
tried watching that without subtitles

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:00.950
the first time I watched it because I

00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:02.720
watched it on like piratebay you could

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:05.000
yeah I was I thought I was following

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.740
like there was so much [ __ ] that I would

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:08.660
have I was like I had the idea and I'm

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:10.220
you could you can watch it like that but

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:12.500
it is so yeah well without the prophecy

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:14.240
from that little girl exactly honey

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.770
yeah they got wrong with the dude how

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:18.170
nice is it when that Jaguars chasing him

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:20.030
and gets that guy's face I honestly

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:22.610
might be my fake snake to the throat

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:24.020
when he has to cut his own wrists yeah

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:25.340
that movie [ __ ] rules might be my

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:26.870
favorite movie yeah the thing that sucks

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:28.370
about it is it didn't get a lot of love

00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:30.710
because it was right after Mel went

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:33.110
after the Jews right after it was I

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:35.120
think it was his first movie back from

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.720
attacking the Jews I mean that's good

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.370
luck with his best movie came back with

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:41.390
some heat I'll tell you that

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:42.920
Apocalypto might be one of the best

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:44.870
movies and also the whole thing is now

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:47.180
that I had had a couple drinks ya know

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:49.190
like I said I'm listening to that book

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:52.100
on like the French and Indian War mm-hmm

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:56.030
so I got a lot of savagery on the brain

00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:58.130
like I've been sure and reading about

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:00.650
Indian atrocities mm-hm and then I'm

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:02.720
watching you know the Mayans or the acid

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.220
it was the Mayans and that I believe

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:08.300
salad mines or Aztecs you know cutting

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:09.830
people's heads off and hearts out for

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:11.930
yeah they would do that all the time

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:14.600
mm-hmm you know committing atrocities in

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.860
that yeah and then you know you hear

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:17.600
white people like liberals today be like

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.730
and the Native Americans were such good

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:20.390
people

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:22.640
yeah it's like the whole time I was

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:25.130
watching Apocalypto as I wait till the

00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:26.900
boys show up at the end they see some

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:30.020
boats and it's like bumpass time is over

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:31.550
dude there's no frame imagine that

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:33.650
that's awful there's no frame of

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:34.370
reference

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:36.500
yeah that's a it's also funny to be an

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.090
adult and think that like there was a

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:39.320
group of people at a period of history

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.060
who are all like uniformly good in peace

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:43.700
with the land and they shared it and you

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:46.640
know what women had a stronger gender

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.800
role than they do it like just all this

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:51.380
[ __ ] and it's also down a well you know

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:53.450
they also used to like eat each other

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:56.600
yeah and scalp scalps were big and rape

00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.700
is pretty common they thought did I say

00:46:58.700 --> 00:46:59.930
there's no last one like they the way

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:01.370
they thought in the Native Americans in

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:02.510
the Northeast at least that's another

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:03.950
thing you have to be you have to specify

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:05.480
what you talk about because that

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.940
literally is like comparing Finland to

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:10.160
[ __ ] Italy yeah if you're talking

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:13.370
about you know but uh they the way they

00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:16.130
thought that one Wars was by the cruelty

00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:18.440
you inflicted on the other person mhm

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.270
so like let's say they just caught you

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:21.890
when we're gonna kill you they would

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:24.380
torture you and let's say no one's gonna

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:26.120
know that you got tortured yeah it's

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:27.860
just between you and them yeah like

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:29.210
they're not sending a message to anyone

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:30.980
they're like this is how we win is we

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:34.070
make him he's hurt it's like we're not

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:35.300
just killing him to get rid of him

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:37.610
reflecting so much pain on they would

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:40.280
does one jazz the Jesuits got rocked

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.930
dude I had to have talked about this on

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:43.100
the last thing a little bit you

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:46.520
mentioned the Jesuits you remember that

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:49.100
movie The Silence or whatever the one

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:52.400
with yeah yeah when the partners not

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.860
having it the partners didn't like it

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:57.500
same thing with the nude so these Jesuit

00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:59.060
priests were like trained kinda in the

00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:00.860
same thing I think there was roughly the

00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:03.650
same time period - yeah and so they were

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:06.260
like priest in a lot of French priests

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:08.060
because they were Catholic obviously

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:09.170
because it was French and British in

00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:11.450
North America they were like trained to

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:13.520
go get tortured like their mission was

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.740
to go spread the word in the wilderness

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.410
in [ __ ] you know the Northeast

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:20.170
Northeast North America and just

00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:22.100
guaranteed you're getting tortured like

00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:23.540
that's part of your mission pretty

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:25.970
[ __ ] cool that is badass [ __ ] nuts

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:28.550
- the Mohawks would get you and one of

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:29.990
the first things they did was chew off

00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:31.360
your fingernails

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.350
they were just immediately when they

00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:34.820
call you they bite your fingernails off

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:37.070
they scalped this dude and they all had

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:39.110
sharp fingernails and we're just digging

00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:41.450
their nails into his [ __ ] head like

00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:44.310
they just did oh but

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:47.040
it worked out sorry I'll Joe no no it

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.780
worked out [ __ ] not because when the

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:51.750
French and Indian War broke out so they

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:53.550
Indians respected the [ __ ] out of French

00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:54.750
a lot more than they did the British

00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:56.430
because they saw the will power of the

00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:58.140
French company with the behind they saw

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:01.320
the strength they were like all that got

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:03.360
it's real because they saw those Jesuits

00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:04.920
getting [ __ ] burnt and tortured not

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.290
just a like I think that God's real so

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:09.090
they started with the the Indians at

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:10.460
first were pretty pro-french

00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:11.700
pro-catholic

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:13.350
I mean again talk about like y'all were

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:15.360
just saying you know like it does work

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.670
to like blow [ __ ] up it works that is go

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:19.800
and let yourself be yourself I mean yeah

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.000
it happened in Vietnam

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.490
those have burned themselves people like

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:26.900
I think those guys have a good point

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:30.150
just go go into the jungle with a Bible

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:32.160

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:35.460

England there were scholars of language

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:44.400
they were like going set up ways to

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.750

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:50.420

00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:05.880
childbirth couple go to the Great Spirit

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:07.950

00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:09.120
there and you're just sitting there just

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:10.440

00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:22.530
timeless those guys lived in every

00:57:22.530 --> 00:57:25.230
civilization oh we don't have as nice as

00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:28.080
thick as them it was probably I think I

00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:30.180
am willing to bet it was like one dude

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:31.590
who was kind of like nah man you can't

00:57:31.590 --> 00:57:33.030
be a [ __ ] and everyone else was

00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:34.650
bitching it's like one dude who they

00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:36.390
can't be a [ __ ] and everyone else is

00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:38.760
like yeah somehow that characters

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:40.440
his way into every movie that's like I

00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:43.020
do not fear death yes like you all did

00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:46.440
everybody did you could be as convicted

00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:48.870
and your religion as possible and you're

00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:50.970
still you fear that's the only thing

00:57:50.970 --> 00:57:53.730
those there's dudes who like we're 100%

00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:55.590
certain of like oh sweet now I'm going

00:57:55.590 --> 00:57:56.940
over to the Great Mother like there was

00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:58.380
dudes who were like hell yeah yeah in

00:57:58.380 --> 00:57:59.790
fact yeah just to cut yourself would be

00:57:59.790 --> 00:58:01.200
scary it was definitely a higher

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.660
percentage than Western cultures like

00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:06.090
those the dudes I'm reading about in

00:58:06.090 --> 00:58:07.440
these tribes were like they were built

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:09.810
to die in battle that's what they were

00:58:09.810 --> 00:58:12.060
all built to do yeah and they did it

00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:13.680
they were [ __ ] wild and if you didn't

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:14.940
die in battle you got the chill like

00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:16.380
dude cool even if you didn't time battle

00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:19.620
you were like you guys well first off

00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:21.450
you got you were gonna get killed if you

00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:23.850
couldn't fight you're [ __ ] and like

00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:26.100
they would you'd just be like you'd have

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:28.080
to go find at the white settlers and

00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:29.850
live with them and just be like it

00:58:29.850 --> 00:58:32.040
shitty porpora all of you lost yeah yeah

00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:33.660
I give the tribes that got conquered by

00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:35.760
other tribes like all the poor shitty

00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:37.350
ones that like limped out of the woods

00:58:37.350 --> 00:58:40.110
would go live unlike the outskirts of

00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:41.940
like New England towns really and the

00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:43.890
New Englanders hated them but they would

00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:45.570
use them as like a buffer against Indian

00:58:45.570 --> 00:58:47.640
raids like there'd be a ring of like

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:49.470
poor Indians around regular yeah yeah

00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:51.390
that's true and then then and then Irish

00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:53.940
people as well pretty funny Irish shitty

00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:56.610
people that's how the story Oh again

00:58:56.610 --> 00:58:58.950
that's how Robert Rogers starts really

00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:00.630
yeah his family was like shitty

00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:02.910
scots-irish they lived on the outskirts

00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:05.190
of town originally with the Indians yeah

00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:07.260
then them and the other pours that's

00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:10.110
what they did yeah you don't track the

00:59:10.110 --> 00:59:12.000
land with your name on it really good

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.620
dealing you're like yeah don't move out

00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:14.730
there and all of a sudden they move in

00:59:14.730 --> 00:59:16.560
and be like do you guys see something

00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:18.000
running through the woods negative yeah

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.860
yeah who is that you know oh yeah at

00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:21.810
night demons dance in front of a bonfire

00:59:21.810 --> 00:59:25.140
other woods just don't go out there cut

00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:28.950
your [ __ ] head off slowly yeah man

00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:31.020
yeah so we've come a long way well it's

00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:32.460
funny to think about like how they

00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:33.900
quarry like there's all that cool fight

00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:35.430
choreography in those movies when in

00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:37.110
reality it was just world so just dudes

00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:38.910
throwing haymakers like the gun would

00:59:38.910 --> 00:59:41.730
see it's like five out of ten guns with

00:59:41.730 --> 00:59:43.020
Jam and it would be a guy just like

00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:44.850
throwing haymakers missing everyone's

00:59:44.850 --> 00:59:45.630
out of breath

00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:47.030
that's what

00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:51.110
you see the king no oh yeah I was [ __ ]

00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:52.730
sick that fights he was great when both

00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:54.230
of them are in full suit of armor I

00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:56.000
think yeah that was the one about like

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.040
Braveheart - basically no that was the

00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.560
outlaw I was a movie called the King on

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.210
Netflix Timothy Shou man it's [ __ ]

01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:05.500
sick is it dudes just like two dudes in

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.520
like they did one of those things where

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.530
they settled up instead of a battle they

01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:12.260
just had two champions fling and it's

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.690
just two dudes in full night armor so

01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:16.190
it's impossible to find banging each

01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:17.540
other yeah just hit each other and

01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:21.170
they're like breathing in its way like

01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:23.690
you ain't nothing but like beer bread

01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:28.580
and meat for like your whole life 100

01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:32.690
pounds and it's 90 degrees out dudes who

01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:35.960
die all the time just died drop he's

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.760
close the king's king if that won the

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.070
sassy daddy dude he had a full armor

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:42.470
soon he [ __ ] died when I arrived in

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:46.040
bacon they would wear steel in the heat

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:48.860
and their bodies the temperature

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:50.960
internally must have been like 150

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:54.650
degrees so you have that guy who's

01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:56.630
wearing like a metal trashcan just like

01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:58.610
a heavy heat stroke on a horse then

01:00:58.610 --> 01:01:00.320
you're like look how [ __ ] up this guy

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.640
look how [ __ ] up the way they used to

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.230
think is it's like yeah dude this guy

01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:04.340
couldn't figure out what not to wear a

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:07.970
medal and this song I think I so [ __ ]

01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:09.380
up and he saw another person thought he

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:10.580
was better because of the color of his

01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:11.870
skin it's like yeah this guy was not

01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:13.570
fired yeah they don't know these guys

01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:16.220
know imagine the battle are like they're

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:17.450
just swinging there's the first one to

01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:19.130
pass out from heatstroke and I know you

01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:20.600
kind of all passes out he's like yeah

around lat although lads developed over

01:10:20.769 --> 01:10:23.170
time like a very thick chin Native

01:10:23.170 --> 01:10:24.789
Americans basically turned in like small

01:10:24.789 --> 01:10:29.860
bricks they just got beaten down into

01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:31.690
like charcoal and they're like dying

01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:33.729
it's compressed anything I resident like

01:10:33.729 --> 01:10:36.429
an input every Mexican boxer is just

01:10:36.429 --> 01:10:39.099
like punching the fit you need to kill

01:10:39.099 --> 01:10:41.469
them to knock them is granite yeah they

01:10:41.469 --> 01:10:41.920
are

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.989
I mean that is that is true dude it's

01:10:43.989 --> 01:10:46.210
like especially like you know those guys

01:10:46.210 --> 01:10:47.469
you drop a Mexican often

01:10:47.469 --> 01:10:49.060
the northern woods of Canada and they're

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:50.650
got to run to America they're instantly

01:10:50.650 --> 01:10:52.210
Jaguar Paul we're like if anyone's

01:10:52.210 --> 01:10:53.800
trying to stop them were like these are

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:56.410
my woods I have my father hunted them

01:10:56.410 --> 01:10:58.360
and I've hunted them with my father you

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:00.070
can't stop that dude that's it he's

01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:01.719
gonna lay in the mud puddle and pop up

01:11:01.719 --> 01:11:06.330
and just be like poisonous stars

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:09.430
jump in the fall just like a four foot

01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:13.540
drop he's just like yeah apparently

01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:15.370
they're like yeah they're just like yeah

01:11:15.370 --> 01:11:16.540
they're just flying I talked to a coyote

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:17.980
and they're like oh yeah we just [ __ ]

01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:21.370
fly to Canada walk pretty easy actually

01:11:21.370 --> 01:11:23.620
if they fly and they go onto land

01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:30.640
well let's try to Minnesota sucks they

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.530
like get to they get flown in and then

01:11:32.530 --> 01:11:34.420
they you know you just I guess fly a

01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:36.010
private plane even if money is flying

01:11:36.010 --> 01:11:37.660
probably lame so it's like or you just

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:38.920
fly I don't know how it works but you

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:40.960
just fly into Canada and then you're

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:42.160
like hey is it cool if I come and

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:44.410
they're like yeah yeah it's cool totally

01:11:44.410 --> 01:11:46.300
chill and then you just go to a cartel

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:47.920
owned form that's butted up against the

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.050
border yeah just walk in it's really

01:11:50.050 --> 01:11:52.540
pretty easy yeah that makes sense

01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:54.760
going up to like I guess the Pacific

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:59.350
Northwest yes yeah yeah exactly yeah

01:11:59.350 --> 01:12:01.000
well there was guys out in California

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.260
used to grow but before when you had

01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:03.489
like you know you could only grow so

01:12:03.489 --> 01:12:05.230
many plants they would limit you so they

01:12:05.230 --> 01:12:06.730
were just divide their properties up

01:12:06.730 --> 01:12:08.050
they would buy properties and they all

01:12:08.050 --> 01:12:09.400
right and like just I'm gonna cut this

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:10.900
property in half sell to my friends I'm

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:12.520
sell back to me somehow I owned like six

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:15.130
properties and now I can grow like 2,000

01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:16.510
plants because now I have multiple

01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:19.210
properties 200 properties for plant or

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:20.650
I'm gonna put like six other properties

01:12:20.650 --> 01:12:22.239
in four people's names tight pretty

01:12:22.239 --> 01:12:24.760
chill this Joe I support that yeah man

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.350
but that's I think we'll get legal weed

01:12:26.350 --> 01:12:27.940
out of this you know I want to be

01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:30.010
selfish this will get federally legal

01:12:30.010 --> 01:12:34.150
weed yeah I think I think that's a bone

01:12:34.150 --> 01:12:35.650
then like I was coming out of the riots

01:12:35.650 --> 01:12:38.140
right now just out of like the new you

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:39.070
know when we go into the new regime

01:12:39.070 --> 01:12:40.630
almost a new world order we go the new

01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:43.380
regime because it's like dude do this

01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:46.000
this is on this is on demand now dude

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.400
it's like I don't know man it's just

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.489
it's [ __ ] up which yeah it does suck

01:12:51.489 --> 01:12:53.280
because there's definitely a lot of good

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.090
coming out of it but for all the good

01:12:55.090 --> 01:12:56.949
coming out there's just you know ten

01:12:56.949 --> 01:12:59.400
[ __ ] Twitter videos of

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.900
people just getting jumped over getting

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:03.520
sucked up but that the problem is again

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.380
it's like this is the fall that happens

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:07.090
in our brains you know when you like go

01:13:07.090 --> 01:13:08.740
to Afghanistan like all the walls are

01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:10.480
always like like Call of Duty bullet

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:12.190
holes and crumbled yeah this is the

01:13:12.190 --> 01:13:13.630
American psyche right now we're in the

01:13:13.630 --> 01:13:15.010
middle of psychological warfare between

01:13:15.010 --> 01:13:16.540
billionaires who for some reason I don't

01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:17.860
nobody understands what the president

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:19.780
really truly does I mean or maybe I'm

01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:22.120
just an idiot I don't but it's like you

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:23.920
have this office that can be filled with

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:27.130
either Joe Biden or Donald Trump who you

01:13:27.130 --> 01:13:29.380
know Donald Trump kind of like pulled

01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:31.060
some mega move somehow and you don't did

01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:32.980
this thing Biden's being kind of propped

01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:35.410
up just by a huge political business

01:13:35.410 --> 01:13:37.200
apparatus that is like for some reason

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:40.000
this very important job this is the guy

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.660
we need to put in there it's like I know

01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:45.250
I still don't and then the midst of that

01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:46.900
there's these two forces trying to get

01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:49.030
like geezers into power positions and

01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:51.130
then we will stop at nothing to like

01:13:51.130 --> 01:13:53.650
[ __ ] everybody's brains up to be like no

01:13:53.650 --> 01:13:54.910
yeah yeah this is the guy and you're

01:13:54.910 --> 01:13:56.560
like all right hey I guess that's the

01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:59.110
guy now you know I'm saying it yeah it's

01:13:59.110 --> 01:14:00.610
like I don't even know what the job I

01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:01.390
don't even know what the [ __ ] they do

01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:06.310
yeah I mean dude Elon Musk just built a

01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:09.430
[ __ ] rocket ship yeah why can't we

01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:11.530
have like maybe maybe set the bar like

01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:12.550
oh you got to be able to build a rocket

01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:14.290
ship too if you want to be President you

01:14:14.290 --> 01:14:15.580
gotta be like able to do [ __ ] that's

01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:17.860
like super impressive on paper rather

01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:20.110
than just being like for abortion in the

01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:23.080
80s against it in the 90s yes but you

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.730
know it's like dude I was looking at

01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:27.040
like like I've been watching a go ahead

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.720
and watch grant on the history check

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.480
that still it's so funny to see what

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:34.750
like a president used to be like yeah

01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:38.260
like he was like West Point Mexican

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:41.890
American War failed like he was a drunk

01:14:41.890 --> 01:14:43.750
at first cuz he was out of like in the

01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:46.240
middle of nowhere and then he came home

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:48.460
like left the military basically was

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:49.870
like a loser worked it like his dad's

01:14:49.870 --> 01:14:52.270
shop and then the war broke out he like

01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:54.790
while he was poor he like turned in one

01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:56.890
of his slaves it said he'd set his slave

01:14:56.890 --> 01:15:00.460
free he got a slave because his family

01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:02.620
was anti they were abolitionists yeah

01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:05.020
and grant married into a slave owning

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:08.080
family like in Missouri and he would

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:09.610
like work in the field with the slaves

01:15:09.610 --> 01:15:11.860
like everybody hated him for doing [ __ ]

01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:12.640
like that

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:15.070
and then while he was very poor he

01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:16.780
instead of selling his slaves he gave

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:18.160
them all their freedom yeah

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.420
which back then was like crazy yeah like

01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:24.730
then he you know just became the best

01:15:24.730 --> 01:15:27.460
military commander in the world and then

01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:28.600
became the president

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.730
compare that to Trump's resume yeah

01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:33.100
again not now how could you compare a

01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:35.260
modern politician to true kept a Civil

01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:37.300
War general but still yeah it's funny to

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:40.090
see like what President used to be yeah

01:15:40.090 --> 01:15:42.190
now it's just a popularity now is a

01:15:42.190 --> 01:15:44.890
popularity contest corporate interests

01:15:44.890 --> 01:15:47.250
it started you know probably after they

01:15:47.250 --> 01:15:50.050
after they shot Kennedy you think so

01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:52.630
yeah the last like probably the 60s 70s

01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:53.950
there's probably when it just totally

01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:55.750
turned to just like this guy's gonna

01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:58.390
make the most powerful people most the

01:15:58.390 --> 01:16:00.610
most money yes it's all dude that's why

hated Don Lemon right yes

01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:37.210

liberal these days but yeah did I told

some dude in like the Hamptons it was in

01:18:18.639 --> 01:18:20.530
the Hamptons and like okay like it's

01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:21.880
just like well then this is the problem

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.110
too with the news I mean he'll just

01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:24.309
cover it up cuz he's rich

01:18:24.309 --> 01:18:26.050
didn't literally cover that up this is

01:18:26.050 --> 01:18:28.420
the problem with the news it's like did

01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:30.610
that happen yeah that happened so it

01:18:30.610 --> 01:18:32.949
definitely happened yeah I mean it's you

01:18:32.949 --> 01:18:34.360
can look it up true I guess yeah you

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.770
have the records yeah because that's

01:18:35.770 --> 01:18:38.050
that's pressing charges it's gonna get

01:18:38.050 --> 01:18:39.820
dropped also but this is the thing to

01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:41.320
with when I you know from seeing comedy

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:43.329
the people who are the hardest like

01:18:43.329 --> 01:18:45.460
warriors against all this [ __ ] typically

01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:47.079
are associated with the little blunder

01:18:47.079 --> 01:18:48.849
on their part they have little yeah

01:18:48.849 --> 01:18:50.500
something happened on the resume back

01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:52.809
there all of a sudden they're it's like

01:18:52.809 --> 01:18:55.539
yeah exactly it's like so a lot of times

01:18:55.539 --> 01:18:57.099
when people do this well there's also

01:18:57.099 --> 01:18:59.199
the thing to them they say like the more

01:18:59.199 --> 01:19:00.880
like a gazelle at somebody it's about a

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.440
thing typically it shows that they have

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.179
a ton of like a bunch of guilt not a

01:19:04.179 --> 01:19:05.650
guilt they have a bunch of a doubt that

01:19:05.650 --> 01:19:07.059
they don't want to express they turn

01:19:07.059 --> 01:19:08.500
that into a double down even harder and

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:11.199
they're like no yeah that's that's kind

01:19:11.199 --> 01:19:12.579
of there's a part of me that you know

01:19:12.579 --> 01:19:14.409
I'm gonna get called [ __ ] [ __ ] for

01:19:14.409 --> 01:19:15.820
this but that's like there's like the

01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:18.309
guilt and doubt right now like wait

01:19:18.309 --> 01:19:19.900
where it's like white people are [ __ ]

01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:20.949
they're [ __ ] out and then like

01:19:20.949 --> 01:19:22.329
there's a part of me that's like damn I

01:19:22.329 --> 01:19:23.289
do feel bad

01:19:23.289 --> 01:19:25.630
yeah like about like I wish I could I

01:19:25.630 --> 01:19:27.010
wish there was some way I could distance

01:19:27.010 --> 01:19:29.500
myself from the bad whites yeah like I

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:31.000
maybe I can just put like a black live

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.010
man or thing on my Instagram maybe

01:19:33.010 --> 01:19:34.360
that'll let everybody it's like there

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:36.909
that's in there like I've you know yeah

01:19:36.909 --> 01:19:38.260
and then it's like all right no I just

01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:39.449
gotta [ __ ] calm down

01:19:39.449 --> 01:19:40.920
yeah don't be a [ __ ] about it I don't

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:43.769
need to announce to everybody hello I'm

01:19:43.769 --> 01:19:45.840
not racist which by the way for me on a

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:48.150
social platform might not look great

01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:51.090
yeah you know yeah so maybe I have other

01:19:51.090 --> 01:19:52.949
reasons to not speak up right now other

01:19:52.949 --> 01:19:55.530
than it's [ __ ] it's [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:19:55.530 --> 01:19:56.999
and again the only thing the only real

01:19:56.999 --> 01:19:58.679
thing is again what my friend was saying

01:19:58.679 --> 01:20:01.590
how it's like he's there he's in a cop's

01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:03.119
face that's Capote you know according to

01:20:03.119 --> 01:20:04.739
the agenda this is the enemy that's what

01:20:04.739 --> 01:20:06.090
we're doing then you see like the fear

01:20:06.090 --> 01:20:08.340
and another here it's a guy no cops

01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:11.039

01:20:21.570 --> 01:20:23.369
leanings and all this stuff and I'm

01:20:23.369 --> 01:20:24.809
gonna be like alright let's go down this

01:20:24.809 --> 01:20:26.249
let's just move away from this is just

01:20:26.249 --> 01:20:27.780
like you know you usually get that you

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:28.979

dealing with and it's like yeah it's

01:20:34.739 --> 01:20:37.260
easy to look on Twitter yeah but if

01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:39.659
you're in person I'm sure it's I mean he

01:20:39.659 --> 01:20:41.459
was saying he was like it was pretty

01:20:41.459 --> 01:20:44.039

a long time ago was like Latin x

01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:49.200
communities they didn't know about rape

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:51.000
until like the colonizers came and it's

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.320

everyone do there's people if you I

01:24:13.730 --> 01:24:15.230
could have went to Bryn Mawr and just

01:24:15.230 --> 01:24:17.449
solely been like I recognized white

01:24:17.449 --> 01:24:19.010
supremacy I recognize I am a Democrat

01:24:19.010 --> 01:24:20.810
and dude I could have just wrote all my

01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:22.429
papers like that and I would've gotten

01:24:22.429 --> 01:24:24.320
the same degree I got like yeah yeah if

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.579

01:24:25.579 --> 01:24:27.199
man like you sing the song and do the

01:24:27.199 --> 01:24:28.460
dance and just don't question anything

01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:31.070
they're like good job they they actively

01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:33.320
discourage people from thinking outs and

01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:34.429
it's from like all the students the

01:24:34.429 --> 01:24:35.690
teachers do it was the teachers you

01:24:35.690 --> 01:24:37.400
start I'd start popping off and the

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:38.960
teachers would be like I'd see them like

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:41.210
- stop stop stop like now they you have

01:24:41.210 --> 01:24:42.800
to kind of do it it's just this is

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:45.130
[ __ ] [ __ ] me I just saw this dude

01:24:45.130 --> 01:24:47.989
this professor from Villanova tweeted

01:24:47.989 --> 01:24:50.239
some [ __ ] that just was like some white

01:24:50.239 --> 01:24:51.739
guy and he was like as a professor of

01:24:51.739 --> 01:24:54.650
this I want you to know that like white

01:24:54.650 --> 01:24:57.290
people invented it was some sort of like

01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:59.300
white white guys invented violence

01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:01.460
somehow I get it I get the one thing

01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:03.110
that's kind of true is then that we

01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:05.170
learned this from you debate is like

01:25:05.170 --> 01:25:08.949
yeah like the Plantation slavery was

01:25:08.949 --> 01:25:12.260
that was adopted in other countries by

01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:14.570
minorities against minorities yeah well

01:25:14.570 --> 01:25:15.679
I mean over there they weren't my noise

01:25:15.679 --> 01:25:17.540
but you know I mean sure so they didn't

01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:19.219
learn that kind of but when it comes to

01:25:19.219 --> 01:25:23.929
like we learned murder from you like

01:25:23.929 --> 01:25:25.610
what do you like our little brother it's

01:25:25.610 --> 01:25:28.639
like so you have you're saying that you

01:25:28.639 --> 01:25:31.550
know you guys learned quote-unquote to

01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:33.260
do that it's like yeah but so you still

01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:34.550
had a filter that decision through your

01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:36.079
own moral compass and you weren't just

01:25:36.079 --> 01:25:38.780
like oh sweet you know I'm saying it's

01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:41.329
like maybe we're just misinterpreting

01:25:41.329 --> 01:25:42.829
when they're saying learning to just

01:25:42.829 --> 01:25:45.530
like we're doing it out of a reaction I

01:25:45.530 --> 01:25:49.550
don't know you guys did that like you

01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:50.389
started it

01:25:50.389 --> 01:25:52.369
yeah I was like a third generation slave

01:25:52.369 --> 01:25:53.389
and they freed me and sent me back to

01:25:53.389 --> 01:25:54.560
another country I'd probably be like

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:55.909
like what do you do with yourself is

01:25:55.909 --> 01:25:57.469
like get some [ __ ] slaves dude what

01:25:57.469 --> 01:25:59.389
do you think you conquer people and they

01:25:59.389 --> 01:26:01.340
do stuff for you but yeah that's just a

01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:04.340
weird infantile like we learned it from

01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:07.130
you it's like all right dude yeah it's

01:26:07.130 --> 01:26:07.880
like this is gonna be uncomfortable

01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:09.650
white people but you need to face

01:26:09.650 --> 01:26:12.980
yourselves I think maybe we all need to

01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:14.869
face ourselves a little that's maybe

01:26:14.869 --> 01:26:16.699
everybody needs to look inside a little

01:26:16.699 --> 01:26:17.220
that's

01:26:17.220 --> 01:26:18.690
thing it's like all we're doing is

01:26:18.690 --> 01:26:20.400
shifting it was before like super

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:22.350
predators there's net with you that was

01:26:22.350 --> 01:26:23.970
by I mean I was to Biden was there's a

01:26:23.970 --> 01:26:25.500
video and being like they don't have a

01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:26.790
cut and he even said he was like I hate

01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:29.160
to say this but nobody that parents

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:29.970
aren't there they don't have a

01:26:29.970 --> 01:26:31.290
conscience they're the bah blah blah

01:26:31.290 --> 01:26:32.940
blah blah blah blah and now they're like

01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:34.530
all right dude you know we want a little

01:26:34.530 --> 01:26:35.700
hard on the paint against inner-city

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:37.440
black dudes so it's like they're just

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:39.120
doing the same exact thing again yeah

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:40.770
it's like dude you guys haven't figured

01:26:40.770 --> 01:26:42.660
out but again that's not that you know I

01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:44.550
think they did figure it out that's does

01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:47.340
work they are in power yeah does work

01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:48.840
yeah we're again what writing articles

01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:50.880
for dude I'd have a guy be like yeah

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:52.530
just just can you just do something that

01:26:52.530 --> 01:26:53.850
pisses people off to get shared a lot

01:26:53.850 --> 01:26:55.170
they would ask me to do that so I you

01:26:55.170 --> 01:26:56.760
know this was like real low stakes I

01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:58.560
could imagine of course you know it's

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.660
like [ __ ] Fox is beating us what do we

01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:01.080
got

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:02.970

just sucks dude like I said it's

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:16.860
everyone's thinking it's like all right

01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:18.360
this is all filtered through there's two

01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:20.040
options now it's like pick one and then

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.660

slow down my life's been so [ __ ] good

01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:31.380
perfect because I'm white but like if if

01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:33.929
I was thinking this cuz you know as a

01:29:33.929 --> 01:29:35.729
white guy right away my instinct if I'm

01:29:35.729 --> 01:29:37.050
seeing like looting and [ __ ] on my

01:29:37.050 --> 01:29:40.320
[ __ ] [ __ ] yeah like just going

01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:41.999
in and breaking to a pharmacy in a

01:29:41.999 --> 01:29:43.619
target I'm like that doesn't like a guy

01:29:43.619 --> 01:29:45.329
carrying out a [ __ ] 70 inch

01:29:45.329 --> 01:29:46.800
flatscreen from Target like every time

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:47.999
he turns that on he has to be like

01:29:47.999 --> 01:29:50.969
thanks George like you know I mean like

01:29:50.969 --> 01:29:52.530
there's a weird thing to gather from a

01:29:52.530 --> 01:29:56.099
protest but yeah yeah but like I saw

01:29:56.099 --> 01:29:57.539
riding I saw looting all that [ __ ] and

01:29:57.539 --> 01:29:59.340
instantly my first reaction was like man

01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:01.559
this is ridiculous but then I was like

01:30:01.559 --> 01:30:03.719
in mechanik like in my there's a time

01:30:03.719 --> 01:30:05.550
there's a police station by my house if

01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:07.260
one of those dudes strangled somebody I

01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:09.929
knew yeah and they did it like every

01:30:09.929 --> 01:30:10.979
once in a while they just did that

01:30:10.979 --> 01:30:12.479
there's a group of dudes that everyone

01:30:12.479 --> 01:30:14.309
saw just killed someone in the town yeah

01:30:14.309 --> 01:30:16.800
I think we would do we would [ __ ] we

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:18.269
would rip that police station 1 percent

01:30:18.269 --> 01:30:20.880
dude 100% would and it wouldn't be like

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:22.800
litigious it would be physically going

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:23.760
into the office

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:25.229
yeah and beating the [ __ ] out of the

01:30:25.229 --> 01:30:27.479
guys they were militia up so fast yeah

01:30:27.479 --> 01:30:29.489
so I mean as soon as you put it in those

01:30:29.489 --> 01:30:30.780
terms where it's like what if this was

01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:32.519
your town I think it makes a little more

01:30:32.519 --> 01:30:34.739
sense to my brother I told you before my

01:30:34.739 --> 01:30:36.929
brother got hit in the ribs I thank God

01:30:36.929 --> 01:30:38.739
I didn't tweet something gay like that

01:30:38.739 --> 01:30:41.650
I mean saying it real quick it's a

01:30:41.650 --> 01:30:43.180
little less cos I thought about that I

01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:44.980
was like all right could be fair what

01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:46.600
would happen I was the same thing it

01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:47.950
would be like like my brother got

01:30:47.950 --> 01:30:50.320
hitting their ribs with a baton when he

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:52.120
was younger I think I got like the

01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:52.930
[ __ ] check

01:30:52.930 --> 01:30:54.190
yeah yes he was like trying to come

01:30:54.190 --> 01:30:56.170
across checked that is a cross-check

01:30:56.170 --> 01:30:58.150
yeah [ __ ] yes apparently it's a penalty

01:30:58.150 --> 01:31:02.340
in hockey that is apparently a knock but

01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:05.200
that's true he they should have that

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:06.070
rule for the Roger

01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:07.420
there should be refs down there to just

01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:09.219
be like I fight you two can fight

01:31:09.219 --> 01:31:10.930
everybody stand up everybody after the

01:31:10.930 --> 01:31:12.460
fight you two are going home but you two

01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:13.960
get to square I have to be [ __ ] all

01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:15.760
[ __ ] that should be the return of the

01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:17.469
NHL they should just be in every city at

01:31:17.469 --> 01:31:19.830
the riots being like just hockey rules

01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:22.510
cross-checking you're out bring out the

01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:24.070
big chunk yes they did you they did

01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:27.540
political UFC that would be awesome

01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:31.300

again it's like dude I can put the guy

01:34:07.269 --> 01:34:09.419
in jail immediately and figure it out

01:34:09.419 --> 01:34:11.590
you know what I mean oh yeah you can't

01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:12.550

thought like I'll be good but they said

01:34:23.979 --> 01:34:25.599

technically didn't murder the you know

01:34:45.039 --> 01:34:46.599
it's a boy thing found out he had a

01:34:46.599 --> 01:34:48.340
heart attack even if the guy had a heart

01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:49.689
can't act like that's murder you can't

01:34:49.689 --> 01:34:52.090
hold someone down by their neck like too

01:34:52.090 --> 01:34:55.179

01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:25.749
you're saying it's like okay dude and

01:35:25.749 --> 01:35:27.340

crime of forgery someone was like white

01:35:45.399 --> 01:35:47.409

01:35:47.409 --> 01:35:50.229

Abagnale getting hammered and trying to

01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:00.639
buy something with a fake 20 is that

01:36:00.639 --> 01:36:03.099
what he did yeah that's good George he

01:36:03.099 --> 01:36:04.239
would he would have here George was a

01:36:04.239 --> 01:36:05.649
little [ __ ] up and he either wrote a

01:36:05.649 --> 01:36:09.280
fake check or a had some [ __ ]

01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:11.260
something like he did whatever you tried

01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:14.229
to pay with wasn't real it probably was

01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:16.629
a counterfeit check write bad checks

Brooklyn being like we're getting

01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:46.810

01:40:03.550 --> 01:40:05.470
fencing am in a little so they were like

01:40:05.470 --> 01:40:07.660

01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:09.940
subcutaneous like a subcutaneous layer

01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:12.640
of just fat yes around them you like

01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:15.370
yeah kind of like a cell you know they

01:40:15.370 --> 01:40:17.710
had a fat force field yes so they think

01:40:17.710 --> 01:40:20.050
they were like powerhouse of the cell

01:40:20.050 --> 01:40:21.610
they're the mitochondria so they knew

01:40:21.610 --> 01:40:22.630
they what they think they have our

01:40:22.630 --> 01:40:23.860
holding arms and you better not hit me I

01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:25.660

01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:27.400
incredibly pale and I bruise almost

01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:28.780
immediately they literally are all

01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:31.510
surrounding like yeah all these white

01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:32.350
[ __ ] yeah

01:40:32.350 --> 01:40:35.020
Jesus Christ it bothers me so much oh oh

01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:36.940
I have contacted toilet contact

01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:38.800
dermatitis easily that's what it

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:43.300
honestly makes it so hard I can't bring

01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:45.930
myself to be like yeah I support this

01:40:45.930 --> 01:40:48.460
because of how much I hate them [ __ ]

01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:51.010
white liberal people yeah I hate them so

01:40:51.010 --> 01:40:52.330
much that I can't be like this is a good

01:40:52.330 --> 01:40:55.120
cause it's like I know their motives why

01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:57.070
don't exactly why can't your calls be

01:40:57.070 --> 01:40:58.300
the fact that you think they're being

01:40:58.300 --> 01:41:00.730
disingenuous miss yen yeah I think they

01:41:00.730 --> 01:41:01.690
are being disingenuous

01:41:01.690 --> 01:41:04.300
I think [ __ ] George Boole got murdered

01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:06.370
I think there needs to be obviously some

01:41:06.370 --> 01:41:08.080
changes in there yeah and what is the

01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:10.360
what is the fortunately yeah there's a

01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:11.860
pressure you're thinking for yourself

01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:14.410
and you're being pressured by you could

01:41:14.410 --> 01:41:17.230
say society at large yet form so two

01:41:17.230 --> 01:41:18.910
little pockets that all they do is fight

01:41:18.910 --> 01:41:20.350
each other yes if you think for yourself

01:41:20.350 --> 01:41:22.900
you just get naught at everyday yeah and

01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:24.730
if you think I'm a cleaner gosh there's

01:41:24.730 --> 01:41:27.010
[ __ ] at stake economically like dude it

01:41:27.010 --> 01:41:28.810
it's it's a real thing we're being

01:41:28.810 --> 01:41:31.740
herded into groupthink or just occupying

01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:35.200
two diametrically opposed and so fight

01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:37.090
it's just so advantageous to join one of

01:41:37.090 --> 01:41:39.520
those oh dude dude if I came out if I

01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:42.040
started tweeting like [ __ ] thugs

01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:42.810
routing

01:41:42.810 --> 01:41:45.480

01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:47.670
sell out you go ups for the rest of my

01:41:47.670 --> 01:41:49.260
career granted it'd be kind of shitty

01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:50.850
locations would be like [ __ ] you -

01:41:50.850 --> 01:41:52.800
the guy who was a child store that [ __ ]

01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:54.210
on his friend and now is like a YouTube

01:41:54.210 --> 01:41:57.270
child star there was a guy who did the

01:41:57.270 --> 01:42:00.270
the Harlem shake video and it's like God

01:42:00.270 --> 01:42:02.310
he's like a millionaire you a child star

01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:05.100
now yeah so he's just like acts like

01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:07.080
Steve from Blue's Clues like 9 to 5 then

01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:08.700
he goes to Vegas and like puts like him

01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:10.050
in hot chicks up I know like flaunt

01:42:10.050 --> 01:42:12.450
[ __ ] and like yeah that those are the

01:42:12.450 --> 01:42:14.190
option you can wear I could go full left

01:42:14.190 --> 01:42:17.070
I could be like I could be I could get

01:42:17.070 --> 01:42:19.410
like an old helmet put on some cargo

01:42:19.410 --> 01:42:22.050
shorts yeah go down and throw a rock

01:42:22.050 --> 01:42:24.510
film it you know it's gonna be like I'm

01:42:24.510 --> 01:42:26.580
liberal as [ __ ] all he needs a publicist

01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:28.260
you could build us you could have a guy

01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:30.690
you could pay a company to Reese pin

01:42:30.690 --> 01:42:32.610
your image and be like have a picture of

01:42:32.610 --> 01:42:35.010
you being like I was lost but I found my

01:42:35.010 --> 01:42:37.260
way and have you like screaming at a cop

01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:38.910
and then it's just boom now everyone's

01:42:38.910 --> 01:42:40.770
like oh cool I've read in my newspaper

01:42:40.770 --> 01:42:43.470
that if you have contacts to have that

01:42:43.470 --> 01:42:44.940
newspaper that people read spin you in a

01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:46.530
positive light people will see you in a

01:42:46.530 --> 01:42:48.120
positive light they were the most part

01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:49.470
they were working on that during the

01:42:49.470 --> 01:42:52.320
that's all we have we have reporters at

01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:53.910
the New York Times that report comedy

01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:56.100
that maybe that's an option we could we

01:42:56.100 --> 01:42:57.210
could have them write an article about

01:42:57.210 --> 01:42:58.680
you that's one way we can get out of

01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:00.690
this that's SNL imagine the [ __ ]

01:43:00.690 --> 01:43:02.730
government what they can do yeah and

01:43:02.730 --> 01:43:04.320
people want to sit here and be like well

01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:06.030
so no new it's like if you know how

01:43:06.030 --> 01:43:08.280
anything works it's like that that's all

01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:10.440
moldable that's all for sale you can do

01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:11.970
that you can spin things how you want if

01:43:11.970 --> 01:43:13.590
you have enough money you can spend

01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:15.630
you'd [ __ ] uh that guy got busted

with like prostitutes and [ __ ] they

01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:21.750

see that I could be wrong I mean there's

01:43:30.750 --> 01:43:32.490
a chances are it's fake but they did put

01:43:32.490 --> 01:43:35.340

01:43:35.340 --> 01:43:36.720
of surprise war mode it's not all over

01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:39.270

01:43:40.410 --> 01:43:42.140

feel like that yeah you know anonymous

01:43:54.079 --> 01:43:56.559

kind of cornea they're like we are the

01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:01.070
