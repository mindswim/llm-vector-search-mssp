that's pretty funny yeah the movie was

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.600
funny because it was like

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.800
like what did you think what did you

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.160
think the whole ending was i don't know

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.440
why people are debating

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.719
i won't say they have to reveal the

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.879
ending but like people are debating like

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:53.920
chronology

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.559
the meaning though of like they're like

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:57.680
well this is what the movie actually

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.840
means

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.239
wait well all right this is a spoiler

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.479
alert so if you want to go see the joker

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:05.840
which chances are if you listen this

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.280
podcast you already have

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.640
yeah opening night dressed as him after

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.000
putting the handgun back in the glove

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.360
compartment on the way in and be like

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.200
you know what not today

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.119
uh so what what do you mean like

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.479
because he was catching all this like

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.720
political flack for it for some reason

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.640
how so like what they were just all

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.000
they're saying like it's enabling

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.720
like in-cell violence and stuff like

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.000
that

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.360
i do understand that but i wouldn't

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.200
like i mean you can't criticize a

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.640
[ __ ] movie for that

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.520
yeah i mean you can if you can criticize

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.200
people trying to be funny for things

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.799
maybe true that maybe it's time actors

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:43.759
and movies start getting held

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.040
accountable but i just understand why

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.399
they had beef with the joker

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.280
it's like like are they calling that

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.680
like white guys uh black panther

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.520

wakanda

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.760
it ain't all [ __ ] you know it ain't

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.959
all rosy dude

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.560
well it is it was funny man because um

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.200
it's funny too because like so i was in

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.720
class today and people were talking

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.439
about

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:55.840
delaware county and they're like you

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.360
know oh my god [ __ ]

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.040
delco dude they're talking about like

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.959
other person's from delco or [ __ ]

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.239
yeah the place is like oh my god like

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.080
they're basically trashing it and it was

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.519
funny because i was like oh that's

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.200
some nice classism to start the day guys

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.000
and they're just kind of like

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.680
and it's funny because white people

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.120
don't give a [ __ ] about poor white

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.680
people

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.439
yeah if a white person sees other poor

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:16.880
white people like hey man well

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.639
did you have you consulted what poor

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.079
white people think about this it's like

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.479
no yeah but for some reason black people

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:23.759
are beholden

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.080
to the poor black population in terms of

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.520
like their authenticity

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.280
okay like if a black dude strives from

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.040
like the ethos of poor black people

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.639
they're like man you [ __ ] sell out

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.479
but that's like a as a thomas wayne you

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.080
see the joker and you're just like [ __ ]

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.600
you dude get the [ __ ] out of here

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.680
thomas william rules thomas wayne was

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.639
the only good guy in the movie

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.320
well he was bad he was no he wasn't

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.240
accurate he wasn't

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.960

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.680
forged that

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.360
thomas wayne wouldn't [ __ ] lay pipe

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.199
like that you don't think

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.000

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:20.240
that what did trump use rocking in the

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.440

barracuda

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.560

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.760
well it's funny they can kind of just

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.600
get away with it they'll just use a song

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.720
somehow saying coming out to whitney

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.600
houston

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.680

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.360
for sure simon saying was good from what

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.240
i heard yeah

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.839
you kept things in order down there you

00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:47.600
did a good job you know people like i

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.279
understand he's got fans look dude i've

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:50.160
played tropico

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.600
i understand now you're understanding

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.200
the role if you play tropico you start

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.880
to understand how these dictators you

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.079
know you guys sometimes you gotta take

00:10:56.079 --> 00:10:57.760
away like the rights to vote

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.680
and just kill a bunch of people honestly

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.519
that's the natural

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:03.440
without like a really well thought out

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.040
political system in place that's

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.000
the natural growth if you literally what

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:08.480
happened

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.640
you have an option to be like no nobody

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.000
can vote so you can't lose

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.240
yeah like they might try to rebel but if

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.240
you have soldiers you're all right

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.760
or you can let everybody vote and

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.200
possibly the game ends every like

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.240
four years really because if you get if

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.120
you lose the election

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.959
can you fix the election you can start

00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:28.720
rigging the election yeah that's [ __ ]

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.560
it's so fun it's [ __ ] sexy yeah but

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.920
uh dude that's

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.440
that's what happens man it was uh yeah i

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.040
would do it i'd do it in tropico

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.800
i would do it in real life for sure

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.640
someone was like uh yeah you can either

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.720
have everybody vote every four years to

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.079
see if you're still in power or you just

00:11:42.079 --> 00:11:44.160
you know you just don't even have to do

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:44.959
that

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:46.399
dude that's oh okay the whole point of

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:48.240
the political system you have guns

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.639
it's set up where it's acknowledged that

00:11:50.639 --> 00:11:52.000
we just have a steaming

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.160
pot of [ __ ] like kim jong-uns trying

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.360
to get the power in this country

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.560
and then we have checks and balances

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.639
that like kim jong-il in north korea

00:11:58.639 --> 00:12:00.000
they used to teach the kids that he

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.720
never

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.680
defecated that was in the curriculum

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.160
that kim jong-il did not [ __ ]

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.920
how sick is that it's so [ __ ] that's

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.560
so awesome that is so dude i was in uh

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.560

it is it is strange where like

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.159
he's more right about this topic than

00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:45.919
most comedians

00:20:45.919 --> 00:20:49.520
and trump's funnier than most comedians

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.440
yeah it's a weird time no one wants to

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.880
talk about that that trump's the

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.159
funniest dude

00:20:54.159 --> 00:20:55.840
pretty much and also the fact that like

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.840
dude his turkey tweet did you see that

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.640

not the [ __ ] one it's just like uh

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.840
so i guess the us troops kind of like

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.799
left the kurds

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:08.640
out to dry out in syria kind of hung

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.000
them out to dry just like

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
under whose orders good luck guys trump

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.679
daddies okay who's that guy

00:21:13.679 --> 00:21:15.280
we're coming home boys yeah mission to

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.480
come what the [ __ ] are they doing in

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.520
turkey

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.600
uh the kurd kurdistan is like on the

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.559
border of

00:21:20.559 --> 00:21:23.039
syria and turkey it's not a country okay

00:21:23.039 --> 00:21:24.960
kurdistan is just a region

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.880
gotcha within a country within two

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.720
countries hold up possibly three

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.280
in iraq also because kurdistan is like a

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.440
washington dc of the middle east

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.679
uh no there's like places like uh where

00:21:35.679 --> 00:21:36.799
khabib's from

00:21:36.799 --> 00:21:38.960
okay dagestan there's like a territory

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.720
dagestan is in russia

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.320
yeah it's almost like it's a state

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.480
that's where the tall russian is at

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.559
fault rocky he was from dagestan was he

00:21:46.559 --> 00:21:48.400
i think so no way maybe i i could be

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.159
wrong drago was muslim

00:21:50.159 --> 00:21:51.919
oh never mind never mind he wasn't mars

00:21:51.919 --> 00:21:54.240
yeah dagger is mother's territory

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.039
so okay so this is the kurd territory

00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:59.360
kurdistan first off that's who

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.440
saddam he lied in his uh his campaign

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.679
he did not love them forever he turned

00:22:05.679 --> 00:22:07.360
on the kurds pretty quick he was gassing

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:07.760
them

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.520
okay so they're like people there are

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.360
people that have always been at war

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.320
with all the other moths okay they're

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.679
they just keep getting attacked

00:22:15.679 --> 00:22:18.159
and they they're like they're kind of

00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:19.200
[ __ ] awesome

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.799
yeah from i don't know i mean i'm sure

00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:22.080
they've done horrific things everybody

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.679
had but like and warzone yeah for

00:22:23.679 --> 00:22:26.240
[ __ ] thousands of years and they're

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.760
like holding their ground just like come

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.799
on [ __ ]

00:22:28.799 --> 00:22:30.799
dude that's funny and that's crazy so we

00:22:30.799 --> 00:22:32.400
we like help them occasionally but

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.919
because

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:36.240
the turks hate them it's hard for us to

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.039
help them

00:22:37.039 --> 00:22:38.640
because then it looks because then it

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.159
complicates our [ __ ] with turkey

00:22:40.159 --> 00:22:42.080
gotcha the kurds are kind of good for

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.760
[ __ ] [ __ ] up in the middle of yeah

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.120
for us but we can't help them too much

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.039
because them and turkey don't get along

00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:49.280
so then when when we got out of syria we

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.480
kind of just left

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.880
the kurds there and it's like all right

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.240
well turkey's definitely gonna [ __ ] him

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.280
up now

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.360
and then trump tweeted he was like if

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.280
turkey does anything bad

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.520
i'll [ __ ] destroy their economy i saw

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.520
him and then he was like in my infinite

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.159
wisdom

00:23:04.159 --> 00:23:06.159
and like he said some [ __ ] like that i

00:23:06.159 --> 00:23:07.360
was like damn

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.120
he's willing he's [ __ ] wilding out

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.720
dude but yeah he was also so he was

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.480
saying don't feel bad the kurds got paid

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.919
he was like the kurds did their job like

00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:15.679
we paid them to fight yes

00:23:15.679 --> 00:23:17.360
he's he's like a roman senator then he's

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.799
just like getting mercenaries and like

00:23:18.799 --> 00:23:20.400
yo they're my boys they're sitting kurds

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.880
are all citizens now some tribe and gaul

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.320
had to fight for him and he was like all

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:24.640
right

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.600
well the war's over see you guys well

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.640
you're leaving us with all the other

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.760
tribes

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.320
you know there's a pile of gold where

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.760
you live now that'll help they're like

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.520
philadelphia comedy hosts they get hired

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.039
like once every six months so they just

00:23:39.039 --> 00:23:39.440
[ __ ]

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.960
eat [ __ ] in the middle of the year

00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:44.880
damn dude yeah so what's going on with

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.799
that is that why they're impeaching them

00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:48.000
why are they no why are they impeaching

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.320
them because they he called turkey

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.720
under like back door deals with like

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.840
ukraine i think

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.440
is what it was i don't know enough about

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.200
yeah but then he's just trying to be

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.820
like uh biden did it too

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.279
[Laughter]

00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:04.240
like okay well he's not the president

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.039
yeah

00:24:05.039 --> 00:24:09.120
i don't know it's also like chances are

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.000
they have a lot to impeach him on

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.679
chances are they do but

00:24:13.679 --> 00:24:15.440
i don't think they can i still don't

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.760
think anybody will get him on anything

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.720
i don't know i don't even know how the

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.039
[ __ ] that works because it's like you'll

00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:23.200
you know you'll hear about obama like he

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.200
spied on u.s citizens did a bunch of

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:25.600
drones

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.679
strike the u.s citizens so it's like

00:24:27.679 --> 00:24:29.120
they're like they got [ __ ] on trump to

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.799
impeach him it's like i don't know maybe

00:24:30.799 --> 00:24:32.320
do they do they not could they not

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.520
i think they can impeach every president

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.720
probably if you looked into their [ __ ]

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.640
you're like uh okay you're done

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.480
yeah so i don't i don't unders when they

think he just slept right through it

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.000
so then it doesn't count if he sleeps if

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:14.559
he sleeps

00:32:14.559 --> 00:32:16.320

00:32:19.039 --> 00:32:20.960
actually have seen the footage it's

00:32:25.279 --> 00:32:26.320
deal struck

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.720
yeah they may have a deal what do you

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.000
think constructed some sort of car what

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.799
do you think about like

00:32:30.799 --> 00:32:32.399
dudes who are married and have sex with

00:32:32.399 --> 00:32:35.440
their wife when their wife's drunk

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.519
what are you doing what do you mean yeah

00:32:39.519 --> 00:32:40.240
what do you mean

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.240
what's the situation here you're at a

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.360
wedding but you're like you know you're

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.240
like you're not supposed to have sex

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.360
with like a drunk woman but if you're

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.039
married and your wife gets drunk

00:32:47.039 --> 00:32:48.159
pretty much everyone's going to have sex

00:32:48.159 --> 00:32:50.159
with their drunk wife yeah no

00:32:50.159 --> 00:32:51.519
she like passed out and you do it

00:32:51.519 --> 00:32:53.039
because i'm passed out not passed out

00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:54.480
then it's weird but like how she's

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.000
hammered how drunk can your wife

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.919
be your girlfriend your girlfriend or

00:32:57.919 --> 00:32:59.519
what if you can't do that

00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:00.960
can be hammered she can be hammered and

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.480
[ __ ] you so what if these two homeless

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.159
guys had a deal we're like look if i

00:33:04.159 --> 00:33:05.600
pass out i pass out

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.559
bro i'm not [ __ ] gay but if i pass

00:33:08.559 --> 00:33:10.480
out and you're jammed up chuck one up me

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.039
just

00:33:11.039 --> 00:33:13.120
promise me you eat my ass first lube it

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.640
up lube it up that's probably why he did

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.679
it to be honest

00:33:15.679 --> 00:33:17.440
really spitting there so he doesn't tear

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.200
his body up i think he saves up his spit

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.720
and this one

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.279
yeah because if you if you rip a butt

00:33:23.279 --> 00:33:24.799
out on the streets you're that's gonna

00:33:24.799 --> 00:33:26.240
disable you for a while

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.159
for sure that's gonna limit how many

00:33:28.159 --> 00:33:29.440
cans you're getting although he has

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.080

00:33:37.679 --> 00:33:40.399
if you have street butt

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.039

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.560
stage it's like it's kind of behind you

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.160
mm-hmm when you're on stage anybody to

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.359

i couldn't see him and he just kept

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.400

testament though

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.800

this show where you go on

00:37:38.079 --> 00:37:39.760
there's three comics and then you pick

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.040
three people out of the audience to be

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.800
your partners for a quiz show

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.320
but the way the show starts is the three

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.400
comics go out first and do stand up

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.560

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.200

throughout the show that it was like

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.440

[Laughter]

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:56.960
dude the um the micro dosing thing has

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:57.440
me

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.920
bugged up oh you microdosed out right

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:00.480

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.640
well it's like no not right now it's it

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.480
was yesterday but it's definitely um

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.440
wait was it

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.119
i don't know maybe i micro dosed out but

00:42:07.119 --> 00:42:08.720
it was dude

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.400
it's starting to take a toll yeah

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.920
because you you uh

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:13.839
truthfully the first because when we do

00:42:13.839 --> 00:42:15.440
this if you know you were like i don't i

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.000
don't

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.920
let's start over yeah i never start over

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.119
you were great i know

00:42:19.119 --> 00:42:20.319
that was a great that was better than

00:42:20.319 --> 00:42:22.160
this episode this really sucks should we

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:22.960
start over

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:26.160
no no this is gone enough

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.440
but uh yeah i could as soon as that

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.319
happened i was like i thought you were

00:42:30.319 --> 00:42:31.119
doing great

00:42:31.119 --> 00:42:33.839
it must be some the black hole opened in

00:42:33.839 --> 00:42:36.160
my mind

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.000
dude you're the joker pretty much man

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.920
it's good to take drugs too right now

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.440
i think that's important for you right

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:43.440
now for me if you're also feeling like

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.880
you could be the joker i think it's

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.319
really important to double down on some

00:42:46.319 --> 00:42:48.960
psychedelics

00:42:49.599 --> 00:42:51.440
yeah well it's funny i've been feeling

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.839
fine i've just been a little bit spaced

00:42:53.839 --> 00:42:54.800
it was weird

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.560
the whole this again the whole program

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.480
was to like take away like

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.040
all of my like little dopamine sources

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.000
and then i just like

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.680
gave myself mushrooms after all that

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.040
when it was it's just a

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.400
yeah it's a weird thing to play with

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.240
because my whole thing now is like

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.359
to try to find good dopamine sorry

00:43:11.359 --> 00:43:12.800
every time you talk about this program

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.319
i'm like oh it's a real thing and then i

00:43:14.319 --> 00:43:15.760
forget that you just made it up

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.640
for sure to take away your dopamine

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.920
anything you like for a month

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.079
and then just take mushrooms at the end

00:43:22.079 --> 00:43:24.240
of that month yeah pretty much

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.520
like every time you bring up the you're

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:26.960
like and then the you know the

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.400
experiment or the system or whatever i'm

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.359
just like oh yeah

00:43:29.359 --> 00:43:31.200
it always takes me one second to be like

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.200
oh this is the thing he made up

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.359
like this isn't a real thing that people

00:43:35.359 --> 00:43:36.319
this is how [ __ ] this is

00:43:36.319 --> 00:43:39.440
true i'm not sure no for sure i need

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.960
your skeptical eye workshop you're my

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:41.610
peer journal

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:56.560
man

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.920
that's i think that's another that's a

00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.839
confounding variable too weird time to

00:43:59.839 --> 00:44:02.000

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:24.160
pretty bleak space i feel like

okay that's that's how [ __ ] serious

00:51:41.839 --> 00:51:43.119

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.920
the ladies love rings dude they love the

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.440
getting married well it's dude it's it's

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:47.760
like

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:50.240
the complete validation exactly total

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:50.960
validation

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:53.599
exactly and i'm telling their the female

00:51:53.599 --> 00:51:54.079
ego

00:51:54.079 --> 00:51:56.319
thrives on exclusion because if you

00:51:56.319 --> 00:51:57.280
think about it male

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.720
males have all that like you know

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:00.079
they'll like dominate and they're like

00:52:00.079 --> 00:52:01.760
physically conquer and stuff

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.040
if you're a chick you're not like going

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:04.720
in like you know beating people up and

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.079
like being like the strongest biggest

00:52:06.079 --> 00:52:07.520
but you can be the most relationally

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:08.319
aggressive

00:52:08.319 --> 00:52:10.160
and the way you hurt someone

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.480
relationally is you exclude them

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.640
so it's like now once someone else gets

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.400
the ring you're part of the excluded

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.119
group it's like

00:52:17.119 --> 00:52:18.400
it's like someone dunking on you

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.760
literally it's like someone dunking on

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:20.720
you nuts in the face

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.319

00:52:22.319 --> 00:52:24.240
shot clock's on like what we oh the shot

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:25.200

00:55:00.799 --> 00:55:03.359
real shot clock of being like if i don't

00:55:03.359 --> 00:55:04.880
do this by now

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:06.720
it's going to become less and less and

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.480
everyone's in their ears dude

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:10.240
it's like the crowd the crowd's chanting

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.839
that they're like five

00:55:11.839 --> 00:55:14.000

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.359
throw up a hail mary you're like [ __ ] i

00:55:15.359 --> 00:55:18.160
married mccuskers

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.520
[ __ ] that guy's soccer sucking what was

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:21.119
funny no the funniest part that actually

00:55:21.119 --> 00:55:22.319
reminds me something that the

00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:23.839
the one person she was talking to was

00:55:23.839 --> 00:55:25.599
basically like yeah well there's like

00:55:25.599 --> 00:55:26.240
you know

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.680
i think i'm gonna go back and give guys

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:29.119
a second chance i didn't really talk to

00:55:29.119 --> 00:55:30.400
before

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.559
of course you are yeah but it's like

00:55:32.559 --> 00:55:34.000
that's getting old babe you're

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.720
using no you're using people to fulfill

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:38.400
some weird thing and then it's like then

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:38.880
what

00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.400
you're gonna have someone pledge their

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.799
life to you to fulfill your

00:55:42.799 --> 00:55:44.400
basically an ego function which again

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:45.599
i'm not you know i'm not hating on them

00:55:45.599 --> 00:55:46.720
because i'm level three

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.240
but it's like think of the poor guy

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.760
that's like oh sweet

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.200
[ __ ] you know who wants to she's back

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:52.960
in my life i knew she [ __ ] liked me

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:53.440
yeah

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:55.599
in the whole while yeah a whole while

00:55:55.599 --> 00:55:57.200
she's like so what are we even doing

00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:57.760
here just

00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:59.280
waiting to get it's like how much of

00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:01.040
that is the [ __ ] scorn

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:02.960
of not the scorn just the anxiety of not

00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:04.720
being accepted into the in group and the

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:06.000
you know the success

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.440
and how much of that is just kind of

00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:09.359
like yeah you know what maybe

00:56:09.359 --> 00:56:12.000
it's just like a weird thing to be like

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.280
yeah the guys that we're into

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:14.720
obviously aren't going to do what i want

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.240
so i'm gonna go down a peg and i could

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.119
probably convince one of these

00:56:17.119 --> 00:56:19.359
[ __ ] to propose to me

00:56:19.359 --> 00:56:20.960
yeah that's the darkness dude i don't

00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:22.400
know if it's even that dark though i

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:23.200
think it's just like

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.160
yeah that's it yeah i mean i'm full of

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:27.040
level three dude

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.799
but then my thing is then if they they

00:56:28.799 --> 00:56:30.319
get the validation you don't think

00:56:30.319 --> 00:56:32.799
they're going to start being like

00:56:32.799 --> 00:56:34.640
oh oh mama bear is going to go back on

00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:36.880
the prowl oh for sure get the validation

00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:38.240
that's how that's how that's always

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.160
that's why women cheat

00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.520
yeah i feel like i mean that's not the

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:43.200
only reason but those types of like a

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:44.880
chick that like

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:47.359
goes down to get somebody to marry them

00:56:47.359 --> 00:56:49.359
is clearly as soon as the i mean as soon

00:56:49.359 --> 00:56:50.640
as the wedding's over

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.640
party's over yeah she's like oh [ __ ] i'm

00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:54.079
stuck with this guy

00:56:54.079 --> 00:56:55.599
i had so much fun the last year like

00:56:55.599 --> 00:56:57.359
planning the wedding being the center of

00:56:57.359 --> 00:56:58.880
all this as soon as the wedding ends

00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:00.319
you're just waking up in bed next to

00:57:00.319 --> 00:57:01.760
some dork in a tux

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:04.160

experience this cut type of bae is

00:57:19.839 --> 00:57:21.920
synonymous with like power hungry psycho

uh like puritan [ __ ] culture

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:25.359
puritanical left yeah i think it's going

01:07:25.359 --> 01:07:26.880
to fizzle i think it's coming to a stop

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:27.440
like

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.760
towards this i mean what i did was

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.359
pretty outrageous compared to what most

01:07:31.359 --> 01:07:32.720
people get canceled for and there are

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.079
still people like he shouldn't be

01:07:34.079 --> 01:07:35.280
[ __ ] canceled

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.799
yeah and you also weren't like you know

01:07:36.799 --> 01:07:38.799
you didn't basically [ __ ] up

01:07:38.799 --> 01:07:40.400
like you stayed in gp you could have

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.079
went pc and you didn't [ __ ] up you

01:07:42.079 --> 01:07:43.359
stayed gp you could not

01:07:43.359 --> 01:07:45.039
[ __ ] up on this i mean i don't i don't

01:07:45.039 --> 01:07:46.480
think people give that enough credit no

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:47.039
one

01:07:47.039 --> 01:07:48.880
that's that hurt them i said listen to

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:50.480
metger he gave me some credit

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.680
well he understands what you're up

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.280
against he heard the story you can hear

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.440
people that have heard the story of

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.280

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.760
chance i would have got crushed no

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.119

going over it and being like this is

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:17.759
what happened on that and they're

01:09:17.759 --> 01:09:19.040
they're like you don't have to do that

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.319
i'm like i want to

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:22.400
like i want to tell you they're like no

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:23.440
it's okay i don't care

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:26.000
i'm like yeah i i care yeah like i'm

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.600
telling i'm going out of my way to just

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.279
be like yeah i got [ __ ] on this clip

01:09:29.279 --> 01:09:30.880
this is what i actually meant

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:33.279
and they're like no it's okay it's just

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:34.960
[ __ ] again dude i'm telling you they

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:35.920
are for real

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:39.440
trying to stifle and it sounds so

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:41.600
[ __ ] annoying but it's like

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.199
unfettered free speech

01:09:43.199 --> 01:09:45.040
which is like and i don't i think you're

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.799
still not you're not allowed to like

01:09:46.799 --> 01:09:48.159
walk up to someone and harass them by

01:09:48.159 --> 01:09:49.520
throwing slurs at them

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.359
yeah like no one's defending that no and

01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:52.560
you're not allowed like free speech

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:53.520
doesn't allow you to do that because

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:54.560
that's harassment you're not allowed to

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.040
do that

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:57.840
yeah and it is such a dumb argument but

01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.280
my thing is if you

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:00.640
start at a certain point they're going

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:02.400
to keep [ __ ]

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.560
chiseling down like oh yeah and they

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.560
will keep chiseling that down

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:08.880
sure but they do have arguments against

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:09.760
that

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:13.520
of course about that like

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:14.960
yeah i agree with that but you either

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.800
can have it or you don't

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.159
yeah because that's it's like nobody

01:10:18.159 --> 01:10:20.320
just like one day

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.480
that's the thing where it's like where

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:23.840
if somebody says something that's

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:24.880
offensive

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:26.880
if you decide that it's offensive if you

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:29.360
watch or listen to this podcast

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:30.960
and are like you know what i don't think

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.640
those guys are trying to be funny

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:35.360
i think this is real yeah which how

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:35.920
[ __ ]

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:38.159
dumb do you have to be to listen to you

01:10:38.159 --> 01:10:39.520
and me and be like yeah

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:41.280
i think they're serious but do you have

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:42.800
to also want they probably want that

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.320
dude we're just twisted jokers

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.159
twisted jokers but if you want if you

01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:47.760
wanted that to be the case it's super

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:48.640
easy to convince you

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:49.760
yeah i mean that's what we're doing in

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:50.960
the podcast we're pretending we're

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:51.679

01:10:55.199 --> 01:10:57.840
it's like yeah if you want to listen to

01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.360

01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:59.440
doing comedy and anything in this

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:01.360
[ __ ] corny ass entertainment industry

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:02.880

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.400
oddities dude

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.719
that'll be nuts it'll be fun as [ __ ]

01:17:26.719 --> 01:17:28.400
they're writing about it already

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:30.320
who the press dude they're already

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:31.679
writing about the show what they're

01:17:31.679 --> 01:17:32.640
saying that they're you're going to be

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:33.199
in philly

01:17:33.199 --> 01:17:35.840
yeah what the [ __ ] what's the problem

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:36.320
dude

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:39.280
i don't know it helps for sure it helps

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:42.080
why why are they so obsessed

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:43.120
i don't know i guess because they're

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:44.159
following you because you didn't give a

01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:46.239
good enough apology

01:17:46.239 --> 01:17:48.239
yeah i think they i think people like it

01:17:48.239 --> 01:17:49.440
some people

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:52.080
you mean the press yeah that's oh yeah

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.760
absolutely i do i think there's certain

01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:54.880
yeah i think they're following me for

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:56.719
that yeah i think they'll be done after

01:17:56.719 --> 01:17:57.040
this

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.520
but then again i said that last year

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:00.719
keep saying every week i'm like all

01:18:00.719 --> 01:18:02.000
right that's gotta be it it's just weird

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.600
too because news is so hyper focused

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:04.800
anymore because there's like the google

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:05.600
searches that like

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.840
it can be going on and on and it like it

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:08.640
won't pop up

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:11.040
well the story of cancel culture is big

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:12.960
right now true and so that's why they

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:14.719
keep using me

01:18:14.719 --> 01:18:16.480
true yeah you are [ __ ] the jesus

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.400
christ i was martyred

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:20.239
you kind of were dude i was martyred for

01:18:20.239 --> 01:18:22.000
the art dude pretty much where and then

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.080
my own disciples and [ __ ]

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:26.800
companions turned on me yeah they denied

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:27.360
me

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:29.520
that's true they denied the podcast was

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:31.199
funny three times

01:18:31.199 --> 01:18:32.960
no i didn't think it was funny like what

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:35.120
if i do what if i don't

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:37.360
forgive me then me and the gods are up

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:38.560
on the mountains dude just

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:39.840
i just don't know why everyone has to be

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.920
like a i don't know why well it's also

01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:43.360
too if you're doing stand-up for a while

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:46.159
and you know ticket sale starts slowing

01:18:46.159 --> 01:18:46.640
up it

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.840
you it's never you're never really

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.520
secure you're just always worried that

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.199
your shit's about to fizzle out

01:18:51.199 --> 01:18:54.320
yeah so it's like it's either that or

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.080
your [ __ ] is going well you're selling

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:57.840
out theaters and [ __ ] so you're like

01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:00.239

01:19:00.239 --> 01:19:01.600
you sure you're good at

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.159
yeah or you get a little nudge by

01:19:04.159 --> 01:19:05.199
someone who is

01:19:05.199 --> 01:19:07.840
yeah something like that i don't know

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:08.480
hey

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:09.679
hey i'm not saying nothing i'm not

01:19:09.679 --> 01:19:10.960
saying nothing i hear you i'm not saying

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:11.600
nothing there

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:14.719
i hear you bro come on bro dude i am

01:19:14.719 --> 01:19:17.440

happened to me the other day

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:21.040

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.239

01:19:22.239 --> 01:19:25.600
memory yeah so like what

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.120
so all right i think i can understand

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:28.560
what that is so say you're drunk right

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:29.760
and then and then you can

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:31.679
access the memory from the mood yes

01:19:31.679 --> 01:19:33.040
exactly so

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.040
i'm [ __ ] i take a nap on the couch i'm

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.239
