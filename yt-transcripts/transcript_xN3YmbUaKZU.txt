00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.360
political videos to get fired up

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.560
i should probably do some research

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.879
it's no fun yeah it's a little it's so

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.319

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.599
watch

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.319
to make it okay what's gonna happen well

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.760
it's it's funny too because like i do

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.519
these shows and then like if you say

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.239
like a political fact like hat you know

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.120
half my fans

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.640
are trump guys half are not

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.160
and then people will be like shut the

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.680
[ __ ] up like no matter what you say

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.479
people are like

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.239
you don't know [ __ ] it's like all right

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.560
i'm not i'm out oh yeah as soon as you

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.320
you pick one side online you're gonna

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.400
get eaten alive no matter what

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.680
yeah so i'm gonna i'm just gonna try to

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.400
make my friend

my friends fight on the show tonight oh

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.960
i think that'll be pretty easy to do

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.520
yeah because two of them these guys war

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.360
mode are very

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.840
they're excited for donald trump sure

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.479
and then

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.680
a lot of my friends are not excited

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.360
so it should be very easy to make them

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.960
fight yeah

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.479
i think it's gonna be a pretty fun show

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.880
philly tonight yeah it's gonna be good

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.040

[Laughter]

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.679

other night like i never get to do that

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.760
oh really like la really isn't doing

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.880
outdoor stuff

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.360
no not really no not like this new york

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.600
has just beat in that regard

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.880
really because it's like that's why i

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.159
thought l.a would have hopped on an

00:24:48.159 --> 00:24:50.240
outdoor dining much faster because

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.000
there's so many restaurants in la that

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.440
have outdoor dining

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.039
they just started getting like we're

00:24:55.039 --> 00:24:57.200
just behind i think la's a little bit

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:57.600
more

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.240
afraid than new york like new york you

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.159
guys are already so close together that

00:25:02.159 --> 00:25:03.360
you're like well we just

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.760
have to deal with this where l.a people

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.520
got more reclusive and they're like

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.760
i don't wanna right

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.200
but you guys were like we're already

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.120
close like let's just figure this out

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.039
you know what i mean well also in the

00:25:17.039 --> 00:25:18.960
restaurants here have a union so they

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.520
were like

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.559
we're only going to do this [ __ ] for so

00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:23.440
long

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.279
yeah before y'all don't think like if

00:25:25.279 --> 00:25:26.559
y'all figure this out we're going to be

00:25:26.559 --> 00:25:27.200
mad

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.159
i don't know what they would have done

00:25:28.159 --> 00:25:31.679
be more closed i don't know

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.039
oh but y'all like opened up a little bit

00:25:35.039 --> 00:25:36.559
over the summer right

00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:39.279
a little bit yeah we started to like

00:25:39.279 --> 00:25:39.679
what

00:25:39.679 --> 00:25:41.679
uh there's like outdoor like in in the

00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:43.360
valley and stuff is open and way more

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.799
they'll block off the streets and they

00:25:44.799 --> 00:25:46.559
put all the tables in the streets

00:25:46.559 --> 00:25:49.039
right it's like a different yeah that's

00:25:49.039 --> 00:25:51.600
what they have to do here because like

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.960
they didn't do outdoor dining here

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.159
because who would want to eat when there

00:25:54.159 --> 00:25:55.760
was a million people walking up down the

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.880

i mean that would be a lot of

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.159
that'd be a lot of judgment from people

00:26:14.159 --> 00:26:16.000
if they found out like you're doing

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.760

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.039
