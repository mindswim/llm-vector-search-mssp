how many days was that wasn't that a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.840
specific new idea it was a bunch of days

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.360
four hundred i don't know

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.120
whatever it was i was told like pretty

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.239
much day one or two into reagan

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.399
they [ __ ] they were like now more no

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.760
so reagan

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.160
got to take credit for the carter more

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.280
than anything wanted to free the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.280
hostages before

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.320
he left office and he actually did that

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.320
he was up all night for several nights

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.159
he was haggard there's a great story

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.000
about the day of inaugura reagan's

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
inauguration that carter went to um get

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.880
him they that's the the the tradition

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.479
is the sitting president goes and

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.640
collects the new president and takes him

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.600
escorts him so the story was that he

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.479
went

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:27.520
to

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.759
uh reagan's hotel room where he was

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.960
staying and ho and him and nancy were

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.560
um reagan was putting on his tie and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.079
nancy was getting dressed and it was

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:37.920
like [ __ ] smell in the room

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.000
oh

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
i remember reading this somewhere which

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
you have to the carter yeah the carter

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.600
was like they wow they [ __ ] they're like

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.840
innocent things like sex in here yeah

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.479
[ __ ] [ __ ] these freaks yeah they just

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:51.840
they power

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.680
all over her horny from the power yeah

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.360
she just assumed he gave her another

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.079
pearl necklace yes and uh

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.520
so that was the thing he was the thing

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.799
coming out with nancy was good at giving

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.960
head yeah recently i don't know what

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.399
that was

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.280
nancy look into it

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.560
frank sinatra says that he a very

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.120
important secret to singing

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.520
is that you eat an apple and you wait an

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.680
hour and then you throw it up

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.040
because it creates a gravel in your

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.040
throat it gives you texture he learned

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.120
this from nancy reagan it's only one way

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.360
that a woman would learn this trick is

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.040
because she's [ __ ] bulimic one day

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.879
she ate an apple she threw up and then

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.640
she's like i sound great

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.000
so the next time she worked with sinatra

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.519
she's like you know you should do frank

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.000
yeah and she spread it it's like a trick

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.080
of the trade that was nancy reagan she

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.040
probably did it with [ __ ] too i don't

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.360
know yeah i think she did it with [ __ ]

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.879
these people are all dead so it's fine

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.000
yeah but so

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.680
nancy

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.160
and ron this was jimmy had this jimmy

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.040
carter had this in his unsleeping

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.360
had this little observation

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.080
that

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.160
reagan was grumpy on the inauguration

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.760
didn't feel like doing it and that they

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.200
had just [ __ ] and then they all got in

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.640
the limo together

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.280
and jimmy got the news that the hostages

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.080
were being freed but reagan got to

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.680
announce it

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.680
so ronald reagan is yeah it's funny i

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.040
get all these legends from my republican

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.080
family

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.519
so like i'll tell you what those that

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.200
[ __ ] carter couldn't get it done day

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.560
one of reagan

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.440
those that's right those muslims knew

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.440
yeah you don't [ __ ] with the republicans

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.440
that's right

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.080
so reagan and i heard this my legend so

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.840
who knows which one's real

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.920
uh but reagan was uh fascinating

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.239
president two terms

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.519
um

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.159
there was uh oh i got one did nixon did

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:42.400
nixon start the war on drugs

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.319
i think it was nixon i know

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.560
reagan was huge on it yes he nancy

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.879
reagan said just say no yeah which was

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.720
hated because people were addicted to

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.360
drugs yeah uh also aids started with

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.360
reagan and reagan i mean he's he was the

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.799

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.840
i think i got aids from so reagan uh

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.159
he was uh there's a piece of footage of

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.519
reagan there's a documentary about

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.359
huckleberry finn

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.000
and it's about how it gets banned

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.240
and then rebought re-found and banned

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.560
throughout history huckleberry finn

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.120
has been banned by liberals who don't

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.160
like the n-word and then um

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.320
conservatives who don't like whatever

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.160
they have yeah it just keeps going back

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.680
and forth

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.199
um

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.560
and mark twain to some quote where mark

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.720
twain said uh i knew when i created huck

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.240
he'd get in trouble his whole damn life

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.600
like his he knew that this was going to

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.560
happen

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.960
okay so there's a character in the in

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.479

just [ __ ] hated them so much i gotta

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:07.120
be honest i i i think i would have too

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.319

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:10.080
mean george harrison hated hippies yeah

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.360
george's hair is george harrison there's

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.639
an interview with him

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.080
where he went to haight ashbury he's

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.280
like i heard they're all and he was like

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.800
they were just disgusting drug addicts

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.400
so yes hippies are gross

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.919
they always were um

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.600
so reagan

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.960
ray i mean it's so much about ringing

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.360
for [ __ ] sake two terms and

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.759
um george bush was his vice president

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.120

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.440
an obsession

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.360
with bringing down the proliferation of

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.599
nuclear weapons it was something that he

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:56.800
cared about

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.919
and so they had a treaty they had a shot

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.280

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.200
up my my mom hated ronald reagan hated

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.839
him since the 70s and she saw him coming

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:01.600
he there was a thing about reagan that

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.959
was like trump for for democrats

00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:06.240
which was

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.720
it was like it's a nightmare scenario

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.640
reagan is a nightmare scenario it's the

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.080
end of all things he is the worst guy in

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.080
the world and they had connections

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.240
between him and white supremacy like a

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.320
bunch of them like the place he gave his

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.560
first speech as a candidate yeah is a

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.399
famous horrible that's where the

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:26.399
students were were missing

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.839
yeah it was like in that it was like

00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:29.920
he's standing on their [ __ ] car that

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.320
they took out of the mud not that but

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.240
you know he was there so a lot of people

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.920
made connections with that [ __ ] but

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.240
people hated ronald reagan before he was

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.240
president when he won i remember my mom

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.399
being deeply disturbed by it

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:44.160
and um

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.760
and so there was this feeling he's not a

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.519
good guy we have a bad president

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:48.959
from some people's point of view and

00:09:48.959 --> 00:09:51.200
then other people you were very aware

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.080
yeah [ __ ] loved the guy

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.880
i mean so much and the his the mask the

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.160
rubber mask of him what became a thing

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.800
and uh snl was making fun of him and all

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.120
this stuff but um there were these

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.040
people that just absolutely

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.680
they loved reagan without any reason

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.760
without any and some people were on his

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.360
side all kinds of stuff but there's a

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.959
lot of democrats who just couldn't stand

00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:16.839

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.160
him jim that he had there's these are

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.199
the legends he had uh

00:14:31.199 --> 00:14:34.320
dinner at george bush's house

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.320
uh apparently like a couple of weeks

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.120
before he shot the president no

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.199
look up john hinckley and the bush

00:14:41.199 --> 00:14:42.399
family

00:14:42.399 --> 00:14:44.880
their families were linked

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.959
the hinckleys i think gave money to the

00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:48.240
bushes or something like that but

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.399
apparently hinckley was a guest in a

00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:52.959
bush house

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:56.079
an alarmingly short amount of time

00:14:56.079 --> 00:14:59.199
uh before he shot president reagan

00:14:59.199 --> 00:15:00.720
and

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.720
a very interesting thing about it is

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.399
that george bush

00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:07.440
was where when he was when reagan was

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.199
shot you know where george bush was

00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:11.199
when reagan was shot in texas

00:15:11.199 --> 00:15:13.440
he was in texas this thing about wasn't

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.040
he in dallas when kevin

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.519
shot that's what folks say and he was it

00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:20.399
like texas is this place to like

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:22.800
like it it feels like

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.839
he was

00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:25.519
he was skull and bones

00:15:25.519 --> 00:15:27.040
but oh yeah skull and bones very big

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.279
george bush and we'll get to him but

00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:31.279
george bush uh

00:15:31.279 --> 00:15:35.199
was a power nerd and he was a guy who

00:15:35.199 --> 00:15:36.639
really hated

00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:38.560
the shooter's father john hinckley

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.680
senior was friends with george h.w bush

reagan

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.600
and maybe take you know have an effect

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.760
on his life i mean what are you you know

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.919
anyway so yeah so so hinckley was like i

00:17:35.919 --> 00:17:37.280
don't know why you're talking about

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.880
talking about that but uh i i know what

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.840
you're saying

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.240
and so then he went to his bedroom and

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.520
he looked in the drawer and he found a

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.039
guy he's like where's this gun coming i

00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:46.559
left something for you i left you a

00:17:46.559 --> 00:17:48.080
little something

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.000
you know what you have to do son yeah so

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.280
if you're the vice president and you

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.520
have anything to do

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.000
with the president being shot

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.039
you need to be in texas because

00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:03.440
if if there's any sort of like

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.360
where we have word that vice president

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.120
whatever and then the governor of texas

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.799
is like we're not extraditing like the

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:11.120
one place he might be able to hold up

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.720
and maybe even stage a coup from he's

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.960
like no we're the republic of texas now

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.240
like it could work so bush is in texas

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.799
and he refuses to come to washington it

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:23.039
was a big deal because he just should

00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:25.200
have taken and taken over but he refuses

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.360
to come to washington he's like i'm not

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.799
going i'm not going to show up in the

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:30.240
white house while the gipper's fighting

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.080
for his life he had big statements about

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:32.799
it

00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:35.600
but he stayed away he stayed and it got

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.919
really chaotic as we all know

00:18:37.919 --> 00:18:39.520
there's a great movie how long was

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.280
reagan out

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.640
um

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.520
i think a few days but nancy so there's

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.640
an amazing movie made by hbo called the

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.559
day the president was shot richard

00:18:50.559 --> 00:18:53.600
crenna plays reagan and richard dreyfuss

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.160
plays alexander hague and it's like a

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.480
comedy in a way but

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.559
anyway um

00:19:00.559 --> 00:19:03.360
when nixon was in the in the uh i mean

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.120
when reagan you know reagan they drove

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.320
him to george

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.919
there's a hospital that's for the

00:19:07.919 --> 00:19:08.880
president

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.960
first of all the cottage the white house

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.799
they have a emergency room they have

00:19:12.799 --> 00:19:14.799
everything there but he was bleeding he

00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:17.120
was spitting blood

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.039
so uh

00:19:19.039 --> 00:19:20.880
and he yeah

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.840
he got him he [ __ ] shot him in the

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.440
armpit she pressed into the liver shot

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.679
him and then he and then he thought his

00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:29.760
bodyguard jumped on him and then he said

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.600
i think he broke my rib he that's what

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.440
he thought happened he said i think he

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.200
broke my ribs so they so they they're

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.400
gonna go back to the white house to get

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.799
him looked at but then uh then he

00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:41.200
started spinning lots of blood

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.039
and so they went straight to george

00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:45.360
washington hospital which was just a

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.240
[ __ ]

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.080

screeches up and they brought a gurney

00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:54.400

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.240
yeah and this great this there's a move

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.440
this movie the best part is showing him

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.720
hello

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.720

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.919
charming devil yes

00:20:45.919 --> 00:20:48.960
the the doctors right before anesthesia

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.640
they showed mr they had to tell him he

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.280

and it was an exploding bullet

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.120
so the doctors were all in danger

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.080
hinckley didn't exploding what and it

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.679

that you guys are republicans

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.880
and the doctor who was not a republican

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.919

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.080
the white house has alexander hague

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.919
saying i'm i'm in charge here at the

00:21:43.919 --> 00:21:45.919
white house i'm i'm he was the secretary

00:21:45.919 --> 00:21:47.679
of state he had no business saying that

00:21:47.679 --> 00:21:50.240
he was like by the he made up this thing

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.320
by the success laws of succession i

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.000
would be next it's like no no you're

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.039
like 20th down

00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:58.720
and meanwhile at

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.360
though at the hospital nancy's there

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.440
with the chief of staff and there was a

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.520
battle between the white house and the

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.360
guys at the hospital

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.159
so they needed to prove that reagan was

00:22:10.159 --> 00:22:12.559
functioning as a president so they

00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:15.120
needed a photograph and they needed him

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.039
to do a piece of business

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:19.760
so they had a uh the dairy bill some

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.679
bill that's like for dairy subsidies

00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:23.360
that needed to be signed jackpot for

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.159
those guys yes

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:32.750
[Laughter]

00:22:38.559 --> 00:22:40.799
for another 15 cents on a [ __ ] carton

00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:42.640
of milk

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.799
so

00:22:44.799 --> 00:22:47.280
nancy got enlisted and they said you

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.360
need to do this and you need to handle

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.000
them like you handled them in the movies

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.600
and so she put makeup on his face and

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.760
she like slaps ron you gotta wake up and

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.280
they have and they leaned his bed up

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.200
like this and she just kept trying to

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.480
wake him up and this is all in the movie

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.720
done very well but it's true and they

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.760
took a picture of him like

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.960
like a really weird picture that i think

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.120
did more harm than good

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.120
and then he signed that he said he looks

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.400
great yeah he signed the dairy bill

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.400
it's a great pick one great picture is

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.880
very rare to find of reagan he had like

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.799
he had many operations he was a very

00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:24.559
sick and dying old man yeah

00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:27.280
he had some brain like something taken

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.520
off his brain or something so he had had

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.159
his half of his head was shaved

00:23:32.159 --> 00:23:33.840
and it won't and he was coming out of

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.440
the airplane and he had a baseball cap

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.760
on and he went like like i don't know

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.480
and nancy's going don't like she's like

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.480
horrified and because he thought it was

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.039
funny half his head is shape it's creepy

00:23:45.039 --> 00:23:46.960
i i saw that picture once i never saw it

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.240
again

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.279
uh so anyway reagan survived obviously

00:23:51.279 --> 00:23:53.600
and then that just was a massive lift

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.520
yeah i was a kid and my mother hated

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.200
reagan and i was just like yeah hey good

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.880

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:16.840
they were

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.640
uh

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.640
using there were still some hostages in

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.159
iran

00:24:22.159 --> 00:24:23.840
and they were

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.279
offering the iranians weapons

00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:29.600
in exchange for hostages

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.600
and money

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.760
and then they were gonna use the money

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.170
to

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:35.279
[Music]

00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:37.039
uh fund the

00:24:37.039 --> 00:24:39.039
contras

00:24:39.039 --> 00:24:42.240
and um in el salvador yeah

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.120
and it was all done by this guy oliver

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.679
north north yeah i'll colonel oliver

00:24:47.679 --> 00:24:50.000
north it was reagan it was dirty it was

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.679
a dirty reagan thing and reagan said i

00:24:53.679 --> 00:24:55.360
take responsibility for it because i'm

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.880
not sure what i remember that i was told

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.360
about this and we're looking into it but

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.600
make no mistake it's my responsibility

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.000
very nobody does that anymore yeah so he

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.320
did that and that kind of got him

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.520
through it

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.760
and it made people believe that he was

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.200
really looking into it and then they

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.919
pinned it all on this guy who i remember

00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:15.600
his hearings was a big it was the

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.400
biggest deal since since watergate

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.919
i ran contra gate that's what they was

00:25:19.919 --> 00:25:21.200
first thing that they gave that they

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.279
said gate about

00:25:23.279 --> 00:25:24.799
and

00:25:24.799 --> 00:25:26.000
um

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.960
oliver north was he said dumb thing that

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.120
he said somebody pitched the somebody

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.840
pitched this idea to me of the missiles

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.960
and then yeah

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.440
and he said i thought it was a neat idea

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.960
and when everybody heard him say that

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.520
they it became plausible

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.919
that this [ __ ] dummy did he just was

00:25:43.919 --> 00:25:46.480
stupid and crazy and he did it

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.480
he later ran for governor of virginia as

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.840
a republican

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.080
might be west virginia i'm sorry but

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.600
chuck todd who was the that lieutenant

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.279
that sent the tape to

00:25:59.279 --> 00:26:00.559
yeah

00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:02.799
lyndon johnson's son-in-law who was

00:26:02.799 --> 00:26:04.559
thought to be the next great he was

00:26:04.559 --> 00:26:06.240
supposed to be the next kennedy but he

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.279
had a bad coke habit but but he was cool

00:26:09.279 --> 00:26:11.440
enough to be a senator he was senator

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.200
from i think west virginia for years

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.360
and he just didn't care anymore so

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.520
there's another great documentary about

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.919
called the perfect candidate and it's a

00:26:21.919 --> 00:26:23.440
really great

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.440
um it's a documentary about him running

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.120
against oliver north

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.640
decided after all this [ __ ] it happened

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.919
he's gonna run

00:26:29.919 --> 00:26:31.440

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.559
presidential politics that's why i'm

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:34.480

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:38.320
and the doctor comes up and he says uh

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.799
he says mr president i got an issue he

00:29:40.799 --> 00:29:43.679
says some of us think

00:29:43.679 --> 00:29:45.679
that you might be losing your mental

00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:47.520
capacities and

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.279
right now you're okay

00:29:49.279 --> 00:29:51.120
but you're declining

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.600
and i need to know what to do

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.919
if i perceive that because i can't talk

00:29:55.919 --> 00:29:58.320
to you once you lose your mind yeah we

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.640

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.240
maybe in a year or so i won't be able to

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.200
have this conversation with you because

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.600
you won't be cognizant so while you're

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.679

00:30:07.679 --> 00:30:09.600
ask i need instructions from you what do

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.919
i do when i believe that you've

00:30:11.919 --> 00:30:13.679
left the earth

00:30:13.679 --> 00:30:15.279
and reagan just took it as a piece of

00:30:15.279 --> 00:30:16.720
business took off his leather gloves and

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.240
he said well

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.240
uh speak to nancy

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:24.320
and speak to the chief of staff

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.760
and uh

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:26.480
the

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.559
the head democrat that speaker however

00:30:28.559 --> 00:30:30.480
is the number one democrat get them in a

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.440
room

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.159
and make a committee and tell them

00:30:34.159 --> 00:30:36.480
i'll do whatever they say

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.679
and so

00:30:37.679 --> 00:30:40.080
that didn't end up happening yeah the

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.480
the second time he won the presidency

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.880
was a moment for me too as a kid

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.640
because he won and it was just

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.960
every time a president wanted nixon you

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.720
know this whole thing and

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.760
and then when reagan won the second time

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.519
they he didn't he wasn't with balloons

00:30:59.519 --> 00:31:01.679
he was in a hotel room footage you can

00:31:01.679 --> 00:31:04.159
find of him and they cut to all these

00:31:04.159 --> 00:31:06.720
republicans cheering and they cut to him

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.559
and nancy on a couch

00:31:08.559 --> 00:31:10.799
watching on a tv holding hands and they

00:31:10.799 --> 00:31:12.640
look really upset

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.000
they're just sitting there and he's

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.679
literally going like this and it was

00:31:15.679 --> 00:31:18.399
this it may have been performative

00:31:18.399 --> 00:31:20.640
but the signal was i got it i have to do

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.640
it it's my duty but i'm an old i don't

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.000
want to do it

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
this is a grave

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.600
responsibility

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.159
he took it seriously and he was frowning

00:31:30.159 --> 00:31:32.159
when he when he learned that he won that

00:31:32.159 --> 00:31:34.399
was a that was a big character moment

00:31:34.399 --> 00:31:35.279
yeah

00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:37.840
by an actor of course but

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.159
nonetheless it was a big deal a lot of

00:31:40.159 --> 00:31:41.840
it's a lot of it's acting a lot of these

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.760
guys yes

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:47.120
and that's uh that's reagan

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.159
and then bush ran against mike dukakis

00:31:50.159 --> 00:31:51.919
this is where i'm starting to become

00:31:51.919 --> 00:31:54.640
somewhat cognizant i'm starting to okay

00:32:19.279 --> 00:32:22.000
change a sea change yeah because bush so

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.679

30s mid late 30s by rockefeller and um

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:43.359

side of one of them with a big you know

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.599
wheel it's some release valve

00:39:47.599 --> 00:39:48.720

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.400
it's a not a swastika

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.960

in this building is nazi steel

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.119
it's all german that was the flag it

00:40:07.119 --> 00:40:08.960
wasn't a political flag like it was a

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.400
political show but it was also just the

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.319
flag of jerusalem yeah yeah yeah so if

00:40:12.319 --> 00:40:14.480
you bought german steel it was like made

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.079
in usa yeah you're not gonna it had a

00:40:16.079 --> 00:40:17.839
building swastika on it and they bought

00:40:17.839 --> 00:40:20.319
it and all he said all of the steel in

00:40:20.319 --> 00:40:22.960
30 rock has swastikas on it but they at

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.040
one point they turn them into the

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.440
corners but they can't turn these the

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.800
spigots

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.800
so every time i used to go to the thirty

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.359
rock when i hosted snl i would take

00:40:33.359 --> 00:40:34.800
anybody who didn't know about it and

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.319

00:40:36.319 --> 00:40:38.400
there they had shaved it then somebody

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.240
got in there with a thing and shaved it

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.119
down

00:40:41.119 --> 00:40:42.960
holy [ __ ] but so that's how [ __ ] up so

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.280
that's prescott bush was one of the guys

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.520

skull bones skull bones but he was a

00:40:53.839 --> 00:40:55.839
kind of a nixony thing where i think he

00:40:55.839 --> 00:40:57.040
went too far

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.280
he got reagan shot he just went through

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.839

yeah he was supposed to run he was

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.319
supposed to win this is when i started

00:41:06.319 --> 00:41:08.400
to believe in this country

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.560
was when clinton ran for president

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.680
because

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.720

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.680
how dug in reagan

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:20.240

was his real dad

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.359

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.760
but then there was this feeling that it

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.920
was a kind of a circus and i remember

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.400

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.359
me that was the moment where everybody

00:44:39.359 --> 00:44:40.880
was like who gives a who gives a [ __ ]

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.240

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.560
hillary stood by him we did the

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.720
interview with him and uh

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:50.400
with uh uh barbara walters a light fell

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:54.000
from the from the grid and crashed on

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.960
the floor right next to them and the

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.520
clintons hugged and they were both

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.359
crying so it was like they're under a

00:45:01.359 --> 00:45:02.960
lot of stress and they almost one of

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.720
them died and it was a and barbara

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.400
walters saw this and told everyone the

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.480
story and so it was like everybody

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.880
started to love bill clinton same as

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:13.440
same as oliver north

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.440
you're looking at the clinton body count

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.880
what's that how many people they've

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.319
killed oh you mean foster the guy yeah

00:45:20.319 --> 00:45:21.599
didn't he shoot himself twice there's a

00:45:21.599 --> 00:45:23.040
bunch of guys who shot themselves twice

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.240
in the head and stuff like that i don't

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:25.599
know but they were the only ones dick

00:45:25.599 --> 00:45:27.359
cheney shot a guy in the face

00:45:27.359 --> 00:45:29.200
yeah but that was fun he was having fun

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:32.160
i know i'll tell you about that but so

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.160
so clinton made me feel like i can't

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.920
believe this they just got rid of the

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.000

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.240
got they really i like in my lifetime

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:43.200
that didn't exist the idea of that so i

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.119
was pretty [ __ ] impressed

00:45:45.119 --> 00:45:47.440
um likewise with obama later but so that

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.880
made me think you know maybe this is

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.720
actually something kind of you know and

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.560
then later you learned that clinton and

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.240
gore together

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.599

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.680
when he was governor he literally just

into like

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.640

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:55.760
be a nightmare and i remember i

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.119
here's what i hated about because i

00:52:57.119 --> 00:53:00.240
didn't i wasn't predisposed to hate bush

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.440
because i heard he was like a

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:03.040
compassionate conservative that was the

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:04.880
word on bush yeah compassionate

00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:06.480
conservative

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.559
and i could read on him that he was a

00:53:08.559 --> 00:53:10.079
kid of might he was like of my

00:53:10.079 --> 00:53:12.400
generation or just above that he was a

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:13.359
post

00:53:13.359 --> 00:53:15.200
summer of love guy

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:16.000
like

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.680
you know clinton loved saying that he

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:20.720
had what was her name malin albright

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:23.280
and uh but bush had black people and

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.680
women in his cabinet as a matter of like

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.440
he's like why wouldn't yeah like for

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:30.400
bush it wasn't it stopped the bigotry of

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:31.920
the republican party and by the

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:34.000
democrats tons of it also

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.760
stopped at because clinton was like you

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.200
gotta have a couple of [ __ ] in there

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.960
otherwise people get mad you know and

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:40.319
the gal you know the gals are good you

00:53:40.319 --> 00:53:43.040
know not a bad thing it helps you but

00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:44.960
bush was like condoleez rice is [ __ ]

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:47.280
amazing she's gonna run everything colin

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.640
powell

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:51.280
um so i liked bush in that sense

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:53.200
but i remember he gave

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.359
he was interviewed about uh foreign

00:53:55.359 --> 00:53:56.800
policy

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:57.680
and

00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.920
he just sounded like a [ __ ] idiot he

00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.880
didn't know anything he knew nothing

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.240
and then

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:07.200
he took a day and crammed

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.880
and did it again

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:10.079
and then they were like what about north

00:54:10.079 --> 00:54:11.680
korea and he goes okay so north korea

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:14.160
yeah he got uh kim il-jun and and and

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:16.079
then in the south it was and he just

00:54:16.079 --> 00:54:18.000
answered like that like real quick

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.920
canned answers and i remember they cut

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:20.640
to

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.640
like wolf blitzer and he was like well

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.240
that's really impressive clearly he

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:26.240
doesn't know about foreign policy and i

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:29.839
was like are you [ __ ] kidding me

00:54:30.559 --> 00:54:33.520
so bush was president september 11th

00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:35.119
you know that was the first president i

00:54:35.119 --> 00:54:38.319
remember all the kids my age hated bush

00:54:38.319 --> 00:54:40.559
so then i liked him i get that all the

00:54:40.559 --> 00:54:43.200
kids were like he's evil he's gonna ruin

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.960
the country and i was like dude he's

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:45.920
awesome

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:47.920
it just made me like him there was a

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.079
woman who made a documentary about

00:54:50.079 --> 00:54:51.520
riding the bus with him she was one of

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:52.880
his press people and she brought a

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:55.359
camera and i forget what it's called or

00:54:55.359 --> 00:54:57.280
what her name is but she was kind of a

00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.920
kind of a ooh gee whiz lenny rife

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.240
install

00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.200
um

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:06.720
but there's a moment in it where she

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.240
took a pulse she was like kind of a

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.839
goofball and she was with the press

00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:10.640
corps

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:13.520
on his plane and she went around and

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.040
asked everybody

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.040
um who do you think is going to win and

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:18.960
the press all said mckayla was in the

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:21.680
primaries so mccain was starting to lead

00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:24.240
and so she

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.400
it leaked through her

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:27.839
someone leaked that she because she was

00:55:27.839 --> 00:55:30.079
just doing it privately for fun someone

00:55:30.079 --> 00:55:31.920
leaked it that

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:34.160
um that his press corps thought he was

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:37.119
gonna lose and it was really damaging

00:55:37.119 --> 00:55:39.040
and everyone threw her under the bus

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:40.799
everybody in the press said it was her

00:55:40.799 --> 00:55:42.079
we didn't do it and then nobody would

00:55:42.079 --> 00:55:43.200
talk to her

00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:44.880
so while they were on the plane and this

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:46.960
is i think on film on the thing she's

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:49.760
sitting there just devastated and bush

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:52.319
comes which he never did back and he

00:55:52.319 --> 00:55:54.160
sits right next to her

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:56.079
and he says uh i want you to take a good

00:55:56.079 --> 00:55:58.079
look around at these people because now

00:55:58.079 --> 00:56:00.240
you know who they really are he said now

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.079
you know who your friends are now you

00:56:02.079 --> 00:56:03.760
know who they're not so don't forget

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:06.160
this moment because this this is really

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:07.040
just

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:08.720
just don't let them forget it yeah and

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:11.119
you forget it there was a guy i was uh

00:56:11.119 --> 00:56:12.480
[ __ ] i forget the name of this guy he

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:14.799
was uh might have been on rogan he was

00:56:14.799 --> 00:56:16.160
on there and he was talking about how he

00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:17.920
was like a muslim extremist he got

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:20.400
arrested after 9 11 in egypt

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.760
you remember that i don't know if it was

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:23.040
rogan

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.480
he was great he was incredible but he

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:25.839
had sat down and talked to a bunch of

00:56:25.839 --> 00:56:27.520
presidents and rogan was like who was

00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:30.559
the best one he was like w seemed to be

00:56:30.559 --> 00:56:32.880
genuinely compassionate i do believe

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:35.520
that i believe that he had a conscience

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:36.960
and then he was like did he do anything

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.960
about it he's like no maybe not again

00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:40.720
what all these guys did and what how

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:41.920
much of it was their fault how much of

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:43.920
it was the deep state whatever it is i

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:46.480
don't know any of this stuff yeah but my

00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:48.400
feet all i'm talk all i'm going by is my

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.559
feelings about the guys and there's

00:56:50.559 --> 00:56:52.240
moments about w that i remember because

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:54.559
i politically i hated them

00:56:54.559 --> 00:56:55.440
um

00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:57.040
the whole thing with the patriot act all

00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.520
this kind of stuff but and and iraq it

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.760
was shocking shocking

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:03.280
so many people died did you know i

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:05.839
realized that at the time when when the

00:57:05.839 --> 00:57:07.680
towers were on fire

00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:09.760

in the desert that are going to die who

00:57:11.599 --> 00:57:13.440

00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:29.119
[ __ ] knuckle sandwich well uh

00:57:29.119 --> 00:57:30.880
bush had a great

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.200
improv dominated after that like when he

00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.359

this is bad but then he went to

00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:43.920
[ __ ] ground zero ground zero held a

00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.880

like dole-like moment i'm like [ __ ] bush

but i look at him and he goes like this

01:00:14.079 --> 01:00:15.119
and i'm like

01:00:15.119 --> 01:00:16.559
like i just couldn't help it of course

01:00:16.559 --> 01:00:19.520
of course of course you have to yes but

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.599
the thing i liked about bush was that

01:00:21.599 --> 01:00:23.839
when he like when the guy threw shoes at

01:00:23.839 --> 01:00:25.119
him

01:00:25.119 --> 01:00:27.280

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.680
shoes in him he got two shots yeah talk

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:31.040

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:33.119
[ __ ] the harvey got him getting two

01:00:33.119 --> 01:00:36.480
shots with a bolt rifle this guy got two

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:39.119
[ __ ] shoes off

01:00:39.119 --> 01:00:40.799
with the [ __ ] at a standing target

01:00:40.799 --> 01:00:42.720
with a press all around him and his

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.960
secret servicer right there he threw his

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.079
shoe

01:00:46.079 --> 01:00:48.720
bush ducked and then there was another

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:51.200
one and bush ducked because he came back

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.839
he's smiling yes throwing shoes is the

01:00:53.839 --> 01:00:55.839
most insulting thing you can do is throw

01:00:55.839 --> 01:00:57.760
hit somebody with one of your shoes

01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.119
uh in america you know what the most

01:00:59.119 --> 01:01:00.319
insulting thing you do in the middle

01:01:00.319 --> 01:01:02.240
east is what's that

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.640
kill everything all of them kill all of

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:05.839
them i wonder if he was thinking that

01:01:05.839 --> 01:01:07.040
yeah

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:09.359
i killed a lot of your family yeah i'm

01:01:09.359 --> 01:01:11.119
about to hit your wedding for this so

01:01:11.119 --> 01:01:13.280
bad but bush they asked him about

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.720
afterwards and he said well you know i

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:17.520
got good i got good reflexes

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.839
and he said look he was he's in a

01:01:19.839 --> 01:01:21.520
country where you can you know he's not

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.200
going to get killed for that and people

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.799
expressed themselves he always

01:01:24.799 --> 01:01:26.400
appreciated

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.920
freedom of speech he always appreciated

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.680
he didn't never mind being made that guy

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.000
went to jail when he i'm sure he did but

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.359
yeah um when when bush was made fun of

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:38.640
he took it very well when he was uh

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.559
he would go on snl and read jokes that

01:01:40.559 --> 01:01:43.599
were just devastating against himself

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:45.760
and he did them with really good timing

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.839
and he was funny he was a funny dude he

01:01:47.839 --> 01:01:49.440
was funny got why

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:52.000
that was important and i remember he was

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.040
debating

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.000
gore

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.520
and they did a typical thing they do in

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.680
debates they tell each other the bad

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.559
things

01:01:58.559 --> 01:02:00.160
so he told

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.480
the moderators said al gore said this

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.599
about you

01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:05.520
and he reads some shitty things al gore

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.359
said and he goes what's your reaction

01:02:07.359 --> 01:02:09.039
now that you're with him and bush goes

01:02:09.039 --> 01:02:10.720
like i don't know

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.319
[Laughter]

01:02:12.319 --> 01:02:13.760
he's running for president of course

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:14.799
he's going to go for it he's running for

01:02:14.799 --> 01:02:16.000
president

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.280
i mean that's it's the game we're trying

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.880
to win we're trying to you know we have

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.200
different views he didn't care and later

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.440
also they asked him about the press and

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.880
that he said

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:25.680
we

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.160
counted on the press to keep us honest

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.240
he said when you're out there

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:33.119
making decisions that are outside of the

01:02:33.119 --> 01:02:35.440
decisions that come to the president are

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.520
the ones that nobody knows what to do

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.160
the ones that are clear what the law is

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.480
and what's practical other people make

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.079
those decisions they go to the president

01:02:44.079 --> 01:02:45.599
where they're like we're not sure what's

01:02:45.599 --> 01:02:46.720
legal here

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.000
and we're not sure what the american

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.720
people would want here and so it's the

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.079
hardest job in the world because you

01:02:52.079 --> 01:02:54.160
have to deal with the cutting edge

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.160
of where the country is going why it's

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.160
going there and what people really want

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.079
even if they don't know what's going on

01:03:00.079 --> 01:03:02.400
and what's legal it's not it's so

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.960
unclear sometimes and he said i depended

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.880
on the press because we knew they were

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.880
probing everything we knew they were

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.079
watching everything and we knew they

01:03:10.079 --> 01:03:12.079
were adversarial that they were

01:03:12.079 --> 01:03:13.200
they were

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:16.880
um ambitious to bust us and that made me

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.520
comfortable because it made me confident

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:21.760
that i'm not gonna in my confusion make

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:24.000
any real mistakes like that's what bush

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.079
that's a profound thing for president to

01:03:26.079 --> 01:03:29.280
say and it shows the level of confidence

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:32.240
that he had which is why did not like

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:35.039
donald trump because he didn't have that

01:03:35.039 --> 01:03:38.160
it to be made fun of is a place of

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.119
strength

01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:41.280
if you're to if you

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.599
i can't take you seriously unless you

01:03:43.599 --> 01:03:45.599
don't take yourself seriously

01:03:45.599 --> 01:03:47.839
if you're a person to be taken seriously

01:03:47.839 --> 01:03:49.280
then you can be made fun if you can't be

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.960
made fun of you can't be taken seriously

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.880
if you're like do not make that joke

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.680
about me it's like you're a [ __ ]

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:57.119
you have no [ __ ] you have no

01:03:57.119 --> 01:03:59.920
confidence in yourself you need to hear

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.559
good about you all the time that is a

01:04:02.559 --> 01:04:06.240
mental and emotional problem so bush

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.119
didn't have that to me and i appreciate

01:04:09.119 --> 01:04:11.039
him for that he killed

01:04:11.039 --> 01:04:13.280
mountains of arabs just mountain

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.119
mountains of them

01:04:15.119 --> 01:04:17.280
and other people and who knows what else

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.039
he did i don't [ __ ] know

01:04:19.039 --> 01:04:20.079
but

01:04:20.079 --> 01:04:21.359
um

01:04:21.359 --> 01:04:24.160
but an interesting dude yeah

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:24.960
um

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:27.599
and the way he reacted to obama winning

01:04:27.599 --> 01:04:29.760
was cool yeah

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.760
i like the way he handled that and in

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:32.880
the middle of that you got another

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.720
connective tissue guy which is mccain

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.319
mccain was a great

01:04:36.319 --> 01:04:39.039
great man i think um yeah those clips

01:04:39.039 --> 01:04:40.720
are him when he's debating obama and

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.160
someone's like he's a muslim and he's

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:42.960
like

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.960
he goes don't say that you got it

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.400
yeah he was like he took the microphone

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.480
away then she goes he's an arab this

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:50.400
lady and he goes no no no give me he

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:51.599
says listen

01:04:51.599 --> 01:04:53.119
i don't agree with the guy about how to

01:04:53.119 --> 01:04:54.559
run the country but he's a good man

01:04:54.559 --> 01:04:56.640
we're starting with that he's a good man

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:57.520
yeah

01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.359
um and then there was a lady who yelled

01:04:59.359 --> 01:05:01.839
out during sarah palin's rally she said

01:05:01.839 --> 01:05:04.400
you need gloves to touch him

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.200
which

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:07.520
is a leadership but it's like what does

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:08.880
that mean like

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.440
he's very delicate or or it's the most

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.599
racist thing i've ever heard or yet but

01:05:13.599 --> 01:05:14.319
also

01:05:14.319 --> 01:05:15.680
why do you want to touch him it's almost

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.680
like she's like i want to touch him why

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:20.559
do i have to wear gloves

01:05:20.559 --> 01:05:22.799
but uh yeah so that was crazy and mccain

01:05:22.799 --> 01:05:25.200
handled it as best as he could

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.839
um there's another mccain thing [ __ ]

01:05:27.839 --> 01:05:30.400
oh he had a great story about obama that

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.640
he was because he met obama when obama

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.240
was in the senate

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.079
and someone asked mccain what was your

01:05:36.079 --> 01:05:37.920
first impression of him

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.640
so he said well i remember when obama

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.559
his first day like in

01:05:42.559 --> 01:05:45.039
the senate he came to see me

01:05:45.039 --> 01:05:47.200
and he said listen i uh

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:48.079
um

01:05:48.079 --> 01:05:49.920
i i think that you know you're the

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:51.760
smartest guy on the other side and i

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.839
wanted to be bipartisan and he said what

01:05:53.839 --> 01:05:56.079
can lets you and i talk and find

01:05:56.079 --> 01:05:57.760
something that we both care about like

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.400
that was obama's first idea

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.400
and so mccain and him thought for they

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.520
talked for about an hour and they came

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:04.720
up with something they both cared about

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:05.680
and he's like let's work on that

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.039
together mccain said sure and he was a

01:06:07.039 --> 01:06:09.520
veteran senator at this point and obama

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:10.640
goes off

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:12.960
and then the democratic leadership gets

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:15.039
to obama and goes dude do not [ __ ]

01:06:15.039 --> 01:06:17.119
you don't just [ __ ] do that the [ __ ]

01:06:17.119 --> 01:06:19.280
are you doing mm-hmm and then he saw

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:21.599
mccain in the hall obama and was like uh

01:06:21.599 --> 01:06:23.760
um i got it i don't

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:24.799
pull the plug

01:06:24.799 --> 01:06:26.720
and so the interviewer asked mccain did

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.799
you also you have a bad opinion of him

01:06:28.799 --> 01:06:30.799
and he goes not at all he said it was a

01:06:30.799 --> 01:06:33.440
rookie mistake it was a rookie mistake

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.960
that he thought he could just do you

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.720
think we could get what you wanted

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:39.039
and also the way he handled the getting

01:06:39.039 --> 01:06:41.599
out of it was rookie he said but i knew

01:06:41.599 --> 01:06:42.960
that he had a good heart this is how

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.640
mccain was a guy who's running against

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:45.520
the guy

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.520
and he kept praising him

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.720
um

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.280
but so

01:06:52.319 --> 01:06:54.880
obama

01:06:55.119 --> 01:06:57.280
we're almost there we're so close it's

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.119
gonna be dark

01:06:59.119 --> 01:07:00.960
obama

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.640
um

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.319
what do you think man you like him i

01:07:04.319 --> 01:07:06.799
loved him i just loved him

01:07:06.799 --> 01:07:08.480
from the get-go

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.319
and i could tell that he was a lot of

01:07:10.319 --> 01:07:12.160
flash on some level

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:14.640
yeah but one of the first things i heard

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:17.200
about him that impressed me was biden

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.119
as biden said

01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:21.599
he's he just getting to gnome he said i

01:07:21.599 --> 01:07:23.599
gotta tell you he's a really surprising

01:07:23.599 --> 01:07:25.599
bright guy you know for a black guy yeah

01:07:25.599 --> 01:07:26.559
yeah

01:07:26.559 --> 01:07:29.359
well spoken

01:07:29.359 --> 01:07:31.119
but biden was like he said i got in a

01:07:31.119 --> 01:07:32.720
phone call with him and the there was

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.559
three of us on the call and then biden

01:07:34.559 --> 01:07:36.799
and then obama jumped on he said i have

01:07:36.799 --> 01:07:38.640
four questions for this group he asked

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.640
us questions he gave his comments and he

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.000
got off and i was like that guy has got

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.240
a good mind that guy's gotta you know i

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.720
do think obama had a mind that got

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.720
around the president he got his brain

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.319
around yeah i think so

01:07:50.319 --> 01:07:51.440
and uh

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.280
the picture of him leaning down so some

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.839
kid could touch his head he that's as

01:07:55.839 --> 01:07:57.359
important as almost anything with the

01:07:57.359 --> 01:07:58.720
president you ever see trump put the

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.480
candy bar on the minion

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:02.480
put the candy bar in the wood

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:03.920
where's the halloween you know they're

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.440
doing the halloween thing yeah i'm just

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:07.359
a kid in like an inflatable minion

01:08:07.359 --> 01:08:09.440
costume comes by and he's like he just

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:12.640
puts a candy bar in his head

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.159
he's like get out of here

01:08:16.159 --> 01:08:17.120
um

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.440
yeah obama uh

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.520
obama is a great speaker and he gave

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:23.359
people a feeling about

01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:26.239
where the country was and he brought a

01:08:26.239 --> 01:08:28.799
feeling to the presidency that there was

01:08:28.799 --> 01:08:32.159
a kindness in it and he taught i learned

01:08:32.159 --> 01:08:33.759
a lot from him

01:08:33.759 --> 01:08:36.000
in terms of confrontation

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.159
and like he debated with mccain and

01:08:38.159 --> 01:08:39.839
mccain was just kind of like bulldogging

01:08:39.839 --> 01:08:43.279
him and obama knew that you don't win in

01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:45.520
the room you don't win because he says

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.880
you're right he's never going to say

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.640
you're right there's other people

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:50.640
watching like i've learned from this in

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:53.040
my life like this guy's going in

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.120
and obama would say something and mccain

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.880
would attack and obama would just go all

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:57.920
right

01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.520
and just look at the camera smile and

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.040
people at home are going like i like

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.279
what he said better i don't need him to

01:09:03.279 --> 01:09:05.199
attack this guy to make the point i like

01:09:05.199 --> 01:09:07.759
what i like his the sound he's making

01:09:07.759 --> 01:09:10.159
better than his sound it's not about who

01:09:10.159 --> 01:09:12.319
wins this and mccain being like a

01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:14.640
military guy you know this is

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:15.759
his way

01:09:15.759 --> 01:09:18.319
um do you ever get to meet obama i never

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:19.600
got to meet obama but i was in

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:20.640
washington

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.239
and i was a big deal at the time and i

01:09:22.239 --> 01:09:23.440
thought maybe i could meet the president

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.520
i'm staying at the hey adams which is

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:27.279
across this column

01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:29.520
so i called myself my publicist oh i no

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:31.520
longer have one of those i used to have

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:33.359
an agent publicist and i don't have none

01:09:33.359 --> 01:09:34.880
of these people anymore but i called my

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:36.239
publicist and said is you think there's

01:09:36.239 --> 01:09:37.440
any way i could meet the president while

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.040
i'm in town and as i was on the phone i

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:42.159
saw marine one taking off and he he was

01:09:42.159 --> 01:09:43.600
on hold then he came back and said that

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.279
he they said he just left

01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:46.640
but they said but

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.880
they asked and they said that obama

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:52.319
asked to ask you if you would help him

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:54.400
help them come up with jokes

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.000
for the uh

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
um correspondence dinner because it was

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.520
in a few days

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.920
and their their meeting to to try to

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.760
write it and they asked if you come

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.600
across the street to the white house and

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.840
pitch in and i said of course

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.760
so i went into the white house and they

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:11.360
gave me a pass

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.600
and i went down to

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:17.040
their little room the white house

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:19.440
the rooms that aren't the oval office

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.960
are all [ __ ]

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:22.719
because they keep packing because

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:24.080
government never stops growing but the

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:25.600
white house stays the same size i mean

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.600
that's my idea of it but i was in the

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.840
literally i had to duck into the room

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:32.400
because the ceiling was so low and it

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.800
was like his head speechwriter it's john

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.280
favreau or something weird same name as

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.199
john favorite but anyway so we sat in

01:10:39.199 --> 01:10:43.199
his office and i pitched jokes

01:10:43.199 --> 01:10:46.800
and i got one in he opened with my joke

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.679
um which was because it was

01:10:49.679 --> 01:10:51.440
his last one

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:53.920
and trump had won so it was his swan

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:55.199
song

01:10:55.199 --> 01:10:56.560
and uh

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:59.199
my joke was uh it's an honor to be here

01:10:59.199 --> 01:11:00.560
for my last

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:02.640
correspondence dinner probably the last

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:04.800
correspondence dinner and it turned out

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.560
to be true trump you were close to him

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.480
yeah trump they just did the first one

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:09.440
yes

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.120
but anyway he did that he opened with

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.239
mike i was hoping you didn't write the

01:11:12.239 --> 01:11:14.239
one that made trump the president no

01:11:14.239 --> 01:11:15.920

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.920
that no no i didn't yes yes that's one

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.520
of my favorite clips of all time oh i

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:22.000
mean obama was so good he's such a good

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.480

watching trump sit there with his

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:38.960
[ __ ] hair just bobbing while

happens when you laugh at him and that's

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.360
by the way what he was thinking was

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:49.120
literally the words laugh at trump

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:50.560

01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:00.000
a letter saying uh um thanks for helping

01:12:08.159 --> 01:12:11.280
hours and at the end maren asked him uh

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.880
did you enjoy being on the show and

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.159
obama said i thought we were going to

01:12:14.159 --> 01:12:15.760
talk about comedy

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.679
and miranda was like oh because he talks

01:12:17.679 --> 01:12:19.360
about politics yeah

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:20.239
and he goes oh well who are your

01:12:20.239 --> 01:12:22.159
favorite comedians and he says well i

01:12:22.159 --> 01:12:24.880
like jerry seinfeld and dick gregory and

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:25.679
but

01:12:25.679 --> 01:12:27.920
my the guy i really love is louie

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.000
because you can tell even though he's uh

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.679
he says terrible things

01:12:31.679 --> 01:12:32.960
he's a good guy so i'm like they said

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.000
something nice

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.199
meant a lot to me because i just uh with

01:12:37.199 --> 01:12:38.239
no

01:12:38.239 --> 01:12:41.199
uh regard for history or morality i just

01:12:41.199 --> 01:12:43.360
love obama yeah i have no idea if he's

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.199
done good or bad but

01:12:45.199 --> 01:12:47.840
as a guy i just really you know

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.760
i dug him yeah

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:52.239
he seems he seems like uh

01:12:52.239 --> 01:12:54.239
i mean he's just an incredible speaker

01:12:54.239 --> 01:12:54.960
and

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.199
he was like what a president

01:12:57.199 --> 01:12:59.120
should be that's right

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:01.600
on appearance carrying the sure the

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.679
office and the way he

01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:06.080
the the way he operated and the way he

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.679
communicated

01:13:07.679 --> 01:13:10.480
um and i you know things started getting

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:12.400
really [ __ ] up during obama in this

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.320
country you know people started to get

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:16.480
really yeah the banks i mean that was

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:18.719
that was insane all that [ __ ] but also

01:13:18.719 --> 01:13:21.280
just like the word problematic happened

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:24.400
under obama like his last four years was

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.440
when

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.600
people started getting ultra ultra

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.400
sensitive and digging trying to find dig

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:33.280
down into where is our moral center to

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.400
the point where you just you're just

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.920
never going to find it because human

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:38.560
beings are flawed and that started i

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:41.120
think obama left in a strange place

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:42.719
because it was like what were we all

01:13:42.719 --> 01:13:45.199
doing i remember seeing famous liberals

01:13:45.199 --> 01:13:46.719
saying i'm disappointed in this

01:13:46.719 --> 01:13:48.719
presidency i'm like yeah you know when

01:13:48.719 --> 01:13:50.960
he was running there you know shepard

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:54.159
fairy did the cool poster of him and uh

01:13:54.159 --> 01:13:56.239
wyclef whoever the [ __ ] did a song in

01:13:56.239 --> 01:13:58.320
black and white video but once he's

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.080
president everyone's like i'm not gonna

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:02.880
it's the pres it's not cool to help the

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.159
president yeah

01:14:04.159 --> 01:14:06.880
so they all just vanished

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:09.120
uh and he's like hey guys i'm

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:12.320
the only black guy even here i'm not

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:13.600
just the first black president i'm the

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:16.239
only black guy at this level and no

01:14:16.239 --> 01:14:17.840
one's helping me i mean that's how i

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:20.159
felt was that he got kind of abandoned

01:14:20.159 --> 01:14:21.840
and he couldn't find

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:23.760
you know and and congress became weird

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:24.960
but i don't know anything about this

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.480
yeah

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.800
that's not my expertise my thing is i

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.360
just really i i really dug the guy as a

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:33.600
person the way he carried the office and

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.199
uh and he was another example where i

01:14:35.199 --> 01:14:36.480
was like you know that feels like a

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:37.760
democracy and a lot of people be like

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:38.880
well

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:41.280
you know then you're deluded you know

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:42.400
fine

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:44.719
sure but i'm 54 and that's how i feel

01:14:44.719 --> 01:14:46.960
yeah that was the first election that i

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.400
remembered

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.000
it seemed to start to get really

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.360
polarized

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:52.960
like i remember when he won

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:56.719
yeah people i was with were upset yes

01:14:56.719 --> 01:14:58.480
and that and that wasn't even close to

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:01.360
where we got that was the first time i

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.520
remember

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:06.159
the world being that there were people

01:15:06.159 --> 01:15:08.480
who hated the president that's the first

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:10.960
time i've been

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.960
yeah we're good

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.719
obviously we're going to close with the

01:15:18.719 --> 01:15:21.120
dog

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:26.320
so my mom really surprised me twice in

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.239
terms my mom died a couple years ago but

01:15:28.239 --> 01:15:30.400
she was like my best friend

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.159
and my

01:15:32.159 --> 01:15:33.840
intellectual counterpart she so i talked

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.440
about everything

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:37.360
and i remember first of all when john

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:40.239
kerry ran for president i called her up

01:15:40.239 --> 01:15:42.080
because my sis i have three sisters my

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:43.520
mom and i basically controlled the

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:45.679
household vote so we figured we have

01:15:45.679 --> 01:15:47.280
we have a blood we're super delegates we

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:49.280
have five votes yeah

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:50.719
so they just cause our sisters my

01:15:50.719 --> 01:15:53.120
sisters would devote for whoever we said

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.040
my mom was a republican and a

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.040
conservative as a kid

01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:59.120
and then jack kennedy came to speak at

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:01.199
her at michigan where she was in college

01:16:01.199 --> 01:16:02.560
and a friend of hers grabbed her and

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:04.880
said you're coming to watch kennedy and

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:08.080
they sat in the front row with knitting

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:10.000
waiting while the crowd gathered and

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.080
then she watched kennedy speak from this

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:13.440
close and she that was she was a

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:15.679
democrat from that day on

01:16:15.679 --> 01:16:16.640
but

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:18.159
when i called her and said so we're

01:16:18.159 --> 01:16:20.159
voting for carrie she said i'm not

01:16:20.159 --> 01:16:21.760
voting for that guy

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.360
i was like what

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:24.960
and she said i won't vote for him i

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:27.120
won't vote at all

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:30.000
um because i can't vote for bush

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.920
but i can't vote for that man because my

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:34.159
brother was in vietnam and we were

01:16:34.159 --> 01:16:35.600
scared every day that he was going to

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:36.560
die

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:39.280
and kerry came home and spoke against

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:40.640
the troops that's how we felt and she

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:42.400
says i i know now i look at it

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.000
differently now

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.480
and that he was trying to do good but it

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.239
just left a bad taste in my mouth he was

01:16:48.239 --> 01:16:52.080
a rich kid and my brother wasn't and

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:54.320
uh he came he did one tour came home and

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.440
started

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.600
um you know grandstanding while there's

01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.440
boys over there getting killed every day

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:02.239
and she he was pulling support out from

01:17:02.239 --> 01:17:04.239
under their feet yeah

01:17:04.239 --> 01:17:06.800
so i can't do it and i'm like mom

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:08.080
there's more to the story she's like i

01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.520
know but you can't make me you're like

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:11.600
mom you have to wait for john carey

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.640
you're the vote for john kerry

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:16.239
i mean he's still alive so i don't want

01:17:16.239 --> 01:17:18.560
to say but jeez he had lipstick he was

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:21.679
and he was like i report for he was a

01:17:21.679 --> 01:17:22.480
mess

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:24.880
and then his [ __ ] wife teresa hines i

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:27.760
am theresa hines and i have something to

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:30.560
say like we're done we lost yeah [ __ ]

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:31.520
him

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:34.239
and also by the [ __ ] way

01:17:34.239 --> 01:17:36.000
take that part out oh wow i'm actually

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.640
what one part i want out okay

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.239
wow i feel bad because people make

01:17:40.239 --> 01:17:42.719
mistakes

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:46.480
but okay

01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:50.159
when bush was running against kerry a

01:17:50.159 --> 01:17:52.239
thing that came up that was big was gay

01:17:52.239 --> 01:17:55.840
marriage it was starting to be an issue

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:57.440
and

01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:00.320
i got really angry at john kerry then

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.600
because

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:03.280
um

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:07.280
bush had a really sound argument it

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.400
wasn't and

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.560
this is when people started just lobbing

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:12.480
names at each other right it's an

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:15.040
anti-it's anti-gay people's homophobic

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.360
to be against gay marriage bush made an

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.120
argument that was practical he said

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.920
listen marriage is the easiest contract

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:24.239
in the whole world and by the time by by

01:18:24.239 --> 01:18:25.679
the way during that time they were they

01:18:25.679 --> 01:18:27.040
weren't talking about national gay

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:27.920
marriage they're talking about the

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:29.600
states that had started to it was legal

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:32.960
massachusetts i think california yeah

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:35.920
so he said marriage is the simplest

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:38.480
contract in the world you it costs ten

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:41.600
dollars most places and it's ironclad

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:44.560
and it's accepted all over the world as

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:46.320
meaning the same thing

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.880
now if you start messing with that and

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:50.480
you start saying well it's this means

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.560
this here means this there you really

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:54.080
you're you're messing with an

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:57.280
institution that is the backbone of the

01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:00.239
family and this country that is such a

01:19:00.239 --> 01:19:01.600
good argument

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:03.760
now you can argue against it and people

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.920
have very well this is nothing to be

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:08.080
afraid of this is about their rights you

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:10.080
all kinds of things but the democrats

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.480
didn't want to say yeah this is their

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:13.280
right

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.440
why would you the thing you just said

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:17.679
why would you deprive gay people of it

01:19:17.679 --> 01:19:20.560
it's if you're living in a [ __ ] in a

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:22.880
time capsule this is important it's the

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.400
same as they said this about interracial

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:25.679
matters it's a

01:19:25.679 --> 01:19:27.679
million arguments

01:19:27.679 --> 01:19:30.880
but uh carrie didn't want to go there he

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.480
was like look i am it's a man and a

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:34.480
woman to me but i don't think we but

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.640
they're homophobic they're homo they

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:39.840
don't like gay people and cheney's

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:42.159
uh daughter's gay and i don't have a

01:19:42.159 --> 01:19:44.320
problem with cheney's daughter being

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.960
they did that yeah edwards did it edward

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:49.760
said uh because cheney and him debated

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:51.360
he said i think it's great that his

01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:53.440
daughter's gay

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:55.440
i think that's great

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:56.400
what do you think of that and he

01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:58.880
expected cheney

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:01.120
to have a bad moment and chaney who's a

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:03.199
very complicated guy

01:20:03.199 --> 01:20:06.080
said uh thank you i appreciate that yeah

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:07.920
i love her

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:10.639
oh i mean they just won right there

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:13.120
so go go i don't know how i got back to

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:15.120
him or at the end of

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:18.400
obama obama into trump

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:19.840
oh yeah this is like like i was saying

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:23.120
like i remember when obama beat bush or

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.239
romney

01:20:24.239 --> 01:20:26.719
that was the first time i felt like

01:20:26.719 --> 01:20:28.400
oh this was like

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.400
totally divided because towards the end

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.480
of bush everybody hated bush

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:35.120
like that was divided half the country

01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:37.360
you know yes really hated him like

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:39.120
bands were coming out with music against

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.159
him

01:20:40.159 --> 01:20:40.960
like

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:42.480
that's what that's that's why because i

01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:44.560
was saying people hated

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:47.199
obama so much and it's when i started

01:20:47.199 --> 01:20:49.679
feeling things coming apart because i

01:20:49.679 --> 01:20:52.320
had that moment about bush i was against

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:54.880
bush as president but i could see his i

01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:56.320
could see where he was at and then the

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.080
other thing was that's because of my mom

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.080
so when obama was running i'm like we're

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:02.960
in for obama right we're doing obama

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:05.120
and my mom said i'm not voting for obama

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:06.320
and i was like

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.199
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

01:21:09.199 --> 01:21:11.120
she said i'm not voting for him

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.120
because

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:15.920
um he picked joe biden

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:17.679
as a vice president

01:21:17.679 --> 01:21:18.880
and

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:19.290
um

01:21:19.290 --> 01:21:21.360
[Music]

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.520
he hillary clinton

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:26.800
had nearly beat obama in the primaries

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:29.199
and she had done an incredible

01:21:29.199 --> 01:21:32.400
campaign she her campaign was historic

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:34.080
because she was the first woman to run

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:35.840
effectively for

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:38.159
national office and to get that close it

01:21:38.159 --> 01:21:40.639
was a big deal she and she said she won

01:21:40.639 --> 01:21:42.480
and she also remembers

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:45.120
when she was younger that typically the

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.639
president the guy running for president

01:21:46.639 --> 01:21:48.960
his running mate would be his rival you

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:51.040
pick your rival because it's your way of

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.639
saying i'm not afraid of my rival i can

01:21:52.639 --> 01:21:54.320
work with the people who it's how you

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.159
unite the party it's what reagan did

01:21:56.159 --> 01:21:57.199
with bush

01:21:57.199 --> 01:21:58.239
it's what

01:21:58.239 --> 01:22:00.560
uh kennedy did with johnson

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.639
johnson was bitterly hated kennedy and

01:22:02.639 --> 01:22:04.400
then kennedy subjugated him by saying

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:05.600
you're gonna run with me we're gonna do

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:08.159
this together buddy and i'm not afraid

01:22:08.159 --> 01:22:11.440
of your rivalry because i'm strong right

01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:13.440
and he said he didn't pick hillary and

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:16.480
she earned it and he gave it to joe and

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:18.480
she the name joe drove her crazy she

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:20.320
didn't care about biden was fine she

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:23.679
said joe joe biden's a regular guy

01:22:23.679 --> 01:22:26.159
my mother worked her whole life she was

01:22:26.159 --> 01:22:28.239
a single mother she says i worked my

01:22:28.239 --> 01:22:29.840
whole life and

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.840
me and women i worked with

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.080
would earn the spot and it would be

01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:38.080
given to joe just some joe who smiled

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:40.560
and knew how to work it yeah and the

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:43.440
woman who earned it gets [ __ ] and the

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:45.520
reason i hate him for it is because it

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:47.679
means he has no balls my mother said

01:22:47.679 --> 01:22:51.199
this obama has no balls

01:22:51.199 --> 01:22:53.920
because he picked a guy he didn't want

01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:55.760
to pick her because he's afraid of women

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.920
and he's afraid of a strong woman and

01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:59.760
she said i'll never vote for her i think

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:01.280
he was afraid of losing she did not use

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:03.120
the n word i think and then i think he

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:04.639
was afraid of losing

01:23:04.639 --> 01:23:06.480
so no i don't think that's what happened

01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:09.520
but here's what's cool about it

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:11.199
uh

01:23:11.199 --> 01:23:14.080
uh mccain picked palin

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.679
and then my mother said i'm gonna vote

01:23:15.679 --> 01:23:17.440
for obama now for the opposite reason

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:19.600
which is mccain picked palin as a who's

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:23.360
an idiot a douchebag a [ __ ]

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:24.960
uh who i personally

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:26.800
uh love now

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:29.440
i'll get to that later but

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:30.880
you know what i met her i meant all

01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:34.560
these crazy people i met

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:36.880
um

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.880
she said he picked mccain to get the

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.400
woman's vote yeah and you're not gonna

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.239
get a smart woman's vote by picking

01:23:42.239 --> 01:23:43.840
somebody like that

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.760
so i'm voting for obama and then later i

01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:47.600
checked in with my mom when obama became

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.440
president and made hillary clinton

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:52.480
secretary of state which is a far yeah

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:54.080
more important position than but i

01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.600
called my mom and i said you gotta give

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:58.239
that to him that and he didn't run on it

01:23:58.239 --> 01:23:59.840
he didn't say to the women of the world

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:01.760
i'm gonna give he didn't tell anybody he

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:03.520
gave her the job because he thought he

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.000
she had earned that job to actually do

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
yeah not just the [ __ ] political

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.760
position she said yes i'm with you and

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:12.480
she ended up loving obama but sarah

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:14.080
palin

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:17.040
amazing person amazing person i mean

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.600
when mccain announced her and she spoke

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:22.400
her first national speech and did the

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.920
joke about you know the difference

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:27.120

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:36.560
in american history to me and i was on

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.840
and

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:11.440
so she wrote a book and she put a

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:13.360
chapter about me a little chapter about

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:14.800
me

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:17.679

01:29:17.679 --> 01:29:19.199
about how i came up apologize to her and

01:29:19.199 --> 01:29:20.880

01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:35.600
romney's vice president

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:37.280
nominee

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:39.760
wasn't he wisconsin guy ryan oh yeah

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:42.080
paul ryan yeah but he wasn't up there no

01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:44.080
he didn't he didn't write yeah by the

01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:45.440
way just talk about

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.760
romney for one second

01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:49.760
because i never liked i didn't like

01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:52.159
romney yeah because he was a venture

01:30:52.159 --> 01:30:53.440
capitalist with what do you call the

01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:55.280
fund those funds

01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:58.320
hedge fund these guys ruined capitalism

01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:00.719
capitalism used capitalism used to be

01:31:00.719 --> 01:31:02.960
make the best of something or and and

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:04.800
make a ton of money or or make the

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:06.800
second best and kneecap the guy who

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.800
makes the best and which is fine that's

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:10.639
how that's why we had vhs instead of

01:31:10.639 --> 01:31:12.800
beta beta was better but vhs just went

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.199
after beta and won that's why we had ibm

01:31:15.199 --> 01:31:17.520
instead of apple for a long time ibm

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:19.840
apple was better and it's by the way why

01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:23.040
we have the uh records the the the

01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:25.440
grooves go up and down which is stupid

01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:27.199
they were better side to side but that

01:31:27.199 --> 01:31:29.120
guy that that patent got

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:31.199
it's just [ __ ]

01:31:31.199 --> 01:31:32.320
romney

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:33.760
um

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.520
never liked him until the whole [ __ ]

01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:37.600
capital riot thing happened and then he

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:39.520
did that thing where he stood up in the

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:41.679
middle of that crazy [ __ ] after january

01:31:41.679 --> 01:31:43.600
6th after the riot

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:45.360
and he said you know i know all of you

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.600
are trying to serve your constituents by

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:49.520
telling them what they want to hear

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:51.360
well why don't you

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:54.320
help them the people who you work for by

01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:56.400
telling them the truth

01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:58.480
and the place it was this raucous

01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:00.639
applause and he looked at the applauding

01:32:00.639 --> 01:32:01.520
people

01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:02.960
and it reminded me of the reagan thing

01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:04.560
because he looked at them like why is

01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:06.480
that getting applause

01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:08.560
that's just normal what has happened to

01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:10.639
this country so romney's an interesting

01:32:10.639 --> 01:32:13.199
guy to me yeah because of that yeah i

01:32:13.199 --> 01:32:15.520
don't yeah i never really liked him

01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:16.560
i don't like him but that was an

01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:18.400
interesting moment that was human to me

01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:19.760
and he kept his dog on the roof of the

01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:21.420
car but he did do some

01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:22.960
[Music]

01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:24.960
you drive his dog

01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:27.440
what i mean the talk was in a box it

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:29.210
wasn't like

01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:30.880
[Music]

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:33.040
he just uh he seems like the

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:34.400
establishment to me he is the

01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:35.679
establishment and so like never never

01:32:35.679 --> 01:32:38.320
had he always tried to stop trump so of

01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:39.199
course

01:32:39.199 --> 01:32:40.960
no matter what he did even if he hated

01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:43.040
trump yeah but the moment that made

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:44.400
trump matter was when he was in that

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:45.199
room

01:32:45.199 --> 01:32:47.440
and he said these guys are all crooks

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:49.840
and i'll tell you how i know because i'm

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:52.560
a billionaire i'm a businessman and i

01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:55.199
give them all money and the democrats

01:32:55.199 --> 01:32:57.280
yep and if i call them they pick up the

01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:59.600
phone yeah if i call any and they're all

01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:00.639
like

01:33:00.639 --> 01:33:02.239
you can't tell me what are you doing i

01:33:02.239 --> 01:33:04.159
was just sitting at home like what just

01:33:04.159 --> 01:33:06.560
happened yeah that moment was just like

01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:09.440
a you could hear the country go

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:10.320
what

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:13.520
the [ __ ] is going on here and every time

01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:15.199
he spoke at those debates and you just

01:33:15.199 --> 01:33:17.920
saw those guys less and less peeling off

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:20.639
whoever was closest

01:33:20.639 --> 01:33:23.520
and you saw him turn

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:24.960
and

01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:27.440
you saw him reveal

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:29.360
what people were

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:32.159
over time also i remember lindsey graham

01:33:32.159 --> 01:33:33.520
saying

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:34.320
um

01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:36.159
after trump said some really super

01:33:36.159 --> 01:33:38.639
[ __ ] up thing i forget which one

01:33:38.639 --> 01:33:40.400
lindsey graham said for any of us

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:42.080
looking for an off-ramp this is probably

01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:43.520
the last one

01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:45.280
and i thought wow lindsey graham's got

01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:47.120
lindsey graham's got it lindsey graham

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:49.760

01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:51.520
what he revealed about lindsey graham

01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:54.800
and how fake he is and how full of [ __ ]

01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:55.920
he is

01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:58.159
is incredible because he lindsey graham

01:33:58.159 --> 01:34:00.320
announced to the world that this guy is

01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:02.480
a crook he's aborts that he's against

01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:04.800
everything that he's for and then he

01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:07.440
defended him and he loved him and he

01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:09.440
just kissed him everyone [ __ ] ass

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:11.280

01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:15.199
destroying chris christie

01:34:15.199 --> 01:34:16.719
destroying him he ruined his political

01:34:16.719 --> 01:34:18.400
career chris christie was supposed to be

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:20.480
something i that guy i think might be

01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:22.239
president and then i think chris

01:34:22.239 --> 01:34:24.800
christie might be president i think uh

01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:27.520
chris christie has had a journey

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:31.760
same as uh as uh um nixon did nixon was

01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:33.840
toast he had to give a speech on tv

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:35.520
saying i'm keeping the dog that i

01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:37.199
shouldn't you know he had to give

01:34:37.199 --> 01:34:38.719
the checkers speech and then he ended up

01:34:38.719 --> 01:34:41.360
being president twice it didn't end well

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:43.360
but chris christie has had a [ __ ] up

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:45.119
life but he's also had real like his you

01:34:45.119 --> 01:34:47.760
know uh um drug addiction in his family

01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:49.280
that he gave one speech about drug

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:50.880
addiction that was like off the cuff

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:53.040
that's like his one of his best moments

01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:54.960
he was passionate he is another guy that

01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:56.159
i met

01:34:56.159 --> 01:34:58.800
barely i was walking in an airport after

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:00.480
he'd washed out

01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:02.800
of the election and i was in an airport

01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:05.440
and there was chris christie alone

01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:07.119
with his big suit

01:35:07.119 --> 01:35:10.000
and his hudson news airport bag with

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.719
like a heavy drink and snacks and soda

01:35:12.719 --> 01:35:15.280
and he was just walking and he saw me

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:16.960
and i think the recognition was just

01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:18.480
like we're both on

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:20.320
both pictures on twitter

01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:23.119
and he just went like this

01:35:23.119 --> 01:35:24.159
like that

01:35:24.159 --> 01:35:26.080
he just looked sad in the airport but

01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:28.639
then i saw him on bill maher recently

01:35:28.639 --> 01:35:31.360
and uh he took some tough questions and

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:33.440
he sounds like he's got he did all right

01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:35.520
he's got some grit to him

01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:37.920
and he's got some complexity and some

01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:39.920
dimension and i think he's digging his

01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:41.280
heels in and thinking about what he

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:43.040
believes now

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:44.960
because there was one i think it was it

01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:46.960
was right after him and trump obviously

01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:49.119
were he trump killed him

01:35:49.119 --> 01:35:50.880
and then he's standing on stage with

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:53.199
trump at another rally and trump's like

01:35:53.199 --> 01:35:55.119
you can go

01:35:55.119 --> 01:35:57.360
uh like he's right he introduced him and

01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:58.719
then was standing there and he was like

01:35:58.719 --> 01:36:00.080
you can get off the phone

01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:03.760
he was being as brutal as trump was yeah

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:05.360
to the people around him including

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:07.520
giuliani who used to say shut the [ __ ]

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:09.600
up to giuliani he curses him in front of

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:11.679
everybody yeah he shits on all these

01:36:11.679 --> 01:36:14.880
guys now that is an incredibly fast and

01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:17.600
powerful engine to be trump you just

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:19.119
shoot to the top

01:36:19.119 --> 01:36:21.520
but it's unstable it's like caligula

01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:24.000
it's the same [ __ ] thing he's he's

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.239
everybody around you hates you a little

01:36:26.239 --> 01:36:28.639
more each year it's jackson yes and also

01:36:28.639 --> 01:36:31.679
no goals no real goals for the country

01:36:31.679 --> 01:36:34.400
just a win-win-win which can get you to

01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:37.040
win to a certain degree but there's a

01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:38.400
limit to it i'm just talking i'm not

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:40.639
talking morally i'm talking about what

01:36:40.639 --> 01:36:42.080
works yeah

01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:44.480
and i think that he's he's come to a

01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:46.159
critical place i i don't know if he'll

01:36:46.159 --> 01:36:47.920
win again i don't think he's i don't

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:49.280
even think he's gonna run i don't think

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:50.800
he'll be playing i think desantis is

01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:53.440
gonna run but

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:55.280
but i don't know anything no but when he

01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:57.199
was right i'm sitting here like you know

01:36:57.199 --> 01:36:59.679
who i think i've got my eye on

01:36:59.679 --> 01:37:01.199
the governor of florida i don't know a

01:37:01.199 --> 01:37:03.199
[ __ ] thing i don't know either and i

01:37:03.199 --> 01:37:05.199
but i do i think that

01:37:05.199 --> 01:37:07.199
his win changed everything his room

01:37:07.199 --> 01:37:08.480
changed everything

01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:10.800
and and maybe for the better

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:13.360
i in some everything maybe everything

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.360
has both sides yeah

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:17.600
every single change that comes to your

01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:20.080
life has both sides good and bad has

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:22.639
pain and and healing

01:37:22.639 --> 01:37:26.239
and uh if you resist pain

01:37:26.239 --> 01:37:27.840
you're you're not gonna get the healing

01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:30.880
if and if you also if you try to freeze

01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:32.880
your the moment of happiness you're

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:34.639
gonna miss the sad on the other side

01:37:34.639 --> 01:37:36.560
which you need you need it otherwise you

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:38.320
go you go you're not living in the real

01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:39.199
world

01:37:39.199 --> 01:37:41.840
but the thing i would have said to who

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:44.239
was just talking about trump

01:37:44.239 --> 01:37:46.239
the thing about these guys is this is

01:37:46.239 --> 01:37:48.719
what i think about christy okay he's got

01:37:48.719 --> 01:37:51.199
an idea in his head of who he is and

01:37:51.199 --> 01:37:53.199
what he believes in that's what i feel

01:37:53.199 --> 01:37:55.040
when i see him talk now

01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:56.560
and that's what these guys are usually

01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:58.239
missing the ones who lose

01:37:58.239 --> 01:38:00.639
like i used to watch american idol

01:38:00.639 --> 01:38:02.560
love that show i love any show that's

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:05.119
like emotional so yeah i watch deal or

01:38:05.119 --> 01:38:06.400
no deal i used to watch that all the

01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:07.840
time you were watching this

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:09.040
great

01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:10.719
i was watching dealer no deal because i

01:38:10.719 --> 01:38:12.560
was depressed and i didn't want to

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:13.679
change the channel and i was just

01:38:13.679 --> 01:38:15.199
staring at it

01:38:15.199 --> 01:38:16.800
and

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:19.600
i was it was a marine who was during the

01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:22.719

01:38:22.719 --> 01:38:24.400
they talked to him he's in he's got all

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:25.679
his medals

01:38:25.679 --> 01:38:27.440
and uh he says i'm a little bummed

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:29.199
because my family lives in san diego and

01:38:29.199 --> 01:38:30.960

01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:32.960

and his little girl like you know is

01:38:41.119 --> 01:38:43.119
crying you know and he takes one knee

01:38:43.119 --> 01:38:44.570
just like nixon did in my dream

01:38:44.570 --> 01:38:48.400
[Laughter]

01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:50.800

01:38:52.239 --> 01:38:54.880
my lips trembling of course

01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:56.719
and then they do the crazy dealer no

01:38:56.719 --> 01:38:58.320
deal which is america [ __ ] losers

01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:01.199
keep going keep going keep going and

01:39:01.199 --> 01:39:03.440
there's always this moment where

01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:04.880
they're like you could you and the guy's

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:07.119

you've got 250 000

01:39:09.199 --> 01:39:11.440
but you could get 10 million and the

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:13.600
guy's like oh and then then he goes one

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:15.840
step too far and the lights come on and

01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:19.040
it's depressed back to iraq yes

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:21.280
well that's what usually happens

01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:23.119
but whenever somebody hits i'm gonna

01:39:23.119 --> 01:39:24.560

yeah yeah yeah yeah thank god yeah

01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:34.159
yeah so this was one of those moments he

01:39:34.159 --> 01:39:35.840
had a ridiculous you know the game at

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:36.560
all

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:38.320
all the little

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:41.360
baskets were gone they were all retired

01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:44.400
he had like uh one for 10 million over

01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:47.920
here and whatever crazy numbers and then

01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:49.840
one that was like five dollars but

01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:52.719
eight of them were good yeah and he had

01:39:52.719 --> 01:39:54.400
something like a quarter of a million on

01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:56.000
the thing

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.960
and everybody's saying go go and he said

01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:00.400
he tells them

01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:03.280
in his military way quiet he says to his

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:04.400
little daughter

you understand what's happening here

01:40:06.239 --> 01:40:09.040
you understand how likely it is

01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:10.960
how good the odds are that if i go one

01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:13.920
more step i could get more money

01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:16.880

01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:00.800
train

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:07.679
that song is about a man who murdered

01:42:07.679 --> 01:42:10.560
somebody just to watch him i shot a man

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:13.280
in reno just to watch him die

01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:15.679
and the sound of the train because he

01:42:15.679 --> 01:42:18.320
can picture the cigars smoking i bet

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:21.040
they're they're smoking big cigars

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:23.920
and that it's tort it's it it tortures

01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:26.159
him to think of the freedom he goes i

01:42:26.159 --> 01:42:28.400
know i i got it coming

01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:30.960
i know i can't go free but i hear the

01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:33.199
whistle blowing and that's what tortures

01:42:33.199 --> 01:42:35.760
me and he says if i had all the money in

01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:37.360
the world and i was a free man all i

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:38.400
would do

01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:40.960
is move that railroad a little bit

01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:42.480
further down the line

01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:44.000
so i wouldn't have to hear the whistle

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.560
like all he asks for is that the train

01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:48.320
was a little further away that that good

01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:50.000
life was further away and this kid is

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.520
singing it like it's just

01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:53.199
because he just wants to win he wants to

01:42:53.199 --> 01:42:54.320
be a winner

01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:56.239
he wants to be loved he wants to connect

01:42:56.239 --> 01:42:58.480
with the audience to me that's trump

01:42:58.480 --> 01:42:59.920
to me the great presidents have been

01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:02.159
guys who are like i'm when i i got an

01:43:02.159 --> 01:43:04.239
idea i know what i'm singing about

01:43:04.239 --> 01:43:06.320
i know what i know what i'm about i know

01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:08.159
what the for clinton was the american

01:43:08.159 --> 01:43:10.000
people he said all the time i don't

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.199
think the american people want that like

01:43:11.199 --> 01:43:13.360
he was connect because he was a

01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:15.040
son of a vegas

01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:17.119
blackjack dealer that is a he was an

01:43:17.119 --> 01:43:18.400
american

01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:20.000
obama when obama was president he was an

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.199
american

01:43:21.199 --> 01:43:22.560
so

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:26.000
to me trump changed the game in a way a

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.400
lot of people could have and didn't

01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:29.920
but i think it's like it's got limited

01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:32.000
it's got limited legs and i i never

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.760
thought

01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:36.480
i think a huge mistake that the

01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:40.080
democrats made was to [ __ ] on his on the

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:42.159
people who loved him that's a dumb [ __ ]

01:43:42.159 --> 01:43:43.920
yeah they can't stop doing it basket of

01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:45.199
deplorables you can't stop it i mean

01:43:45.199 --> 01:43:47.600
it's just the stupidest thing you can do

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:49.040
the thing that

01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:51.280
progressives do that i've never seen in

01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:53.840
all these years we've talked about

01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:56.000
never seen a political

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.280
movement

01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:58.320
do

01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:02.159
is assign people to the other side yeah

01:44:02.159 --> 01:44:04.800
you what clinton did what anybody

01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:07.199
running for president uh nixon did it

01:44:07.199 --> 01:44:09.040
you could see examples of all of them

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:10.320
when they talked like especially when

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:12.159
they started doing town halls

01:44:12.159 --> 01:44:14.560
which was a great addition yeah

01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:16.000
they would say

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.719
somebody would stand up and say i i i

01:44:18.719 --> 01:44:20.239
don't want to vote for you because i'm a

01:44:20.239 --> 01:44:21.679
democrat

01:44:21.679 --> 01:44:23.360
and because i think you're

01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:25.119
you know whatever and they go okay tell

01:44:25.119 --> 01:44:26.400
me what does that mean to you being a

01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:27.679
democrat yeah

01:44:27.679 --> 01:44:30.480
well uh the economy is very important to

01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:32.960
me and healthcare and i want people to

01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:34.480
be taken care of when they're old or

01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:36.560
sick and he goes i i'm afraid to tell

01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:38.239
you but you're a republican that's what

01:44:38.239 --> 01:44:40.080
that's what that's what people do is i

01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:41.360
come here

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:43.760
i've got i've got the same i'm like you

01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:45.760
you're like me more than you understand

01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:47.360
now and they they hedge it they go like

01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:49.199
now i'm not i don't i don't agree with

01:44:49.199 --> 01:44:51.920
my opponent's bill for health care

01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:54.000
but i have the same concern as you do

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.679
about health care i have the same values

01:44:55.679 --> 01:44:58.080
you do where like you should vote for me

01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:00.080
but what progressives do is they you you

01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:02.080
actually say to them i'm a progressive

01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:04.880
yeah and they go really

01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:07.440
prove it well i'm for gay marriage we

01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:09.679
mean gay what do you mean marriage yeah

01:45:09.679 --> 01:45:12.960
yeah yeah you are a trump they like tell

01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:15.199
other people that they belong to trump

01:45:15.199 --> 01:45:17.600
they give him

01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:19.360
they push people away he pushed everyone

01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:22.400
to him because the goal is not actually

01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:25.360
to win and to change the country which

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:28.159
is a ugly difficult to really change the

01:45:28.159 --> 01:45:29.119
country

01:45:29.119 --> 01:45:32.880
is a gray difficult boring

01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:34.880
bureaucratic

01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:35.800
uh

01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:38.719
unsatisfying slow business and people

01:45:38.719 --> 01:45:40.239
want to be able to make it happen like

01:45:40.239 --> 01:45:42.880
this i can this i can just and they're

01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:44.320
not trying to make something happen

01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:45.360
they're just trying to feel they're

01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:47.119
trying to show what they think

01:45:47.119 --> 01:45:49.360
and perform what they are and

01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:51.360
and just get it and they're addicted

01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:54.000
it's a sickness i feel sorry for them i

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:54.800
don't

01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:56.320
hate people like this

01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:57.840
it's just that they're sick they can't

01:45:57.840 --> 01:45:59.920
stop this thing this does if this

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:01.199
doesn't bark

01:46:01.199 --> 01:46:03.760
they start feeling sick inside so if

01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:05.600
it's not barking they bark at it so

01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:08.639
it'll bark back and that's on both sides

01:46:08.639 --> 01:46:10.719
yeah that's everybody on the trump side

01:46:10.719 --> 01:46:12.000
that's everybody on the on the

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.159
progressive side yeah it's sick

01:46:14.159 --> 01:46:15.920
but i feel

01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:16.719
that's

01:46:16.719 --> 01:46:20.239
to me i'm skipping over trump because

01:46:20.239 --> 01:46:22.639
i think the whole country has been in a

01:46:22.639 --> 01:46:24.239
fevered

01:46:24.239 --> 01:46:26.400
nightmare for all the time he was

01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:29.199
president and he was the he was the

01:46:29.199 --> 01:46:31.840
perfect president for the time we were

01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:33.760
living he was all the people that hate

01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:34.560
trump

01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:36.639
that really hate him are exactly like

01:46:36.639 --> 01:46:38.639
him and they picked him

01:46:38.639 --> 01:46:42.320
cnn and msnbc refused to talk about any

01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:44.560
other republicans like i wrote a dumb

01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:45.760
thing that i never should have written

01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:49.679
about uh trump and the point of it was

01:46:49.679 --> 01:46:51.679
pick a pick a real conservative like i'm

01:46:51.679 --> 01:46:54.000
not i'm not a conservative generally i

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.239
am about things i mean look if i go to a

01:46:56.239 --> 01:46:57.760
smoothie place i don't pick one of the

01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:00.400
like cool blue or the berry i like to

01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:02.239
make my own that's where i am

01:47:02.239 --> 01:47:03.360
politically

01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:06.480
like bananas with some spinach

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:09.119
and some you know agave

01:47:09.119 --> 01:47:10.320
okay

01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:11.440
so

01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:13.600
that's the way i am politically but i

01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:14.560
think it's

01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:16.880
i wanted to say if you're gonna pick a

01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:18.639
conservative pic a person who's gonna

01:47:18.639 --> 01:47:20.000
really talk about conservative politics

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.600
there's a lot of value in that and then

01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:23.360
let's have a real debate

01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:25.920
trump wasn't that to me he was a psycho

01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:28.320
weirdo [ __ ] salesman and he was

01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:30.080
extremely effective

01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:32.159
fascinating had his finger on the pulse

01:47:32.159 --> 01:47:34.239
of the people knew how to run a rally

01:47:34.239 --> 01:47:35.600
and then would get into his helicopter

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:37.520
by the way and buzz them because he

01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:39.440
thought it was funny to watch them run

01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:42.800
in fear he's a screwed up dude now he

01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:44.400
did that because it was cool he did that

01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:45.600
because it was cool and the people down

01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:48.000
there were probably like yes no he was

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.719
like scaring them he here's the thing

01:47:50.719 --> 01:47:53.360
with trump he was to me he's just a

01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:55.119
result of where we were politically he

01:47:55.119 --> 01:47:56.719
was a result he's a result he's not the

01:47:56.719 --> 01:48:00.560
cause and then to watch the way the left

01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:02.560
kicked and screamed the entire time he

01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:05.280
was in office and they got their way

01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:06.639
they got their way and that's what

01:48:06.639 --> 01:48:07.760
bothers me because there's a part of me

01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:09.440
that's always like look i'm glad he's

01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:11.119
gone so we don't have to [ __ ] fight

01:48:11.119 --> 01:48:13.679
every single day that was annoying but

01:48:13.679 --> 01:48:15.440
then it's like do i want to reward the

01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:17.600
side that [ __ ] cried every day when

01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:21.040
they lost do do we want to reward them

01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:23.040
with an actual result which is they got

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:26.239
their guy who happens to be dead

01:48:26.239 --> 01:48:28.480
well i guess what i think is the only

01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:30.320
way you get out of nightmare moments in

01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:33.520
history which happen all the time yeah

01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:34.880
they come and they go and they come and

01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:36.159
they go and they come and they go it's

01:48:36.159 --> 01:48:38.000
just constant and every time you think

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:39.840
this is all over like i used to tell my

01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:41.600
kids and people you know around me that

01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:43.440
were really upset when trump won hey

01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:45.679
that's how we felt when reagan won and

01:48:45.679 --> 01:48:48.159
you know we got a lot of good after him

01:48:48.159 --> 01:48:50.239
and even some good out of him

01:48:50.239 --> 01:48:53.679
and uh i like when people are afraid of

01:48:53.679 --> 01:48:55.520
uh we're afraid of terrorism i mean that

01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:57.600
was all anybody cared about yeah after

01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:00.159
when after 9 11. and i remember telling

01:49:00.159 --> 01:49:01.199
people everybody was like we're all

01:49:01.199 --> 01:49:02.239
going to get blown up this is going to

01:49:02.239 --> 01:49:03.119
be the end there's going to be another

01:49:03.119 --> 01:49:04.719
many more 911s and that's what we

01:49:04.719 --> 01:49:06.400
thought about nuclear war

01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:08.320
that's what we thought about so these

01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:10.800
kind of things do happen cyclically

01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:13.440
cyclically and i think uh

01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:15.840
that the only way you get out of them is

01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:17.920
by giving up on

01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:19.760
our side your side and i i see people

01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:20.800
doing that

01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:22.800
i see everybody doing that i see i see

01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:25.599
it in the way you what you do on stage i

01:49:25.599 --> 01:49:27.520
see it in the way when you first i

01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:29.199
remember this is the way i tell myself

01:49:29.199 --> 01:49:31.040
the story you would go to the comedy

01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:32.800
cellar and you want to tell some jokes

01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:33.920
about your dad

01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:36.560
and you'd say my dad is a

01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:38.000
fox news guy

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.920
and they all go boo

01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:41.520
because it's their place it's new york

01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:44.560
city and they have no shame just booing

01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:46.680
yeah just building my dad

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:48.639
[Music]

01:49:48.639 --> 01:49:50.719
this is definitely the right move

01:49:50.719 --> 01:49:52.880
boo and you would take it with your red

01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:55.280
irish half [ __ ] face

01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:58.400
and you would just take it and get angry

01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:00.400
but you'd swallow the anger and you'd

01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:02.239
continue talking about your dad and it

01:50:02.239 --> 01:50:04.239
was hard and you went kept going to

01:50:04.239 --> 01:50:05.840
these and you're not playing in you're

01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:07.679
not being theo von play in the south

you're in new york city nothing against

01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:11.360
the ohio but you're here

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:13.119
and

01:50:13.119 --> 01:50:15.599

01:50:19.679 --> 01:50:22.320
and they said boo and you said hey all

your dads

01:50:23.599 --> 01:50:26.239

01:50:26.239 --> 01:50:28.480
yeah and you said and guess what you

01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:30.800
want your dad to be a fox news guy and

01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:32.159
you found

01:50:32.159 --> 01:50:34.560
this common ground for with them and the

01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:37.360
thing that snl really [ __ ] up by not

01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:38.800
having you on there by the way you

01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:40.080
wouldn't have been able to do what you

01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:41.679
do of course

01:50:41.679 --> 01:50:43.840
but if you could have been you

01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:45.520
your version the thing that you do

01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:47.840
that's great

01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:49.599
is that

01:50:49.599 --> 01:50:52.440
you make fun of

01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:54.000
pennsylvania

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.159
fox news trump world

01:50:56.159 --> 01:50:58.880
from because they're your family and you

01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:01.280
love them and they're part of you and

01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:03.520
yet you hate them you want out you're

01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:05.840
throwing up and so but you know how you

01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:07.280
can only make fun of somebody i'm going

01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:09.520
back there you can only it's growing you

01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:11.520
can only make fun of someone yeah you

01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:14.000
love them if there's love there and you

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.239
know them and you know seth uh you know

01:51:16.239 --> 01:51:20.560
[ __ ] admirers and a trumpet bit

01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:22.560
their jokes are crafted but there's i

01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:24.080
don't give a [ __ ] it's all like it's us

01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:26.320
versus those yes that's not fun it's fun

01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:28.719
to watch a guy go this is my dad listen

01:51:28.719 --> 01:51:30.880
you wanna you wanna know about yeah you

01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:33.040
wanna know what's really flawed about a

01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:34.880
fox news guy

01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:36.320
listen to the stories about my dad

01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:38.320
because and unfortunately you're gonna

01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:41.040
like my dad yeah you're gonna like him

01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:42.960
and that

01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:44.960
that makes that being able to like go

01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:48.239
like ah you [ __ ] but uh

01:51:48.239 --> 01:51:50.400
you and i probably disagree about almost

01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:52.719
everything but i can't get your sound

01:51:52.719 --> 01:51:54.960
anywhere else i can't get your sound of

01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:56.800
humanity anywhere else

01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:58.560
so i think that

01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:00.800
all this time drove us apart and then we

01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:03.119
got lonely this is a human story

01:52:03.119 --> 01:52:05.280
you you want to get away from people

01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:06.719
that you think are hurting you and then

01:52:06.719 --> 01:52:09.280
you miss them so much and then you come

01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:10.800
back together and we'll we'll do it

01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:12.960
again but i do believe

01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:14.880
and again i do think that i mean trump

01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:17.040
could have he ran for president every

01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:18.639
every election

01:52:18.639 --> 01:52:20.800
people like where did this he he could

01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:23.360
have the country decided it's time for

01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:25.360
trump because we lost our minds but he

01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:27.760
ran i remember he ran one year

01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:29.920
and he got a shot he would did a town

01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:30.800
hall

01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:33.760
uh just one-on-one with uh some big

01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:35.840
chris matthews

01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:37.520
and he said um

01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:39.679
well what do you think of the republican

01:52:39.679 --> 01:52:41.520
national whatever and trump said they're

01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:43.760
just [ __ ] and

01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:46.880
chris matthews was like

01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:49.599
and i was like did he just say [ __ ]

01:52:49.599 --> 01:52:52.960
he's just so [ __ ]

01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:54.320
and

01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:56.560
nobody took him seriously yeah he ran

01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:58.080
every four years and it would just be

01:52:58.080 --> 01:52:59.599
like stop it there's an interesting

01:52:59.599 --> 01:53:02.000
trump give me the [ __ ] break

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:03.760
this what yes bannon has a there's a

01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:05.360
youtube video of bannon doing an

01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:07.119
interview about about trump and like

01:53:07.119 --> 01:53:09.040
finding trump and like he's taking a lot

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:11.280
of credit but the populist movement

01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:14.400
which is jackson like just being like

01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:16.719
there's something here we can do this

01:53:16.719 --> 01:53:19.119
this guy has a well he he failed them

01:53:19.119 --> 01:53:21.040
too by the way like he he

01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:23.920
the thing is trump's magic

01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:26.560
was an absolute perfect narcissism like

01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:28.000
a crystal

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.639
[ __ ] diamond

01:53:30.639 --> 01:53:31.760
just

01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:33.040
perfect

01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:37.119
no flaws yeah narcissism and at an age

01:53:37.119 --> 01:53:38.400
where that was

01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:40.960
the country everybody and people

01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:42.639
something was invented under trump i

01:53:42.639 --> 01:53:44.320
feel which is or maybe it goes all the

01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:45.679
way back to everybody who's ever been

01:53:45.679 --> 01:53:47.679
like a big crazy leader

01:53:47.679 --> 01:53:48.880
is

01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:50.159
um

01:53:50.159 --> 01:53:51.280
uh

01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:53.119
narcissism in the collective that people

01:53:53.119 --> 01:53:54.880
are obsessed with one person and they

01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:56.400
can't hear anything against them and

01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:57.760
they don't give a [ __ ] without what

01:53:57.760 --> 01:53:59.599
happens as long as the person wins that

01:53:59.599 --> 01:54:00.480
sort of

01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:02.719
he came at a time where people were

01:54:02.719 --> 01:54:05.040
obsessed with personal attention

01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:07.679
with feelings and they just were in

01:54:07.679 --> 01:54:10.000
denial about what's yeah what's going to

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.480
happen again he was he was a result yes

01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:14.800
he was a result of social media

01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:18.080
he was a result of how america is acting

01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:19.119
and like

01:54:19.119 --> 01:54:20.880
he was also a result of the left being

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:23.599
complete [ __ ] [ __ ] and it was

01:54:23.599 --> 01:54:25.119
more fun to be like i want to watch

01:54:25.119 --> 01:54:26.800
trump win and watch those [ __ ] people

01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:29.280
that openly hate me i want to watch them

01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:31.199
cry when hillary loses

01:54:31.199 --> 01:54:32.800
the same thing i understand that and i

01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:35.440
was i was uh i felt in agony every

01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:37.679
minute that he was president and i hated

01:54:37.679 --> 01:54:38.320
it

01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:40.159
but i understood i understand that i

01:54:40.159 --> 01:54:42.080
understand why people dug i i look i

01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:43.520
didn't vote for him i didn't vote for

01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:45.440
him but the night he won i was doing an

01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:47.360
open mic and i was like this is fun i

01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:49.280
got to watch all the [ __ ] alt comics

01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:51.119
literally listen when i was i was in i

01:54:51.119 --> 01:54:52.719
was happy i was on tour when he won and

01:54:52.719 --> 01:54:54.960
i was in dallas the night he won or the

01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:56.560
night after the first day of him being

01:54:56.560 --> 01:54:58.880
president and i said hey guys you know

01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:00.239
all this stuff about probably because

01:55:00.239 --> 01:55:01.760
everybody was into problematic and

01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:03.679
writing pieces about

01:55:03.679 --> 01:55:05.920
you know this and i was like so this is

01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:07.280
what you did thank you yeah this is

01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:09.040
where it got this word that was my

01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:10.560
feeling back then was like this is

01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:12.880
what's happened is that there's no

01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:15.040
conversation going on anymore nobody's

01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:17.360
really defending liberal politics and

01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:20.159
there isn't a real conservative running

01:55:20.159 --> 01:55:21.440
it's just a

01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:24.000
it's just a [ __ ] show and a piece of

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.320
[ __ ] one because the right [ __ ] just put

01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:28.239
out a guy that goes aren't they [ __ ]

01:55:28.239 --> 01:55:31.119
crazy and and do well

01:55:31.119 --> 01:55:33.599
because of how crazy the left is

01:55:33.599 --> 01:55:35.520
i think the next thing that would

01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:38.960
restore the country is um

01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:40.480
a [ __ ]

01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:42.880
normal conservative

01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:44.719
a normal

01:55:44.719 --> 01:55:46.800
chris christie yeah just a normal

01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:49.199
[ __ ] dude because there's no democrat

01:55:49.199 --> 01:55:51.280
first of all they're all behind by

01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:53.520
there's nobody even thinking there's not

01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:55.199
but at this point

01:55:55.199 --> 01:55:56.800
it's 2022

01:55:56.800 --> 01:55:59.119
the presidential election is in 2024 and

01:55:59.119 --> 01:56:00.880
not one democrat is talking about

01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:03.119
running um so there is it's going to be

01:56:03.119 --> 01:56:05.920
biden and it can't be it feels

01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:07.360
it literally can't be

01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:09.199
i think it literally can't be two so i

01:56:09.199 --> 01:56:11.520
don't really know

01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:13.920
and it's such a mess over on the on the

01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:16.719
on the democrats side and but it can't

01:56:16.719 --> 01:56:18.480
be these it can't be these guys who are

01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:19.280
just

01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:21.599
pushing whatever button that day i'm

01:56:21.599 --> 01:56:23.119
going to go against the liberals on this

01:56:23.119 --> 01:56:24.080
because that's what they're mad about

01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:25.840
today it's got to be somebody who goes

01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:27.920
back to just regular and i don't want a

01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:30.159
conservative president but i believe i

01:56:30.159 --> 01:56:31.599
live in a democracy and that the

01:56:31.599 --> 01:56:33.760
president should only sometimes reflect

01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:35.679
my values because

01:56:35.679 --> 01:56:38.000
i'm i'm a part of the country i'm not

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.760
the whole country yeah so if i lived in

01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:41.920
a country where i love the president my

01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:44.880
whole lifetime that would be [ __ ] up

01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:47.520
because i only agree with about 38 of

01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:49.679
the people in the country yeah so that's

01:56:49.679 --> 01:56:52.239
to me the the what is the test of what a

01:56:52.239 --> 01:56:54.000
president should be is it that he should

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.560
be compassionate strong all these to me

01:56:56.560 --> 01:56:58.320
what he should be is a representative of

01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:00.480
the people's will he remember this thing

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:02.400
that i said he is a

01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:03.599
president

01:57:03.599 --> 01:57:05.520
he presides like when they talk about

01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:06.960
like real intellectuals talk about it

01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:08.840
and real press guys they say you are

01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:11.520
president they don't say you're the

01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:13.920
president they say you're president

01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:15.840
and obama used to say when it comes to

01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:18.159
president he didn't say being the

01:57:18.159 --> 01:57:19.199
president

01:57:19.199 --> 01:57:21.679
because it's a verb it's present you're

01:57:21.679 --> 01:57:24.719
presiding like i said it's not it's a

01:57:24.719 --> 01:57:26.560
simple job trump always talks about

01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:29.040
leader when you're a leader you're not a

01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:30.000
leader

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.480
you're not a ruler

01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:35.360
you are presiding over a process you're

01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:37.440
presiding over process of equals

01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:39.280
deciding things together you're supposed

01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:41.760
to be just one of the people who was

01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:45.199
chosen to step up and and run [ __ ] for a

01:57:45.199 --> 01:57:47.360
while being told by this group of all

01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:49.360
that's all we also voted for

01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:51.679
what to do that's what the legislators

01:57:51.679 --> 01:57:53.440
and then these nine people who are

01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:55.520
looking after making sure that all that

01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:57.199
it's supposed to result in the right

01:57:57.199 --> 01:57:58.560
thing and keeping after keeping the

01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:00.159
tiller in the right direction yeah but

01:58:00.159 --> 01:58:02.560
it's a pr it's a humble position that's

01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:04.159
why i don't think it belongs to a guy

01:58:04.159 --> 01:58:06.239
like him um i think it's fascinating

01:58:06.239 --> 01:58:07.840
that he took it for as long as for those

01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:08.960
four years

01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:11.599
and they [ __ ] impeached twice if you

01:58:11.599 --> 01:58:14.719
impeach somebody and they win it makes

01:58:14.719 --> 01:58:17.760
them stronger i mean clinton proved that

01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:21.040
it's just so [ __ ] stupid

01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:22.960
if he wasn't if it wasn't for covet we'd

01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:24.239
he'd still

01:58:24.239 --> 01:58:25.760
he'd still be there i don't know i don't

01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:27.599
know it's hard to say he really was

01:58:27.599 --> 01:58:29.040
running hot

01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:29.920
and he

01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:31.679
and he didn't give a [ __ ]

01:58:31.679 --> 01:58:33.520
and that's just a

01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:35.119
something's going to get you same with

01:58:35.119 --> 01:58:38.080
nixon same with caligula just somebody

01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:39.920
something that you left because you

01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:41.840
didn't care same with putin i mean these

01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:44.159
guys who just like they

01:58:44.159 --> 01:58:46.719
create a ball of energy that shoots so

01:58:46.719 --> 01:58:49.119
high but it burns everything around them

01:58:49.119 --> 01:58:51.280
and when they need someone if you stay

01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:52.719
in politics long enough you're going to

01:58:52.719 --> 01:58:54.480
have a moment where if things aren't

01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:55.280
good

01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:56.239
and you look to your right and

01:58:56.239 --> 01:58:58.080
somebody's like [ __ ]

01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:00.480
you and you start to take a dump into

01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:03.040
the ground now if you get your hold on

01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:05.760
the mechanisms hard enough like get rid

01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:07.679
of to me the thing about trump is that

01:59:07.679 --> 01:59:09.920
he had no respect for the democratic

01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:11.760
process to me the thing on the left is

01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:12.880
they have no

01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:15.360
respect for liber for

01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:18.560
liberty this america is about democracy

01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:20.960
and liberty okay it's about that we

01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:22.560
choose amongst ourselves and that

01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:24.880
there's a working fair democracy and

01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:26.480
it's about you could say what you want

01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:29.199
you can believe what you want you can be

01:59:29.199 --> 01:59:31.440
who you want you can have the identity

01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:32.960
you want you can be anything you want

01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:35.199
and no one you and the the great

01:59:35.199 --> 01:59:36.800
american

01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:37.760
um

01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:41.040
ideal is leave people the [ __ ] alone

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:42.560
that's the one they forget it's not

01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:44.880
about like say this say that but leave

01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:47.599
folks alone let people do what they want

01:59:47.599 --> 01:59:49.679
and the left forgot that they don't give

01:59:49.679 --> 01:59:51.440
a [ __ ] about freedom of speech anymore

01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:54.719
they don't get how stupid it is

01:59:54.719 --> 01:59:56.800
to shut people up and how quickly that's

01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:58.239
gonna come around and kick you in the

01:59:58.239 --> 02:00:00.719
ass same thing with trump if you just

02:00:00.719 --> 02:00:02.560
wield authority like this say [ __ ]

02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:04.719
democracy no one's gonna have your back

02:00:04.719 --> 02:00:06.400
yeah no one's gonna be there to to make

02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:07.679
sure you're doing the right thing like

02:00:07.679 --> 02:00:09.280
the press is supposed to do and doesn't

02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:10.800
do anymore

02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:12.800
um so that's to me the two sides have

02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:14.960
[ __ ] up though those two those two

02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:16.480
prints and that the problem is both

02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:18.560
those sides are correct

02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:20.239
to point the finger at the other side

02:00:20.239 --> 02:00:21.599
yes that's why

02:00:21.599 --> 02:00:23.199
this is why we're [ __ ] up that's why

02:00:23.199 --> 02:00:25.119
we're [ __ ] up that's what won't stop

02:00:25.119 --> 02:00:26.880
that's why it becomes a looking glass

02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:28.800
because they don't understand each other

02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:30.719
and yes they are right about each other

02:00:30.719 --> 02:00:32.239
yeah they're right they're right about

02:00:32.239 --> 02:00:33.360
each other

02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:34.960
the left is right about trump trump's

02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:36.159
right about the left and all the people

02:00:36.159 --> 02:00:39.199
are left you know and so it's a mess but

02:00:39.199 --> 02:00:41.679
the thing i count on

02:00:41.679 --> 02:00:44.639
is just human spirit human nature which

02:00:44.639 --> 02:00:47.840
is that we gotta we we like each other

02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:49.360
i think uh

02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:51.760
and we like to laugh at each other

02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:52.840
and

02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:55.760
um and and everybody knows that they're

02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:57.679
full of [ __ ] everybody knows

02:00:57.679 --> 02:00:59.520
it's the thing that's sad about the

02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:00.800
phone to me and this is the last thing

02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:02.320
i'm gonna say because i'm going yeah i'm

02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:04.960
losing my mind

02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:07.599
can i say that last finish this

02:01:07.599 --> 02:01:10.239
you get on a subway train or on a bus or

02:01:10.239 --> 02:01:12.480
in a plane and you look at another

02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:13.840
person and there's that weird eye

02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:16.159
contact thing you're like

02:01:16.159 --> 02:01:18.400
and you look at a person and you kind of

02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:21.199
hate you're we're reptilian like a hell

02:01:21.199 --> 02:01:23.520
[ __ ] [ __ ] that guy yeah he's competition

02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:25.040
or whatever it is

02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:27.440
but you look at a person and you go

02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:29.360
he ain't that bad

02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:30.960
and then you see him look at you and you

02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:32.239
see yourself through his eyes and you

02:01:32.239 --> 02:01:34.400
think i ain't that great

02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:37.199
these are these two very important parts

02:01:37.199 --> 02:01:39.280
he ain't that bad i ain't that great and

02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:41.119
you get that from eye contact and

02:01:41.119 --> 02:01:43.679
personal contact and through

02:01:43.679 --> 02:01:45.360
forced you just around people that you

02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:47.280
don't love around people that you're not

02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:48.719
that aren't like you

02:01:48.719 --> 02:01:49.920
that's why i've always loved new york

02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:51.360
city because i always used to feel like

02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:54.080
that uh but with this thing you just you

02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:55.599
don't you don't have to ever have that

02:01:55.599 --> 02:01:57.440
moment you're just looking into this and

02:01:57.440 --> 02:01:59.840
it keeps and it keeps this magical

02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:01.840
algorithm keeps telling you more and

02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:03.520
more of what you want to feel it doesn't

02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:07.840
give you any it keeps you from any um

02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:09.679
resistance you know

02:02:09.679 --> 02:02:12.000
kids get out of college and they just

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:13.280
feel like idiots because they go in the

02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:14.960
world and every nobody cares what they

02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:15.760
think

02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:17.679
but they start to get stronger every day

02:02:17.679 --> 02:02:19.760
they meet with resistance and also they

02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:21.840
start to hear [ __ ] they don't believe in

02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:23.360
and believe some of it you know what i

02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:25.920
mean and their world expands but this

02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:27.599
thing takes you into a smaller world

02:02:27.599 --> 02:02:29.119
every day smaller and smaller further

02:02:29.119 --> 02:02:30.639
away from other people

02:02:30.639 --> 02:02:33.119
and everybody instead of learning and

02:02:33.119 --> 02:02:35.920
growing everybody's becoming [ __ ]

02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:37.679
that's where trump came from and i don't

02:02:37.679 --> 02:02:39.920
know what's next i really don't

02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:42.960
i don't know what they're gonna do

02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:46.480
that's all i got

02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:47.840
hell yeah

02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:49.599
please don't post this
