true but dude it's coming man because

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.919

00:17:39.919 --> 00:17:40.640
like

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.640
the culture's about to get divided yeah

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.240

the side of the sword

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.559
sword black people are the most

00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:05.600
dangerous that's the anime side

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.160
you're an anime yeah and i think i can't

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.000
say this out loud but i think the anime

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.840
side is kind of more on the baby's team

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.840
really

00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:18.320
anime people are awoken the fact that

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.919
like like there's a bunch of

00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:21.360
like there's a bunch of like people

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.320
around them who indulge in like the yeah

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.240
the stuff not like indulge but like who

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.640
are like

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.080
they're like confused about their gender

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.200
and [ __ ] like there's a lot of those

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:31.919
people

00:18:31.919 --> 00:18:33.520
who like in that community are trying to

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.960
find themselves yeah

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.520
so they're accepting in that way but

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.880
like

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.799
their thoughts are more like the baby

00:18:40.799 --> 00:18:42.799
stones yeah yeah they like a nice little

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:43.760

yeah yeah yeah if there is a black civil

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.840
war and the baby's side loses would you

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.600

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.080
baby up

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.640

yeah they are going to fall to it

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.360
eventually thin is the razor's edge yeah

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:31.919
dude

00:19:31.919 --> 00:19:33.600
kareem son stabbed the guy he got the

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.799
worst part of the curse dude

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.840

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.880

between magic johnson's son

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.919

true you know yeah like quest love or

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.400
whatever just being like shouldn't be

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.360
saying all that

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.200
yeah it's like well they're like how

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.360

how much the baby 23.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.120

not that young but he is young

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.280
he shot someone too he's got a body

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.840
really yeah

00:21:17.919 --> 00:21:19.679
that seems self-defense that seems worse

00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:22.320
than what he said what's self-defense

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.720
technically

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.720
he stood his ground in walmart he's he's

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.840
trying to

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:36.240
[Laughter]

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.440
do you think the white people will join

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.840
in on the black civil war

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.760
i think they're going to go like yeah i

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.799
think we're going to sit back for a

00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:43.919
little buck

00:21:43.919 --> 00:21:46.159
as an ally i think i'm going to let them

00:21:46.159 --> 00:21:47.919
yeah the allies are nowhere to be found

00:21:47.919 --> 00:21:51.039
the allies will have to join but then

00:21:51.039 --> 00:21:52.559
that'll it'll be like world war one i

00:21:52.559 --> 00:21:55.120
felt like this flag would drag the

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.880
big dogs in then you're gonna get the

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.400
white patriots getting involved they'll

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.679
be on the side of the

00:21:59.679 --> 00:22:01.840
the baby thanks for the babies yes yeah

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.000
man it's because we could use this this

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.919
black civil war

00:22:05.919 --> 00:22:07.520
i think it's a white wolf proxy they're

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.679
using like blacks to like

00:22:09.679 --> 00:22:11.280
instigate the old blacks in the change

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.280

00:22:16.159 --> 00:22:17.280
and the peels dude

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.679
yeah you want to know what the appeal is

00:22:19.679 --> 00:22:20.559
this i found this

00:22:20.559 --> 00:22:23.520
woke war i became the the center of a

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.960
bit of a woke war not really

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.640
not really a crazy one but i just i

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.159
tweeted out that the green knight sucked

00:22:30.159 --> 00:22:32.720
how would i have yes it did suck how

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.840
would i have known

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.320
that it was a woke issue i thought it

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.080
was like an art like in uh king arthur

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:38.960
yeah it was

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.400
so what the hell but everybody that was

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.240
like no it was actually [ __ ] amazing

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.600
has he him

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.000
yeah like is it like a woke term i get

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.919
the people mad that i said it sucked

00:22:47.919 --> 00:22:49.760
were all woke i clicked all their

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.080
profiles it's a weird thing

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.840
do they know like the rest of like all

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.760
that dude there's myths from like king

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.360
arthur that are strictly about dealing

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.679
with like annoying women

00:22:59.679 --> 00:23:02.159
there's a myth of a knight and like

00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:03.440
that's probably why they like it

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.360
because this one they caught it the main

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.360
character is kind of a

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.760
coward the whole time yeah yeah that's

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.360
arthur is it king arthur no

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.000
king arthur's a man he's an old who's

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.280
who is king arthur's young

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.640
bro lancelot oh nice

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.400
was it about lancelot or no no it's

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.480
about gawain

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.559
kuwait gawain who the hell is colleen

00:23:26.559 --> 00:23:28.720
no he's not the green knight he fought

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.320
the green knight

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.679
it does make sense though because nobody

00:23:31.679 --> 00:23:33.679
fights once huh

00:23:33.679 --> 00:23:35.760
the whole movie sucks dude that's that's

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.159
hard i was so excited did they ever sit

00:23:38.159 --> 00:23:39.360
at any round table

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.720
they did sit at our round table which

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.640
was exciting when you see the round

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.159
table you're like this does rule

00:23:44.159 --> 00:23:45.440
first half hour you're like all right

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.200
little slow but this is going to rule

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.640
yeah and then you're just stuck in the

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.600
doldrums for like an

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.640
hour and a half of [ __ ] nothing why

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.880
why nothing that's bizarre you see come

arthurian mythology yeah but you know

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.240

i watched joseph campbell videos on

00:26:23.919 --> 00:26:25.440
youtube that's more than every single

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.720
one if you have black lives matter in

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.240

00:26:29.919 --> 00:26:32.880
i'll go on the record

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.039
yeah there was the one uh parsival i

00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:37.679
think was like

00:26:37.679 --> 00:26:39.440
some form of like those myths and they

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.960
had one called like the

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.320
the knights had to go through a ritual

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.440
it was it was just like a thing they

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.039
made up of like the

00:26:45.039 --> 00:26:47.039
bucking bed or something so they get in

00:26:47.039 --> 00:26:48.720
full armor and you lay in bed and the

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.240
bed would just start rumbling and like

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:50.960
they would like

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.240
throw stuff at you and there's like

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.840
blood would come up like you just get

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.279
spears thrown at you and

00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:56.400
when they're like it was funny in the

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.640
joseph campbell video he was like so you

00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.679
know he's like you always got to figure

00:26:59.679 --> 00:27:00.880
out like what do these things mean he

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:01.520
was like

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.039
this is the male experience of the

00:27:03.039 --> 00:27:04.880
female temperament and the roomful

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.600
people were like

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.200
he's like you just got to endure that's

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.880
funny you can't fix it you got to endure

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.200
it

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.480
yeah and it was just like that jfc

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.960
foundation

00:27:19.279 --> 00:27:22.159

00:27:22.399 --> 00:27:23.679

demeanor when it came to taking pictures

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.720

and then eventually the guys your whole

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.280

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.319

it

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.760
because the best teams in the world are

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:07.280

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.599
died in jail oh

01:00:21.599 --> 01:00:23.839
yeah also some of the cops that were at

01:00:23.839 --> 01:00:25.119
the

01:00:25.119 --> 01:00:27.200
riot thing in january 6 are like killing

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.200
themselves yeah one of them did

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.040
two three two three we have now three of

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:33.599
the cops killed themselves yeah

01:00:33.599 --> 01:00:36.160
three the cops ptsd or from the clintons

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.280
i don't know three people

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.119
it just is like bizarre three people who

01:00:39.119 --> 01:00:40.640
were there apparently that event was so

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.319
traumatic dude

01:00:42.319 --> 01:00:44.319
it's like how much am i how much ptsd am

01:00:44.319 --> 01:00:45.920
i being exposed to a family parties dude

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:47.920
if it's probably for a cop

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.359
like if you're a cop there they're

01:00:49.359 --> 01:00:50.640
probably conflicted because they all

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.240
probably wanted to storm the capital

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:56.350
four four four cops get that one

01:00:56.350 --> 01:00:59.880
[Laughter]

01:01:00.079 --> 01:01:02.240
what's like the i mean cops deal with

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.000
like all kinds of wild crazy [ __ ] what

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.760
is it about like dudes and like

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.520
i said jeans wasn't there like a thing

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:08.799
where a bunch of the cops

01:01:08.799 --> 01:01:11.520
testified and it ended up kind of like

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:13.839
hurting the case to do an investigation

01:01:13.839 --> 01:01:15.440
really i think a bunch of cops testified

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.119
in everyone all the public the

01:01:17.119 --> 01:01:20.240
the favor the people that were in favor

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.440
of investigating this

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.839
yeah saw these testimonies we're like no

01:01:23.839 --> 01:01:24.720
we're good

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.000
we don't need to investigate yeah well

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.520
most cops also aren't like bleeding

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:29.040
heart liberals so they probably were

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:29.839
like

01:01:29.839 --> 01:01:31.040
when they were getting stormed they were

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.119
probably like definitely they were like

01:01:33.119 --> 01:01:34.319
opening gates

01:01:34.319 --> 01:01:36.880
yeah they really were gates yeah yeah

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.079
people thought it was a conspiracy

01:01:38.079 --> 01:01:39.520
they're like why'd they open the gates

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.119

01:01:41.119 --> 01:01:43.599
