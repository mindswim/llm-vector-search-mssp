00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.320
i literally sat down here

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.119
seconds before the show started i got

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:47.520
here

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.560
um exactly at four

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.759
because of uh the [ __ ] subway i guess

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:54.000
the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.200
heat and everything else oh

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.560
pain in the ass we will get uh into the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.920
um

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.119
shenanigans that was uh

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.920
the east side dave show last night um

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.599
quickly though is everything cool with

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.520
this [ __ ] desk

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.560
yeah cool enough what what is

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.160
actually [ __ ] up with it so the uh the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.840
top got ripped off

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.680
yeah so the screws going uh

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.560
perpendicular to the top into the legs

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.959
on the right side got pulled out

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.959
so if you want to lift the right your

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.560
right side of the desk

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.519
the top it'll come up so those screws

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.200
would have to be come out maybe shift it

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.599
over an

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.360
inch the uh the shelf cracked off

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.120
near the tv so that the screws toward

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.200
you stayed in but the ones by the tv

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.840
broke off so i had to re-push that up

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.319
and screw them in again differently

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.080
and everything else the electronics

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.239
worked fine oh the lights and everything

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:56.560
yeah

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.879
there was a regular bob vela last night

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.560
yeah

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.280
totally no no reason for him to have to

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.159
[ __ ] do

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.159
exactly [ __ ] like that added hours

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.280
unless somebody's

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.000
being a [ __ ] idiot um oh my god

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.720

the stand for the roast battle

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.840
uh first i went over there to hoboken

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.360
and did artie lang's

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.159
podcast which i think it's like the last

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:27.040
one

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.680
or the last couple that he's ever doing

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.040
i don't know

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.640
what's going on with artie's show i

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.519
guess uh you know he was telling stories

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.120
of being um

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.400
swindled a bit by his um

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.400
uh the people that take care of uh the

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.159
subscription prices and and

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.799
rates and and charging and everything um

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:47.200
and

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.560
all of a sudden he was not getting money

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.239
for it so i don't know what the [ __ ]

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.120
that was all about

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.760
but we had a great time hung out um at

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.360

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.760
and then and then took the ferry back

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.599
and went to the stand for the um

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.400
lewis j gomez hosts the rose paddle over

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.680

and they were like heckling him okay so

00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:56.320
he was doing comment now was he asked to

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.720

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.320

00:10:04.079 --> 00:10:06.640
heckling him yes

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.079
and i guess he got upset oh yeah

00:10:10.079 --> 00:10:13.040
why would he get upset

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:16.240
i don't think he was in his right mind

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.600
now does he have mental problems

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.640
oh yeah i'm just looking in the class

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.600
and i'm getting some

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.000
indications of things it was never

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.040
obvious

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.640
but there were signs that maybe

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.000
something could but nothing ever

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.920
happened so i was like oh it's just it

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.040
was always just you know

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.279
it's stevie woo you know a work or a bit

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:40.160
when he would uh be angry yeah we did

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.040
stuff

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.880
um and especially at dave like dave is

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.640
dave's dave if you do a show with dave

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.519
you know shit's gonna go down shit's

00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:53.440
gonna [ __ ] happen

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.160
uh he's gonna say dumb [ __ ] that gets

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:56.959
people mad

00:10:56.959 --> 00:11:00.320
yes but it's his [ __ ] show and if

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.720
you're doing comedy and he heckles you

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.880
is he supposed to be a comedian what the

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.959
[ __ ] does stevie lou do

00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:09.920
i can't believe i'm saying this stevie

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.040
lou

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.480
the [ __ ] is a stevie lou

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.120
he has some sort of corporate job he

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.640
comes in here dressed up and he can

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.560
print stuff for free at work so

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.640
it has to be a big enough place that's

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.640
the that's the upside

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.959
that was his qualifications for becoming

00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:28.000
the [ __ ] i heard

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.320
he became the producer of the eastside

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.560
dave show because he was in the audience

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.519
when the other producer who was duty hat

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:36.880
guy

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.399
a year ago exactly a year ago exactly

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:44.160
judy hat left because he couldn't take

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.240
because he left his facebook open and we

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.240
read some message

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.079
between him and his girlfriend i forgot

00:11:50.079 --> 00:11:51.920
what it was

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.480
and again that's fair game you leave the

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.360
[ __ ] open

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.600

[ __ ] jones

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.800
he reached into the toilet

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.760
and put on his little paper duty hat but

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.560
he was known as

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.160
jared jared yeah yeah i don't know we

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.360

gone forever like [ __ ] dave the

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.200
intern

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.079
our jewish intern friend and then he

00:12:42.079 --> 00:12:42.720
turns up

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.040
as eastside dave's producer i'm like

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.480
what the [ __ ]

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.720
how did that happen anyway yeah he left

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.320
his facebook open he got pissed that

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.600
people read his [ __ ]

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.040
and he walked out leaving his career of

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.920
eastside dave's producer right then and

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.160
there on the spot

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.120
they needed a producer and they there's

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.480
stevie lew

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.079
in the [ __ ] on the bleachers

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:09.760

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.839
be my producer or did he say i'll be

00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:12.720
your producer

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.880
i think he was positioning for the job

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.160
beforehand

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.680
because there was some turmoil with

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.600
jared you know it wasn't just

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.600
a facebook thing so stevie lew was

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.720
trying to sneak in there

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.320
when he could and try to lend his hands

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.240
okay so he's the producer for a year

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.440
yeah and he's had some run-ins here over

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.480
the course of the year right

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.240
he's been a problem a couple of times

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.600
yeah yes but it was like

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.040

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.440
dave's show everything in dave's show is

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.279

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.000
arrested for

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.400
like you know destruction of property or

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.400
something like like

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.240
keith was really gonna have him [ __ ]

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.520
arrested

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.799
uh i didn't think that was necessary

00:20:02.799 --> 00:20:05.600
but um what's the status now is he

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.520
persona non grata here

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.679
do we have to put his picture up like uh

00:20:09.679 --> 00:20:12.720
like mine is serious

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.559
is he our first like you're fired for

00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:19.760

threats in the workplace he wasn't paid

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.080
so it's hard to say you're fired

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.559
did he did dave pay no one paid him no

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:27.360
no

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.120
he did that for a year for free he's

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.120
like kramer yes

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.520
well i don't even really work here

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.600
that's what makes this so difficult

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.360
he didn't have a platform for a year

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.520
though yeah it's kind of the payment i

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.159
guess

00:20:40.159 --> 00:20:43.039
mr kramer i don't know what this is

00:20:43.039 --> 00:20:44.640
supposed to be

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.679
just trying to get by remember that one

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:48.570
where he was working

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:52.000
[Laughter]

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.640
old man leland's old man leland's

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.520
i got to get these reports in what's in

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.840
your briefcase

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.159
crackers yeah that's so that's what he

00:21:04.159 --> 00:21:05.760
was he was kramer

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:10.559
at uh leland um

00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:12.320
so that's it we shan't be seeing him

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.400
again yeah i mean

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.919
i made that immediate decision i was

00:21:15.919 --> 00:21:17.520
just like he's oh forever

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.400
absolutely good decision yeah it's just

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:20.799
like

00:21:20.799 --> 00:21:23.280
people have been uh fired for a lot less

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.039
so i don't know if we can consider that

00:21:25.039 --> 00:21:26.880
a firing though like you said

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.400
if someone's not getting paid and

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.159

lunge at somebody and and as uh big a

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.240
pointed out

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.520

the the cost of the desk is uh estimated

to be

00:27:16.159 --> 00:27:19.440
i i don't this this actually is an eight

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.840

with all the other pieces and stuff

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.399
obviously it's not it doesn't have to

00:27:26.399 --> 00:27:27.760
it's not eight thousand dollars to fix

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.760
the [ __ ] debt but the whole thing put

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.320
together

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.880
it was built by professionals that put

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:33.679
together

00:27:33.679 --> 00:27:37.679
the desks for uh cbs for cbs news and uh

00:27:37.679 --> 00:27:39.919
colbert's show and all that that it's

00:27:39.919 --> 00:27:40.880
that guy

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.520
who built this set the set of deaths we

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.919
we have this section we've got another

00:27:45.919 --> 00:27:47.760
section over here so it's very

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.440
professional it wasn't just you know

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.000
some guy with uh a hammer and some

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.760
[ __ ] nails putting a desk together

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.960
uh this is a professional desk a great

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:57.520
deal

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.559
i know it's a beautiful desk it was very

00:27:59.559 --> 00:28:01.200
disrespectful

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.039
uh of stevie lou to uh

00:28:05.039 --> 00:28:06.880
to uh destroy you know throw it over

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.399
like that now

00:28:08.399 --> 00:28:09.600
you've been working with the guy for a

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.440
[ __ ] year he doesn't understand what

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.640
you do

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.080
and that occasionally you rile people up

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:19.440
what never ceases to shock me about

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.640
stephen

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.360
is that he doesn't seem to still

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.919
understand the concept of the show

00:28:25.919 --> 00:28:30.080
which is playing around ball boston and

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.679
no one ball busts themselves as hard as

00:28:33.679 --> 00:28:34.399
i bust

00:28:34.399 --> 00:28:37.919
my own balls of course dick warts

00:28:37.919 --> 00:28:40.000
living in your parents basement having

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.840
skin cancer going through

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.320
a divorce and trying to get off of xanax

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.039
oh my god i don't set myself up as this

00:28:47.039 --> 00:28:49.679
fantastic hero but at the same time

00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:50.399
because

00:28:50.399 --> 00:28:53.039
i am going to take shots at myself we

00:28:53.039 --> 00:28:54.720
take shots at other people

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.159
my god roy harder has been called

00:28:58.159 --> 00:29:00.559
the worst things that anyone i mean

00:29:00.559 --> 00:29:01.279
[ __ ]

00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:04.240
hitler has been complimented more than

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.279
roy harder

00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:08.559
but yet you don't see roy trying to tip

00:29:08.559 --> 00:29:10.240
over his keyboard

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.760
or smash me in the head with it no um

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.799
it was uh very strange i

00:29:16.799 --> 00:29:19.520
have to be honest it was uh it was quite

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.320
odd

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.840
and i didn't understand why stevie

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:24.240
didn't realize just what we were doing

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.000
until after the show

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.840
he told me that he was mixing booze

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.440
prescription pills

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.880
and that probably uh led to a uh a bad

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:33.600
uh

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.520
breakdown there and i advised him

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.440
not to do that but he didn't take the

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.799
dave man's advice

00:29:40.799 --> 00:29:43.360
right fixing booze and pills that can

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.440
often lead to psychotic episodes as we

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.039
witnessed last night

00:29:47.039 --> 00:29:50.240
wow um dave

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:54.080
uh he he called up

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.520
just before you did and

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.480
like his biggest concern by the way if

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.440
you noticed

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.440
was that people wouldn't think he was an

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.880
open micro

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.159
that was his [ __ ] his takeaway from

00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:10.159
everything that was said and his

00:30:10.159 --> 00:30:11.840
volatile [ __ ]

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.919
uh throwing over the desk and trying to

00:30:13.919 --> 00:30:15.120
get to you to

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.760
physically assault you and all that we

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:18.720
had talked about

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.600
for the past half hour here all he took

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.480
away from it was

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.440
hey by the way i'm not an open miker i

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.240
do

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.000
and he tried to plug one of his [ __ ]

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.600
gigs yeah

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.000
a news flash he's very much an open mic

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.440
but you know what's fine

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.320
here's the thing though when i gave him

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:36.880
the the

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.440
the spotlight when i considered giving

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.760
him the spotlight to do his comedy set

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.679
it actually didn't start off as me

00:30:43.679 --> 00:30:45.760
heckling i was i was saying okay give

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.120
uh four or five minutes this is the

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.679
least i could do but if john and garrett

00:30:49.679 --> 00:30:51.279
would testify

00:30:51.279 --> 00:30:55.360
his last joke was a two-minute

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.720
[ __ ] incoherent rambling that sounded

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.799
more like he was about to confess to cry

00:31:00.799 --> 00:31:04.000
do we have that it was yeah

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.480

if you look at the video i moved back

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.679
but actually i moved back because the

00:33:35.679 --> 00:33:38.159
wooden desk landed on my leg

00:33:38.159 --> 00:33:41.200

00:33:43.679 --> 00:33:44.480
i'm gonna have to

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.360
contact my attorney neil under and we

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.679

00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:50.240
dollars

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.600
wow you have a lot of lawsuits in the uh

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.000
in the old mill uh ready to get ready to

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:56.640
come out

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.679
um well i was planning on on on uh being

00:33:59.679 --> 00:34:00.960
in the olympics

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:04.159
2020 and so my sprinting career is over

00:34:04.159 --> 00:34:06.000
because of the leg injury i suffered but

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.039
in all honesty

00:34:07.039 --> 00:34:09.200
uh so the death comes out that's why i

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.280
moved back then i get up and i start

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.079
walking towards

00:34:12.079 --> 00:34:14.399
uh stevie but then big a uh hugs them

00:34:14.399 --> 00:34:16.000
and i say okay this is all good

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.079
and yet you know i i do want to say this

00:34:18.079 --> 00:34:19.359
for compound media because

00:34:19.359 --> 00:34:21.359
by the way i want to forget about just

00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:23.359
the text apologize just for

00:34:23.359 --> 00:34:25.359
the destruction though i i'm not going

00:34:25.359 --> 00:34:27.280
to you know claim responsibility because

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.720
honestly i had no idea that this

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.320
psychopath would have a nervous

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.280
breakdown

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.159
on your show but still it's a bad look

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:34.480
and

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.399
i i want to say if you look at the video

00:34:36.399 --> 00:34:38.720
my main concern was restoring order to

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.520
that death

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:42.320
yes i saw you immediately tried to uh

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:42.960
fix it

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.040
it was like as if a child had broken

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.079
something his parents

00:34:46.079 --> 00:34:48.159
owned and was trying to glue it back

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:49.919
together it reminded me of the brady

00:34:49.919 --> 00:34:51.359
bunch episode where they shouldn't have

00:34:51.359 --> 00:34:52.560
played ball in the house

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.800
and the vas broke and they glued it

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:55.599
together and

00:34:55.599 --> 00:34:57.920
didn't do a very good job that's kind of

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.520
what it reminded me it was very uh

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.400
innocent

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.320
uh and by the way if eastside dave is

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.160
calling you a psychopath

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.200
uh you are a [ __ ] psychopath

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.160
well i have my own mental issues but by

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.200
the way

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.520
we have had conversations via steve's

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.560
off the uh

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.119
and i have said to him look dude i i've

00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:18.160
gone through all

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:21.119
this [ __ ] and i know you've got to leave

00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:23.760
pills and stuff and all that behind you

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.200
yeah because it's this is what

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.920
happens when you mix all that stuff yeah

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.160
and he can't deny it because he

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.280
told me last night after the show man

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.880
you know i've been there and i'm like

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.400
dude by the way the

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.640
issues you know my heart really goes out

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.400
to him you know what his issues are

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.720
what is uh um he's not sure who she

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.680
should go out with

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:49.040
a hot chick who is a little bit nutty

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.359
or a chick who's not as attractive but

00:35:51.359 --> 00:35:52.480
who's nice

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.560
those are the quote-unquote issues i

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.400
have goddamn skin cancer

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.000
i'm living my parents basement and i'm

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.440
going through a divorce

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.440
yeah but his issues are balancing

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.599
between two [ __ ] chicks

00:36:03.599 --> 00:36:05.760
the world should cry him a goddamn river

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.359
i mean give me a break already

00:36:07.359 --> 00:36:09.599
i i hear you some people have no

00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:10.480
perspective

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.720
and um you know on on what true

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.760
true issues in life are by the way uh

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.040
even though it would be uh safer

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.599
to go out with the average looking girl

00:36:23.599 --> 00:36:24.960
that isn't a nut

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.359
you gotta go for the maniac hot girl i

00:36:27.359 --> 00:36:28.320
will just

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.560
i will just put that out there well i

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.400

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.800
don't marry her at the hard rock cafe in

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.560
front of anthony and jim norton

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.119
during the match my sister dawn does the

00:36:39.119 --> 00:36:40.960
wedding by the way she um

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.800
she does have the business she i think

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.880
you were like her first

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.920

98

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:30.400
in common with you from the firearms to

one of

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.880
well let's see i i don't like uh

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.200
necessarily getting uh

00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:00.000
uh having women make false claims

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.480
against me let's just say

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:06.240
that's good like i do yeah right

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:07.440
just because you go through something

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.520
doesn't mean you liked it

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.599
that's no i understand if i had your

00:51:11.599 --> 00:51:13.359
money i'd be used to it and

00:51:13.359 --> 00:51:16.079
probably have some resources to deal

00:51:16.079 --> 00:51:16.640
with it

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.280
let's just say you agree with a hundred

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.559
percent of what i said

00:51:20.559 --> 00:51:22.960
i think

00:51:27.599 --> 00:51:29.520
yeah so uh what did you think of the

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:32.000
whole um dave thing

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.839

00:51:33.839 --> 00:51:35.520
speak for a lot of listeners and

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.440
i'll give you kind of a quick 10 second

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.760
history on on my history with the show

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:42.400
i started out as a cern guy and and at

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:43.839

uncircumcised

00:52:14.079 --> 00:52:15.920
and it's uncircumcised apparently

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:18.800
russian girls are like

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:26.400

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.480
multitask right now uh

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.319

00:52:30.319 --> 00:52:32.720
the red lights and exactly

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.480
they don't arrest us down here i mean if

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.000
you're not

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.520
some cities you can actually drive

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.280
through red lights and cops won't even

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:41.200

00:52:46.079 --> 00:52:47.119
uh

00:52:47.119 --> 00:52:48.800
whatever you called force yeah the whole

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.960
point was i had clicked on and i hadn't

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.720
seen any of those other shows before and

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:53.359
i'm

00:52:53.359 --> 00:52:54.720
catching the video and i'm catching a

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.960
commentary on it and i'm one of the

00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:57.839
listeners that

00:52:57.839 --> 00:52:59.760
pretty much just listens to you

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.040
exclusively and

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.559
some of the other shows i know gavin and

00:53:02.559 --> 00:53:03.920
some of the other guys i was just going

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:04.960
to say

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.640
that was really good that i i really

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:07.920
appreciate you kind of incorporating

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.280
some of that others i mean i know it was

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.160
dramatic and

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:12.640
yes but i think that turned me on to i

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.240
really want to see more of that

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:16.559
and even if you i know it would be some

00:53:16.559 --> 00:53:18.240
work but even do like the best of all

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:19.760
these different shows

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.200
at the end of the week i think it's

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.119
going to turn more of the listeners

00:53:23.119 --> 00:53:24.480
that are kind of like me that are

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.880
exclusive to you on to some of these

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:27.599
other options

00:53:27.599 --> 00:53:30.559
that's uh that would be a good thing why

00:53:30.559 --> 00:53:32.079
don't we should just put that

00:53:32.079 --> 00:53:35.040

can uh see what the [ __ ] that show's

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.520

enough exposure

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:46.480

left-handed wow some old piece of [ __ ]

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:03.520
trying to hit a pinnacle oh just

00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:06.319
backpedaling

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:09.040
he looks like he's

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:12.720
here's the actual uh shooting

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:15.760
of some guy that was uh in the i guess

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:17.440
in the dog walk park that was

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:20.559

behind a dugout and was shooting onto

00:58:35.359 --> 00:58:36.960
the field from behind the dugout so you

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.799

uh and normal facebook ernie came out

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.160
with a statement

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:33.280
because anytime something happens

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:36.480
especially trump related people say well

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:38.960

saying that he uh has nothing to do with

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.119
this and he is outraged by earth

01:01:43.119 --> 01:01:46.240
so bernie got uh right away not on it

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.400

clip of bernie

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.720

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.720
like i could play second yeah

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.119
do you need a replacement without

01:01:55.119 --> 01:01:56.799
objection

01:01:56.799 --> 01:02:00.880
madam president just been informed

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.559
that the alleged shooter at the

01:02:02.559 --> 01:02:05.200
republican baseball practice this

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.559
morning

01:02:06.559 --> 01:02:08.880
is someone who apparently volunteered on

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:09.920
my presidential

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:13.680
campaign i am thanks to capitol police

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.400
he felt the burn of a bullet penetrating

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.599
his head and let me be

01:02:17.599 --> 01:02:21.119
as clear as i can be

01:02:21.119 --> 01:02:24.640
violence of any kind is unacceptable

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:28.559
in our society and i condemn this action

01:02:28.559 --> 01:02:31.839
in the strongest possible terms

01:02:31.839 --> 01:02:34.160
yeah but what does that really mean only

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.520
come about

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.799
through non-violent action and anything

01:02:38.799 --> 01:02:40.000
else

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.400
runs counter to our most deeply held

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:48.079
american values i know i speak for the

01:02:48.079 --> 01:02:49.599
entire country

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:52.240
saying that my hopes and prayers are

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:54.160
that representative scalise

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.720
congressional staff and the capitol

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.200
police officers who were wounded

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:02.640
make a quick and full recovery

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.039
i also want to thank the capitol police

01:03:05.039 --> 01:03:07.119
for their heroic actions

01:03:07.119 --> 01:03:09.280
to prevent further harm there you go

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:11.039
thank you all right

01:03:11.039 --> 01:03:13.520
thank you uh bernie that speech bernie's

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.319
out there

01:03:14.319 --> 01:03:16.799
uh now this will uh obviously turn into

01:03:16.799 --> 01:03:17.839
a big uh

01:03:17.839 --> 01:03:19.680
gun control issue they're gonna be ah

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:22.079
but but apparently the guy

01:03:22.079 --> 01:03:24.799
was a felon i think he had he had some

01:03:24.799 --> 01:03:26.480
kind of record so he shouldn't have been

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:30.160
uh legally able to even get a gun um

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.079
i have no idea but it's going to turn

01:03:32.079 --> 01:03:33.359
into that whole issue but think about

01:03:33.359 --> 01:03:34.000
this

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.960
uh if the capital police uh and i guess

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.880
it's part of one of the uh senators

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.960
security team weren't there they're

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.000
saying this could have been

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.680
a real bad situation if it was just this

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:46.319
guy

01:03:46.319 --> 01:03:48.160
and a bunch of people on a softball or

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:51.119
baseball field without uh any protection

01:03:51.119 --> 01:03:53.280
um that would have been a problem gulps

as he inspected the house he also got a

01:07:12.799 --> 01:07:14.480
couple aids in that that's kind of sad

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:15.680

yeah always all right billy you're gonna

01:07:22.319 --> 01:07:23.280
have helped me at the

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:26.079
baseball game yeah about the old jeepers

01:07:26.079 --> 01:07:27.440
thank you senator

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.839
this is going to be great [ __ ]

01:07:29.839 --> 01:07:30.880
plugged getting

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:34.480
shot uh just [ __ ] crazy

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:37.520
but if if the capital uh police

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:40.400
weren't there as security for those

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:41.280
people

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:43.839
uh the guy would have had carte blanche

01:07:43.839 --> 01:07:45.520
to just shoot whoever the [ __ ] he wanted

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.359
so again the only thing that stopped

01:07:47.359 --> 01:07:49.119
that guy was somebody else with a gun

01:07:49.119 --> 01:07:51.359
because scalise was there yeah it

01:07:51.359 --> 01:07:52.799
wouldn't have had any place if scalise

01:07:52.799 --> 01:07:53.839
wasn't there he was the only one that

01:07:53.839 --> 01:07:55.520
like was important enough to have

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:58.240
yeah have capitol police yeah you think

01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.839
all the other guys would have something

01:07:59.839 --> 01:08:00.559
but it just

01:08:00.559 --> 01:08:01.760
you wouldn't even heard about it if it

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.920
wasn't there yeah yeah

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.359
something happened at a baseball game

01:08:05.359 --> 01:08:07.839
yeah wounded dozens

01:08:07.839 --> 01:08:11.039
yeah and then uh the stories that were

01:08:11.039 --> 01:08:11.680
coming out

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.359
because a lot of these guys are

01:08:13.359 --> 01:08:14.720
ex-military

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.319
so all of them had stories there was one

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:18.400
old guy that was apparently a retired

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:19.120
general

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:21.920
and he's like my marine instincts kicked

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:22.239
in

01:08:22.239 --> 01:08:24.159
he actually said it on there he's like i

01:08:24.159 --> 01:08:25.520
low crawled

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:28.319
to the dugout and then assessed the

01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:29.440
situation

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.719
he had this thing and then another guy

01:08:30.719 --> 01:08:32.560
who was a medic uh

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:35.040
combat medic was uh waiting in the the

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:35.839
second he heard the

01:08:35.839 --> 01:08:38.640
the shooting stop he crawled out and

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.159
started administering uh

01:08:40.159 --> 01:08:43.440
combat field combat first aid hello

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:44.880
crawled and then beat the [ __ ] out of a

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.480
random asian boy

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:49.040
it had nothing to do with anything ah i

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.560
grabbed a hand grenade

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.480
and i lobbed it and realized it was a

01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:54.000
baseball

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.550
i didn't have a grenade

01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:57.359
[Laughter]

01:08:57.359 --> 01:08:58.719
just having some kind of [ __ ]

01:08:58.719 --> 01:09:00.719
flashbacks

01:09:00.719 --> 01:09:04.480
and in your halls get in your halls

01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:06.239
that's out there with a shovel by second

01:09:06.239 --> 01:09:08.319
base trying to

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:11.520
dig deep my friend

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:14.159
that's [ __ ] up though i mean uh i i

01:09:14.159 --> 01:09:15.520
think

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:18.239
i i don't like saying that that people

01:09:18.239 --> 01:09:18.880
can't

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:20.480
speak their mind and say what they want

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:23.679
and uh that's fine i'm for 100 freedom

01:09:23.679 --> 01:09:24.319
of speech

01:09:24.319 --> 01:09:27.600
uh but i have to think some of the news

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.520
and the organizations that the news is

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:30.719
kind of uh

01:09:30.719 --> 01:09:33.839
they're left-leaning mainstream media

01:09:33.839 --> 01:09:34.719
kind of

01:09:34.719 --> 01:09:37.600
grabs hold of uh certain activist groups

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.120
and gives them a voice and

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.799
and uh i i'm almost thinking they're a

01:09:40.799 --> 01:09:43.120
little culpable in some of this [ __ ]

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:46.480
there's such a hatred of the fact that

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:48.640
donald trump was elected president

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:51.040
um that the left has lost their [ __ ]

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:51.839
minds on this

01:09:51.839 --> 01:09:54.400
i mean we see it on a daily basis i know

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:55.280
a lot of people

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.960
a lot of liberals progressives whatever

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.800
[ __ ] you want to call um

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:01.520
would would deny that but we see it i

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.000
have never

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.080
in all my years seen a collection of

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.239
people that are so upset

01:10:06.239 --> 01:10:08.719
for so long about the election of a

01:10:08.719 --> 01:10:09.760
[ __ ] president

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:10.880
there were plenty of people that were

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.400
mad at obama getting elected plenty of

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.120
people mad

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.880
bush got elected whatever and then you

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:16.560
just kind of move on

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:19.760
but this is just going on and on and

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.480
and the the violence behind it some of

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:23.440
the antifa

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:26.320
people communist organizations that just

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.120
want to go and

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.880
uh deny freedom of speech and punch

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:30.320
people in the face and things like that

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.080
like it's bringing out this violence and

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:33.840
i can't help but believe

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:37.280
that this nut was influenced by that

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.400
and these are some of the people that

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.640
say like video games influence people

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.640
yeah and then it's still happening yeah

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.040
i i i actually still say that

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.440

years why

01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:25.679
you know why not in context it's not

01:32:25.679 --> 01:32:27.440
like a doctor is saying it or

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:30.080
uh congress is testifying and he's

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:31.360
dropping n bombs

01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:33.199
like in comet you gotta you gotta give

01:32:33.199 --> 01:32:35.440
it the context so if it's a joke

01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:43.040
like i'm not going to do it

01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:45.199

thought it was firecrackers

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.400
and then anytime firecrackers are going

01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:05.119
