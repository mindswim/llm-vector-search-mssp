comment yeah it's my favorite comment

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.529
yeah he um he was hired by SNL Saturday

00:14:35.529 --> 00:14:37.300
Night Live and then the controversy

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.980
happened where they went back and listen

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.000
to a podcast right and he said a word

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.800
which if you listen to it he's like he

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.450
was saying what they would say right he

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:48.279
was doing a character piece almost but

00:14:48.279 --> 00:14:49.870
it's character yeah what so it doesn't

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:51.490
even matter I mean it's just it's you

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:52.839
know it's like the game of telephone

00:14:52.839 --> 00:14:54.880
it's like you know it just people just

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.459
say it happened and then it happened and

00:14:56.459 --> 00:14:59.800
and so then some people weren't and

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.010
weren't just didn't feel safe with his

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:04.050
they didn't feel safe with this higher

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:08.890
so they he his higher got retracted he's

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:10.870
not at SNL instead he's with the hyenas

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.670
right now and what it is in this [ __ ]

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:16.870
construction site yeah but but yeah and

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.029
you know I supported him throughout the

00:15:19.029 --> 00:15:21.850
whole thing that didn't I don't know a

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:23.920
funny comments that yeah yeah I mean

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.380
it's just it's an it's an unfortunate

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.850
thing that we're living through this era

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.350
where comedians are under the microscope

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:32.740
and it's the result of the journalists

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.570
and how low their standards gun they're

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.399
looking for anything to write an article

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:37.660
about to make a name for themselves

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.130
that's when they have Twitter accounts

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.020
that's why they get verified that's why

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.300
they try to treat tweet jokes it's why

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.600
they treat like you know hardline you

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.060
know headlines and say this has happened

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.190
because its attention their crack [ __ ]

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:53.829
for cliques their their crack [ __ ] for

00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:56.380
self aggrandizing behavior and so that's

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.029
the reason this has happened again it's

00:15:58.029 --> 00:16:00.430
cuz we're a vulnerable target because we

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.350
have no power so we just take the hits

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:03.610
and they're going this guy's a racist

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.110
you go wait I'm not I'm joking they're

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.300
gonna [ __ ] burn out we're the new

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.490
witches absolutely we're the new [ __ ]

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:11.709
witches yeah ain't even [ __ ] you know

00:16:11.709 --> 00:16:14.020
that this controversy happens whatever

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.410
the Asian slur and then Andrew yang

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:19.000
supports Shane and says ah let's talk it

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.380
out and Andrew yank by the way was again

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:21.790
I've said this before is getting my vote

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.420
because he's the only he's an American

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.079
candidate because he was made in China

00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:28.480
he's the most American

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.490
China until people get hwaseong seeing

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.139
but [ __ ] you we're comedians we'll say

00:16:32.139 --> 00:16:34.360
what we want and uh I don't think it's

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.560
like the same thing with Kevin Hart when

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.870
Kevin Hart said you know ten years ago

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.339
he said some homophobic thing and then

00:16:39.339 --> 00:16:41.199
in ten years he says nothing

00:16:41.199 --> 00:16:43.930
the only positive about gay people but

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:44.829
they still don't let him host the

00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:46.600
awesome people just want to hurt so I

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.000
don't I who cares yeah you stay above it

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.370
by just barreling through one of them

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:52.779
with the Kevin Hart thing that's funny

00:16:52.779 --> 00:16:55.510
about that he had that in 2010 yeah I

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:58.089
don't even think Hillary Clinton was Pro

00:16:58.089 --> 00:16:59.829
gay marriage at that point right and

00:16:59.829 --> 00:17:00.880
they wanted her to be the [ __ ]

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.430
president yeah and he can't you know

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.660
wild the funniest thing that is the

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.339
definition of Wow the funniest thing we

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.240
and dropped me

he's gonna [ __ ] BIA it's over yeah

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.679
here's an idea here's the deal if you're

00:18:45.679 --> 00:18:47.299
[ __ ] if you're a journalist covering

00:18:47.299 --> 00:18:49.850

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:51.500
is there a look you are you're in the

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.690
open mic scene of journalism yeah is

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.240
there a lower beat then I'm I'm sifting

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.500
through podcasts at the creeks in the

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.429
cave yeah what I'm serious like I might

00:19:01.429 --> 00:19:02.690
be trying to be funny what is lower

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:06.740
what's lower like what's a lower require

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.620
like what's a lower safer beat I mean

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.330
like what's his fieldwork like for real

ladyboys you ever watch this I'm gonna

00:20:49.429 --> 00:20:50.630
it's just one point

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:53.030
I'm listening about lady boys in

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.510
Thailand

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:56.500
following these it just reminds me of

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.910
how weird British dudes are because it's

00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:59.260
all about British dudes down there just

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.490
going down there [ __ ] and sucking

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:05.590
these kids dad

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:08.290
this dad moves to Thailand marries a

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.990
[ __ ] and then he abandoned his family

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.850
and to his family in like three years

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:16.000
sick baller move just moves in with a

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.309
[ __ ] and then brings his son down to

00:21:18.309 --> 00:21:20.350

like are they quite beautiful in it

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.809
so I suppose I might be interested in

00:21:28.809 --> 00:21:30.700
some but you know this doesn't make me a

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.179
homosexual

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.690
yeah yeah I agree with that arguments

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:42.250

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.610
still upset but I think I did kill

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:15.920

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.500
Jorge Flavius but you're devout Ruth I'm

are you guys doing are you a four legged

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.680
penalty against the death penalty I

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.000
think the death penalty doesn't actually

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.680
solve any problems but I can be able to

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.960
do I like the death penalty I like it

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.090

into this like shipping lane to this

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.450

00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:58.020
get to this island and there's like a

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:00.300
dog on the I like a stray dog was just

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.740

uh so they wouldn't they don't they got

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.370
the [ __ ] out of there cuz he ran out of

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:13.020
food because back then like planning an

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:14.790
escape was like impossible right he was

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:16.920
writing letters to New York then being

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:19.260
sent to Ireland to his dad it would I

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.880
mean it took like four months to get

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.060
land to get a letter non-stop so I mean

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:26.250
the the plan was crazy to just meet up

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:27.269
with a [ __ ]

00:36:27.269 --> 00:36:30.569
a ship like a wool trading ship he had

00:36:30.569 --> 00:36:32.400
to go to a [ __ ] island wait there for

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.039
it it away like 10 days he had food for

00:36:35.039 --> 00:36:37.170
like one day did he eat so he waited

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:39.749
yeah stayed on this island ship finally

00:36:39.749 --> 00:36:42.539
came gets on it sails to California then

00:36:42.539 --> 00:36:43.349
goes to New York

00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:44.489
yeah because by the time you get to the

00:36:44.489 --> 00:36:46.890
United States not only is he not well I

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:48.809
mean he may still be wanted in England

00:36:48.809 --> 00:36:49.769
but the United States a lot of the

00:36:49.769 --> 00:36:51.749
United States like greeted him yeah like

00:36:51.749 --> 00:36:53.130
so there was England knew that the u.s.

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:54.539
accepted him and they be like what can

00:36:54.539 --> 00:36:54.960
we do

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.729
yeah yeah he was like a hero in the

00:36:56.729 --> 00:36:58.619
United States he probably got a lot of

00:36:58.619 --> 00:37:00.960
these passes cuz his pops right you

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.920
think some of them were going to just

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.369
let my son go yeah I mean I'm sure they

00:37:05.369 --> 00:37:07.499
paid people oh yeah I mean lore of him

00:37:07.499 --> 00:37:09.269
he was like a potato farmer everybody on

00:37:09.269 --> 00:37:10.650
the island loved him because they were

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:12.809
all convicts too it's tough to hate

00:37:12.809 --> 00:37:14.940
Irish kids they're just friendly jolly

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:17.219
drunk hits yeah yeah they are a good

00:37:17.219 --> 00:37:18.869
storytellers got a good sense of humor

00:37:18.869 --> 00:37:20.880
you just like when they get drunk

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.680

in Germany with those firefighters they

00:37:30.269 --> 00:37:31.079
got they started getting a little

00:37:31.079 --> 00:37:32.009
aggressive with us because they knew

00:37:32.009 --> 00:37:33.269
that we were women yeah

00:37:33.269 --> 00:37:35.039
and they knew that yeah they thought we

00:37:35.039 --> 00:37:36.119

00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:42.380
was on this stage that was on the main

00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:44.840
so you know audition number one that was

00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:46.970
they were just at jfl and they just saw

00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:48.680
you first and then your agent or

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:50.870
whatever was like hey they liked you you

00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:52.040

00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:54.650
private audition for you yes got it well

00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:56.210
it wasn't just for me that that's just

00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:58.070
the audition at 30 rock that's on the

00:55:58.070 --> 00:55:59.660
stage yes and what did you have to do I

00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:01.130
just did five minutes to stand up just

00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:02.810
now Carrick's there's nothing you were

00:56:02.810 --> 00:56:04.280
just like I'm being me you just did your

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:05.720
best bits yeah I'm were they laughing

00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:07.490
not laughing they did laugh they left

00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:08.480
the whole time with Lauren Michaels

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.850
laugh - yeah yeah and you can barely see

00:56:10.850 --> 00:56:12.860
but you could see his face right cuz

00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:14.300
they're in the dark kinda and the whole

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:14.960
rooms empty

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.520
it's [ __ ] how many people in there

00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:21.460
roughly twelve twelve so it's it's it's

00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:24.530
yeah people have to bomb their auditions

00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:26.000
you could see people getting offstage

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.410
because there was probably like 25 other

00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:29.210
people they're all brightening you could

00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:30.560
tell when people bombed cuz you weren't

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:31.580
in the room you weren't allowed to see

00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:33.470
anything the only time I saw the stage

00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:35.300
was when I was walking out to go onto

00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:37.310
the stage Wow [ __ ] nuts

00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:39.020
Wow it was and that was the first time I

00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:40.340
saw Lauren he was just sitting at a

00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:41.990
table to the right with like all the

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:43.640
producers and you never physically seen

00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:45.230
that man in your life no being in his

00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:47.330
presence Wow and I wasn't a lot to take

00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:48.620
that hell yeah that's why I'm curious

00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:50.420
about him yeah wasn't that nervous going

00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:51.920
into it cuz I was like there's no way

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:53.570
there's no way I'm gonna get on this

00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:55.460
[ __ ] show my whole times like I don't

00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:57.170
even want like this [ __ ] I don't I don't

00:56:57.170 --> 00:57:00.290
know if I want this cuz of you know the

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:01.850
direction of the show do you weren't

00:57:01.850 --> 00:57:03.380
like going over your set a million times

00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:04.760
in your head or anything no it was the

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:06.140
same set I'd been doing you just knew

00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:07.580
what five we're gonna do is they did a

00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:09.530
cluster fest yeah yeah easy and then I

00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:10.910
was right alright I'll just go do that

00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:13.550
and I was starting to walk out and but

00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:14.840
then once you start to walk out it's

00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:15.650
like

00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:17.840
damn this is the coolest [ __ ] thing

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:20.030
in the world yeah cuz it's on the main

00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:21.860
stage where they do the monologue right

00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:23.570
that's where you're standing right you

00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:26.000
walk out you pull out the mic and then

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.580
introduce yourself is there a time or

00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:30.680
like what camera right in your face and

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:33.320
a camera to your side and the guy behind

00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:34.910
the camera just gives you a three to one

00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:37.250
and you say hi you say your name and

00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:38.810
then you just [ __ ] you're performing

00:57:38.810 --> 00:57:40.250
to the camera not to the crowd you

00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:42.020
performing to the crowd as if the crowds

00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:42.500
there

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:44.300
not the table not the dongle of

00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:45.830
producers and writers and they tell you

00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:47.420
that yes yeah so you got to act like

00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:48.920
which is really hard cuz you're like

00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:50.060
looking around the room and then the

00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:55.100
table laughing like it's great so after

00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:56.720
you do five minutes you think it went

00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:58.640
well they were laughing were like wow

00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:00.080
maybe I got this my hand was shaking

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:02.450
right because of the adrenaline dude I

00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:04.130
haven't had that in forever like yeah

00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:05.900
walk out in that room and it's like holy

00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:07.640
[ __ ] this is crazy so my hand was

00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:09.350
[ __ ] shaking enough that I had to put

00:58:09.350 --> 00:58:11.810
the mic against like my chin where I try

00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:14.420
to keep my hands steady but uh I thought

00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:16.250
I didn't have it and then I ran into che

00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:19.880
that night and he was like you were I

00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:21.320
was like damn my [ __ ] hand was

00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:22.370
shaking the whole time could you see

00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:23.900
that he was like you were easily the

00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:25.850
most calm really well so he was in the

00:58:25.850 --> 00:58:28.640
room yeah he was sawing yeah che did he

00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:30.020
tell you like hey I think like you have

00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:30.830
a good chance at this

00:58:30.830 --> 00:58:32.480
actually he's he said you're the

00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:34.160
funniest so you're probably not gonna

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:38.540
get it right and then so you get a call

00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:40.310
back then you get a call back where you

00:58:40.310 --> 00:58:41.660
go in and meet everybody

00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:43.940
but you also perform again no right you

00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:45.320
go in you meet everybody in the office

00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:47.930
to see if you would get along with

00:58:47.930 --> 00:58:52.100
everybody and then me and three other

00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:55.250
people we're in there so then then you

00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:57.260
go back into Lauren's like waiting area

00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:59.090
and you sit there and they like kind of

00:58:59.090 --> 00:59:01.190
intentionally make it everything is very

00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:03.950
intentionally like stressful and [ __ ]

00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:06.680
watery up I mean cuz it's live in from

00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:08.540
so they know they need to see if you're

00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:10.520
not a psycho that's why I'm freaked out

00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:17.390
right which they got it wrong so you're

00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:18.560
in there waiting and like I was with

00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:20.480
these three improv kids and they're

00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:21.650
sitting there talking about like how

00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:23.150

eating with them like quick one of them

00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:32.619
he didn't even [ __ ] meet after we

00:59:32.619 --> 00:59:34.420
waited for three wives one of them was

00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:35.410
like they were like actually you can

00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:37.780

00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:42.490
with everybody they kept me for like an

00:59:42.490 --> 00:59:44.890

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.390
they don't listen to podcast now they

01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:51.220
well now they will for sure none of us

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:52.839
in this room will never get SNL now well

01:00:52.839 --> 01:00:54.099
but here's the thing

01:00:54.099 --> 01:00:58.300
they hired him right that's him and when

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:00.190
I heard I read Lauren writing about it

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:01.570
going like we were looking for someone

01:01:01.570 --> 01:01:04.980
to appeal to the conservative audience I

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:07.690
know he didn't say that something that

01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:10.839
was like not even a no because if you

01:01:10.839 --> 01:01:13.150
yeah that wasn't that wasn't him it was

01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:17.320
a real quote no but somebody from SNL

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.510
had said that which is yeah it's

01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:21.250
apocryphal it didn't actually be said by

01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:23.230
him nobodies what was that it wasn't

01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:24.880
actually said by Lauren it was yeah up

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.109
tribute to him to all the articles

01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:27.670
didn't check with their sources yeah

01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:28.450
right because they're not really

01:01:28.450 --> 01:01:29.920
journalist who does [ __ ] Zelena and I

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.960
wasn't cuz I mean they saw my standup it

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.480
wasn't conservative right I I did a joke

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.700
about Trump getting shot being funny in

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:39.040
my audition yeah it wasn't also said

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:40.390
Trump was funnier than everybody in the

01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:43.240
room if you got a Senna which is true

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.980
gotta laugh and they laugh yes it's true

01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:48.250
it got the guy's hilarious yeah but that

01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:49.869
was you know that I was just saying that

01:01:49.869 --> 01:01:52.720
to say like their you know obviously

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.670
Shane's a comic so a lot mostly times

01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:56.020
comics aren't even left alright we're

01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:57.369
just [ __ ] pocum's yeah and everything

01:01:57.369 --> 01:01:59.260
but it was sort of an indication that

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:01.840
they're you know much like Roseanne

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:04.690
which brought in huge numbers blew out

01:02:04.690 --> 01:02:06.760
everything it's like Lauren it seems

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.500
like a little aware like hey you know

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.930
like maybe this woke thing maybe there's

01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:12.130
more than just the woke thing

01:02:12.130 --> 01:02:13.930
furthermore when you look at that

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:16.090
segment that Colin Jost and che are

01:02:16.090 --> 01:02:18.400
doing where they're kind of like they're

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.080
saying like I wrote this joke for you to

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.460
see you know they're pimping each other

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:23.650
you're going like you're going like you

01:02:23.650 --> 01:02:25.420
guys are protecting yourselves with this

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:27.310
little framing but these are really the

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:29.110
jokes you want to do yeah and those were

01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:30.790
the borrowed and those were the funniest

01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:32.800
jokes of the whole [ __ ] yeah by the

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.570
way yeah yeah so it's not like it's not

01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:36.100
like those people don't know that it's

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.450
not like Lauren's watching that not

01:02:37.450 --> 01:02:39.460
acknowledging that cuz shant like Shane

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:40.960
said he's these are real guys a normal

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:41.980
guy obviously you'd be that successful

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:44.740
and keep a show that successful for that

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:47.650
long it's like you can't not notice that

01:02:47.650 --> 01:02:49.420
the best jokes were the what was that

01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:51.010
segment and you can't not notice that

01:02:51.010 --> 01:02:53.890
Eddie Murphy's edgy stuff from an a

01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:56.020
bygone era was like the best thing

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:57.369
that's happened to SNL all year and it

01:02:57.369 --> 01:02:58.780
wasn't just cuz it was Eddie Murphy it

01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:01.480
was because it was legit hilarious right

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:04.119
the Gumby thing was hilarious right you

01:03:04.119 --> 01:03:05.410
know what I mean but in today's world

01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:07.000
you know you couldn't do that on come

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.250
bow belt show that wouldn't have been

01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:11.470
part of the mission statement yeah but

01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:13.750
it's [ __ ] funny yeah but it's funny

01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:16.210
because the the right thing is rarely

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:18.790
the funny thing when did that happen

01:03:18.790 --> 01:03:21.520
we're like saying the right thing lines

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:24.160
up with the funny thing like I mean what

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:24.550
the [ __ ]

01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:26.859
agreed it's usually the wrong thing

01:03:26.859 --> 01:03:28.420
that's the funny unfunny people wanted

01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:30.640
to be comedians there you go that's the

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:34.869
truth yeah bubbles burst yeah get enough

01:03:34.869 --> 01:03:36.369
people that are like why am I not on

01:03:36.369 --> 01:03:38.470
that stage and they start complaining

01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:40.990
and then you know people get forced into

01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:42.730
putting them on stages and then comedy

01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:44.619
sucks yeah that's what happens and you

01:03:44.619 --> 01:03:45.760
know what there's no way out of this one

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.050
because these people are doing it

01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:48.970
because there's no other jobs right so

01:03:48.970 --> 01:03:50.740
it's more of like an overall trumps

01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:53.320
creating jobs Trump garment factories

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.390
yeah yeah these hipsters get up in the

01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:57.040
[ __ ] factory yeah man

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.990
yeah [ __ ] vanity a we're gonna put

01:03:58.990 --> 01:04:02.140
you back into sewing factory you're not

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:03.670
just gonna [ __ ] prance around from

01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:05.770
job to job and work trip work trip any

01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:08.410
one time well I'll just fall it in the

01:04:08.410 --> 01:04:09.850
comedy is because they're [ __ ]

01:04:09.850 --> 01:04:11.590
YouTube blog where they test makeup

01:04:11.590 --> 01:04:13.570
didn't pay off for some other [ __ ]

01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:15.490
so yeah and I'm here cuz they think

01:04:15.490 --> 01:04:16.570
everyone can do it and it's self

01:04:16.570 --> 01:04:18.250
reinforcing cuz they see the other kids

01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:19.690
who aren't that funny making it their go

01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:21.670
everyone's going like and those kids are

01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:22.660
supporting them because they're going

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:24.400
like that means I can do it too yeah so

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.110
they're just kind of like supporting in

01:04:26.110 --> 01:04:27.400
our sellable [ __ ] yeah they're taking

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:31.560
turns kind of performing and an audience

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:35.710
antigua lynne comedy make it's it's good

01:04:35.710 --> 01:04:39.310
i love someone who's terrible yeah who

01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:41.170
thinks they're great yeah and they said

01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:42.520
then they blame the audience and then

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.320
someone who's hilarious comes on it's

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.270
like no it was you as you well know yeah

01:04:46.270 --> 01:04:48.460
it is the greatest error for comedy

01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:51.490
because there's this yeah and you see

01:04:51.490 --> 01:04:53.470
that this is really where most people's

01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:55.810
eyeballs and ears are anyway ryan so

01:04:55.810 --> 01:04:57.580
it's just been kind of this big illusion

01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:59.920
you know what i mean like the it's

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:02.710
ironic because TV has become trolls

01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:05.290
they're trolling trolls get the

01:05:05.290 --> 01:05:07.540
attention the same way car crashes get

01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:09.520
attention everyone looks to stop to see

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.230
what the horror is right and that's what

01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:12.820
tv's become you turn on colbert he's a

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:15.280
trump troll you turn on SNL it's a trump

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.020
troll they're all trolling the president

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:19.000
right because the president does [ __ ]

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.430
sell tickets it's whatever you want to

01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:23.740
say left or right or what you believe I

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:25.060
mean Bennett II would you admit that

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:27.310
that kid [ __ ] moves tickets I agree

01:05:27.310 --> 01:05:29.380
