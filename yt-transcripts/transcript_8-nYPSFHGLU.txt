00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:38.070
about like the whole gender in sports so

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:40.650
he is his sister I believe coaches do

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:42.570
you want URLs to cross oh it Hoss is

00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:45.240
like d1 the cross athlete played for

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:46.470
Drexel first of all she's like you

makes sense he was a wrestler but I

00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:03.600
think he walked on to Drexel lacrosse

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:08.040
boy here hey dude like early like 90s

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:10.740

me

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:15.390
Hass Hass is probably like eight years

00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:19.170

00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:25.590
99 yeah that's yeah Hoss probably

00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:27.150
definitely wore ski goggles to a party

00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:28.800
at one point yeah yeah he probably can't

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:30.390
hardly wait it a couple times definitely

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:33.780

with him he would smoke he specifically

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:53.040
said he would dominate if he played and

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:55.080
he was like I would I could outrun any

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.500
Pete and he won't like girl on your team

00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:00.930

him in races he's 40 you're not gonna

00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:06.960
come dominate you would be just winded

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.490
and crush these they would beat you

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:12.870

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:27.870
man fantasy where he was seeing this is

00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:31.700
a funny spot you seeing a trans MTF

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.029
dominating sport

00:50:33.029 --> 00:50:35.159
and it stoked him up or he's starting to

00:50:35.159 --> 00:50:37.259
fantasize like how you do that lacrosse

00:50:37.259 --> 00:50:45.089

00:50:45.089 --> 00:50:46.709

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:52.830
banned women's women's uh you couldn't

00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:54.660

00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:56.490
an interesting debate be like maybe we

00:54:56.490 --> 00:54:58.020
could just give him like [ __ ] shorts

00:54:58.020 --> 00:54:59.880
yeah instead of what these things are

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:00.710
that car you

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:03.240

done a Scylla to justify the [ __ ]

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:22.110
lingerie the immodest you are but that

00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:24.000
is that for the volleyball they don't do

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.440
that in basketball you don't need that

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:26.790

00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:15.030
absolutely have like an eighth grade

00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:35.240
volleyball team that makes it worse

00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:38.280

you know let's say like as if I'm more

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:52.260
in grade school girls volleyball time

00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:54.300
there's gotta be like an AAU thing like

00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:56.790
girls like a you volleyball for kids for

00:58:56.790 --> 00:59:05.040

volleyball apparel okay it's just a

00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:12.330

Jesus crochet they bring them down a

00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:24.730
little bit but it's the same same idea

00:59:24.730 --> 00:59:25.329
dude

00:59:25.329 --> 00:59:30.250
same idea that's the girls not wearing

00:59:30.250 --> 00:59:35.079
pants well pretty low don't over hanging

00:59:35.079 --> 00:59:37.960
down they should do it in like knee

00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:39.910
length number 5 is literally not wearing

00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:44.319
pants grace this is a goddamn tragedy

00:59:44.319 --> 00:59:46.319
this is great

00:59:46.319 --> 00:59:50.140
meanwhile boys volleyball team that gym

dressed like [ __ ] white chocolate why

00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:57.760
are we they all dressed like the

00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.200
professor you know what dude you know

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:05.170
what it is know what it is because

01:00:05.170 --> 01:00:07.030
volleyball by women is traditionally

01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:08.770
played on the sit on the beat on the

01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:11.619
beach in bikinis so they were like all

01:00:11.619 --> 01:00:12.609
right we're obviously not gonna have

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:14.380
them wear bikinis [ __ ] mind as well

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:16.930
I'm it's like maybe they stepped it down

01:00:16.930 --> 01:00:18.430
from that thinking that's modest carb

01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:21.160
why who's the one who's be like alright

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.300
