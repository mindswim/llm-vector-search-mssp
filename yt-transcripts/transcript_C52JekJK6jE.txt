with that uh that introduction so we

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.039
were going to lay down

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.480
a bit a bit of details and and uh

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.480
maybe chat a little bit about uh you

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.000
know the biomedical model sort of the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.880
context

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.039
um that that we're working within the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.960
system that we're working with then

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.840
and uh maybe some alternative ideas hell

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.399
yeah no

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.079
that's exactly i'm hey i'm really happy

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:37.920
you know you're able to talk to us about

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.280
this because you know otherwise it turns

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.440
into it can turn into like a

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.600
you know just like a kaleidoscope of

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.559
just

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.800
idiots being like yeah yeah yeah like

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.680
it's good

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.760
that we're lynch pinned in with you know

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.680
men of science such as yourself and not

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.640
to mention

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.640
open-minded men of science which is a

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.000
great men of science

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.559
exactly standing on on the shoulders of

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.440
giants

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.120
we are we are [ __ ] standing on the

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.120
shoulders of you basically

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.600
so don't don't let us down that yeah

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.640
well

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.240
no no honestly though i really

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.320
appreciate it man good and i'm yeah i'm

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.960
happy to try them in and and if anything

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.680
i think my value is is pointing out how

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.720
incompetent

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.520
the status quo is and uh and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.799
highlighting

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.479
the importance of these sort of

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.960
alternative programs and stuff so

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.560
oh yeah and that's the point too i do

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.159
want to like i said i i think

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.600
the view is justified but yeah i'm

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.520
always careful not to just be like

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.439
[ __ ] it's [ __ ] it sucks i mean there

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.880
has to be some you know obviously those

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.479
redeeming qualities but yeah

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.240
i agree there's room there's there's

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.079
wiggle room big time wiggle room right

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:40.560
now

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.280
there's [ __ ] wiggle room man i i

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.799
think it's fair to say that

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.720
we are we are failing uh uh people

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.200
from a mental health perspective but

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.159
more sinister

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.840
more satanic we are exploiting uh

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.200
people that's that suffer with

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.680
quote-unquote uh mental health and

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.600
maybe in some ways you know putting them

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.719
into a

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.680
a feed-forward uh system that that can

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.560
be harmful

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.119
uh you know especially relates to labels

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.080
and stuff like that

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.160
so i don't know if it's more useful to

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.680
chat about the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.200
the mechanics of uh of some of the

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.160
you know phase one rollout of your

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.800
dogology program um

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.760
so do you want to let's do let's do both

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.160
give

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.000
let's let's walk through the what's the

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.599
give us like a taste of the you know

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.959
prevailing

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.720
methodology of like you know what could

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.800
somebody expect if they just woke up or

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.160
like you know dialed their phone and

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.239
said i'm going to get help tomorrow

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.360
what's it looking like exactly you know

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.959
yeah the day the day in the life of a

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.400
nut job so

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.120
that's right so and and a lot of

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.640
listeners will be able to relate to the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.280
idea of

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.680
feeling like [ __ ] you know who do you

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.680
call you call your your gp

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.840
usually all right so that's that's first

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.720
line

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.400
and these tend to be whether they're

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.159
internal medicine doctors or nurse

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:01.760
practitioners family doctors

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.040
they tend to be people with a

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.319
a couple of months of medical school

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.800
that

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.159
for example was tailored to uh

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.879
cognitive behavioral therapy um and

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:15.760
management of

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.440
of mental illness so less

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.840
less experience than for example someone

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.840
that has a masters of social work and

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.640
counseling

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.959
well so they're like able to do like an

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.799
intake kind of like they could ask you a

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.640
couple questions and be like all right

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.000
all right well and that's what you would

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
think right that's like oh well that's

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.440
that's sort of the extent of their

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.599
qualifications but

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.120
it's they're doing a whole lot more than

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.840
intake yeah as i'm sure a lot of people

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.159
know

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.560
right these are right now oh they're

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.159
well yeah these are

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.000
these are the backbone and the numbers

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.280
in in canada

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.159
anyway play it out um these are the the

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.040
primary

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.080
prescribers of uh of uh

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.920
pharmaceuticals targeted to mental

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.280
illness and that's why the

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.400
the pharma reps and the drug reps um

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.000
uh market toward family doctors and

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and primary care docs and i'm not

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.200
ripping on these people

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.200
they're you know the the scope of

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.720
practice is huge and from

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.519
a financial uh sustainability

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.120
perspective in terms of the sim

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.079
the system they're they're vital um but

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.840
obviously they don't have the

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.080
the extent of training as you know of

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.759
their their specialist colleagues

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:28.880
so uh you wake up no so

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.880
yeah no i i agree with what you said but

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.720
that is you know for just to drive that

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.800
home that's kind of nuts that

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.160
you're saying i could go in there and be

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.560
like doc i don't know what it is i'm

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.440
just

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.120
i don't know man i just feel off some

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.479
days and there's like they have no

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:43.680
concept of like

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.479
you know like what are your

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.960
relationships like your attachments your

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.720
you know attachment drama they just look

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.080
at you and they're like well here try

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.600
this out

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.840
absolutely i mean it's it's a cynical

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.520
way of looking at it but

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.280
but you know firsthand experience type

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.639
of thing i

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.360
i it's fair to say and and i i think the

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.639
listener would relate

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.600
to being given you know you should so

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.639
you wake up

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.600
feel like [ __ ] okay i'm gonna sort of uh

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.800
debase myself

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.320
and and this is a stigma that we're

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.919
gonna be working toward breaking but i'm

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:15.600
going to go and chat

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.160
to the to the the gp about how i'm

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.720
feeling

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.000
[ __ ] you're in the the uh waiting room

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.919
they they give you you know a couple of

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:25.039
questionnaires and

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:26.880
which are clinically validated including

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.160
you know the cat 7

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.440
phq-9 okay well you're depressed

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.680
according to this this you know

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.960
20-minute

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.440
intake yeah well this is a beef it's

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.240
like that's so

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.000
okay you go to the person who it's like

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.479
hey doctor i can't stop [ __ ] i'm

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:44.000
[ __ ] myself all the time

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
or like oh my god i can't i'm i'm

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.240
throwing up then you're like i feel like

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.000
my life lacks meaning and direction like

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
what should i do it's just a weird

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.080
you know it seems like a weird kind of

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.199
catch-all

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:56.960
yeah i'm having an i'm having an

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.400
existential crisis

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.639
that started from the day i was born and

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.520
is enormously complex

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.560
and i can't stop [ __ ] my pants yeah

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.759
it's like it just seems that's what

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:08.880
that's the problem to me yeah i don't

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.080
think they're evil i don't think they're

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.000
doing anything wrong it's just like

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.240
they've just been this problem's been

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.759
it's a hot potato that's been passed

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:17.280
around like it used to be religion that

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.160
kind of lot

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.479
for the most part collapsed and now it's

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:22.400
like there was you know there was the

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.560
mental institutions psychiatrists that a

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.000
lot of that got defunded

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.919
now they're like let's just give it to

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:29.360
general practitioners they can deal with

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.080
this look

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.720
you're sad here's a pill back back to

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.560
work come on yeah we

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.840
and and from a money yeah from a money

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.720
uh perspective you can imagine the

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.919
insurer

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:44.880
paying for the the initial intake and

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.400
you know maybe that

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.440
that once every three-month uh follow-up

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.520
versus uh a weekly session that is

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.199
you know intensive psychotherapy oh man

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:58.479
that is sinister and then when you

00:06:58.479 --> 00:06:59.680
introduce the insurance companies i

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.199
don't even think about that being like

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:03.520
yeah do we really need all this yeah i

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.280
mean so

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.880
it gets it gets gross so and as a short

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.560
digression like in terms of

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.080
obamacare so

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.280
uh pharmaceuticals um as a

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.960
a segment of healthcare expenditure

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.400
um is is increasing and and the us pays

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.360
per capita some exorbitant you know

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.800
multiple times

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.400
the the the runner-up uh uh on

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.199
on pharmaceuticals and there's partly

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:35.919
it's partly

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:38.960
because the the states is the the engine

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.280
of

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.840
innovation and you're paying for that

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.479
but

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:46.080
the the darkness that underlies that

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.160
is that with with the rollout of

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.280
obamacare

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.479
they uh put in place a law and this

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:54.800
parts this part's kind of interesting

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.599
where 80 percent of health care

00:07:57.599 --> 00:07:59.199
expenditure

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:02.400
had to involve patient care

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.000
or delivery of medicines

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.360
i.e pharmaceuticals so the

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.319
what has happened what insurers have

00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:13.440
done

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.360
in order to to keep making money right

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.800
the profit motive

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.919
is they have permitted expansion of

00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:21.919
health care expenditure

00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:24.960
as relates to to direct you know quote

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.720
unquote patient care which includes

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.000
uh distribution or uh dispensation of

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.399
medicines okay so that 20 that 20

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:36.640
is proportionally increased so it's it's

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.719
a weird it's it's counterintuitive right

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:40.959
you're sure you would think okay well

00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:42.479
it's in their interest

00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:46.320
to uh to minimize costs uh but in fact

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.080
they want to grow the pie

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.360
so that 20 percent which is the uh what

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.240
obamacare permits as their profit for

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.120
example

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.760
is expanded so it it's it gets yucky it

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.640
gets true

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.000
just so i understand so this is you're

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.760
saying that they have and if i'm wrong

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.120
correct me

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.399
so they won't cover so 80

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:08.240
of what they're covering so if they're

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.080
going to cover something

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.560
80 of that will go towards what i what i

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.080
heard was that they won't cover unless

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.120
you're getting some sort of like

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.160
medication

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.399
yeah so the under obamacare let's say

00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:19.680
that formally

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.800
uh a healthcare insurer uh of

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.440
all healthcare expenditure by that

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.800
insurer

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.839
50 could go toward overhead

00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:32.880
okay and 50 could go toward

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.000
patient care i.e medicines gotcha

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.959
um now under obamacare the good

00:09:38.959 --> 00:09:39.760
intention

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.040
was to shift a greater proportion of

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.360
that

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.640
to patient care 80 let's say

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.040
and then only 20 to overheads you know

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.000
paying for the [ __ ]

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.160
ceo to get a [ __ ] at the strip club

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.760
yeah

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.120
well what do you do you expand the pie

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.959
so you make you increase your

00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:01.920
incentivized to increase overall

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.839
health care so that 20 percent of a much

00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:07.519
bigger pie

00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:11.200
okay is is profits so it's it's

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.760
and this is this is a widely uh

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.560
discussed

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.680
uh fault in in obamacare but it's

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.320
it's a it's a massive problem you know

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.880
one one in five americans for example

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.160
are uh harassed by collection agencies

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.760
for health care expenditures

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.760
gosh that's why the bill's like 30 year

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.880
like all right you're gonna need three

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.560
mri like my friend went there my friend

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.320
went to the er and it was like

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.680
you get like two things done like that

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.519
i'll be you know twenty five hundred

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:39.519
dollars and you're like uh huh

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:41.519
yeah what the [ __ ] you like looked at my

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:42.959
fingers

00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:44.480
yeah no so there's so though that's

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.240
where the pressure and i know uh i know

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.000
of another guy who does

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.760
consulting for hospital companies in

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.200
terms of like the profitability

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.040
or hospital companies [ __ ] hospitals

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.640
and uh

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.720
and they'll kind of lightly be like all

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.240
right see you guys aren't doing a lot of

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.320
mri's here you know as anything are you

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.519
guys missing that basically

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:03.600
hinting like dude you can build a lot

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.640
for these yeah

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.560
you're missing the [ __ ] sales goals

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.399
for for mris

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:09.920
yeah that's we're not going to get your

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.519
commission that okay

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:12.959
that makes sense then so then they what

00:11:12.959 --> 00:11:14.399
they're doing now is trying to just you

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:14.800
know

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.959
ball out in terms of the care so then

00:11:16.959 --> 00:11:18.720
they can bill and then get that bigger

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.240
piece for themselves

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.640
yeah so if you if you limit the the

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.360
piece of pi

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.720
uh the piece of the pie to a percentage

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.839
well let's just make the pie bigger yeah

00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:32.880
so in that way insurers are incentivized

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.480
to actually pay out more

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.640
so you know pharma companies want to

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.800
make their drugs more expensive

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.800
uh insurers want to you know make their

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.959
services more expensive ultimately it's

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:46.959
passed on to the consumer rate in terms

00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:47.680
of premiums

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.560
obviously um so insurance companies just

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.720
be like no

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.959
we'll be you're having to pay more right

00:11:54.959 --> 00:11:56.399
well they yeah but

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:59.600
sort of to to to the point uh which is

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.279
that if they have that fixed

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:03.360
you know in this case twenty percent uh

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.360
yeah uh they just wanna make that as

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.440
as big as possible right so it's a it's

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.160
a it's an absolutely broken system

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.560
lots because it's going to get paid by

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.079
the government regardless

00:12:14.079 --> 00:12:16.639
well in this at the government if it's

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:17.839
obamacare or

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:20.959
the insurer uh or the insurer

00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:24.000
i should say the uh the end users so

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.720
yeah it's it's [ __ ] it's broken and

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.399
and the same is true in canada

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:31.680
you know uh apotex

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.079
is one of the most important people for

00:12:34.079 --> 00:12:35.760
example in medical education their

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.519
generic drug manufacturer

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:40.480
you know talk about uh uh shady people

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.000
you know it's it's sad but there was a

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
double homicide involving

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.639
the uh the two owners of that company

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:47.279
what

00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:48.880
these are you know sort of like

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:52.800
pseudo-organized crime sketchy sketchy

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.680
people

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.320
so that's that's all to say that you go

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.399
to the gp's office

00:12:58.399 --> 00:12:59.680
where's the money coming from the

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.839
money's coming from giving a p

00:13:01.839 --> 00:13:05.200
selling people a product right uh and

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.800
it it's the profit margin is way higher

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.760
on a on a product on a capsule uh than

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.639
it is on

00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:16.079
uh you know uh uh hours of a highly

00:13:16.079 --> 00:13:18.399
highly trained professional's time yeah

00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:19.600
laying on a couch

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.440
and as a someone in that space

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.279
um uh the uh we are we're not

00:13:27.279 --> 00:13:29.600
incentivized it's not sustainable to

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.800
to provide psychotherapy one-on-one

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.839
it's not gonna happen really no

00:13:35.839 --> 00:13:38.240
it's it's not it's not it's we're not

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.920
we're not compensated in a way

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.959
where that's uh sustainable long-term

00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:45.839
so income the income the counselors

00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:48.079
income the the folks that are

00:13:48.079 --> 00:13:51.600
allied health and normally uh private

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.000
less accessible through uh public

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.199
insurers

00:13:55.199 --> 00:13:56.720
tend to be less accessible through

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.240
private insurance as

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.360
you know is made evident by by listeners

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.040
uh posting right so huge huge need that

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.160
is is going unaddressed

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.560
yeah so that's that's sort of the space

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.240
where it's coming from

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.519
and then to to to get into if you'd like

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:18.639
again more of the the biomedical model

00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:21.519
and uh you know why pills why why push

00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:22.079
pills

00:14:22.079 --> 00:14:23.920
if you want to chat about that a bit

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.519
yeah well yeah but just

00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:26.959
it is funny like you're saying it's like

00:14:26.959 --> 00:14:29.279
the model itself in terms of like

00:14:29.279 --> 00:14:31.199
you know a person they're having their

00:14:31.199 --> 00:14:32.880
little existential crisis their their

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.480
you know

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.079
name you name it whatever they're

00:14:36.079 --> 00:14:37.440
relationally they're messed up they're

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.199
hearing voices

00:14:39.199 --> 00:14:41.839
they have to enter into almost like a

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:42.480
stock

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.160
a thing that's kind of colored by the

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.160
stock market in order to heal their like

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.279
souls or their

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:48.639
to find meaning in their life like

00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:50.959
you're saying this it's a it's a supply

00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:52.240
chain or whatever you want to call it

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.440
that's tainted

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.160
by somebody's greed somewhere very high

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:56.560
up

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.040
is that a fair assessment absolutely and

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.160
hey listen

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.639
i am a i'm a classic british liberal

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:04.079
like i

00:15:04.079 --> 00:15:07.040
i'm entirely you know i i i fully

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.639
acknowledge that

00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:09.920
people are going to do things to make

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.920
money and that's how you motivate people

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:12.480
but

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.680
it that's not to say that the the uh

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.079
even if there's a profit motive there uh

00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:19.920
that the product doesn't have to be

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.519
effective that's not to say that you

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:23.440
have to [ __ ] fleece people right

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.279
exactly is that yeah that's a that's a

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:26.480
good distinction because yeah it's not

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.639
like man everything's so evil and [ __ ]

00:15:28.639 --> 00:15:30.079
up it's like no no but again if

00:15:30.079 --> 00:15:31.600
someone's sitting there like

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.639
you know they know the number they're

00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:33.759
looking yeah this guy could probably

00:15:33.759 --> 00:15:35.360
this is what they could actually use in

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.560
terms of i want to help people

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.079
make money off of it this is what they

00:15:38.079 --> 00:15:40.000
actually need versus being like

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.440
can you give him a [ __ ] pill like

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.120
does that pill work

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.079
yeah that's good yeah and and why and

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:47.839
why the pill right and like what you

00:15:47.839 --> 00:15:48.240
know

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.040
and we had spoken about previously uh

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:51.519
you know

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:53.519
like why why the [ __ ] pill every time

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:55.040
you see an article written about mental

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:55.759
health

00:15:55.759 --> 00:15:57.120
you know there's this image of the

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.160
[ __ ] all holy pill right it's the

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.240
it's the the imagery that we use to

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.920
discuss mental health

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.560
and it to me it's so strange and and

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.360
exploring the

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.880
the sort of the origins of that is kind

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.279
of interesting so you know i have on my

00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:12.079
desk

00:16:12.079 --> 00:16:16.079
um the uh you know a phrenology

00:16:16.079 --> 00:16:19.040
uh skull it seems like every [ __ ]

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.240
psych major

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.839
you know picks picks one of those up

00:16:21.839 --> 00:16:23.519
from from ikea so

00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:25.199
are you are you familiar with the you

00:16:25.199 --> 00:16:27.680
know like a like the phranology bust

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.959
so the idea is that it's a uh uh

00:16:30.959 --> 00:16:34.320
areas of the brain that are mapped uh

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.639
to to be design together right specific

00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:38.160
functions

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.519
it's like the homer simpson thing that's

00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:41.839
right yeah exactly that's yeah yeah beer

00:16:41.839 --> 00:16:44.240
yeah it takes up the whole [ __ ]

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.360
frontal cortex

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.079
so the the the history there is is super

00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:49.360
interesting

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.639
and i think uh it really provides sort

00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:53.920
of context

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.199
in terms of the the biomedical uh model

00:16:57.199 --> 00:16:59.279
so one of the one of the cool stories is

00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:02.320
uh there's this guy [ __ ] phineas gage

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.240
yep so this is you've heard of them

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.439
through your your psych

00:17:05.439 --> 00:17:09.679
uh yeah yeah and uh so he he got a rail

00:17:09.679 --> 00:17:10.160
spike

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.720
through his his frontal lobe and a guy

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.439
who would and this is going back

00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:17.600
mid 19th century so a guy who was

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.640
formerly

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.760
a reserved uh

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.280
you know productive member of the

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.520
community became

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.880
you know totally impulsive rude

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.080
criminalistic and so that was

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.840
one of the the first patients where it's

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.120
like oh okay well

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.360
you know wow first of all this guy's

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.360
survived but obviously that sort of the

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.960
seat of self-control

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.280
you know resides in the in the frontal

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.400
cortex

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.760
yeah you caught the spike right through

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.440
the front of his head he caught it

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:47.760
through

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.440
yeah and like how the [ __ ] did that guy

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.120
survive and then he was an [ __ ] and i

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.760
was like wait what the [ __ ]

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.880
then he became an [ __ ] and

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.440
and so that's that's you know one of the

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.000
the different

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.200
stories and obviously there's people

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.039
that suffered strokes you've seen

00:18:03.039 --> 00:18:05.679
you know the the homunculus before that

00:18:05.679 --> 00:18:07.120
uh is a visual

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.919
representation of of sort of uh our

00:18:09.919 --> 00:18:10.640
sensation

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.880
and motor system so that's that's what

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.960
sort of gave rise to the idea that

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.559
okay well there is a a physical seat

00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:21.600
of consciousness right

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:26.080
um and uh the the neuro anatomical model

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.640
would

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.840
you know in turn uh give rise to

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.760
to people talking about well you're this

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:32.960
is a um

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.080
a piece of meat that uh has uh

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.440
electrical signals via a chemical soup

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.440
so that that's sort of the origin of the

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.880
the biomod

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.600
biomedical model and so if if

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.360
consciousness arise from

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.840
it arises from a piece of meat and this

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:50.799
chemical soup

00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:53.360
then there must be a way to to correct

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.840
the chemical soup

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.520
right because yeah because that guy you

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.120
know his behavior was clearly changed

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.480
because he got hit in a certain part of

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.120
his head

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.559
so there's people who are like we can

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:04.480
manipulate this to make people

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.600
stoked on themselves basically yeah and

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.799
and and that's and and uh

00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:13.600
and that's what we where in turn um you

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.240
know the

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.080
the the drugs started pouring in so

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.600
um we we started off in terms of

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.799
uh utility with medications like uh like

00:19:24.799 --> 00:19:25.520
haldol

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.200
i don't i don't know if you're familiar

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.440
with it like the the antipsychotic

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.039
yeah what was the one that gave people

00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:32.320
that like quivering lip like they're

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.919
always chewing something they're like

00:19:33.919 --> 00:19:35.919
what did you want so that's called

00:19:35.919 --> 00:19:37.600
tardive dyskinesia and

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.039
any any uh so-called uh like classic

00:19:41.039 --> 00:19:42.480
antipsychotic including

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.760
haldol leads to to side effects there

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.600
can lead to side effects like tardive

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.679
dyskinesia but yeah it's it's [ __ ] day

00:19:49.679 --> 00:19:51.440
like it's the it's like a hallmark of

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.080
the yeah it's schizophrenic

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:58.000
um so in your in your work uh

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.960
and and counseling kids for example you

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:01.280
know

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.919
how have you ran into the biomedical

00:20:03.919 --> 00:20:06.400
model and sort of butted heads with that

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.520
and chatting with parents too and and

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.280
managing illness like what what have you

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.159
run into

00:20:12.159 --> 00:20:14.559
uh i was kind of lucky well first of all

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:15.760
i didn't have to deal with any insurance

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:16.720
or anything like that because it was

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.760
just a school

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.039
so that was cool so i didn't have to do

00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:20.880
any of that paperwork or just you know

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.000
have to like you know like that's the

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.120
other thing too with insurance like in

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.480
order to get treatment i have to

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.960
slap a label on you and be like oh no no

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.919
this person has

00:20:27.919 --> 00:20:29.919
x y and z and if it doesn't if i'm like

00:20:29.919 --> 00:20:31.039
yeah they're just kind of [ __ ] up the

00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:32.159
insurance companies like yeah we don't

00:20:32.159 --> 00:20:33.919
care we need a specific disorder so i

00:20:33.919 --> 00:20:34.960
didn't have to deal with any of that it

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.320
was like

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.440
in terms of the medication i did i never

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.679
had anyone who was

00:20:41.679 --> 00:20:43.440
on i'm trying to think i'm thinking of

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.720
everyone too

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.640
yeah there was nobody that i was dealing

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.000
with that we

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.039
like i was aware of any sort of

00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:50.400
medication or who was like seeking

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.120
medication

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.640
they were actually coming to me with

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.520
like very kind of concrete life problems

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.640
and nothing like

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.320
you know nothing's working for me blah

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.760
blah blah

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.280
but i also was working a lot me i was

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.880
working with i mean a lot of especially

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.919
a lot of middle schoolers because the

00:21:03.919 --> 00:21:05.280
school i was working at

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.200
was it was all black it was an all black

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.200
school and a lot of times the middle

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.600
school boys get thrown on 80d meds

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.159
right so that and that's why i'm i'm so

00:21:14.159 --> 00:21:15.039
yeah so

00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:17.200
and the numbers and and i can't quote it

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.080
specifically but

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.240
especially among you know black kids are

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.120
like like

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.280
astounding like the percentage of the

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.559
kids that are medicated

00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:26.880
so in your work you found that that most

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.840
of the kids

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.000
were unmedicated from an adhd well i

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:30.960
didn't so

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.440
the high schoolers i was working with i

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.960
didn't have anyone who i actually didn't

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.400
even talk about medication with any of

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.039
them

00:21:37.039 --> 00:21:39.440
um no one ever brought them up the only

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.640
thing i talked about with kids was like

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.840
they all smoked weed and [ __ ] so we

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.080
would talk about smoking weed yeah

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:44.799
that's sick

00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:46.480
yeah and they never really they never

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.919
it's funny i never thought about

00:21:47.919 --> 00:21:50.000
that till now we never talked about

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.320
medication at all

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.960
interesting yeah and so me you know

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.600
maybe

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.120
you know part of part of the reason they

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.039
were sort of seeking out

00:21:59.039 --> 00:22:02.559
uh counseling um was uh

00:22:02.559 --> 00:22:04.559
as a potential alternative to medication

00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:05.679
so would this be

00:22:05.679 --> 00:22:09.039
was it primarily like uh parent driven

00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:12.000
were was it teachers that were linking

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.440
you guys up

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.000
yeah it was like the parents so the

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.360
little kids you had to get you had to

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.480
call the parents say hey here's what

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.679
we're thinking of doing we need your

00:22:19.679 --> 00:22:20.720
consent but the

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.720
and as soon as they're 14 they can

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.840
themselves like when they're

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.360
once they were in i guess 9th grade or

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.440
eighth grade they could just be like hey

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.960
i want some help and then it was just

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.039
between you and that that kid

00:22:31.039 --> 00:22:32.960
so it was like i'd have to anything

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.640
under 13 i'd call the parents say his is

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.120
cool

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.880
but really it was a school was driving

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.159
it but the school would also call the

00:22:38.159 --> 00:22:38.640
parents and

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.760
here's what we're thinking of doing you

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.400
can totally opt out if you want to but

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.159
mostly it's like the chinese age of

00:22:44.159 --> 00:22:46.240
consent yeah yeah

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.280
yeah yeah exactly but yeah they were uh

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.880
yeah they were just kind of most the

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.159
parents were like yeah what you know do

00:22:52.159 --> 00:22:53.679
what you got to do or they would be kind

00:22:53.679 --> 00:22:55.039
of like sketched out like

00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:55.919
what do you mean what are you talking

00:22:55.919 --> 00:22:58.640
about interesting

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.200
so yeah and and from a uh the

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.480
perspective of

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.320
you know involvement i guess it's child

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.559
protective services

00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:08.000
were there ever it was there every sort

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.760
of pushback or concern from

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.679
parents that the kids were being you

00:23:11.679 --> 00:23:13.520
know systematized or

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.919
or brought into the fold of the system

00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:17.360
yeah there was there was a

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.200
i did a group i did a grief group and

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.720
there was um

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.720
there was a couple people who their

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.240
parents wanted to be like i need to know

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.520
everything you guys are talking about

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.960
blah blah blah blah blah

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.240
uh there was yeah we even uncovered uh

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.760
there was like some kind of abuse going

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.360
on one of the situations that got like

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.799
kind of blurted out and that got

00:23:34.799 --> 00:23:35.600
followed up and

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.400
dealt with but yeah no so there was

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.679
stuff like that and there are parents

00:23:39.679 --> 00:23:41.120
who were kind of dodgy about it but

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.520
the i kind of stayed in close contact

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.799
with the

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:46.320
kids parents that i worked with just i

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.440
would just you know hit them up and say

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.480
hey you know how are you doing does

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.039
anything

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:50.480
you want to talk to me about anything is

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.240
anything i should know and most of them

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.400
are really kind of cool about it and uh

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.760
you can kind of tell the ones who you

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.360
couldn't get on the phone i feel like

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.640
not like they would be the ones who

00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.840
would be doing anything [ __ ] up but i

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.760
think it's more likely

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.159
right well exactly the parents that are

00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:05.600
inaccessible

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.240
and what's cool you know and they the

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.720
analogy is not exactly there but

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.320
the in some in i'm not going to

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.840
necessarily make assumptions here but

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.840
maybe it's a group that is a little bit

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.640
more

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.360
you know disenfranchised for example and

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.400
has suffered

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.360
you know historical injustice from the

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:25.919
system

00:24:25.919 --> 00:24:28.000
type of thing and so of course they're

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.279
bringing a

00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:32.559
skepticism uh and a suspicion

00:24:32.559 --> 00:24:36.559
uh potentially to to uh to providers you

00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:38.159
know whether they're counselors or

00:24:38.159 --> 00:24:40.000
doctors or whomever

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.640
so did you run into that as well like in

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.000
terms of like cracking the nut and

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.039
getting the kids to

00:24:45.039 --> 00:24:48.880
to open up and share was that difficult

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.799
yeah some it depends all it all depends

00:24:50.799 --> 00:24:52.240
on the kids some of the kids were like

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:52.960
uh

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.720
you know would still to this day if i

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.600
were to talk to them they would just

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.880
come in my office talk to me

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.240
like i'm cool i'm fine i'm cool what am

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.679
i later i didn't really i didn't

00:24:59.679 --> 00:25:00.960
wouldn't like

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.840
you know go crazy sweating them but the

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:04.960
yeah there's a lot of people who would

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.400
be like i'm fine i'm fine i'm fine and i

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.840
would just always make it a point and be

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.159
like

00:25:08.159 --> 00:25:09.600
whatever man it's your time you know

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.880
you're the boss here do what you want

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.240
and then eventually a lot of people

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.919
would eventually kind of like fold or

00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:15.360
just not like fold but they would just

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.080
be like

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.360
there was people who would come in for

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.720
like a month and be like no i'm cool i'm

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.320
cool then one day just gush and start

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.840
crying and be like i can't [ __ ] take

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:22.720
this

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.440
you're like oh my god and that that

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.640
moment's [ __ ]

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.279
okay yeah and like you know and seeing

00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:31.279
that sort of all the time right

00:25:31.279 --> 00:25:33.600
and and so that's the thing it's like

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.640
well you know how do you

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.440
how do you make a safe space how do you

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.840
make a space that that's comfortable to

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:42.880
for people to

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:47.360
to open up um and i think that that's

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.480
a huge challenge especially for for

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.720
for young men whatever a lot of a lot of

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.760
guys to

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.000
to be to be frank about about their

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:56.799
feelings or

00:25:56.799 --> 00:25:59.039
even you know be vulnerable enough with

00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:00.640
themselves sorry for sounding like

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.360
[ __ ]

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.520
but being vulnerable enough with them

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.679
with themselves to sort of be in touch

00:26:05.679 --> 00:26:06.320
with their

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.039
with their own emotions and and have the

00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:10.320
the insight into

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.840
oh well here here are sort of the

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.360
thought distortions

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.840
that are that are present uh so you know

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.320
working with someone who's unable to

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:22.320
introspect uh is is very difficult

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.840
yeah well that and you know this gets

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.600
this kind of is you know part of the

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.799
heart of it is like you know as we're

00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:27.760
talking about this

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.200
how do you create a safe space person

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.200
open up you'll hear people oh shut the

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:31.840
[ __ ] up

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.039
let me even say like i sound like a

00:26:33.039 --> 00:26:34.960
[ __ ] here but you'll hear people

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.320
and i i can hear them already like oh

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.600
shut the [ __ ] up all these people are

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.320
disenfranchised it's like dude

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.240
you sit there with a 13 year old kid

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.559
from west philly and get it just peek in

00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:45.919
through their little sunroof of a light

00:26:45.919 --> 00:26:46.880
you know when they start telling you

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.000
about their life and you're it's just

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.320
like

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.679
what the [ __ ] it's crazy it's insane but

00:26:51.679 --> 00:26:54.240
that being said it's like yeah no it is

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.000
it's like how do you turn a room

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.440
with two people into a place where

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.440
somebody can just let it out dude be

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.440
like all right this is what's going on

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.279
it's like you know or the only other

00:27:03.279 --> 00:27:04.559
option is to hold that all inside

00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:06.400
themselves and slowly drive themselves

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:06.720
or

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.200
everybody else around them nuts so it's

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.120
like rather than being like oh [ __ ]

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.720
it's like you probably bother everybody

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.159
at your [ __ ] job

00:27:14.159 --> 00:27:16.159
so you can hold on to this thing of like

00:27:16.159 --> 00:27:17.919
[ __ ] that [ __ ] for [ __ ] [ __ ] it's

00:27:17.919 --> 00:27:18.559
like

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:20.159
dude people probably [ __ ] sigh

00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:23.200
heavily when they see you get to work

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.919
and everyone knows like exactly like

00:27:25.919 --> 00:27:26.559
everyone

00:27:26.559 --> 00:27:28.559
everyone knows like you're you're

00:27:28.559 --> 00:27:30.159
dealing with some [ __ ]

00:27:30.159 --> 00:27:32.080
yeah i'm not gonna talk to you know

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.440
scott today like he's

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.320
he's in a [ __ ] mood again and so it's

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.440
yeah it's it's like

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.960
it's yeah it's thinly veiled

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.679
you know depression anxiety whatever it

00:27:43.679 --> 00:27:44.480
may be

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.320
yeah no you're right man it and you know

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.520
it's you know not to go

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.960
too far off the subject but it the idea

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.399
as far as we had it drilled in our head

00:27:52.399 --> 00:27:54.480
that we're so much

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.840
like uh non-interdependent separate

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.520
physical entities is crazy it's like

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.120
you're constantly

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.960
we we have total access to each other's

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.039
physio physiological systems by how we

00:28:05.039 --> 00:28:06.640
talk to each other how we interact

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.240
how we put ourselves off to other people

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.360
it's like you know we're constantly

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.279
taking in and putting out and it's like

00:28:11.279 --> 00:28:13.360
it's important to you know deal with

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.880
yourself otherwise everybody [ __ ]

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.240
else has to and it's just like god what

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.159
the [ __ ] wrong with that person

00:28:18.159 --> 00:28:20.559
yeah and from and from motivating people

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:21.840
to do stuff

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.120
uh you know exactly that like i i i find

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:25.600
that

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.559
uh you know in my own in my own work um

00:28:28.559 --> 00:28:29.120
that

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.399
that people who uh uh uh

00:28:32.399 --> 00:28:35.520
feel guilty uh because of the the

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.200
relationships that are that are

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.720
compromised because of their own mental

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.440
health

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.360
so features that are super uh protective

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.480
uh in terms of suicide um are

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.159
healthy relationships especially with

00:28:48.159 --> 00:28:49.919
children um

00:28:49.919 --> 00:28:52.799
so it is it's one way to motivate people

00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:54.559
like if not for yourself do it for your

00:28:54.559 --> 00:28:55.120
[ __ ]

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.520
kids do it for your co-co-workers so

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.640
that you know you're not getting a bit

00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.520
of a piece of a

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.000
piece of [ __ ] so that's yeah that's fair

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.600
the protective factor things is cool too

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.399
and i'm uh

00:29:04.399 --> 00:29:05.600
i was funny i was actually reading about

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.080
that today but the

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.440
um so so just i'm gonna try to

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.720
zoom it in so the uh yeah so the medical

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.919
model you're saying there's

00:29:15.919 --> 00:29:16.799
everyone's always talking about the

00:29:16.799 --> 00:29:19.120
pills and you know all that

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.600
so why do you think that came about in

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.200
terms of i know there's obviously

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.720
the economic side of it and there was

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.440
you know this

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.799
there's a i feel like a lot of people

00:29:28.799 --> 00:29:30.640
who i mean maybe i'm wrong but would

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.640
want their consciousness just to be some

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.279
like thing wafting off of the physical

00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:36.720
meat of their brain

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.120
yeah well i think yeah to keep going

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.640
like

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.679
so you know and i can cite sort of

00:29:43.679 --> 00:29:46.080
more objective stuff but like a simple

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.679
idea is that

00:29:47.679 --> 00:29:49.039
we've known forever that our

00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:51.200
consciousness can be

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.200
uh dramatically changed by you know

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.360
substances that we imbibe right

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.919
so things like alcohol or in you know

00:29:57.919 --> 00:29:59.360
things like aldol

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.720
so it's a it's an easy way to to

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.840
uh to deal with especially from a

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.600
medical perspective

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:11.440
which you know psychiatry as a branch of

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.720
medicine

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.120
works within the the medical model where

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.320
there is a

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.960
underlying physiologic or neuro

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.039
neuroanatomic abnormality

00:30:21.039 --> 00:30:22.880
which needs to be addressed from a

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.559
physio physiology

00:30:24.559 --> 00:30:27.440
perspective right and and i think that

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.240
that's the

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.760
the philosophy that has informed uh

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.399
that model and and there and there's

00:30:34.399 --> 00:30:36.000
it's been validated so you know

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
some some interesting uh uh

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.240
uh you know illustrations of that on the

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.200
spectrum would be

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.399
for example in the case of parkinson's

00:30:46.399 --> 00:30:47.120
disease and

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.520
and parkinsonian depression uh which is

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.159
which was not uncommon is not uncommon

00:30:52.159 --> 00:30:54.000
you know you have in your in your

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
substantia [ __ ]

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.559
dopamine neurons that die and when you

00:30:58.559 --> 00:31:00.799
have less than about 80 percent of them

00:31:00.799 --> 00:31:03.440
you get depressed and and tremulous and

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.799
you get it it could be

00:31:04.799 --> 00:31:07.360
a catheter and you you manifest these

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.960
symptoms and you start shaking and

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:09.600
suffering yeah

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.200
exactly you cut into the brain and you

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.279
can literally see the [ __ ]

00:31:13.279 --> 00:31:15.760
substantia like the the black substance

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:16.320
that is

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.799
atrophy that is gone so that that type

00:31:18.799 --> 00:31:19.360
of thing

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.279
it's that's super cool right it

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:23.440
definitely reinforces the model

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.919
you know similarly and and this has been

00:31:25.919 --> 00:31:27.440
you know especially the past couple of

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.720
decades

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.919
um as relates to drug use and drug

00:31:31.919 --> 00:31:32.480
seeking

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.880
well we know that there's a structure in

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.600
the brain the

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.000
the nucleus accumbens where if you you

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.399
flood that area with dopamine

00:31:40.399 --> 00:31:42.960
a [ __ ] rat will press a bar until it

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.399
dies

00:31:44.399 --> 00:31:47.679
i mean and uh they and you can

00:31:47.679 --> 00:31:50.799
you know recapitulate that uh uh

00:31:50.799 --> 00:31:52.320
neuroanatomy or

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.080
physiology with things like cocaine

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.840
methamphetamine alcohol

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.360
so there there's definitely uh

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.600
physiologic neuro neuroanatomic

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.480
correlates

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:06.640
to uh important types of mental illness

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.600
but things like depression and anxiety

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.240
which

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.440
i think interestingly enough um uh

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.559
are the things that gps encounter uh

00:32:16.559 --> 00:32:18.880
and are left to deal with are far more

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.399
complicated

00:32:20.399 --> 00:32:22.480
yeah well it's also like all right so

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.559
you have me i'm kicking around i'm just

00:32:24.559 --> 00:32:27.600
bummed i'm paranoid i'm angry i want to

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.640
[ __ ] kill people

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.559
whatever you name whatever it is and

00:32:30.559 --> 00:32:31.919
then you you know hit me with the hell

00:32:31.919 --> 00:32:32.399
doll

00:32:32.399 --> 00:32:35.919
i'm on uh you know [ __ ] for adhd

00:32:35.919 --> 00:32:38.960
i'm on ssris i you hit me with

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.120
the full chemical soup and yet you know

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.640
i'm you know i'm kind of walking through

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.320
the day kind of cloudy

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.679
but there's still that part of me that's

00:32:45.679 --> 00:32:47.600
just like [ __ ] this [ __ ]

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.440
sucks you know on a small scale it's

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.240
like

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.600
you know you can you can definitely

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.200
reduce symptoms for sure but then

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.200
there's also the act of

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:59.200
how do you have somebody let's say

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.679
you know reinterpret their life as

00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:02.799
something that's meaningful

00:33:02.799 --> 00:33:04.480
something that kind of feels genuine to

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.080
them and you know feels like they're

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.240
moving in a way that doesn't make them

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.679
i think the best way i've heard it was

00:33:09.679 --> 00:33:11.360
in this one book uh

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.120
by rolo may the courage to create it's

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.760
like how do you have a person

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.000
increase or sustain their appetite for

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
life it's kind of like that simple

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.679
yeah you know it's like can a pill

00:33:23.679 --> 00:33:25.039
if you're like [ __ ] my life sucks [ __ ]

00:33:25.039 --> 00:33:26.559
my life sucks you take a pill and you're

00:33:26.559 --> 00:33:28.399
like no my life actually kind of rules

00:33:28.399 --> 00:33:29.760
you know is that as different as

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.360
somebody just kind of like making you

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.279
have an insight to be like oh wow you

00:33:33.279 --> 00:33:33.600
know

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.240
all this stuff's cool so yeah it is it's

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:36.880
incredibly

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.519
weird and complex and strange but

00:33:39.519 --> 00:33:41.360
they're almost to me as like you know i

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.720
would say this personally

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.960
the idea that somebody could now like my

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.919
whole

00:33:45.919 --> 00:33:47.760
you know mental enterprise could just be

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.279
like yeah dude just you know

00:33:49.279 --> 00:33:50.960
i see that you're here trying to think

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.480
your way out of this just take this bill

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.519
you'll be fine

00:33:53.519 --> 00:33:54.960
that kind of offends me i'm like what

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.799
the [ __ ] you know what are you doing

00:33:56.799 --> 00:33:59.440
it's it's so offensive and it must it

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.200
must be so offensive

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.320
as someone who has committed

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.919
you know their their education what

00:34:05.919 --> 00:34:07.360
you're you know probably

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.079
20 grand in debt so you're you know

00:34:10.079 --> 00:34:10.960
you're literally

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:14.720
invested you're literally invested

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.839
uh yeah to to simplify to simplify it

00:34:17.839 --> 00:34:18.480
like that

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.760
and to get paid yeah to to manage it

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.639
that way

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:24.879
it must be so frustrating to see and

00:34:24.879 --> 00:34:26.399
it's frustrating for me to see and you

00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:27.119
know that's

00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:28.879
that's why i'm i'm getting involved

00:34:28.879 --> 00:34:30.560
right appreciate that

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.760
yeah um but it's yeah

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:37.359
so like you said motivating people um

00:34:37.359 --> 00:34:40.000
making a safe space for for exploring

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.800
that

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:44.079
you know getting rid of of stigma um

00:34:44.079 --> 00:34:46.960
which is what sort of i think definitely

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:47.599
cbt

00:34:47.599 --> 00:34:49.440
into a lesser degree you know

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.800
psychoanalytic uh

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.320
fields uh uh move away from the idea of

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:54.720
the

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:58.160
of the broken uh or dysfunctioning piece

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.280
of flesh

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.839
to uh a consciousness that doesn't fully

00:35:01.839 --> 00:35:03.440
understand itself

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.079
yeah exactly and i i kind of i think i

00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:07.599
like that way that you put it and

00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:09.280
i sorry i'm so hung up on the safe space

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.880
thing but it's like

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.800
it's so and this is the thing i ran into

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.240
in my school where it's like people will

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.359
be like

00:35:15.359 --> 00:35:16.400
in my school they're like this is

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.520
supposed to be it's like they would

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.880
always be like well you know what

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.079
they would always ask me like what do

00:35:20.079 --> 00:35:21.520
you think and you know i always would

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.800
throw my hat in the ring on stuff and

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.520
then just

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.520
by me talking they would be like this

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.960
place is supposed to be a safe space

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.400
it's not a safe space i'm like well it's

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.240
not it's not a safe space it's

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.320
it's an exclusionary space right

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.720
sometimes for people to be able to like

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.720
open up there has to be certain elements

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.000
removed from like my

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.040
my presence in the way i think and talk

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.560
inhibited people from speaking and made

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:43.839
people feel uncomfortable and it's like

00:35:43.839 --> 00:35:45.040
that's fine i'm not even mad at them or

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.000
anything but

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.839
it's like if say you cr corral a thing

00:35:47.839 --> 00:35:49.760
like a pack like the dogs

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.040
there's certain stuff that can't be in

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.240
that room or it's going to send people

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:52.880
into weird

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.960
it's going to trigger you know everyone

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.560
thinks only like girls with purple you

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.320
know sideburns can get triggered

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.760
but you can if you get a room full of

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.040
landscapers there's things i can say

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.400
that'll trigger those guys and make them

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.440
[ __ ] spaz like

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.800
[ __ ] you you're [ __ ] gay [ __ ] it

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.000
you know it's like to think that you're

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.359
immune from that it's so you're

00:36:09.359 --> 00:36:10.400
absolutely right

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.720
and it's

00:36:17.119 --> 00:36:19.520
it's a loaded term absolutely so it's

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.640
and yeah sorry

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.560
and so don't be sorry it's it's you know

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.680
people need to

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.920
accept that it's like there are you need

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.839
to feel like

00:36:27.839 --> 00:36:30.400
let's say i'm trying to think like i

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.920
always think of like a try like a small

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.200
little tribal band like everyone's on

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.359
the same page ever like all the [ __ ]

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:36.880
is out of the room that would normally

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.440
trip up

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.200
a conversation that's what you're

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.040
referring to no and i'm glad

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.200
i'm glad you've you've highlighted that

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.040
like yeah no the

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:48.160
safe space is is so charged and is it is

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.119
a shitty turn

00:36:49.119 --> 00:36:52.400
i the the my meaning is like an enabling

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.320
space

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.599
set and setting when people talk about

00:36:55.599 --> 00:36:56.800
like trip if you're like yo you need to

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.920
set up a safe space before you do

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.359
mushrooms you're like right no doubt

00:36:59.359 --> 00:37:01.040
i need a safe space to talk that well

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.160
you [ __ ] gay dude you don't need to

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:02.800
[ __ ] say

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.240
it's like you know so yeah you're 100

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.079
right it's an enabling space it's an

00:37:06.079 --> 00:37:07.359
encouraging space

00:37:07.359 --> 00:37:09.280
yeah so in it they're in addition to

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.880
rainbow stickers

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.920
uh i think that yeah like in in

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.800
in my work with with young men and you

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.400
know that's kind of the group that

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.240
that i think is most interesting because

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.000
we've all struggled this [ __ ] i i've

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.680
struggled with tons of [ __ ]

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.880
and i think that being placated

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.400
and being um uh being

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.839
uh you know babied essentially

00:37:33.839 --> 00:37:36.800
uh uh is is unhelpful and in fact it's

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.680
harmful

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.880
um and so in some ways you know

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.560
quote-unquote safe space

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.800
in the the context of helping you know

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.640
dogs deal with [ __ ]

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.240
is is calling them on their [ __ ] yes

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.720
yeah like an enabling space and you know

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.680
that's short of

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.640
of people that are suicidal and i'm sure

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.320
there's going to be listeners that are

00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.920
that have that type you know those types

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.520
of thoughts and just go talk to your

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.280
talk to your doctor you know number one

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.680
this isn't medical advice but

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.839
the the there's there are people that

00:38:07.839 --> 00:38:09.520
that can be suicidal and

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.839
some advice that's been helpful you know

00:38:11.839 --> 00:38:12.880
when when

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.520
when i'm at my lowest is like suck it up

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.960
stop being a [ __ ]

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.280
and you're not going to get and sorry

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.480
you know i'm sorry but

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.400
and i know that's very blunt and i i'm

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.760
not i'm not trying to

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.200
uh brush i'm talking about myself sure

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.640
and that's not something that you're

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.960
going to hear from

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.960
oh and how are you today and did you did

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.400
you complete our questionnaire

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.560
yeah and how are you feeling and how are

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.079
you dealing with that

00:38:38.079 --> 00:38:40.320
like that [ __ ] you know the reframe

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.440
that's that's dude i'm telling you i

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.560
just went to school with people who all

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.400
they learned how to do is be like

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.800
wow so that must have been very scary

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.680
wow

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.680
wow oh that must be very troubling oh

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.960
wow and you're just like yeah

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.119
it [ __ ] is what do you yeah what you

00:38:53.119 --> 00:38:54.320
know what it means which again

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.920
could work for some people but i i would

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.520
sit in a room and be totally freaked out

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.440
but exactly the voice you're doing

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.000
that was my school 24 7. and there's

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.200
there's a place for that and it's good

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.800
people are able to do that whatever

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.440
but yeah dude exactly like wow that must

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.880
have been very scary tearing me more

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:09.440
we're like

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.880
there's a good people people are like

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.560
yeah what the [ __ ] are you talking about

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:16.240
that's what i just said but yeah you're

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.560
just reiterating how shitty it is yeah

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.520
and and so these

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:22.160
sort of like empty platitudes yes um

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:22.720
that are

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.520
that are less than helpful your

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.280
therapist voice is very very good too

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.240
it's pretty accurate

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.560
well obviously i've been around enough

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:31.680
of them

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:36.320
so i i that's that's where i'm coming

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.960
i'm coming you know at it and i'm coming

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.880
i'm coming out it's like seeing

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.480
seeing people suffer you know like

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.240
seeing people get incarcerated seeing

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:44.560
people

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.760
lose their kids um substance misused as

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.760
being a huge issue

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:53.040
um and yeah and and uh

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:56.720
talking about a framework in order to to

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.720
deal with it and it is sort of

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.320
petersonian or whatever

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.800
or uh you know before him like descartes

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.520
but just

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.800
acknowledging the the

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.480
tragedy that is life and

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.440
uh highlighting the the the amazing

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:13.839
things

00:40:13.839 --> 00:40:16.560
like the matte and chain podcasts and

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.440
being able to

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.359
to laugh but at the same time not sort

00:40:19.359 --> 00:40:20.720
of uh

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.760
ignoring problems as they fester and

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.880
spread

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.200
yeah so yeah and also that's the thing

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.720
too it's like

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.720
like maybe this is getting older but i

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.599
remember being in my 20s and being like

00:40:33.599 --> 00:40:35.920
chasing this like what i i call now i

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:36.720
actually

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.800
coined the term today this sense of like

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.480
mythical winning where you're like oh my

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.359
god it's all

00:40:41.359 --> 00:40:42.560
if i do this thing it's going to come

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.079
together and then i'm going to do this

00:40:44.079 --> 00:40:45.359
and if i don't do this stuff my whole

00:40:45.359 --> 00:40:46.560
life's not worth it and i have to do

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.000
this thing

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.760
and then like you know you hit 34 and

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.040
you're like all right i've done maybe

00:40:53.599 --> 00:40:55.280
but you eventually have to start you

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.720
know living your life

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.119
on you it your actual life's terms and

00:40:59.119 --> 00:41:00.720
then going from there rather than being

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:01.200
like

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.280
i'm going to i'm going to transcend my

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.560
entire life

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:08.079
by this one thing or this one person or

00:41:08.079 --> 00:41:09.520
i think that's one thing that trips up a

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.119
lot of people especially maybe dudes

00:41:11.119 --> 00:41:12.480
more than girls i don't know

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.880
but maybe that's just a personality type

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.599
no it

00:41:15.599 --> 00:41:18.079
but i and you see that and people you

00:41:18.079 --> 00:41:18.720
know

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:21.040
crash their ship on on the sea of

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:21.839
ambition

00:41:21.839 --> 00:41:24.240
sort of all the time and and and it's

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.839
you know reframing goals and

00:41:25.839 --> 00:41:27.760
and we'll get into that obviously in

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.240
later episode episodes in terms of like

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.800
cognitive distortions and useful i think

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.240
useful frameworks from

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.640
from things like uh psychoanalysis and

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.760
cbt

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.440
um that that are that are super helpful

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.839
and so in terms of sort of the the the

00:41:43.839 --> 00:41:44.640
structure

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.640
uh if we can chat about that a little

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.400
bit yeah um

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.839
uh do you have anything else to say

00:41:49.839 --> 00:41:50.880
about them sorry do you have anything

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.079
else there with a biomedical model i

00:41:52.079 --> 00:41:53.599
think we did a good job explaining

00:41:53.599 --> 00:41:54.960
like how it works and you know there's

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.640
just been an evolution of

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:57.839
different medicines that have been kind

00:41:57.839 --> 00:41:59.680
of thrown at people side effects take

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.040
that one away try this one less side

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.160
effects okay cool oh

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.520
actually that had more side effects we

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.200
didn't know about so that's kind of the

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.240
the point of it i guess they're just

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.680
been throwing things at people and you

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:08.319
know

00:42:08.319 --> 00:42:10.319
building yeah this profit center thing

00:42:10.319 --> 00:42:12.079
that's really supposed to be about

00:42:12.079 --> 00:42:13.760
you know making people tapping into a

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.119
thing we don't even really understand

00:42:15.119 --> 00:42:16.800
that you know at the seat of it

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.800
exactly and and don't get me wrong like

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.000
there's there's huge

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.480
so you know there there is there's

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.280
validity

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.520
so for example you know in the case of

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.000
schizophrenia or paranoid schizophrenia

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.200
uh twin identical twin concordance

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.920
is on the order of 50 so unfortunately

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.119
there are these huge

00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:37.280
genetic predispositions and that's

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.160
knowing that is

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:42.160
is useful for early interventions um

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:45.440
in the case of major

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.920
mental illness and for things that are

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:48.560
much more

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:51.200
you know what i would call uh cortical

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:51.680
or

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.480
the the uh the term that's used is super

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.200
tentorial when when you want to subtly

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.000
uh

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.680
say that that someone is having like a

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:01.680
functional problem you say it's super

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:02.400
tentorial

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.800
that's awesome yeah it says it's like

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.839
doctor talk for

00:43:05.839 --> 00:43:08.960
that person's being a [ __ ] um

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:12.079
there that's way more complicated

00:43:12.079 --> 00:43:13.839
but there's cool and and just a quick

00:43:13.839 --> 00:43:15.520
thing there's cool sort of empirical

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.119
ways to get at that as well

00:43:17.119 --> 00:43:19.440
so the idea is like okay well maybe we

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.280
don't understand what the [ __ ] is going

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.240
on maybe we don't

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:25.040
understand the massively complex

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.280
circuitry that's that's underlying it

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.640
however if from a purely empirical

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.839
perspective

00:43:31.839 --> 00:43:36.160
that is uh uh a medication

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:39.440
let's say like paxtil uh is moderately

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.560
effective

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.920
um for for depression and in an animal

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.920
model and this is this is how these

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:46.800
drugs are

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:51.040
are uh validated early on uh helps a

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:55.040
mouse who is suspended from his tail

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.599
struggle struggle for a prolonged period

00:43:57.599 --> 00:43:58.960
of time

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:01.760
uh that suggests that if paxol does that

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:02.720
to a mouse

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.720
that this that this substance under

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.720
investigation may likewise be

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.839
therapeutic in a human so that yeah like

00:44:09.839 --> 00:44:10.960
that's literally

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:14.480
how uh the the drug assays and early

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.520
animal models

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:18.079
uh are used in addition to looking at

00:44:18.079 --> 00:44:20.240
things like hippocampal neurogenesis

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.520
it's a good way it's a good way to like

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.520
try to like get into the feeling of

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.200
being there's like a 45 year old dude

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.640
who hates its job like let's just spend

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:27.930
a mouse from its tail

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:31.760
[Laughter]

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.079
the scientist who came up with that is

00:44:34.079 --> 00:44:35.599
like

00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:37.440
how do i really encapsulate what it's

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.160
like to be a [ __ ] white collar

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.920
i'm a rat hanging from my tail

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:45.520
jesus christ yeah that's i mean the

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.359
animal trials you always forget like you

00:44:47.359 --> 00:44:48.240
know they'll come up with some

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.839
breakthrough for blindness so yo they

00:44:49.839 --> 00:44:52.400
just gouged out 10 monkeys eyes so

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:55.200
yeah you'd be happy but yeah that's yeah

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:55.680
so

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.720
all right so yeah so i do and i do like

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.800
the fact again i i try to keep myself as

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.000
i can easily go off the cliff and be

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.440
like it's all [ __ ] [ __ ] this let's

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:05.119
do this thing so i do like that you're

00:45:05.119 --> 00:45:05.839
you're obviously

00:45:05.839 --> 00:45:07.920
you know you're very tempered in it you

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:09.599
can recognize weaknesses while out

00:45:09.599 --> 00:45:11.040
trying to like tear down the whole thing

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.480
because yeah you shouldn't there's been

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.160
a gazillion breakthroughs a gazillion

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.839
super helpful things that this thing has

00:45:15.839 --> 00:45:16.640
done

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.920
but it does fail a lot of people

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.079
still especially in anxiety and

00:45:22.079 --> 00:45:23.520
depression who are presenting to family

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.880
doctors

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:28.240
yeah yeah

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:31.520
so in terms of the structure yeah

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:34.560
okay what uh do did you have any thought

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.319
i know we talked about this a little bit

00:45:36.319 --> 00:45:37.599
beforehand um

00:45:37.599 --> 00:45:41.440
last week but um you're just chatting

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.280
yeah a couple cool things like looking

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.960
at the post is like

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:48.240
the the sort of uh expertise that can be

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.359
crowdsourced

00:45:49.359 --> 00:45:52.720
from dogs already you know that that

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:56.000
that have done uh uh graduate uh

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.800
work uh in the space is amazing so i

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.000
think that there obviously there's going

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.680
to be like organic

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:05.040
growth to the program and and uh it's uh

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.599
it's going to be polished um you know

00:46:07.599 --> 00:46:08.960
obviously with the with the dog

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.640
community but i thought

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:12.160
we were chatting about like in terms of

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:14.079
phase one uh

00:46:14.079 --> 00:46:17.680
and rolling it out adapting uh

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:19.760
adopting a you know relatively tried and

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.440
true model so and i

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:23.440
and you were gonna sort of decide how to

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.119
best go about that but

00:46:25.119 --> 00:46:28.079
soliciting people to say you know this

00:46:28.079 --> 00:46:29.119
is what's been

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:32.000
bothering me this is my scenario and and

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.200
we had some ideas about

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.640
submitting those anonymously um yeah

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:39.359
yeah so yeah and that's kind of two

00:46:39.359 --> 00:46:39.839
parts

00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:41.920
there's the this is this is i'm still

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.359
again i'm still puzzling this out so

00:46:43.359 --> 00:46:44.240
there's like

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.160
i look at it like this there's the

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:47.839
podcast this podcast

00:46:47.839 --> 00:46:50.240
you know this is this uh which i'm gonna

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.760
call it so there's this podcast which is

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.359
just like the talking part of it

00:46:53.359 --> 00:46:55.440
and then there's the let's say

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.200
underbelly of this podcast which would

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.480
be this program

00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:00.079
that we kind of want to roll out where

00:47:00.079 --> 00:47:01.599
it's like you know pure

00:47:01.599 --> 00:47:03.680
a peer network where it's kind of like

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:04.960
peer-led

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.480
by you know other people kind of like

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.440
there's somebody who's kind of

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:08.640
moderating the group and

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.240
it's not just like a totally

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.079
free-flowing four-people meet and go oh

00:47:12.079 --> 00:47:13.440
no what are you doing there would be uh

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.200
somebody kind of leading and kind of who

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.319
would

00:47:16.319 --> 00:47:18.720
know what they're doing obviously try to

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.400
lead people and kind of um

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.240
you know discovering like you know one

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.079
specific topic at a time

00:47:24.079 --> 00:47:25.599
but you're saying within that there

00:47:25.599 --> 00:47:27.599
could be either from those groups or

00:47:27.599 --> 00:47:30.079
like having just like an open on like

00:47:30.079 --> 00:47:31.680
kind of like a portal like a

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:33.200
somewhere to kind of email to or

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:34.640
somewhere to send stuff to where people

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:35.920
could just send their presenting

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:36.880
problems

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.040
and then they could be uh you know

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.640
obviously they'd be highly anonymized

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:41.760
and all the stuff but they

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.040
if people were willing to be they could

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:45.839
be hashed out and kind of like discussed

00:47:45.839 --> 00:47:47.280
and kind of kicked around people could

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:48.800
like hear their thing get kind of kicked

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.079
around does that make sense

00:47:50.079 --> 00:47:52.400
yeah exactly like it basically you're

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.160
you're crowd sourcing

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.800
solutions yes you know like and with

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.000
people that are

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.319
probably like-minded probably of the

00:48:00.319 --> 00:48:02.240
same gender probably at the same race

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:04.079
probably within a decade of each other

00:48:04.079 --> 00:48:04.960
you know what i mean like

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.400
true yeah you're you've got you've got

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.800
thousands you know people that have been

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.160
through the same [ __ ] right um so

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.559
you're you're harnessing that experience

00:48:14.559 --> 00:48:15.520
and in some case

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.160
expertise uh to help i never thought

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.760
about it that way yeah it is kind of

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:20.960
like

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:23.040
even yeah for people and it's funny too

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.800
because it would be

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.240
you know there is obviously there's some

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.000
difference the dogs have a slightly

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.599
uh we have a little bit of diversity in

00:48:29.599 --> 00:48:31.440
terms of beliefs and stuff like that but

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.400
it's pretty

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.839
root level i think everyone is on a

00:48:33.839 --> 00:48:35.359
relatively same page so yeah i didn't

00:48:35.359 --> 00:48:37.119
think about that to be able to even just

00:48:37.119 --> 00:48:38.079
like

00:48:38.079 --> 00:48:39.599
put something out and just get like a

00:48:39.599 --> 00:48:41.280
boom just like a

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:43.599
hyper feedback from you know and how we

00:48:43.599 --> 00:48:44.319
would do

00:48:44.319 --> 00:48:45.839
i'm curious because it could be like you

00:48:45.839 --> 00:48:47.119
know maybe it would be covered and then

00:48:47.119 --> 00:48:48.559
you could just people would just comment

00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:50.160
below you know cut people commenting the

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.000
things so people can kind of you can

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.319
see people having a discussion of

00:48:54.319 --> 00:48:55.839
whatever it is that's ailing a certain

00:48:55.839 --> 00:48:57.280
person and then you know that creates

00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.880
more of a kind of discourse and people

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.079
then it's not just that person there's

00:49:00.079 --> 00:49:01.200
people who are like yeah me too and

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.160
here's blah blah blah

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.319
blah so that's kind of cool yeah this is

00:49:04.319 --> 00:49:06.160
how i solved it

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.599
you know i was getting i was getting

00:49:07.599 --> 00:49:09.040
cocked and i had to get my [ __ ]

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.960
girlfriend out of the house

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:13.119
like you know and it's there's real [ __ ]

00:49:13.119 --> 00:49:15.280
right sure there's there's real [ __ ] and

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.240
and again i i want to make it clear this

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.400
does not substitute for

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:22.800
uh for medical advice or medical or

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:23.680
professional advice and if you're

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:24.640
feeling suicidal

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:27.440
you need to talk to your doctor um but

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:27.760
uh

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:31.520
yeah in terms of submitting those uh

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.760
issues i guess we can we can refine that

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:34.880
a little bit but there is

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:37.119
there are ways for example google forms

00:49:37.119 --> 00:49:38.240
uh where it's a

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:41.599
totally anonymized um and uh

00:49:41.599 --> 00:49:44.079
you know demographics or identifying

00:49:44.079 --> 00:49:45.040
information

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:47.280
you know matt knows what he's doing yeah

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.720
all that all that [ __ ] would be

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.200
would be totally anonymized and sort of

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.880
obfuscated and obscured

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.720
so that that no one could be just like

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:57.119
the core problem not like oh i'm this

00:49:57.119 --> 00:49:59.040
on this one you know i'm this old i work

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.720
at this kind of place

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:01.760
you know just be like here's the

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.000
presenting problem um

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.440
yeah i like that idea i like so i like

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:07.119
doing this is how this is how i'm seeing

00:50:07.119 --> 00:50:07.920
the whole thing

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.559
it's like within the next couple weeks i

00:50:10.559 --> 00:50:11.520
want to have like

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:13.119
you know i'm not going to go too crazy

00:50:13.119 --> 00:50:14.800
too fast at once i have there's a couple

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.240
people in mind who um

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:17.520
have hit me up who have said like hey

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.280
you know i am experienced in this domain

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.400
i've you know i've gotten either like my

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.040
masters i

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:23.040
there's someone who works who kind of

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.559
does this as well

00:50:24.559 --> 00:50:26.000
in the military and you know people hit

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.839
me up so i could a couple people at a

00:50:27.839 --> 00:50:29.040
time like all right you know

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.559
what are you willing to do you know and

00:50:30.559 --> 00:50:31.839
whatever you want to do obviously

00:50:31.839 --> 00:50:33.119
there's no pressure but it's like say

00:50:33.119 --> 00:50:34.720
you can take six people a week

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.720
i could probably do like you know 18 i

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:37.680
could probably do like three or four

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:38.800
groups a week and then a couple other

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:39.520
people do it

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:40.880
and then as people are doing it they

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:41.920
kind of get the hang they might say hey

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:43.200
i want to claim i want to do my own

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.640
group it's like all right cool

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:45.920
here's you know here's a little waiting

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.520
list bam here's six people you guys go

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:49.119
if you need me let me know

00:50:49.119 --> 00:50:50.640
i'll check i'll come check in whatever

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.559
so that's how i kind of see it going

00:50:52.559 --> 00:50:54.880
yeah exactly and in that way you you're

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:56.000
you're creating you know

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.359
a sustainable network um well that way

00:50:59.359 --> 00:51:00.800
i think become discord i don't want

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.079
people to go in there and just like sit

00:51:02.079 --> 00:51:02.800
there and be like oh

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.960
[ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] he like you

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.800
know turned into like a discord chat

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:08.079
we're just like dude [ __ ]

00:51:08.079 --> 00:51:10.400
the you know i do want it to be pointed

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.920
i want it to be kind of specific

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.119
i want to have areas that are more

00:51:13.119 --> 00:51:14.319
general for people who want to be more

00:51:14.319 --> 00:51:15.680
general and i want to have ones that are

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:16.319
like

00:51:16.319 --> 00:51:19.839
very specific like anger issues

00:51:19.839 --> 00:51:21.040
uh relational issues you know

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.480
relationship issues so i do want to

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.160
eventually want to have it so it's very

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:25.760
like you can be as specific as you want

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:26.400
it to be

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:27.760
and it can be like you have a more

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.760
general just like life

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:32.240
discussion stuff yeah and it and then

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.880
you know discussing around those

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.480
we might call them vignettes or whatever

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:38.000
the hell you want to call them

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.520
um uh uh organizes that and it makes it

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:42.960
[ __ ] entertaining and here's the

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.240
here's the thing you're gonna be called

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.000
you're gonna be called a [ __ ] oh

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:46.480
you're gonna

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:48.559
call the i know you're gonna be called a

00:51:48.559 --> 00:51:49.520
[ __ ]

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:52.000
that that's it is what it is you know

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.200
like like

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.119
i don't give a [ __ ] it's my crucifix

00:51:55.119 --> 00:51:56.720
that's my crucifix to die on

00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:58.480
that's your cross across the barrier

00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:00.300
inri is just [ __ ]

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:03.599
[Laughter]

00:52:03.599 --> 00:52:06.720
but i'll take it if it helps people and

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:09.040
it justifies that forty thousand dollars

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:09.839
of debt

00:52:09.839 --> 00:52:11.680
that you've incurred yeah well that's

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.280
the thing that's this is the pattern i'm

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.640
fighting against in my life which is

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:15.200
like just

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.720
doing things randomly and being like

00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:18.319
well that didn't go anywhere

00:52:18.319 --> 00:52:19.599
all right what's next it's like i am

00:52:19.599 --> 00:52:20.720
trying to i've been doing this thing the

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.839
last year or so where i've been

00:52:21.839 --> 00:52:22.800
integrating all my

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.640
integrating everything i do and all of

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:26.559
my interests into something

00:52:26.559 --> 00:52:28.640
resembling some sort of shape or point

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.160
rather than just being like

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:31.920
i'm gonna do this oh this kind of sucks

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.359
i'm gonna do this oh that kind of sucks

00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:34.319
the next thing you know you're like what

00:52:34.319 --> 00:52:35.040
the [ __ ] am i

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:37.119
i have a gazillion loose ends right now

00:52:37.119 --> 00:52:38.640
so i've been kind of bringing everything

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:39.920
in under one thing and i'm

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:41.359
i'm totally happy with what i'm doing

00:52:41.359 --> 00:52:43.040
and i'm you know i i honestly

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.119
don't i really don't i don't care if

00:52:45.119 --> 00:52:46.400
people like oh you're [ __ ] gay that

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.920
sucks i'm like dude that's

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.480
totally fine because i've you know i'm

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.240
not like a super experienced therapist

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:53.599
or anything but again i've worked with

00:52:53.599 --> 00:52:54.880
kids in high school

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:57.200
and like i was when you watch people

00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:58.000
make

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.400
like actual tangible change and you

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:02.480
watch their like life become less of a

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.200
hell

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.800
it's them it's to me it's like the best

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.079
thing in the world i watch that and it

00:53:06.079 --> 00:53:06.400
just

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.640
it makes me feel so happy so it's like

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:10.880
all that i just i don't care i really

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.640
really don't care about the other stuff

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.240
again and i like i like [ __ ] around

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.200
like that i like

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.280
making fun of [ __ ] it's like you know do

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.960
you do your thing i don't care but again

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:19.440
it's like

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:21.119
i'm sure you've seen this as well it's

00:53:21.119 --> 00:53:22.240
like when you see people turn these

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.440
little corners it's just

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.520
it's like the most beautiful thing you

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:26.960
can do in my opinion a person can do

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.079
with their time

00:53:28.079 --> 00:53:30.079
absolutely man and in some ways you know

00:53:30.079 --> 00:53:32.480
and i'm not here to suck your dick but

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:35.760
you know with your talents yeah

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.520
with your with your you know with your

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:39.680
skill set you know maybe you have

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:42.240
like a even a sense of responsibility so

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.680
what i think that you know most

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.680
listeners will relate to

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:50.000
is uh unique talent and abilities

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.280
for identifying you know uh

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.839
the underlying stories and things and

00:53:55.839 --> 00:53:56.319
like

00:53:56.319 --> 00:53:59.280
and and generating that narrative and

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:00.880
and listening to that and listening to

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.160
dogs that are in

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.240
a similar circumstance and crowd

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:05.920
sourcing solutions

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:08.480
i think could be potentially hugely uh

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:09.359
therapeutic

00:54:09.359 --> 00:54:11.280
so yeah here's the question this is the

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.559
question this is what i'm wondering in

00:54:12.559 --> 00:54:14.240
terms of doing that so it would be

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.400
on a the intake would their input would

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:18.240
come in like a google form or something

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:20.079
i'd spin it around kind of make it so

00:54:20.079 --> 00:54:23.040
again it's like very highly anonymized

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.720
then i'm guessing like would i read it

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.480
with if the person would person be able

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.079
to come on and talk about it so i'd have

00:54:28.079 --> 00:54:29.440
to figure that out and then the

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.280
discussion would be more in the

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.280
like i guess in like underneath for the

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.960
episode because it'll be on patreon and

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.400
then you know people can discuss yeah

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:37.920
that could be a thing in and of itself

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:38.960
where it's like exactly

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.240
because the way i'm looking at it again

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.920
i started saying this and stopped so

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:42.799
it's like

00:54:42.799 --> 00:54:44.319
you know there's the group therapy thing

00:54:44.319 --> 00:54:45.680
that's that's the kind of underlying

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:46.559
thing of all this

00:54:46.559 --> 00:54:48.000
then i'm gonna be doing a podcast or

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.119
like you know i'd be talking to you i'd

00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:50.640
be hitting any expert up that'll talk to

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.319
me about just like

00:54:52.319 --> 00:54:53.839
making sure by the way i have a

00:54:53.839 --> 00:54:55.359
psychiatrist that that's probably going

00:54:55.359 --> 00:54:56.319
to come in sorry

00:54:56.319 --> 00:54:59.680
oh yes you are yeah did i not

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:00.720
did i not tell them that you are a

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:03.680
psychiatrist dr t yeah

00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:05.680
i know i have the next guy that uh might

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:07.440
be but might be coming to chat but

00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:08.400
anyhow another guy

00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:10.400
oh hell yeah yeah that'd be sick that'd

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:11.760
be awesome yeah exactly so i want to be

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:12.880
checking in and make it like i said i

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.000
want to make sure i'm not like driving

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.440
everybody off the [ __ ] cliff

00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:17.280
so it's like i'm going to be very you

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.440
know so it so it'll be like in terms of

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.680
psych naw episodes it would be

00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:24.400
interviews with people um we could go

00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.599
through like you know one or two of

00:55:25.599 --> 00:55:26.720
those vignettes like you're talking

00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:28.000
about have people submit stuff and like

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:28.799
all right this is something somebody

00:55:28.799 --> 00:55:30.160
submitted let's go through it let's

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.400
chop it up blah blah blah and then i'm

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.319
also i'm constantly like reading about

00:55:34.319 --> 00:55:36.000
this so and i'll also be doing like i'll

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:36.799
take a book

00:55:36.799 --> 00:55:38.559
i'll take two books and then i'll just

00:55:38.559 --> 00:55:40.160
be like here's these two books i think

00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:41.359
they're pretty cool you should read them

00:55:41.359 --> 00:55:42.640
and if you don't want to read them

00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:43.760
i'm going to break them down and give

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.040
you i'm going to distill whatever i

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:46.000
found valuable

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.640
here you go exactly it's a dude it's a

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:49.839
content machine

00:55:49.839 --> 00:55:51.760
yeah i feel like it is i'm excited to do

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:54.240
that yeah that's that's sick and i i

00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:54.880
think that

00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:58.000
uh that you know it's it's very uh uh

00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:58.960
practical

00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:02.160
and uh is is easily relatively easily

00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:03.280
implemented

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:06.799
um so yeah i and and i

00:56:06.799 --> 00:56:08.720
i think in terms of inviting people to

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:11.040
share there might be a spectrum

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.880
of people that want to stay highly

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.400
anonymous there's other people that

00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:15.680
might want to hang like chat

00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:18.960
you know uh on air whatever whatever

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.640
sort of floats your boat

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:23.440
uh with the understanding that you know

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.559
this is not

00:56:24.559 --> 00:56:26.240
uh medical advice not professional

00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:28.559
advice free exactly yeah

00:56:28.559 --> 00:56:30.799
no exactly i appreciate that yeah and

00:56:30.799 --> 00:56:31.839
we'll see like i said it should be

00:56:31.839 --> 00:56:32.880
interesting and i'm like

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.960
a lot of times things that i you know

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.319
sometimes it just turns out to be

00:56:36.319 --> 00:56:37.599
something a little different that's fine

00:56:37.599 --> 00:56:39.440
too but for now it's like

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:41.119
you know i i think there is a definitely

00:56:41.119 --> 00:56:43.200
a uh

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:45.440
like a lack of people being able to

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:46.240
authentically

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:48.640
authentically relate to anybody else and

00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:50.319
it's like i think that takes a toll you

00:56:50.319 --> 00:56:50.720
know

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:53.520
over on anybody eventually so dude

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:55.200
listening to the i can't even listen to

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:55.920
the

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:58.960
you know you listen and no offense to

00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.160
to come down but you people are

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:02.319
struggling right like people everyone's

00:57:02.319 --> 00:57:03.680
[ __ ] struggling

00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:06.160
right now and and uh you know even in

00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:08.240
the podcasting universe you see it

00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:11.520
uh sort of uh uh manifested right

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:12.799
uh and that's not to say that we're

00:57:12.799 --> 00:57:14.799
gonna [ __ ] and whine and i

00:57:14.799 --> 00:57:18.000
i hope and and and if

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.880
if this isn't always the case uh but i i

00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:21.599
hope that

00:57:21.599 --> 00:57:23.599
that people are gonna be open to to

00:57:23.599 --> 00:57:25.119
constructive criticism

00:57:25.119 --> 00:57:26.640
a bit of [ __ ] ribbing a bitter you

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:29.040
know a bit of razzing yeah because for

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:30.240
myself

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:32.000
when i'm being a [ __ ] and i'm being

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.480
self-indulgent and i'm being a [ __ ]

00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:36.319
i don't need someone to say they're

00:57:36.319 --> 00:57:37.839
there and like you know

00:57:37.839 --> 00:57:39.440
just keep doing what you're doing you're

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:41.520
perfect you're a special

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:44.559
sparkling star i need someone saying you

00:57:44.559 --> 00:57:45.680
know smarten up

00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:47.200
right yeah so there's there's going to

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.440
be a bit of that and

00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:51.119
you know prepare for that a little bit

00:57:51.119 --> 00:57:53.359
and that's i think that that's healthy

00:57:53.359 --> 00:57:54.559
yeah that's gonna that's kind of the

00:57:54.559 --> 00:57:56.160
whole idea in terms of like like i you

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:57.280
know i'm kind of kicking around like

00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:58.640
well in terms of like the structure it's

00:57:58.640 --> 00:57:59.119
like

00:57:59.119 --> 00:58:00.559
you know i'll figure all that out but i

00:58:00.559 --> 00:58:02.480
do want it some i do want a place where

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:04.319
it's like you go somewhere you know

00:58:04.319 --> 00:58:05.839
people aren't gonna come at you and like

00:58:05.839 --> 00:58:07.359
go for your neck but people are also

00:58:07.359 --> 00:58:08.000
going to be

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000
authentically and very honestly relating

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.599
to what you say and do

00:58:11.599 --> 00:58:13.040
so it's like it's not going to be like

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:14.400
oh you're posting this or that but it's

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.440
going to be like

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:17.520
here's what you said i'm hearing it and

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:19.200
here's what i think because dude i

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:20.880
the whole point if you have somebody so

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:23.280
sorry so the whole time i've been in

00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:24.640
i've been in therapy for like two years

00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:26.079
i've gone to a therapist i went to one

00:58:26.079 --> 00:58:27.359
therapist one time

00:58:27.359 --> 00:58:30.000

to bounce off otherwise you get lost in

00:59:21.839 --> 00:59:23.119
your own like

00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:55.680
my wife she's being so annoying and then

00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:57.440
i'll just instantly it'll just come to

00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:59.040
me of like you did this this is annoying

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.000
you don't really spend time you know

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:00.640
whatever

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:03.200
but it's like yeah man there you need

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.319
that you need that

01:00:04.319 --> 01:00:06.000
you know however many extra voices of

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.440
someone who can look at you

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:10.720
directly and fairly but also be like

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.960
yeah man you're [ __ ] up here because

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.319
you just can't see it if you can't see

01:00:14.319 --> 01:00:15.920
it it's the most frustrating thing to

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.640
just be

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.000
hitting a wall that you can't see

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.680
constantly so sorry i'll stop rambling

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:20.720
but it's like

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.640
no and that's the k and you're

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.839
contrasting with

01:00:23.839 --> 01:00:26.480
with a conventional model where someone

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:26.960
is

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:30.240
incentivized to draw out the the

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:33.359
the uh sob story to the hour that

01:00:33.359 --> 01:00:35.680
they're getting paid whatever 200 bucks

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.920
and see you back next week for as many

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.680
years as possible

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.440
you scare them off by calling them a

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.200
[ __ ] then

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.440
that's your loss of income right so we

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.559
we're you're not

01:00:46.559 --> 01:00:49.359
incentivized to to heal someone or get

01:00:49.359 --> 01:00:50.559
to the right of the problem and that's

01:00:50.559 --> 01:00:52.480
that's a cynical perspective but

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.880
it's important to consider it yeah it's

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.079
important to consider especially like i

01:00:56.079 --> 01:00:57.440
said if you you know if you're getting

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.960
200 bucks an hour i want that person to

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.160
stick around

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.920
yeah i don't want to be like well deal

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.280
with it you know or like you know a big

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:04.640
look man i don't even think you need to

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:05.920
see me here's what you need to do it's

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.960
like yeah i wouldn't want to do that if

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:09.280
someone's paying me 200 bucks an hour

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.720
and you know i think you're right i

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:11.599
think it's not even something that's

01:01:11.599 --> 01:01:12.880
consciously done i think it's just

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.280
baked into that like the customer is

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.000
right

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.520
kind of mentality where it's like let me

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.280
not piss this person off or again they

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:19.680
don't

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.880
i don't think we should all be pissing

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.240
each other off as hard as we can but

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.520
it's also like

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.280
you know yeah you're absolutely right

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.720
rather than uh

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.000
you know you don't want to draw it out

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.359
and it's like if people want to do this

01:01:29.359 --> 01:01:30.720
for two months and be like hey i think

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.559
you feel pretty good it's like good man

01:01:32.559 --> 01:01:33.920
hopefully this [ __ ] doesn't have hope

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.119
hopefully this lasts for like six months

01:01:35.119 --> 01:01:36.319
and everyone's fine it probably won't

01:01:36.319 --> 01:01:37.280
but it's like

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.799
yeah there's no incentive to keep anyone

01:01:38.799 --> 01:01:40.079
anywhere it's like get what you can out

01:01:40.079 --> 01:01:41.040
of it and as soon as you're like yeah i

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.160
think i'm cool it's like dude

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.839
go go about your whatever the [ __ ]

01:01:43.839 --> 01:01:45.520
you're doing good

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.680
exactly get out of here god damn it get

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.680
the [ __ ] out you're healed

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.760
be forth and go forth and prosper and

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.599
multiply yeah go forth for another six

01:01:53.599 --> 01:01:54.400
months so you're like

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:57.760
god damn it [ __ ] uh whatever or don't

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:58.799
whatever you know what i mean yeah

01:01:58.799 --> 01:02:01.839
i agree i think i think a big burden can

01:02:01.839 --> 01:02:03.200
be taking off of

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.359
the you know whatever you want to call

01:02:05.359 --> 01:02:07.440
it the the mental health care system if

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:08.720
people kind of you know

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.240
did something like this i think it would

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:13.039
uh alleviate both sides a little bit

01:02:13.039 --> 01:02:15.039
yeah we've got a doctor sitting like i

01:02:15.039 --> 01:02:16.400

01:02:31.599 --> 01:02:34.960
