00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:37.360
but the

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.520
edibles every now and again destabilize

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.390
headquarters

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.800
[Laughter]

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.920

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.519
john b was robin thicke yeah he's like

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.360
well my problem is he's still fighting a

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.480
hard i

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.799
i get it that's a bizarre got a bees in

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:35.680
the tube

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.680
shout out bees the dude

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.840
dude did you guys start yet yeah we're

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.720
starting

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.480
christ bees [ __ ] rolled the boulder

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.440
in front of his own tomb

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.360
this is exactly what i needed i think

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.080
adam levine is a um like an usher wigger

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.799
i don't think he's too nerdy no he's a

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.640
polite wig

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.640
if you put polite wigger on him think

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.360
about that polite wigger he could very

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.519
well be that i think i think buttery's

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.439
onto something

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:07.360
i don't know i'm thinking you know what

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.360
maybe maybe wigger's not the correct

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.360
word but whatever his whole thing is he

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.040
definitely just stole it from black

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.599
people

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:16.639
now you might be honest you know what

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.239
i'm saying yeah

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.450
i guess you need a more respectful word

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.880
[Laughter]

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.240
what you're thinking

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.600
you're trying to combine the phrase

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.040
someone who emulates like a black dude

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.840
with a master's degree

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.560
the two phrases that you're thinking of

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.919
in your head that you would never say

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.320
out loud are wigger and one of the good

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.320
ones

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.800
those are the that's the kind those are

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.160
the two concepts that you're painting a

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160
picture of right now so i don't think

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.840
that i'm saying that that's what you're

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.680
talking about

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.919
i think he's too big of a nerd

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.360
i think

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.000
i know his nerdliness will forever keep

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.160
him from attaining kangli status

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.800
he's i think he's at best at duke and he

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.720
knows that you don't think he's a king

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.440
no adam levine's not a king not a k

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.960
brother

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.170
[Laughter]

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.639
he's a peaceful merchant he knows that

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.880
we know at any point like a true kang

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.320
could rise up and go into the house of

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.880
horus on them uh that's a line fully

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.880
with horus dude ah

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.759
so

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.280
um you know about the hulk he's more

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.000
like a steward to the throne status he's

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.160
not a full king yes but he's up he's on

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.000
the throne i respect him i mean you know

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.520
he knows this

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.960
like he's not in the house of horus

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.560
house of horus is a dude who fully

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.759
aligns

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.280
and is like did you ever read about

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.960
ancient egypt when they linked northern

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.960
egypt with southern egypt

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.039
yeah bro that's a house of horrors

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.800
that dude just rose up he's like i think

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.880
egypt needs to be won and killed 5 000

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.840
people

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.400
and everyone was like good choice

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.919
nice job

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.680
he's like one of the greatest they don't

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.880
know exactly who did it there's two

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.360
dudes but like he's held up as like

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.199
that's like the hieroglyphs they're like

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:06.479
yo remember that one time that dude was

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.720
like [ __ ] this and killed like 5 000

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.720
people then we had one

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.360
nation i have never that guy rules yeah

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.800
i didn't know there was a north egypt in

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.199
a south egypt there was dude

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:18.720
this dude united and he was like [ __ ]

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.080
that it bothered him he's like this is

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.680
[ __ ] [ __ ] i do hate when there's

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.199
a north and a south of something it

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.199
sucks i mean it sucks it's like you

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:27.440
should kill 5 000 people in north dakota

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.520
and just join them up let's go yeah

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.199
you'd be aligned the whole idea in

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:32.560
ancient egypt was like there was this

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.960
divine order that was right but it

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.600
needed material people to enact the

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.360
right order and then thus create it in

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.759
real life so when that dude did that he

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.280
was said to be living in the house of

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.720
horus because like i need to say this

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.240
because my brain is stuck on it but

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.039
that's

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:49.120
i'm realizing that

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.280
hitler was a wigger

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.039
he stole

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:55.120
he's going oh

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.960
uh who who did this who did this unite

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.280
unite unification of egypt who was who

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.280
was responsible i forget the guy's name

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.720
there's two guys that could have been

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.240
they're not exactly sure which one did

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.759
exist okay so that's basically how

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.800
hitler hitler stole this guy's playbook

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.400
pretty much in the same way that adam

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.599
levine

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:14.000
is a wizard

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.919
hitler

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:18.240
he's an ancient egyptian okay he's in

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.319
yeah adam to be fair you heard it here

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:22.080
first adam levine and hitler are the

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.000
same kind of wicked

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.919
a sentence that's never been crafted

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:27.919
before in the history of the world i can

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:29.680
definitely say 100 never yeah you're

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.199
absolutely that's a brand new sentence

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:35.120
that'd be funny it becomes like a cliche

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.120
like a comparison we're all just like oh

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.479
not another one of these like oh god

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:42.440
adam levine's hitler yeah

00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:52.400
you need to get that out yeah i'm glad

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.520
that it now exists in the ether

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.639
that's joining the collective

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:58.400
consciousness people have to like just

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.319
process that thought and be like i don't

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:02.240
think so

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.319
i couldn't see that it just appears

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:05.150
where you're wrong

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.639
[Laughter]

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:09.120
somebody driving

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.400
no

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.960
are they yeah this is reprehensible

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.720
stuff just some like yeah someone like

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.639
he's like a pharmaceutical sales rep

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:18.400
driving around listening to this or just

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.560
if that happens if you like you wouldn't

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.639
even flinch if at the end of one of

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:25.280
those like passionate hitler speeches he

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.520
was like holla at your boy he just

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.199
walked away you wouldn't even

00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:35.200
he did say that right

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.360
his whole thing was based on your boy it

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.880
was heavy he's like dude you know what i

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.959
mean

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:52.560
[Laughter]

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.880
dude

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.800
i mean i don't agree with him

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.040
not but i will say

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.240
terrible choices but he definitely

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.160
thought he was that boy he would ask him

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.540
like no he was that boy are you in it

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.959
[Laughter]

00:09:08.959 --> 00:09:10.399
yo and if anybody else around here would

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:13.440
have been like yo i'm that boy like

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.800
i mean there were some other politicians

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.920
that thought they were that boy and they

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.040
all kind of died i think he like

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.720
assassinated somebody that's how he came

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.279
into power yeah he rose up damn imagine

00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:23.040
if he put out his own movie of belly

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.760
like was before

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.600
oh man but yeah he probably had pharaohs

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.880
on his wall

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.120
like painted he got he got real they got

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.800
really into eastern

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.839
the eastern religion because you know

00:09:35.839 --> 00:09:37.120
how the [ __ ] like hindus had

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.160
swastikas yeah yeah hitler was like

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.519
hold up

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:43.360
i think that's us i think we was kings

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.560
he definitely

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.440
went in

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.040
there was a big contention between when

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.880
eastern mythology like when we first

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.640
translated it and got it the big thing

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.399
the nazis did was like

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:54.480
yo cause it ruled it was so [ __ ] sick

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.920
and the nazis were like hey just one

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.000
second i'm sorry but if i told you adam

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.440
levine was in the buddhism would you

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.360
even doubt me for a second

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.920
he must be right no yeah you just

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.640
assumed to be the case but please go on

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.839
i'm just saying the connection between

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:10.399
him you see him at levine

00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:12.320
i could see adam levine being more like

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.000
a uh like an episcopalian no way nah

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:16.839
like a

00:10:16.839 --> 00:10:19.600
devout a guy like that going guess what

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.839
buddhism is like the sexiest thing in

00:10:21.839 --> 00:10:23.440
the world i know i think you're i think

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.720
you're wrong i'm just trying to throw

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.240
them everyone likes to think that if

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.880
they were him they wouldn't go buddhism

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.680
i'm playing hitler's advocate

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.800
i'm trying to play hitler's advocate

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.100
here

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.600
[Laughter]

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.720
i wonder if mel was just playing

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.040
hitler's advocate

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.800
he's like i know i'm just weighing the

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.240
argument out just so we're gonna have an

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.480
echo chamber

00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:49.279
yeah but you were explaining buddhism

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:51.200
are you explaining uh oh yes

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.600
the nazi eastern philosophy came in and

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.800
it would kind of ruled which is when

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.000
you're like no here's the deal white

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.360
people are clearly the best the eastern

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.800
philosophy comes in that was like for

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.560
intellectuals they're like

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.560
this [ __ ] [ __ ] rules like i know

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.160

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.360
and then it was a big thing so you're

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.640
doing your thing and you're like hitler

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.920

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.600
000 years ago

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.120

but they were teamed up yeah hitler was

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.680
involved pretty heavily

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.360
or at least the nazi propaganda machine

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.519
was like they kept like where you're in

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:17.600

00:14:44.639 --> 00:14:47.279
white people are somehow like uh the way

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:49.199
you assume them to be they're like

00:14:49.199 --> 00:14:50.639
demonstrating like whatever just [ __ ]

00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:52.800
sure they're [ __ ] gay and then like

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.199
with all brown cultures like you look at

00:14:55.199 --> 00:14:56.839
them as like different levels of

00:14:56.839 --> 00:14:59.360
barbarian not you but like throughout

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.199
like other even the way other brown

00:15:01.199 --> 00:15:03.440
cultures handle each other yeah like

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.360
they'll be like

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.959
you know like i don't [ __ ] you up though

00:15:06.959 --> 00:15:08.399
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah will he or

00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:09.440
won't he

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.639
what's the litmus test for whether

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:12.800
someone's about it or not

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.079
like how do you tell if someone's about

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:15.440
that life or not i mean or do you just

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.240
[ __ ] around and find out

00:15:18.639 --> 00:15:21.519
that's about it

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.519
that's the only way you can know that

00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:26.760
white people

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.639
you know but that's like

00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:35.839
there's a lot of assumed boutedness in

00:15:35.839 --> 00:15:37.680
the black culture

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.839
globally

00:15:38.839 --> 00:15:42.160
yeah and i'm ready to demystify that i

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.600
think that needs to end yeah cause you

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.120
like i think exactly what you're saying

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.040
we have like english people italian

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.639
people scottish and we can kind of get

00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:51.279
like a a decent read based on like a

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:53.279
thing that it's easy to like

00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:55.279
surmise in large quantities i can say

00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:56.399
something about irish people pretty

00:15:56.399 --> 00:15:58.480
easily but like yeah talk about

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.720
stereotypes yes exactly

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.880
wow

00:16:03.199 --> 00:16:05.360
dancing around stereo

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.360
i didn't realize that's what it was

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.199
i swear to god i was just like yeah like

00:16:09.199 --> 00:16:10.560
you could just like kind of like there's

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.959
a large people but there's like this

00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:16.560
identity tag that makes it easier

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.440
shared qualities that are almost kind of

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.160
taboo to even acknowledge

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.120
what i'm saying is like

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.440
we have it like kind of stratified in a

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.959
way with white people whereas yeah with

00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:30.560
black people is not as stratified it's

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.560
not as stratified well i mean i think it

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.639
is but it's it's it's that like it's

00:16:34.639 --> 00:16:36.320
levels of boutiqueness that's what i'm

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.600
saying but nobody

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.360
i feel like these [ __ ] white liberals

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.040

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.559
you're not yeah are you yeah it's like

00:21:38.559 --> 00:21:39.679
are you dude

00:21:39.679 --> 00:21:40.960
he's like i don't know where is this

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.640
where's his need to be perceived as

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.720
being bout it coming from and again

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.799
that's it

00:21:46.799 --> 00:21:48.080
he made a whole movie about it what do

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.840
you think about that it's a paradox dude

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.440
you got it so here let me let me say

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.720
this so

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.440
uh brandon is one of the the things that

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.799
black people

00:21:56.799 --> 00:21:59.440
like like false bout it black people are

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.000
really good at right so like take lebron

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.360
james for example

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.280
do you think he is a pass first guy or a

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.720
shoot first guy just like just get it

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.039
out there shoot first shoot first right

00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:10.880
but he brands himself as a pass first

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.480
guy like people listening to everybody

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.600
listening to this is like no lebron

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.880
james is the most unselfish player in

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.640
the league that's because that's what he

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.240
calls himself and then people just

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.840
eventually started believing it do you

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.679
think he's actually just a ball hug

00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:23.360
he has heart at heart he has to be he's

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.559
been the best person he ever played

00:22:24.559 --> 00:22:25.840
basketball with his whole life he

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.440
statistically shoots more than anybody

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.520
else in the nba really yeah certified

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.600
ball high certified do you think that's

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.039
where all of his social stuff comes from

00:22:33.039 --> 00:22:35.600
his deep guilt about being a ball

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.480
so he started that school

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.240
he's got like a dark knight in his house

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.520
where he's drinking in front of like a

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.640

other half to go fully bounded it's like

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.640
i'd really like to avoid that yeah so i

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.880
don't carry a gun by the way

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.200
i would spash shoot someone if i carried

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.120
a gun on me i'd spat shoot someone like

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.080
[ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.320
when i first like knew about like people

00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.760
carrying guns

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.200
i think part of me was like damn it

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.000
would cool to just like shoot people

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
it would be cool to just like

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.520
kill someone

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.360
i mean dude or just flash it that would

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.679
be my problem the oh yeah

00:29:11.679 --> 00:29:14.240
it's just too delicious to let that go

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.600
like what's your threshold for that

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.919
mine's very low yeah someone's like

00:29:17.919 --> 00:29:20.080
[ __ ] i'm like oh yeah [ __ ] it yeah

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.600
pull that thing out i'd be i'd be

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.799
conscious that's how i felt when i was

00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:24.080
nine when i was nine i was like there's

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.720
probably reasons to shoot people i just

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.039
assumed that there were

00:29:29.039 --> 00:29:31.120
there are though i think it was after it

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.559
was in catholic school they told us that

00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:34.240
like it like

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.159
yeah you go to hell if you kill but not

00:29:36.159 --> 00:29:37.840
if it's in like a war you know what i

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.039
mean there's like technicalities of

00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:40.000
killing people i was like oh you

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.919
probably just shoot some people yeah you

00:29:41.919 --> 00:29:43.520
know yeah who's to say what's war and

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.200
what isn't what yeah the the lines are

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.120
blurred dude it's it's not it's not

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.960
clear yeah

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.240
it's almost like there's this like

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.760
subclass of people who get to say

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.600
exactly what we do and don't do on some

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.600
level to also get to like

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.840
murder thousands of people and be like

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.399
nice job guys everyone go home yeah hey

00:30:00.399 --> 00:30:01.760
what the [ __ ] man

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.840
you're going to jail forever

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.200
i don't know

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.399
it's good they do that i think i think

00:30:06.399 --> 00:30:08.399
the majority of people need that thing

00:30:08.399 --> 00:30:09.840
to keep us from murdering each other but

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.360
but i think again that's why i don't

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.840
know i'm a fan yeah yeah

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.200
now that i thought about it it's all

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.039
right i mean you know now they fully

00:30:17.039 --> 00:30:19.679
process that i could see that yeah that

00:30:19.679 --> 00:30:22.240
that's why historically other cultures

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.600
look at white doubtedness and they're

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.200
like they're [ __ ] gay true they're

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.559
coming up with all these rules and

00:30:26.559 --> 00:30:27.760
justifications

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.679
we need that dude they can't take the

00:30:29.679 --> 00:30:32.000
chains off us

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.880
we need to be so highly

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.840
organized dude

00:30:43.679 --> 00:30:45.919
but i think that's how you become that's

00:30:45.919 --> 00:30:48.080
how white people and

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.399
from outside looking in sure it seems

00:30:50.399 --> 00:30:52.320
like that's how white people become

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.279
bounded

00:30:53.279 --> 00:30:54.960
it's like when you when you're white and

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.880
you want to be about it you got to get

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.600
real [ __ ] organized true you know you

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.159
got to run for senator basically that's

00:31:02.159 --> 00:31:04.880
true that's a terrifying job too

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.640
to be like

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.640
all right there's this valley over here

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.640
um it's kind of [ __ ] us up from like

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.480
an oil standpoint like we need oil to

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.880
like stay as a big country

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.799
you think we should bomb these guys and

00:31:16.799 --> 00:31:18.559
they're like

00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:20.240
that cause yeah

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.600
yeah i think so

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.039
any of them not like us like someone

00:31:23.039 --> 00:31:24.480
like okay

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.600
somebody i mean i'm not saying this i

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.120
wonder if it's like typically like the

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.559
second idea

00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:30.720
like there's like a complicated like

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.559
and the second guy's like yeah that's

00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:34.799
never going to work that's bomb

00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:35.679
you know

00:31:35.679 --> 00:31:37.200
and that guy's just the man the guy

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.159
being like hold up or

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.600
i hear you

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.120
okay yeah

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:46.240
but because bomb bomb that whole area

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.360
yeah they didn't do it and then the

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:51.120
third guy's like wow he's done it again

00:31:51.679 --> 00:31:53.840
it is crazy that's the ultimate oh yeah

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:55.279
when countries start to argue and we

00:31:55.279 --> 00:31:57.679
just drop like

00:31:57.679 --> 00:31:59.840
force just contain force upon a whole

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.399
space it's just like [ __ ] all right

00:32:02.399 --> 00:32:05.039
fine the ultimate oh yeah

00:32:05.039 --> 00:32:07.440
that was yeah definitely oh yeah you're

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.960
in your house you're like jesus [ __ ]

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.320
great yeah just whatever they get it

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.240
we'll pay them that's the old dude

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.760
that's the ultimate [ __ ] around to find

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.600
out

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.760
is your whole country disappearing in a

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:23.760
hot flash mm-hmm that's not nice um

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.200
that is the big that's the big [ __ ]

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.559
we're gonna find it yeah you're right

00:32:26.559 --> 00:32:29.039
it's g [ __ ] it's

00:32:29.039 --> 00:32:30.559
it's something

00:32:30.559 --> 00:32:32.000
it's something and the whole world's

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.519
ruled by it this is all doom and gloom

00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:34.640
it's not doom and gloom this is doom and

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.840
gloom though no this is sunday we're

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.760
light in the darkness we're going down

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:38.960
we have to though

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.159
light the darkness we're full light in

00:32:40.159 --> 00:32:41.440
the darkness

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.760
and it all stops with us

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.519
we're going to stop that

00:32:45.519 --> 00:32:47.360
bees what do you think happens when we

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.640
die

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.600
nothing

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.440
nothing at all no

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.080

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.320
i don't i genuinely don't believe i

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.080
don't want to ever think that i want to

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.159
think you know what that that makes it

00:33:06.159 --> 00:33:07.679
even better then if something does

00:33:07.679 --> 00:33:08.880

well you know what's going to happen to

00:33:11.279 --> 00:33:13.279
you i already read about this last night

00:33:13.279 --> 00:33:14.640
yeah you're going to get sucked into the

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.399
lower astral realms that might be

00:33:16.399 --> 00:33:18.159
awesome down there

00:33:18.159 --> 00:33:19.600
how do you know

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.760
typically like ghosts that haunt and

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.360
stuff like that and spirits that possess

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.519
are lower astral entities so they're

00:33:25.519 --> 00:33:28.240
like they're kicking around like

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.000
i don't know where i think

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.679
i might want to be that's where you go

00:33:31.679 --> 00:33:34.799
when you smoke weed and then a cigarette

00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:36.640
that's the only that's the only place

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.240
you can end up i was haunting you about

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.159
i lay up on that gargoyle perch i see

00:33:40.159 --> 00:33:42.720

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.440
i woke up at like four to put maya back

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.960
to sleep you know when you interrupt

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.599
your sleep and you get sleep paralysis

00:34:15.599 --> 00:34:17.119
i've never had sleep process i remember

00:34:17.119 --> 00:34:18.960
we talked about that lucid dreamers what

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.040
they do is they like purposely wake

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.000
themselves up at like four in the

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.520
morning and stay awake but you're so

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.480
high

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.919
i'm sorry no it's all right

00:34:27.919 --> 00:34:29.919
i'm so sorry

00:34:29.919 --> 00:34:31.760
your eyes were marbles

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.960
maybe i was high uh

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:39.500
[Laughter]

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.119
wait finish your story matt yeah oh yeah

00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:51.760

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.839
[Laughter]

00:34:55.839 --> 00:34:56.960
i want to hear the rest of it thank you

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.720
no i'm appreciate you for bringing me

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.839
back to earth dude i started ascending

00:35:00.839 --> 00:35:03.440
um so

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.079
so you leave

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.599
you might have to take a break

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.040
so i wake up i put my daughter back to

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.480
sleep

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.520
all right

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.280
i put her back to sleep and when you

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.040
interrupt your sleep like that

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.480
people who try to learn how to astral

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.880
travel do that on purpose because it

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.520
sends you into a sleep paralysis is the

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.960
launching pad for

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.119
uh astral traveling but a lot of people

00:35:29.119 --> 00:35:30.400
don't realize that they get scared to

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.079
get stuck but if you flow with it

00:35:32.079 --> 00:35:33.760
there's a state you go into where just

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.880
your whole body all you hear is

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.400
like it sounds like that and you start

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.560
vibrating but i just read the book about

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.880
how the astral realm is full of just

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.800
like people who were like

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.240
like hitler and stuff it was kind of

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.160
mean full of dudes who are like kind of

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.920
mean and shitty get hung up on the

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.359
actual realm and they have to go through

00:35:51.359 --> 00:35:52.880
a whole other lifetime of learning on

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.640
the astral plane that we tap into when

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.160
we dream every night

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.760
but it's like if you

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.520
fully like go into like like if you're

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.480
dreaming it's one thing i think we're

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.000
kind of protected i don't know by what

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:02.960
when you're dreaming you're somewhat

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.440
protected when you leave that and like i

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.720
entered the astral every time i get

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.280
sleep paralysis i go into it it's like

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.880
demons and [ __ ] it's scary do you get it

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.760
a lot uh i would say once every once or

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.359
twice a month dude that is why i didn't

00:36:15.359 --> 00:36:17.119
even really know about it until we were

00:36:17.119 --> 00:36:18.560
at the old house and shane told that

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.440
story and then we watched that

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.440
documentary on netflix and everybody

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.359
described the same thing that what they

00:36:23.359 --> 00:36:25.280
saw during their sleep paralysis yeah

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.200
which i had no idea about which is i've

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.560
never had anything like that yeah but

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:31.040
the same the sleep paralysis i i got i

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.240
used to get like shadow figures that

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.760
would like i'd wake up yeah and i'd be

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.200
in my room but there'd be like shadowy

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.880
figures lurching towards me you know you

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.320
need a mantra

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.720
true you need something to anchor you

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.560
yeah into courage while you're in that

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:43.839
moment exactly that's what the book said

00:36:43.839 --> 00:36:45.040
the book was like without an experienced

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.240
teacher you can go around the lower

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.800
asheville realms and get bullied which

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.240
dude i think you got bullied in the

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.920
asheville realm as well you were on dmt

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.520
oh dude that you've been hijacked you

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.599
told me about that oh man and i thought

00:36:55.599 --> 00:36:56.880
about that so i thought about this and

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.240
i'm like and then i went into the

00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.839
asheville realm like [ __ ] this i got it

00:36:59.839 --> 00:37:00.960
and i thought about the book and i went

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.480
oh there might be some bullies and it

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.240
was just a terrifying all-encompassing

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.839
demon and it scared me out of it i'm

00:37:05.839 --> 00:37:07.599
ashamed to admit i'm going back in but

00:37:07.599 --> 00:37:09.280
i'm going to train myself to be able to

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.480
and he was like it's like going into a

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.839
dangerous neighborhood

00:37:11.839 --> 00:37:13.200
he's like you got to be careful what

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.800
you're doing he's like you got to know

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.760
what you're dealing with you can't just

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.440
go into their blind yeah i got spooked i

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:18.720
got totally spooked yeah you went to the

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:19.839
astral realm and you were in the

00:37:19.839 --> 00:37:20.640
asteroid

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.680
thugs

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.839
they were pretty hostile

00:37:23.839 --> 00:37:25.280
and they were like

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.040
it was i don't it was like the brain

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.440
equivalent of like uh like people

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.440
holding the door open on like a cool car

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.200
but not obviously not a cool car but

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.720
like that was like the

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.960
yeah that was what i perceived you know

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.720
what i mean you got hijacked by lower

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.880
actual bullies it was like bro it right

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.280
now is the time to get in the cool car

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.280
and they were like i was i was like i

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.640
can't get in the cool car i have a

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.800
family and they were just like

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.800
they close the door

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.240
that might be a deeper subconscious

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.240
intake and you're just like obviously

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.760
letting something like

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.200
your kingliness your that's a denial of

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.800
your own kingliness they're like hopped

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.160
up in the souped up yeah

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.760
this might be a serious character flaw

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.720
for me

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.480
dude your subconscious is begging for

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.880
you to actualize oh man

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.800
actually an individual yeah you are

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.920

dancing in the end zone [ __ ] old

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.320
white dude up if it [ __ ] them up

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.920
because they they

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.400
that is their limitation on themselves

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.160
true right and it's like well we're

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.240

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.599
never thought about it though i love

00:39:39.599 --> 00:39:40.960
watching my dad go like i wish you

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.839
wouldn't do this [ __ ]

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.359
do your job although although

00:39:47.359 --> 00:39:49.040
imagine being a black receiver and

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.200
hearing that feedback and being like i

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.880
would dance say i can't dance in the end

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.880
yeah that must be that's the perfect

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.400
thing to be like dude you you would

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.760
dance in the end zone too dude you're

00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.280
just not allowing yourself to yeah but

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.040
but then it goes it goes weird and toxic

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.240
the other way in the black community

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.280
because it's like

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.200
people that are not good at [ __ ] and

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.839
didn't even score

00:40:07.839 --> 00:40:11.800
you didn't even score

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.720
we need each other dude that hurts worse

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.319
than like a breakup for an old white

00:40:20.319 --> 00:40:22.720
dude watching a guy celebrate after a

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.400
non-touchdown play

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.079
oh dude

00:40:26.079 --> 00:40:28.079
kills them go to bed dude it kills them

00:40:28.079 --> 00:40:28.880
dude

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.800
that they should yeah that's that's like

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.960
uh that's a pretty serious anger thing

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.319
especially after like a first down just

00:40:34.319 --> 00:40:36.000
being like come on

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.440
come on play the game

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.760
yeah white people feel the same way

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.599
about being the [ __ ] that black people

00:40:43.599 --> 00:40:45.520
feel about nicknames

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.359
you can't give them to yourself right

00:40:47.359 --> 00:40:49.680
true very true

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.599
very true

00:40:51.599 --> 00:40:53.200
i also yeah i learned recently a lot of

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.200
black people don't like when uh or maybe

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:56.800
it's just britney's family but like

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.200
summarizing somebody's name but with a

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.800

on no you're right you're right you're

00:42:58.319 --> 00:43:00.480
just doing himself the hero's journey

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.000
for sure yeah what kind of stings are

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.040
you talking what kind of things do you

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.560
think about dude there's little stings

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.319
that you don't think like ah [ __ ] that's

00:43:06.319 --> 00:43:07.920
not a big deal was the last time what's

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:12.200
the last time someone stung the bees

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.400
i don't know i get stunned all the time

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.400
yeah because you put up this wall and

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.000
it's like all right but how do you deal

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.160
with being stung maybe that's my issue

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.880
true i've recently entered the world of

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.200
being stung it sucks dude i'm tipping a

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.040
toe in it's yeah

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.880
but it's good though i've been trying to

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.720
i'm trying to put a more i'm trying to

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.599
stop popping off

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:44.880
dude i've been trying to pop off more

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.280
really yeah we need each other yes you

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.359
know yeah you got that bounce

00:43:49.359 --> 00:43:51.200
i don't think i think historically i

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.000
have not popped off enough bro and um

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.920
and look it's it's tough to carry that

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.839
around you have to start popping off

00:43:57.839 --> 00:44:00.160
it's an anchor dude you you got to be

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.920
willing to leave destruction in your

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:02.720
wake

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.079
and not look back oh that's really

00:44:04.079 --> 00:44:05.599
that's that's the maybe the one thing

00:44:05.599 --> 00:44:07.640
i've i've always said you got to slow

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:16.079
[Laughter]

00:44:16.079 --> 00:44:17.200
yeah

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.920
wow yeah okay so like now that i'm i've

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.480
been having some [ __ ] up dreams really

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.480
yeah about what but like it's about not

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.079
popping off you guys should be popping

00:44:26.079 --> 00:44:27.920
off like myself by the way

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.599
this reinforces the existing theory that

00:44:29.599 --> 00:44:33.000
sid is negotiating

00:44:38.079 --> 00:44:39.520
you're going to tell me there's not some

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.280
like universal consciousness that just

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.520
made the situation come about

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:44.400
no

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:47.440
all right fair enough yeah

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.560
what's up with those chips and guac

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.240
we're going to get there i think we're

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.000
there it's coming what's that where are

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.720
we at time-wise

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.200
perfect bees you might be tuned now

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:00.880
you're going to tell them i think you

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:05.560
might be lego bees i might be

00:45:10.079 --> 00:45:12.480
so uh i met up with somebody from back

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.000
in the day who i didn't really like

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.599
right so already i want to pop off but

00:45:15.599 --> 00:45:17.280
i'm not sure right so like i'm

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.480
constantly being tested where were you

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:20.640
guys in in my hometown

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.480
in my hometown your pop-off meter must

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.359
be high

00:45:23.359 --> 00:45:25.200
there too yes so

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.839
uh we're going to his house where he

00:45:27.839 --> 00:45:30.480
once tried to have people jump me

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.800
why were you guys hanging out now

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.000
dude because i i'm being tested

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.119
right oh you're having a dream that's

00:45:37.119 --> 00:45:39.359
happened in real life it's my dream

00:45:39.359 --> 00:45:40.560
so

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:44.240
between uh his house and where we were

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:47.200
somehow there was a pizzeria uno

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.520
swag so we went to p3 you're definitely

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:50.880
in the lower rational realm right now

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.079
dude

00:45:52.079 --> 00:45:54.800

yes so

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.680
i'll go in it's like mad busy but they

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:00.960
have like a counter where you can like

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.560
do orders and [ __ ] and people are like

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.400
bumping into me and you know not

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:06.960

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.960
lower actual room yes yes and i'm like

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.960
not popping off i'm not popping off

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.880
finally i'm like this this is too much i

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.480
don't i don't know if i can handle this

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.560
but i still want some of this p3 you

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.040

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.800
it's like insane

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.319
so i'm like i'm gonna go to the

00:46:26.319 --> 00:46:28.160
drive-through right so i get my car and

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.200
i go through the drive-through and they

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:31.359
let you in like this garage and you come

00:46:31.359 --> 00:46:32.960
in it's like it's like a garage of

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.880
pizzeria you know and there are pizzas

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.680

what dude so like i you know you need a

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.560
garage it's basically first of all why

00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:47.119
don't drive-ins have a like a warehouse

00:46:47.119 --> 00:46:48.079
that would be that would be pretty

00:46:48.079 --> 00:46:49.680
difficult to drive the full drive

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.440
through you pull in yeah they act like

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.200
real futuristic about it

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.720
they set it up like a government hideout

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.319
like they bringing out like a briefcase

00:46:56.319 --> 00:46:57.200

oh i thought you're talking under the

00:46:58.560 --> 00:46:59.839
drive-through yeah i thought you're

00:46:59.839 --> 00:47:01.359
talking about like having like automated

00:47:01.359 --> 00:47:03.119
machines like assembling a burger like

00:47:03.119 --> 00:47:04.880
on a tray that's outside of your car

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.480
window you know that'd be tight too to

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.000
let that let the process go like yeah

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.040
little conveyor arm things go around

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:15.440
that's the future of sonic [ __ ]

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.040
in the symbols through the glass you

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.960

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:34.400
i've always wanted to just like have

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.160
that energy walking down like a crowded

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:37.680
street where people are like trying to

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:39.040

to

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:45.599

00:54:45.599 --> 00:54:47.200
like walking around strangers when like

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.480

00:54:58.160 --> 00:54:59.200
like trying to hold your breath for a

00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:01.119
long time yeah you're holding a person

00:55:01.119 --> 00:55:02.400
in your brain you're like

00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.400
going i don't know it is weird to think

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.640
about like if you have that interaction

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.240
and then somebody continues that on

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.319
about you for the rest of the day

00:55:10.319 --> 00:55:12.079

00:55:13.599 --> 00:55:16.160

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:53.200
off about publicly right and uh you know

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.720
we're we're we're talking

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:56.880
and uh i forget what i for you what

00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:58.079
we're even arguing about but at one

00:55:58.079 --> 00:56:00.079
point he goes you're technically right

00:56:00.079 --> 00:56:01.520
you're technically right

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:04.079
and that's the worst kind of right

00:56:04.079 --> 00:56:06.880
oh man right and then he goes and i go i

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:08.880
i wrote back to him i was like huh

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:11.359
i like that he was like he goes i bet

00:56:11.359 --> 00:56:13.440
you do you said that to me 20 [ __ ]

00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:15.599
years ago and i never forgot it would

00:56:15.599 --> 00:56:17.760
you like

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.359
oh you said yeah yeah i just i like that

00:56:19.359 --> 00:56:20.640
phrase i like that i like the way you

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:21.760
said that you know like you're

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:22.799
technically right and that's the word is

00:56:22.799 --> 00:56:24.319
kind of right when he's when he said

00:56:24.319 --> 00:56:25.280
that i was like yeah i liked how he said

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:26.960
that he was like i bet you dude you said

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:28.559
that to me 20 [ __ ] years ago and i'll

00:56:28.559 --> 00:56:31.119
never forget it like his whole entire

00:56:31.119 --> 00:56:32.240
thing

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:34.000
his whole entire reasoning for that was

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.839
like i get to say this phrase back at

00:56:35.839 --> 00:56:38.880
him what the [ __ ] oh wow yeah you sent

00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:39.680
him

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:42.000
you sent him down a path dude and when

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.680
he when he hit me with that it was just

00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:46.640
like dawg i [ __ ] won oh yeah you just

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.559
you just messaged me to tell me that i

00:56:48.559 --> 00:56:50.000
was in your head what were you guys

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.799
arguing about dude it was some

00:56:52.799 --> 00:56:55.359
weird race thing that he was like he's a

00:56:55.359 --> 00:56:58.000
white guy oh yeah and he he's from my

00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.839
area first of all it's racist to hold a

00:56:59.839 --> 00:57:02.160
black dude in your head for that long

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.160
this guy definitely doesn't not hate

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:05.280
black people

00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.839
that is just reminiscent of slavery

00:57:07.839 --> 00:57:09.359
yeah it has to be like i wonder what

00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:10.799
sydney's up to

00:57:10.799 --> 00:57:12.640
20 years later that's like they're i

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:13.920
mean i don't know there's something

00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.839
racist about that he's karmically like

00:57:15.839 --> 00:57:18.799
trying to hold dominion over you yeah

00:57:18.799 --> 00:57:21.680
yeah and i told him i was i was like uh

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:23.040
like basically what i was telling him

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.119
after was like dude you're lucky

00:57:25.119 --> 00:57:27.280
that you had somebody like me who's such

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:29.680
a good guy in your head like if there

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:31.839
wasn't somebody like me i would have

00:57:31.839 --> 00:57:34.319
[ __ ] you up mentally yeah true you

00:57:34.319 --> 00:57:36.240
know what i mean like if i you're lucky

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:38.480
i wasn't i'm not the good guy that i am

00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:39.760
yeah or else i would have been in your

00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.160
head [ __ ] [ __ ] up dude or like if

00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:43.520
like a loser [ __ ] one of his

00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:45.200
girlfriends and he had to think about a

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:46.960
loser as his rival's whole life yeah

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.400
what i'm talking about you're lucky it

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:50.480
was me yeah

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:52.079
yeah that's [ __ ] nuts that he held

00:57:52.079 --> 00:57:53.359
that for that long like you said that to

00:57:53.359 --> 00:57:55.760
me 20 years ago yeah it's like dude did

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:58.240
we kiss like

00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.960
what else do i don't remember

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:03.119
he was on the cross-country team already

00:58:03.119 --> 00:58:04.640
and uh that's a hot beef anyway because

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:06.160
you're a sprinter i was but i joined the

00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:08.319
cross country team my senior year to

00:58:08.319 --> 00:58:09.599
stay in shape

00:58:09.599 --> 00:58:11.760
oh man

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.920
yeah he did his sport as exercise dude

00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.880
and i beat him every race

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.079
because the other dude sprinters don't

00:58:18.079 --> 00:58:19.440
know anything about london dude he

00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:22.960
[ __ ] sucked he sucked

00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:25.119
that would bother me yeah it bothered me

00:58:25.119 --> 00:58:26.720
i mean then again i don't i feel like

00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:28.799
they made me team kept i was one of the

00:58:28.799 --> 00:58:30.079
i was one of the co-captains of the

00:58:30.079 --> 00:58:31.680
crosstalk

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.440
that actually i'll say throughout my

00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:35.520
life i celebrated people who excelled in

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:37.359
athletics i'd be like nice that's cool

00:58:37.359 --> 00:58:38.799
yeah especially if they're on your team

00:58:38.799 --> 00:58:40.319
yeah there's no part of me that was like

00:58:40.319 --> 00:58:41.680
i need to be better than i was like that

00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:43.359
guy's definitely better than me mike

00:58:43.359 --> 00:58:44.880
he's really good and i'm you know i

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:46.720
always wished i had that i wish i felt

00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:48.720
like competitive with people who were

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.559
like good at [ __ ]

00:58:50.559 --> 00:58:52.480
yeah i uh i know i don't like losing

00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:54.079
video games i don't even pride myself on

00:58:54.079 --> 00:58:55.520
being good at yeah that's like as far as

00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:57.680
i go though it pisses me off

00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.359
yeah i have to have a full conversation

00:58:59.359 --> 00:59:00.799
myself like that this isn't real there's

00:59:00.799 --> 00:59:02.160
nothing at stake here it's not a big

00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:03.680
deal i'll lose it a video game be like

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:05.520
[ __ ] but yeah there's not a part of me

00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:06.640
that's like

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:08.000
maybe in the moment i'll make let's play

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.119
again but like i won't really think

00:59:09.119 --> 00:59:10.960
after like 10 minutes dude for me it's

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:13.040
never about the other person for me it's

00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:15.200
always about knowing that i can rely on

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:16.240
myself

00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:18.799
if everything is stacked against me

00:59:18.799 --> 00:59:20.559
that's all i want to prove through

00:59:20.559 --> 00:59:21.760
competition

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:23.440
and even like video games and all that

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:24.880
no matter the pressure like dude when

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.160
we're playing video games and if i'm

00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:27.359
getting scared he's fighting for his

00:59:27.359 --> 00:59:29.359
life we have everything we have

00:59:29.359 --> 00:59:31.760
everything we've had we have played mk

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:32.720
yes

00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:36.079
dude i stay i stay cool you can't i i

00:59:36.079 --> 00:59:38.160
like being unrattlable

00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:40.000
is all i need because like once you

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.359

00:59:41.359 --> 00:59:42.960
bet you're dead yeah once you're rattled

00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:44.720
you're a dead man yeah true so for me

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:46.640
it's like i need to prove to myself

00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:48.559
constantly i'm not competitive with

00:59:48.559 --> 00:59:49.680
other people

00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:53.040
i'm like it's all me damn

00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:54.880
that's pretty nuts yeah it's me versus

fey long every time

00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.079

01:00:00.079 --> 01:00:02.640
i'm more more of a cooperative spirit we

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.000
