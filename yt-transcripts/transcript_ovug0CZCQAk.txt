and that is you that took a wrong path

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.690

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.849
right look at that dude I should flip

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.920
the [ __ ] day all right you saw the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.989
movie you might would like you flip the

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.879

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.440
[ __ ] dude yeah well you shouldn't talk

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.500
about it that way but perhaps it's one

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.670
of those [ __ ] movies where like the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.959
person turns and then there's like a

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:33.560
dude in the shadows what you guys up to

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.700
we're going down I'm just trying to

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.170
enjoy my [ __ ] house out demonic

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.849
entities entering it it's just very

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.349
played bill and Billie and Spota

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.870
actually like pretty outwardly afraid of

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.290
demon babies watch Exorcism of Emily

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.180
Rose she's terrible when she wakes up on

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.799
the floor and she's moving like talk

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.900
about something else yes real is the

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.540
payment vile dude can I can I do my Sean

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.549
Bolin oh yeah I've been I've been dying

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.230
so I got stuck in a YouTube hole this is

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.919
my peep

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.930
maybe it's not a scariest devil stuff

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.630
but he's the guy who they kind of wrote

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.120
he wrote simulation and Simmel chram so

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.880
similar ohm is a copy of a copy and he

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.639
so the matrix allegedly based it's

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:15.810
pretty it was pretty like sick French

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.430
thing to do the majors like yeah we

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.200
based the matrix show G off of your work

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.120
and he was like you guys got it all

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.890
wrong [ __ ] you guys so you guys are

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.659
stupid American he basically [ __ ] on the

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:26.740
matrix he's like you guys did not read

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.840
stuff close they see it he watch out it

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.190
was shut the [ __ ] up if he saw it he

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.199
watched it they wanted him yeah you guys

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:33.340
got that wrong but the end when he

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.569
catches the bullets was a pretty sick

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:36.520
they wanted him to come can do like

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.050
consultation on matrix to a matrix

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.880
reloaded and he was like I do not have

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.740
time for wait so in his like theory he

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.639
was like there's going to be two white

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.699
twins but hit the thing I was watching

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:52.419
was uh basically that you know we we've

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.870
deviated from like any sort of real

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.979
society where it's like there's like we

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:58.240
don't have products for like the real

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.710
value we're just into stuff for there's

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.810
like their sign value so it's like when

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.729
you look at you to laugh at at dude we

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.020
didn't bring you down here to [ __ ]

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.479
mock us dude let me worry about it so

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:11.979
the handling during my man's lecture

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:24.759
true that [ __ ] that listen so the idea

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:28.060
is we've so all the stuff that we like

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.800
is not like what you you buy a house

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.090
you're not just buying it for the value

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.039
of living and buying it for the value of

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:34.900
like the market of the house but slowly

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.729
and slowly we're having like copies of

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:37.870
copies they're like you know we're in a

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.009
house but it's really like a commodity

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:40.810
so it's like not technically like a real

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.940
house and you've slowly drift off of

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.409
like doing like copies of copies until

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:45.370
you just lose touch with reality

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.250
altogether pretty [ __ ] sick so are

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.080
you saying we live in a simulation not a

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.750
simulation but we live are we in the

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.340
middle put of this like reality to the

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.729
matrix

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.889
kind of like reality TV reality TV came

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.479
out and the big thing was like was not

00:05:58.479 --> 00:05:59.979
reality if you have a camera on someone

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:02.440
right would you agree to that it's not

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.270
ready Audi I'm getting [ __ ] up because

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:10.210
there's a demon demon [ __ ] ring so

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.430
the idea is that you have like it's not

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.110
real reality if there's a camera

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.889
pointing at someone because they're

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:16.599
gonna act slightly different if there's

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:17.620
if they're all cam

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.900
that's why reality TV is not real but

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.009
then it's like if you live in a world

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:22.690
where everyone can film someone at any

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.580
given time if people's behavior genuine

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.009
or because of the case like slowly but

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:28.419
you lose track it's happening so slowly

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:29.860
you lose track and you lose touch with a

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.690
real pretty [ __ ] I was in a total

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.849
negative cameras camera is definitely

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:35.710
I've been half you know

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.630
[ __ ] around I'm sorry no word I mean

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.040
if we're we're Naturals at this point

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.570
cameras don't buy I could be on their

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.270
mother and I would be genuine on it well

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.470
think about it think about an article

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.000
written about you so it's like they

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.250
talked about CNN this week are you

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.990
really think about like some do you call

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.250
me bipolar you don't even know me so if

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.870
you're a dude and you you're like

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.070
alright I think I know who I am but

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.420
people print a bunch of stuff about you

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.620
it's like what if they start saying

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.120
what's more real people's perception of

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.860
you from articles or like you yourself

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.660
and in in reality that perception from

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.580
articles wins out that's always hyper

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.930
reality so like it's real dogs dude no

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.010

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.380
come get it that's the company you keep

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.990
on that Thresh I'm not doing I'm not

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.270
going to hurt anybody's feelings by

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:30.100
explaining my motives on this yeah but

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.050
it obviously wasn't me trying to get her

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:39.540
attention by liking a tweet it's not

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.529
darkness of Sims when you started

00:16:41.529 --> 00:16:42.880
thinking like we could totally be

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:49.630
together I mean like if I even went down

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.100
to New Orleans and she met me she would

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:51.820
totally love me

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.079
he's not talking my name I want in

00:16:53.079 --> 00:16:55.329
particular an estate not even a real

00:16:55.329 --> 00:16:57.790
story so what is this so if you say you

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:59.020
breathe there's a simple just like so

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.310
similar to somebody online that like

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.500
pursues women no that's like basically

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.410
basically like a American version of the

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:12.990
Indian show us Bob yes you prop that up

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.610
like the doll girl stuff that's just me

00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:17.980
personally Dido girls hot she's an

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.959
attractive young lady but I think she

00:17:19.959 --> 00:17:21.400
should stick to working on people's eyes

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.230
and not take goofy pictures be trying to

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:24.370
be a dog I think you should worry about

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:25.819
yourself and not my lady

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:33.309

things are going well when you start

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.710
hailing payment dude so work it out well

don't do it Matt I can't strong that's

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.150
well I mean I would probably do it just

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:07.770
like confront him and just show him like

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.150
how dude you're being a total dick to

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.430
everyone why just fell payment I don't

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:13.710
think I don't think you could take on

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:15.030
the 8th King of Hell you would love

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.530
Haven guy I think I've already taken him

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:18.330
on it was like Ovid had it shook it off

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:19.710
it was like man you should see what he's

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.330
into what's he do he tell you all the

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:27.240
secrets about science doing deep dives

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.350
dude

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.420
so this is this is my view this is my

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.940
part of my being bill spiritual view is

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.160
that you know there I do believe they're

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.690
entities that kind of just float around

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:38.460
it doesn't make sense that it just stop

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.470
biological and this is lighting scarier

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.170
I've seen the movie what hereditary I

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:45.030
don't I don't watch it I think it is I

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.520
don't know I do think there is some sort

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.900
of other dimensional creatures that you

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.220
can't talk to and I went I'd especially

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.780
what I do like super do you believe you

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:52.800
can talk to

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.750
interdimensional creature there are I

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.370
think there's other dimensions Real Talk

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:59.040
real value I think there's other could

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.840
you believe that there's other and

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.490
consciousnesses I think there's

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:03.750
different consciousness is that you can

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.430
tap into do you say that they can talk

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:06.660
to us through the different levels of

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:07.110
the earth

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:11.600
I think the warming debate with a winch

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:16.460
will do that I mean it is crazy

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.020
it's a crazy to think that consciously

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.370
you know we're not bragging we're the

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:21.780
most like consciously advanced creatures

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:27.450
on the earth suck our dick with house

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:29.280
cats probably there has to be another

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.810
thing and you know in all of time and

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:32.580
all of creation is dude has more

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:33.780
consciousness than human beings

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.910

that church I mean anywhere do it in a

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:27.090
church because they're [ __ ] the kids

00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:28.460
all the time

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:31.200
sure I want to destroy a building do a

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:35.340
church Wow [ __ ] little bullies I think

Heyman's in there yeah I mean I don't

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:42.120
know the Catholic Church got bailed out

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.760
they got like stimulus money yeah dude

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:45.060
there

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:46.350
carted ship like no one's coming to

government was like fine gave them I

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:52.470
think like some Mills yeah Joe Trump

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:54.690
denied like 500 million to Minneapolis

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:57.300
or whatever for the riots any gave the

00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.240
Catholic Church he's was firing up that

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:04.260
base dude that's what good his base is

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:06.960
engaged his face is getting leveled

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:09.960
right now once all those geezers die

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.880
we're going full socialism like it's

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.490
just going to have you say that no that

00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:16.500
is gonna happen there's nothing that

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.780
cuts a very small majority of human know

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:21.090
that cause I don't think so all young

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:23.490
people right now from like 20 there's

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:25.230
been so many waves of this yeah that's

00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:27.270
cool it's come to go talk to Bill

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:30.810
DeBlasio say I'm Connie I'm just think

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:33.330
of the 60s mm-hmm once what happens is

00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:35.730
you get out of your 20s like you start

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:37.770
having money and families true and

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:39.720
you're like oh I'm not paying this time

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.460
yeah there's people right now with kids

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:43.320
that are even like I said that's all a

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:45.720
show dude okay these people are the

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.700
biggest frauds known to man we'll see I

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.890
believe it's 20 years prediction well

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:51.870
that's the thing too will be I think

00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:53.970
we'll have like healthcare basic

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:55.680
standard we should we should have health

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.720
care yeah well it should have health

00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:03.630
care is weird reversal heard that I just

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:05.970
figured by our bill hey Bob I know all

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:08.040
right now we love universal health care

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.700
and you be uh yeah yeah that makes sense

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.590
yeah we just like things that make sense

00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:15.000
and when things don't make sense

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.860
it gets his pissed off yeah like inter

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:18.600
like what yeah what doesn't make sense

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.700
just interest like weird fractional

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:23.520
banking or any other banking well there

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:24.930
well it's weird too though cuz it is

00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:27.210
like well you might give a bank a dollar

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:28.950
how come they can lend it out 10 more

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:30.600
times doesn't make any sense to me who's

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:31.200
doing that

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:35.280
swipers yeah yeah thanks go back they

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:36.900
can lend out they make their own rules

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:38.700
with their lobbies that they you know

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:41.010
they have lobbyists and stuff well I I

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:42.840
think it'll be this is me you know and I

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:46.080
I do I think in I think in 20 years it

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:48.330
will be the point where like hey man I'm

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:51.180
not gonna make it 20 years hey don't say

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:52.590
that dude you don't worry we're supposed

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:54.510
to look more like 120 bro maybe you guys

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:56.930
I'm putting

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:02.210
for a good time not a long time he'll be

00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:06.960
used well the part this is the thing

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:08.640
people defend you know maybe maybe I'm

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.080
wrong maybe I'm an idealist but it's

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:13.080
like if people put all the effort into

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.820
just like securing biological

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:18.300
necessities and then chilled that is

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:22.740
possible like food shelter all day long

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.600
films show this and I wish people were

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:28.230
on this this is debris symbolic there's

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:30.510
always like it used to be you would just

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:31.920
go ensure everyone would work together

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:33.720
for the most part to ensure biological

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:35.580
necessities come back and night there

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:36.900
was everyone living under a shared myth

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:37.950
where it'd be like yo tell us again

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:39.510
about how we're all like sky people and

00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:40.560
like alia come here I'll check it out

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.330
like you're like I'm from the

00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:43.680
underground or whatever from the

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.540
underground anything yeah so then app

00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:47.130
then it was like people started making

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:48.810
stuff then you'd have a think so like in

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:50.400
the Middle Ages it would be you know

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.720
you'd grow all the stuff you need you'd

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.310
make all the stuff you need if you got a

00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:55.170
teeny little bit extra you could sell

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:56.520
that for like a cool trinket and that

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:58.200
was it and then it became but just

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.180
making [ __ ] for the sake of making [ __ ]

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:02.370
then hoarding money well yeah because

00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:04.980
then they invented agriculture and then

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:07.050
you didn't have to like roam around you

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:09.330
could just sit there yep and then and

00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:12.540
all the seekers you could make a note

00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:16.170
ran seekers are the problem to have

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:18.450
people create things like art sure

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:20.910
things like that yeah but you but you

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:22.260
could do that if you were secure in your

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:23.790
biological necessities well this whole

00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:25.230
[ __ ] that this happening right now has

00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:26.370
already happen before though

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:28.890
what like all this like [ __ ] weird

00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:32.190
like like hyper feminism and hyper

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:34.470
sexuality and let's [ __ ] whoever we want

00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:36.000
yeah you what everyone but this state

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.560
it's not subversive anymore the states

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:41.840
pushing this yeah that's why I think

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.310
states pushing this yeah but do that

00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:46.200
black lives matter [ __ ] of fun making

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.450
them into [ __ ] [ __ ] that what do you

00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:51.680
mean [ __ ] that [ __ ]

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:55.170
they're pushing [ __ ] black [ __ ]

00:49:55.170 --> 00:49:56.160
everywhere they want to cut their balls

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.450

oh yeah just trans it out don't worry

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:12.030

00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:13.920
that's trying to like hit your show on

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.030
the hottest ticket in town

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:17.190
you're like trans because right now it's

00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:18.270
like the black lives matter things the

00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:19.470
biggest most discussed things you're

00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:21.120
like don't forget about trans people are

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.650
like you know just hit you know that's

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:24.540
hit you onto the card but the people who

00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:26.310
run it what a stronger card though if

00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:27.600
you're just promoting the black family

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.610
yeah strongest well and that's yeah that

00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:31.620
gets I mean dude way this is subversive

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:34.260
Marxist [ __ ] when you get in the

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:37.410
trans stuff and a weird sex stuff then

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:38.940
it's the Bolsheviks Marx is only

he was doing this [ __ ] with a trained

01:08:41.330 --> 01:08:42.800

is when you're Motel okay if you stay

01:10:37.889 --> 01:10:39.030

the really last strong group of

01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:29.250
individuals to come and knock all that

01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:34.460
[ __ ] it's already Nazis but I mean they

01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:36.510
