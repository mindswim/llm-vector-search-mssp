guess I was I was beyond sleep tube dude

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.190
I woke up at one point

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.390
I've never reached levels of sleep

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.620
deprivation like that before that's

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.109
gotta be why I'm good now yeah dude

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.140
the the first night we got home we spaz

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.909
and invited everybody over so like I

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.530
didn't sleep the night before nice

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.180
before that and I'm like you're just

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.409
running on adrenaline you're like I just

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.790
want everyone to see this little kid so

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.680
your family's coming so I don't sleep at

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.549
all and you're supposed to sleep when

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.369
the baby sleeps tom is wide awake oh oh

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.810
look a baby sleeping here passing around

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.509
and eventually like I crash and like do

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.159
you know nighttime the baby wakes up

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.670
like every 35 minutes it's like

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.619
literally like CIA tour there's a form

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.509
of CIA torture that is that yeah where

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.920
you stand in a box and they just kind of

make you they hit you with lights every

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.310

kind of a this is what I this is

00:13:28.959 --> 00:13:30.040
personally what I think's happening

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.990
because you know that the Illuminati did

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:35.230

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.720
if I could honestly yeah if someone

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.339

00:15:05.079 --> 00:15:06.370
much like that it's like AB it's like a

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:09.160
big sick pyramid scheme and then that's

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.389
pretty much the whole thing you just

00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:13.870
have people who are paid huh both we

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:16.060
still not talking about the period yes

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.439
it's not anti-semitic at all it's just

00:15:17.439 --> 00:15:18.930
no no I wasn't

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:20.610
about that I would say that's a symbol

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:23.310
for the Illuminati I mean obvi so this

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:24.750
[ __ ] they love showing their

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.880
symbolism didn't they get off on it well

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.440
that's what Bill Clinton Bill Clinton

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.089
apparently like shouted out his history

00:15:30.089 --> 00:15:32.279
professor the guy was saying like yeah

00:15:32.279 --> 00:15:34.020
same sweet he said oh I love my history

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.870
professor but he's like that guy wrote

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.070
two books one of them was called hope

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.480
and tragedy and the other one was called

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.450
someone about the anglo-saxon America

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.250
but it's like boring

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:45.870
it's like apparently like just facts and

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:47.130
dates it's super boring and then there's

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.230
chunks where it's like this guy was

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.149
invited to document these societies and

00:15:51.149 --> 00:15:52.410
he's like this is what I found he's like

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.390
actually this is sick I don't know why

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:55.980
they're secret what they're trying to do

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.690
is just they're trying to unite the

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.370
world under a world government this is

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:01.230
awesome so they're saying that's what

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:02.760
the it's just a bunch of rich people

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.589
trying to gain dominion over the entire

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:04.980
world

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:08.610
no big which is consistent with history

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:10.680
the idea that like weird is all of

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.660
sudden not ruled anymore as weird people

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.950
like no we uh you know we vote and uh

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.589
it's like okay yeah I agree with all

00:16:19.589 --> 00:16:21.060
that so it's not a base not like a huge

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.890
massive conspiracy but yeah the guy the

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:24.779
historian is so [ __ ] funny because he

00:16:24.779 --> 00:16:26.610
started his own like he wants to start

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:27.420
his own Society

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.070
so he had he wants symbols and

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:30.300
everything is he like loves all that

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.130
[ __ ] so he did that he did took the

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:33.209
peace sign which is obviously the

00:16:33.209 --> 00:16:35.070
upside-down broken cross the satanic

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:37.020
symbol and it was used by the Russians

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:40.589
to deed nuclearized America anyway the

00:16:40.589 --> 00:16:43.890
so then he turned it upside down oh boy

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:45.900
he turned it upside down he's like and

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.150
this was a cool symbol but then drat I

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:49.850
realized this was actually a Nazi symbol

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:52.820
[Laughter]

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.260
I had a little head it's going to

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.330
freedom initiative so funny so I had a

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.310
little head you know now I took the

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.959
similar honestly originally he uses like

00:17:00.959 --> 00:17:03.690
swastika stuff he's like I mean ancient

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.370
symbols you know they kind of took it

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:07.530
dude I was reading this last night dying

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.179
that's so funny this guy rolled out a

00:17:09.179 --> 00:17:11.520
symbol it was like dread damn it it's a

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.740
Nazi symptom right yeah and he also he's

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.829
not a big fan of global warming not a

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:18.689
big fan he doesn't believe in that no he

00:17:18.689 --> 00:17:20.220
doesn't not the mistake with pollution

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.900
he goes pollutions real he's like I just

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.670
don't buy the carbon the whole thing

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:24.870
that carbons heating the earth he goes

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:26.400
that's just a way to tax people heavily

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.169
so this is this is where the guy I was

00:17:28.169 --> 00:17:30.440
kind of like well right breath going ham

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.730
so pretty funny but yeah that [ __ ] was

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:33.960
pretty interesting how he talked about

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.240
how the road scholarship was this guy

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.040
had a will and if you've read like his

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.990
letters and his wills or whatever he's

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:41.610
saying like I want to set up I want to

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:43.470
his whole thing was like the British

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:45.030
race is the best race in the world and

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.950
we have to make sure that the world

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:48.690
falls under the Dominion of the British

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:49.919
race and that's where the Rhodes

00:17:49.919 --> 00:17:51.510
Scholarships comes from and that's all

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:53.010
apparently that's like on the record of

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:53.880
this guy saying that

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.850
so the Rhodes Scholars is is to identify

00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:00.030
who could potentially you know fulfill

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.820
the Rhodes Ian view of like you don't

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:03.960
have to write essays and stuff and you

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.900
have to be in line with like that you

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.840
know English [ __ ] rules and I'm gonna

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.540
help keep then going pretty tight pretty

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.460
tight pretty tight but yeah what you

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.320
said that we do have basically secret

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:16.890
society

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.720
yeah man a podcast network is it just

back all summer ever be chillin and then

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:16.679
you were to see these like it was very

00:25:16.679 --> 00:25:18.179
close to zombies like twenty-year-old

00:25:18.179 --> 00:25:19.799
college white kids we start walking

00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:22.019

00:25:28.679 --> 00:25:29.969
these if I had like if people were

00:25:29.969 --> 00:25:31.589
telling me like if I was experiencing

00:25:31.589 --> 00:25:34.529
gentrification yeah also two of you

00:25:34.529 --> 00:25:35.549

neighborhood nothing's going that well

00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:39.629
either struggling and then you see these

00:25:39.629 --> 00:25:41.789
kids that come throw a party and then

00:25:41.789 --> 00:25:45.959
they're just like managers like your

00:25:45.959 --> 00:25:48.869

00:25:56.759 --> 00:25:59.389
around they're like I'm so [ __ ] broke

00:25:59.389 --> 00:26:02.940

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.629
8 housing dude like oh yeah that's

00:26:06.629 --> 00:26:08.700

00:26:16.469 --> 00:26:17.969
student that got off the elevator I was

00:26:17.969 --> 00:26:21.029
bitter laughs so [ __ ] hard he cries

00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.750
the wood man

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.370
got hey crunch what's also that's

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:24.510
something you kind of got a like hold

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:26.010
yeah it's a white dude you can't claim

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:28.680
hate crime nobody nobody's trying to

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.480
[ __ ] here no one on earth would have

with he was hitting us with that hard

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.450
I like that rationale though it's like

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:37.890
look I hate [ __ ] white people but

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:39.240

don't beat the [ __ ] out of wait that's

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.860
what being racist is yeah thoughts

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.200
you're allowed to actively tell people

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.340
you don't like them because they're

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.020
white yeah but as long as you don't put

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.670

about in China not Chinese restaurants

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:01.920
here but yet true if you're coming from

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.810
China where it's acceptable to launch

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:05.430
those things I'm saying you walk into a

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:08.040

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.740
without having sex Oh forever I don't

00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:00.100
know well they asked you they're like

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:01.360
what are what's your form of birth

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:02.770
control you're gonna do apparently one

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:04.000
women after they have a baby they're

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.520
highly fertile for a little window where

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:07.930
they're super fertile and you don't want

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:10.870
to back to back home yeah damages the

00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:13.270
damages the broad put bathe you put

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:14.710
bathing right and for the kids you gotta

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:15.910
let the placenta build up a little bit

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:17.560
Bay's been through the wringer so I'm

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:20.800
like now it's like sex is a it's like

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.060
you can't go back on birth control

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:23.710
because you can't go and birth certain

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:24.460
birth controls while you're

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:27.070
breastfeeding so now it's like you know

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:28.930
we have a couple more weeks obviously we

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:31.120
can chill but it feels like through that

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.290
first time having sex again it's gonna

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:34.240
be scary I told her we're gonna be nice

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.400
it's gonna be awesome yeah but it's like

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:39.310
you can't use birth control and you know

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:40.570
we're not either us or not really into

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:43.360
using condoms like that so you're

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.710
playing with the doubt at that point you

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:47.140
see what happened so you have sex now

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:50.170

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:52.300
risking it all yeah which you know

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:53.800

00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:56.340
narrative then like somebody's a [ __ ]

00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:58.080

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:03.540
and he had a heart attack this year well

00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:04.770
they're trying to say like he's fully

00:57:04.770 --> 00:57:08.660
he's Moscow turned dogs six foot is he

00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:12.750
good slaps going I didn't notice true oh

00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:14.299
he does have a good

00:57:14.299 --> 00:57:16.250
you know Biden six-foot I think these

00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:17.660
guys are height lion do you think so

00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:23.420
definitely they're like yeah man that's

00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:30.020
that's a big jump dog six to eight hours

00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:34.150
above his enemies did six three it's my

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:36.740
six three yes

00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:38.210
damn I knew I had I knew I had the

00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:44.410
perfect body the exact same dimensions

00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:47.839
wide ass Trump's a big boy dude he's my

00:57:47.839 --> 00:57:50.000
size yeah he's dude he's boy he's a

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.020
sassy daddy so I can bullying people oh

00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:54.920
man

00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:56.180
but yeah dude they're gonna call Bernie

00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:57.380
a Russian ass but that's the other thing

00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:59.990
too it's like I think they want to move

00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:02.809
towards kind of like social democracy I

00:58:02.809 --> 00:58:04.280
think they're gonna put everyone on the

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.289
team and then it's clamped down on

00:58:06.289 --> 00:58:09.530
everything so I think personally I think

00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:12.710
Trump was something to rattle people's

00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:14.869
cages and it turned out people are like

00:58:14.869 --> 00:58:16.039
you know this guy [ __ ] rules

00:58:16.039 --> 00:58:17.510
yeah like foxes they definitely didn't

00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:19.430
want him to nobody wanted him to win no

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:20.809
I think he was supposed to rattle our

00:58:20.809 --> 00:58:22.910
cage I don't think anyone laid this out

00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:24.289
but I think strategy-wise is like all

00:58:24.289 --> 00:58:25.700
right he'll scare the [ __ ] out of people

00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:27.740
so much that they'll just let the

00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:29.029
Democratic Party do whatever they want

00:58:29.029 --> 00:58:31.369
and I like the stock market's up at like

00:58:31.369 --> 00:58:34.220
the side it's people things are just

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:36.109
crashed and I think Iran in Russia are

00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:38.029
talking to [ __ ] us on oil or

00:58:38.029 --> 00:58:40.369
something I don't know it goes up and

00:58:40.369 --> 00:58:42.200
down all the time we need to get as

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.930
productive assets all of the speculative

00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:47.869
[ __ ] on the stock market is [ __ ] you

00:58:47.869 --> 00:58:49.609
just get did invest in Purell last week

00:58:49.609 --> 00:58:51.410
did you really yeah it's good stuff I'm

00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:53.510

might go up that's all [ __ ] and

00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:04.970
gambling like you're not supposed to do

00:59:04.970 --> 00:59:06.230
that you just get companies that have

00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:08.900
paid dividends you buy a ton of them

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:10.670
like coca-cola has been Coca Cola's

00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:11.930
never missed a dividend in a hundred

00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:14.480
years they've paid dividends through the

00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:15.200
Great Depression

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:16.910
all this stuff's charted you just look

00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:18.349
for those companies that always pay

00:59:18.349 --> 00:59:20.329
dividends by all those shares and then

00:59:20.329 --> 00:59:22.099
if the stock market dips you just buy

00:59:22.099 --> 00:59:23.630
more shares I don't know anything I

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:25.069

00:59:29.049 --> 00:59:31.239
betting on like well this one your [ __ ]

00:59:31.239 --> 00:59:34.059
you're gambling bro true that's not the

00:59:34.059 --> 00:59:35.349
wolf didn't do the wolf of Wall Street

00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:37.509

dividends you don't know what you do I'm

01:00:08.410 --> 01:00:11.380

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:27.339
gonna be on its way out so what what's

01:00:27.339 --> 01:00:30.609
up Ford GM GM's go on you look up you

01:00:30.609 --> 01:00:32.109
can look up the companies that have paid

01:00:32.109 --> 01:00:33.519
dividends over the last hundred eighty

01:00:33.519 --> 01:00:35.890
Ron and Ron used to be one of the top

01:00:35.890 --> 01:00:37.690
companies that sunk but the thing is you

01:00:37.690 --> 01:00:39.579
diversify you have a ton of them so then

01:00:39.579 --> 01:00:41.499
it's like you have all these things

01:00:41.499 --> 01:00:43.150
paying you dividends some obviously go

01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:45.489
up and then like steak strop like straw

01:00:45.489 --> 01:00:47.079
bridges and clothes like Sears or one of

01:00:47.079 --> 01:00:48.999
those say you bought Sears like 30 years

01:00:48.999 --> 01:00:51.579
ago it just [ __ ] went up and up and

01:00:51.579 --> 01:00:52.749
up and now you're like all right this

01:00:52.749 --> 01:00:55.479
shit's dying starts to dip then you sell

01:00:55.479 --> 01:00:57.160
that stock off and then you actually do

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.809
get that big bump up like speculative

01:00:58.809 --> 01:01:01.029
bump you get that you reinvest in all

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:04.360
Bay's just go total control mode on you

when they described it in class they're

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:18.010
like what happens is the woman just

01:03:18.010 --> 01:03:19.540
assumes the husband's totally incapable

01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:22.420

they have like a lifetime of these weird

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:30.580
finger skills of just kind of like from

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:31.750
like braiding hair and doing weird

01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:33.820
little like the paper mache fortune

01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:36.430
teller yeah cookie cutter things yeah so

01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:37.600
they're real good at doing these weird

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.430
finger movements and then they're like

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:40.840
you know holding a baby and ripping the

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.310
diaper off and you try to help and

01:03:42.310 --> 01:03:44.020
you're just [ __ ] yeah you're like

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:45.730
trying to pull the things in a lot of

01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:46.900
times what happens is the girl is like

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:48.220
just let me do it and then you go like

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:51.490

01:03:51.490 --> 01:03:53.410
to slowly bag this [ __ ] idiot then

01:03:53.410 --> 01:03:54.400
you start being like she thinks

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.839
[ __ ] idiot and they just slowly

01:03:55.839 --> 01:03:58.089
resent each other on and on and on over

01:03:58.089 --> 01:03:59.770
this thing of just not being able to

01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:01.390
share the response you just feels

01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:03.130
overwhelmed but you all spent you're an

01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:04.809

like you have to give him jobs to do

01:04:12.970 --> 01:04:14.349

so it's pretty tight that's my job now

01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:17.890
we're like she feeds a kid and I get to

01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:19.150
burp the kid and lay the kid down and

01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:21.279

what if you so that was the pediatrician

01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:24.730
was like due to our total sexist nature

01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:26.680
you know we're drenched in sexism women

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.060
think they have to do this and guys were

01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.040
like yeah this is [ __ ] girl work and

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.600
then the girl that starts to hate you

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:34.030
just hate your [ __ ] guts but we're

01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:36.460
not sexist that's girl work it's good

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:39.340
for yeah it is but for guys to wrestle

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:42.040
oh it's funny this isn't a great take

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.540
but do you think that's how like they

01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:44.740
thought about races they're like it's

01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:48.130
not racist that's black people work that

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:50.140
just is that I was actually there was a

01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:51.880
movie going on in the house yesterday it

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:53.590
was one of those like black people

[ __ ] hotel you know yeah like just

01:20:59.419 --> 01:21:03.709
given facts about Sandy Hook not my cup

sandy little problem with it is you

watch and it's like again I I fully I

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:18.470
fully do think there's the government's

01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:20.330
run by kind of these rings of the elite

01:21:20.330 --> 01:21:22.280
I think you can't tell that's what the

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:25.000
government is well it literally is

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.050
elites yeah exactly

01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:28.910
but there's elites who kind of chill on

01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:31.010
that back there's there's more ely oh

01:21:31.010 --> 01:21:31.580
yeah

01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:33.800
the further you go exactly so yeah but

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:35.570
they're kind of in plain sight it's not

01:21:35.570 --> 01:21:39.140
as like the heads of the DNC like you

01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:40.580
can look it up you can just see who's

01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:41.660
running it I don't think I mean the

01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:43.310
heads of the DNC still aren't

01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:45.320
controlling that you're talking so the

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:47.540
like Dick Cheney what's the [ __ ] Dick

01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:49.310
Cheney was running to see if the Council

01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:51.050
on Foreign Relations they're they're

01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:52.730
like four rings the Council of Foreign

01:21:52.730 --> 01:21:54.500
Relations according this historian

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:57.020
they're like three rings out so they're

01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:58.580
just those guys are just doing the

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:00.530
bidding of the other guys just stay

01:22:00.530 --> 01:22:03.830
fully fully in the shadows Porsches you

01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:05.600
just chill sash do your thing you just

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:08.870
literally make money you just put it out

01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:11.900
to people yeah so it's like but like

01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:13.610
when Cheney was running the Bush

01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:17.540
administration yeah oh dude the

01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:19.580
Secretary of State is the most important

01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:21.140
and the director of the CIA the

01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:22.820
president has literally no the President

01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:24.290
as a joke because it's like the

01:22:24.290 --> 01:22:25.370
Secretary of the state between the

01:22:25.370 --> 01:22:27.200
houses and all that stuff that's you can

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:28.730
elect whoever you want and they can be

01:22:28.730 --> 01:22:30.380
fully blocked from doing whatever they

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:32.120
could do well they could be assassinated

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:35.510
it's he killing they can be murdered so

01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:37.280
it's like I personally think the news

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:39.490
like the news Excel to be murdered

01:22:39.490 --> 01:22:41.690
anyone you can murder anyone can get

01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:45.050
touched yeah I think the news is just

01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:47.840
like a bigger ad agency for like if you

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:51.080
want to start a narrative you can buy a

01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:54.170
narrative like an ad that's so that's

01:22:54.170 --> 01:22:56.720
what I think the news is that's the main

01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:58.640
conspiracy I think is what gets to be on

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:01.010
the news of why the rest of this stuff a

01:23:01.010 --> 01:23:02.780
lot of it I think is yeah you can see

01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:05.000
some of that in that uh that the

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.860
Showtime had a show about Roger Ailes

01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:08.990
running Fox and like him just on the

01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:11.300
phone with the Bush administration about

01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:13.430
the Iraq war yeah exact you guys once

01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:15.650
it's [ __ ] war or not so give me what I

01:23:15.650 --> 01:23:17.810
want and I'll put you guys on Fox yeah

01:23:17.810 --> 01:23:18.230
dude

01:23:18.230 --> 01:23:20.660
so I mean yes that's technically

01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:21.240
conspiracy

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:23.670
when you get into like the YouTube docks

01:23:23.670 --> 01:23:26.220
that's where I start going alright who

01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:28.230
knows but I worry it's a lot of its

01:23:28.230 --> 01:23:30.540
Russian propaganda because there or does

01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:32.130
any world government propaganda we're

01:23:32.130 --> 01:23:35.490
just a [ __ ] guy like Oh most of these

01:23:35.490 --> 01:23:38.940
are like look they moved this out of the

01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:41.040
way of the glass yeah when he entered

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:43.260
the school so it's like dude how you

01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:45.000
know what are you talking about yeah

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.650

talking about how during like the 1960s

01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:49.200
of Vietnam they were kind of people are

01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:50.400
getting SIOP this was there was a

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.500
Russian movement to convince the

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:55.320
citizenry to dr like to denuclearize the

01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:57.270
country to be like yeah this is [ __ ]

01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.750

01:25:01.530 --> 01:25:02.880
apparently documented that they were

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:04.770
pouring money and to get people to do

01:25:04.770 --> 01:25:06.930
this so they definitely [ __ ] people

01:25:06.930 --> 01:25:08.370
are [ __ ] around each other non-stop

01:25:08.370 --> 01:25:11.580
yeah so it's like you know is there any

01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:13.860
China denuclearize he might be a Russian

01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:15.690
asset dude hey man he hates nuclear

01:25:15.690 --> 01:25:18.480
power yeah that's a new thing which is

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:19.620
pretty funny he hates it

01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:22.130
well now that's that's like a cause for

01:25:22.130 --> 01:25:25.350
all the people that love Bernie it's

01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:27.150
it's great because my twitter is all

01:25:27.150 --> 01:25:27.930
comics

01:25:27.930 --> 01:25:30.960
yeah and it's all of them just love

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:32.310
Bernie now

01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:35.190
really yeah all team loves Burnie all

01:25:35.190 --> 01:25:37.080
team is obsessed with that's why it's

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:38.640
like I can't even cheer for them because

01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:41.610
I the things that'll affect me is

01:25:41.610 --> 01:25:44.490
watching them be sad that'll make me

01:25:44.490 --> 01:25:44.970
happy

01:25:44.970 --> 01:25:46.800
yeah there's all the people I hate love

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:49.260
Bernie I kinda would rather Trump win

01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:50.460
just so I could see them on Twitter

01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:54.720
everything in terms of like the economy

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:56.580
it's like I don't mind I don't care what

01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:59.430
happens politically honestly I think

01:25:59.430 --> 01:26:01.530
that might be the most rational I just

01:26:01.530 --> 01:26:03.180
want to see people that don't like be

01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:06.630
upset on social media hell yeah that's

01:26:06.630 --> 01:26:08.370
kind of all I want no that's what I look

01:26:08.370 --> 01:26:09.720
for in a candidate that's what you would

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:11.250
who's gonna make my enemies the most

01:26:11.250 --> 01:26:18.740
upset online yes wins all kind of laughs

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:21.690
if he wins again man I I do think he

01:26:21.690 --> 01:26:24.630
will I mean dude if I had to think about

01:26:24.630 --> 01:26:27.150
who died vote for I it's it's a toss-up

01:26:27.150 --> 01:26:29.220
if it's Bernie and Trump and it's

01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:32.040
someone's like you have to vote I don't

01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:35.160
know who I'd vote for I'd literally

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.780
can't say I have to do a little more

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:38.970
reason to some reason because yeah and

01:26:38.970 --> 01:26:40.680
this is this is where we you know

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:42.030
there's gonna be some other red like you

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:43.440
[ __ ] understand anything it's like

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:45.060
yeah I don't know I don't first things

01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:47.310
first things first I don't

01:26:47.310 --> 01:26:49.920
well it's also know anything but health

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:53.250
care I know it's complicated but that's

01:26:53.250 --> 01:26:55.140
the fact that was one of the few

01:26:55.140 --> 01:26:58.140
countries that don't have [ __ ] it's

01:26:58.140 --> 01:26:59.490
wild we're getting it we're gonna know

01:26:59.490 --> 01:27:03.000
this and this is my prediction this is

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.700
the we're gonna be on we're gonna be on

01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:07.140
a single-payer system pretty soon

01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:08.820
they're just getting us ready for it

01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:09.960
because they you know people are gonna

01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:11.760
freak out this is communism they want us

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:14.850
to be in some form of social democracy

01:27:14.850 --> 01:27:17.490
that's coming that's if you know if

01:27:17.490 --> 01:27:19.530
because it dude this has been hundreds

01:27:19.530 --> 01:27:21.000
of years of planning these kind of like

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.890
societies that you know just say rich

01:27:22.890 --> 01:27:25.170
people who are like kind of moving stuff

01:27:25.170 --> 01:27:26.910
around and making things happen or

01:27:26.910 --> 01:27:28.080
trying to make things happen in a

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:29.880
certain way they have a hundred year

01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:32.190
plan of this be companies getting

01:27:32.190 --> 01:27:33.660
control over a one-world government they

01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:34.890
already have their surveillance kind of

01:27:34.890 --> 01:27:36.900
put in place you know and it's not again

01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:38.700
it's not just there's the rosy ins and

01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:41.310
there's communists so there's like they

01:27:41.310 --> 01:27:42.660
and then dude that's the other thing too

01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:44.280
there was like communists and stuff now

01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:45.260
you don't hear communists

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:46.520
or they just they let go of their name

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:47.660
now they're doing like to all the same

01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:50.000
stuff so there's like communists Rosie

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.260
ins and they're battling for total war

01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:53.810
Old Dominion so it's like it's not just

01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:55.220
one group of people doing this there's

01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:56.540
like three or four factions who are

01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:57.620
fighting to kind of get control of

01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:59.360
everything would you make sense who are

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:02.270
you cheering for oh the freedom

01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:04.310
initiative bro once they get once they

01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:06.590
get there I mean it you could do it you

01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:08.450
can take your pack they really really

01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:09.350
could take it back

01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:12.050
what's that it's the guy the professor

01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:14.090
started his own little secret society of

01:28:14.090 --> 01:28:16.220
the freedom initiative and that was a

01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:18.620
guy who unfortunately messed up with a

01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:24.200
symbol accidental upside-down peace side

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:25.520
now see simple but he put like a head on

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:26.750
it and it looks like a person just

01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:28.910
upward reaching but yeah but yeah it

01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:30.590
comes with it the only thing you have to

01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:31.970
swallow if you want to be in the freedom

01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:33.640
initiative you have to deny global worry

01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:36.080
hopes dude I call you they call the

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:37.730
global warming hoax but again that's not

01:28:37.730 --> 01:28:39.140
to say you you're against pollution

01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:41.600
man-made pollution a problem that the

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:43.580
problem has shown me the [ __ ] show me

01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:45.590
the documents and apparently there was

01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:47.300
they have though haven't they put a lot

01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:49.970
of documents I mean again I'm but I'm

01:28:49.970 --> 01:28:51.410
gonna say is I was looking into this

01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:52.910
last night and apparently another now

01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:53.960
Trump pulled out of the Paris agreement

01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:57.350
yeah so and there's apparently like

01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:59.360
there was actual sources like you know

01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:00.890
like The Guardian articles that aren't

01:29:00.890 --> 01:29:04.850
totally like [ __ ] I guess that well

01:29:04.850 --> 01:29:07.100
the Guardian also is running little

01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:10.220
train marriages true maybe a guard but

01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:11.600
it was slightly blue I remember and

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:13.010
again I could be wrong when we're seeing

01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:14.690
our publications am i right this isn't

01:29:14.690 --> 01:29:18.200
just like Patriot usa.com or whatever

01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:20.000
this is like a publication saying that

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.100
they the researchers got in trouble for

01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:25.760
flubbing this research for like they're

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:27.530
like one of them like a couple years ago

01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:28.850
they got in trouble for flubbing the

01:29:28.850 --> 01:29:30.290
stuff and it was actually like in like

01:29:30.290 --> 01:29:32.570
science daily and all this stuff so they

01:29:32.570 --> 01:29:33.980
flub this stuff at the Paris agreement

01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:35.840
and then the other scientists were like

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:39.920
this is [ __ ] so again I'm a big open

01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:41.240
mind if I just know the Paris agreement

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:44.150
was wasn't I don't think it was anything

01:29:44.150 --> 01:29:46.100
binding I think it was literally just an

01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:47.720
agreement like okay this is all we're

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:49.370
all gonna cut our emissions and then

01:29:49.370 --> 01:29:51.500
China was like oh yeah sure ain't [ __ ]

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:52.850
it we're all gonna cut our emissions

01:29:52.850 --> 01:29:55.640
u.s. you better you have I think I think

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.020
in the Paris agreement

01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:59.240
I could be wrong the US had stricter

01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:01.970
guidelines than like China and India

01:30:01.970 --> 01:30:03.050
really

01:30:03.050 --> 01:30:05.450
I believe huh well that's the thing too

01:30:05.450 --> 01:30:07.040
it's like I'm not against non pollution

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:08.720
but it's like we love pollution dude

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:10.370
trail pollution rules I've seen you

01:30:10.370 --> 01:30:12.560
littered you see I used to be a big time

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:14.210
bro you were a litter bug you threw a

01:30:14.210 --> 01:30:16.340
chair out of my car once through a

01:30:16.340 --> 01:30:18.020
folding chair out of my car on the town

01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:21.860
that's all I do throw a chair out on the

01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:23.300
Turnpike but I threw that made it I made

01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:24.710
it to the shoulder it wasn't a hazard to

01:30:24.710 --> 01:30:27.020
anybody do me if I hold it up beach

01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:28.760
chair me and my brother won't I tell you

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:31.460
when we ditch to surf at one time no my

01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:33.230
brother was moving I was like I must've

01:30:33.230 --> 01:30:34.880
been like 20 years old and he was at him

01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:36.020
and his roommate removing out of their

01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:38.510
apartment you know yeah like a pickup

01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:40.400
truck and I helped him load a sofa

01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:41.930
though I sit in the back of the so of

01:30:41.930 --> 01:30:43.700
the pickup truck so he pulled her like

01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:45.530
we got to dump this [ __ ] thing so he

01:30:45.530 --> 01:30:47.570
pulled down a [ __ ] small street dude

and they couldn't pull their cars there

01:30:59.810 --> 01:31:01.580
like there was probably a street full of

01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:03.560
people shut down because there's a nasty

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:05.840
[ __ ] like bong water that's a litter

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:15.560
funny it was it in Philly yeah I would

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:17.510
have I would have immediately got racist

01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:19.280
if I was driving to work I'd be like I

01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:21.500
can't live in this neighborhood back

01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:23.360
there leaving [ __ ] couches in the

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:28.400

01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:34.760
was driving to work in [ __ ] West

01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:35.840
Philly and there was a couch in the

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:38.570
middle of street you would take it I

01:31:38.570 --> 01:31:40.010
would take it there you to pull it off

01:31:40.010 --> 01:31:41.090
to a guy but you're lucky how about

01:31:41.090 --> 01:31:42.920

01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:47.960
say what oh man

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:51.710

01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:55.100
I'll be able to like three o'clock yeah

01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:57.220
I can't believe Trump dogs

01:31:57.220 --> 01:32:00.890
73 he's he's the he's the young spry one

01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:01.460
Robin

01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:04.040
yeah for sure well I mean you could tell

01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:08.060
he is the fungus this I'm telling well

01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:09.140
he's never smoked cigarettes are doing

01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:10.110
drugs to drink

01:32:10.110 --> 01:32:12.020
that's why he's fit in my prediction is

01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:16.170
I think we are gonna start slowly if if

01:32:16.170 --> 01:32:18.120
the New World Order is as this guy

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:19.890
Professor Griffin whatever his name is

01:32:19.890 --> 01:32:21.720
says it is he says there's a hundred

01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:23.430
year plan we're in it there's no stop

01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:25.740
like you know this is moving on so I do

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:27.330
think they're gonna do but if the plan

01:32:27.330 --> 01:32:29.850
is for governments to like give us

01:32:29.850 --> 01:32:34.440
health care and education so if it's

01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:36.810
like bad no well that's the other thing

01:32:36.810 --> 01:32:38.760
too it's these people don't think

01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:40.170
they're doing anything evil they're

01:32:40.170 --> 01:32:42.060
trying to advance mankind to pull

01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:43.670
mankind out or they're like [ __ ]

01:32:43.670 --> 01:32:47.160
stuff yeah but that comes with like you

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:48.420
got to take all the weapons for people

01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:49.320
because you got to take total control

01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:50.760
that's yeah that's the other part and

01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:52.140
then when people get total control they

01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:55.140
generally become wicked so it's like

01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:56.820
they could have the best I wanna just I

01:32:56.820 --> 01:32:58.440

01:47:28.890 --> 01:47:30.079
prophecy all those daddy

01:47:30.079 --> 01:47:31.939
that are at the strip club are basically

01:47:31.939 --> 01:47:33.829
fueling the economy for strippers

01:47:33.829 --> 01:47:40.129
they're creating the stripper chickens

01:47:40.129 --> 01:47:42.109
watching eggs but if you're just kicking

01:47:42.109 --> 01:47:43.579
around you're just kind of like you know
