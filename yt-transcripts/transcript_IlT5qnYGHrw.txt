00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.840

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.600
mcpherson just told me he found the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.879
actual dead

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.719
baseball they found the dead sea scrolls

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.600
of baseball it was just some guy like

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.399
run

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.600
uh in a triangle and hit the ball yeah

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.520
it was it was uh that's a wild [ __ ]

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.280
sport to invent a bunch of old dudes

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.360
from new york and then it was a young

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.560
man's game

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.720
and they had to reinvent it

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.080
it wasn't the original invention but it

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.920
was it just what was the original bible

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.799
it just pre-dated uh abner doubleday so

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.560
but it was it was definitely the idea of

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.080
like throwing something at someone them

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.119
hitting it

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.640
do you think they had the tr the diamond

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.360
shape baseball at first it was like

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.840
run back and forth three times

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.159
who knows who knows matt we may never

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.560
know when did the umpire come about

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.640
i don't know when do they start going

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.790
[Music]

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.479
[Laughter]

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.079
um basketball was uh originally i feel

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:43.280
like there's something with like a peach

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.600
basket or some [ __ ] that makes sense i

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.040
see them every now and again the city

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.479
where it's like a

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.520
a big

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.520
piece of plywood with like a milk crate

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.720
and i'm like all right come on guys

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.720

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.119
at toys r us you're not that poor

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.799
knock off the audio knock off the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.200
autobiographical [ __ ]

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.960
i used to shoot on a thing it's like

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.719
dude they're like [ __ ] 40 bucks

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.840
where'd you even get a milk

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.399
rate naismith uh and they still give out

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.080
the naysmith award he invented

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.000
basketball yeah supposedly but then

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.360
again if you look up who invented

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.120
baseball it says abner doubleday and he

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.319
did not

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.280
i bet yeah that's true that's uh i bet

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.200
the original baseball was like only

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.560
played by girls and they started [ __ ]

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.520
they threw through

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.200
this from canada dude

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.720
what about you think a canadian invented

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.560
[ __ ] canadian probably yeah this is

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.239
ridiculous that's not true that was the

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.480
original baseball dude it was just all

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.680
girls played and they threw the ball

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.400
underhand then he became the head coach

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.280
at kansas who james naismith yeah after

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.879
he invented the game he was the head

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.400
head coach and he went 55 and 60.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.840
this guy [ __ ] why would he just be

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.599
the commissioner of the whole thing

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.000
imagine inventing a sport and then being

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.480
less than 500. that sucks yeah you

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.760
[ __ ] should at least give yourself

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.040
like another couple years to get really

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.800

there's

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.240
if you're like a 35 40 year old woman

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.240
you don't have kids it's like you get a

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.599
[ __ ] camera and you start going to

00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:32.320
the football games snapping pics

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.320

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.000
i think she was gay i have no idea i

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.839
have no [ __ ] idea what she was doing

00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:44.640
maybe

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.399
we had a lesbian jimmy loved the hershey

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:48.640

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.839
[ __ ] who the hershey bear just

00:08:49.839 --> 00:08:51.040
remembered that the hershey bears who

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.880
were the hershey bears

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.480
some of the [ __ ] like [ __ ] ten

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.120
times calder chop carter cup champions

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.640
dude what is it you don't know hershey

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.720
bears are they triple a ball it's uh

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.640
yeah it's the

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.399
the hockey for the

00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:05.680
oh they're like the phantom for the

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.120
capitals like the fans they're better

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.120
than the phantoms but yes well well yeah

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.800
let's look at the cops dude

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.959
count the rings hershey bears

00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:15.680
let's let's go did she love the bears

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.120
she loved her some berries she snapped

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.640
pics of them too i don't know if she was

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.120
snapping pics dude her pickles snapping

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.320
she like loved the hershey bears dude do

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.279
you know how many people love the

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:31.120
hershey bears it's probably like her and

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.040
like two other dudes they were like

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.640
let's go bears come on

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.399
because i know people like this too who

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:41.120
get real into minor league local ball

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.800
and it's like dude

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.800
you can't even like like nfl it's like

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.080
what the [ __ ] dude give yourself some

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.839
credit yeah but i think it's a thing too

00:09:47.839 --> 00:09:49.440
is like with minor league ball you can

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.360
get kind of closer to the players you

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.279
get close to the players which is odd

00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:55.040
yeah it's like it's way easier to be

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.320
like if you're really into like the

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.160
philadelphia soul or whatever you could

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:58.880
like

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.560
you could arguably chill with one of

00:10:02.839 --> 00:10:05.360
them name on facebook and just message

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.080
him

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.160
i might do that now

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.920
that's a six scene to get into like uh

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.200
minor sports ahl yeah hl hockey dude

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.640
there's some good hockey down there you

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.320
can find some good hockey down there so

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.680
she's a teacher

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.519
i'm just trying to absorb the bleakness

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:21.040
of this life so she's a teenager this is

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.200
really harsh there's zero chance she's

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.560
gonna get a hold of this i mean it's sad

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.000
i'm not [ __ ] on her i'm the small

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.760
town i'm from though my whole thing is

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.040
that you don't know it was a bl how hard

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.800
your life can must be bleak as [ __ ] you

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.240
don't know how hard your life can bottom

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.920
out until you get a little older you're

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.040
like a teacher

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.720
she taught us yeah did i include that

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.000
she was our teacher

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.600
she would go to our games

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.279
and take pictures of us like she had a

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:44.880
real nice camera

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.720
and would walk around the field and take

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.399
pictures yeah

00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:50.480
and it's so innocent it's not that bad

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.760
in my head i'm just like god that's

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.680
[ __ ] sad and it's like why

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.519
but it kind of is

00:10:55.519 --> 00:10:56.959
because after all the pictures are done

00:10:56.959 --> 00:10:58.720
you're done teaching school summer break

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.160

just like

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:05.680
[Music]

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.440
yeah it gets a little you start thinking

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.120
about driving a little close to the edge

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.640

they need to learn how to read

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.200
that's when you gotta get a cat that's

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.480
when you get a cat in a camera and you

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.160

appraiser like send pics let me see what

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.440
you're working with

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.440
you got hook shape wow look at that

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.640
thing what do you think of hook shape

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.480
that's rare i was thinking about hook

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.840
shape recently and i'm talking hooking

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.400
up hooking to the side oh one of those

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.120
but that's kind of a girth illusion

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.400
you know what i mean it's like yeah it's

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.760
curved but it's curving to the side

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:14.799
so

00:25:14.799 --> 00:25:16.159
think about that

00:25:16.159 --> 00:25:18.720
it's a girth illusion

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.640
what is there to think about what are

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.760
you talking about just gives you more

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.360
girth because you're hitting you're

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.279
hitting with an angle oh so it's

00:25:25.279 --> 00:25:26.400
creating you

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.080
as it's hooking you're measuring girth

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.080
but from what's touching what i see you

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.520
think that girth illusion also could

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.360
cause some major queef edge if you had a

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.880
curved dick like that you ever think

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.799
about that because that's hooking in air

00:25:36.799 --> 00:25:38.640
every time you create a hurricane really

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.360
that's

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.320
that's probably what happened with

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.760
katrina that's an alberta clipper right

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.120
there dude

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.240
next thing you know your girlfriend's

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.919
queefing so hard she's shooting out the

00:25:45.919 --> 00:25:48.159
window she flies away out of pure queef

00:25:48.159 --> 00:25:49.520
wants to take calls one day and ask if

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.919
people like the uh the hook

00:25:51.919 --> 00:25:54.720
about the hooked dick yeah

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.919
i don't know i guess i would i would

00:25:55.919 --> 00:25:57.919
just you got any hot cousins you should

00:25:57.919 --> 00:26:00.559
probably just ask a hot cousin

00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:02.080
if they like why why do i have to ask my

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.840
hot cousin i can't just ask anyone

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.279

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:06.880
randy see i'm sure randy's talked to

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.320

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.640

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.159
with a [ __ ] mushroom tip i got the

00:26:22.159 --> 00:26:24.480
plunger classic plunger oh yeah we

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.320

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.640
is the uh maybe it could it might i

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.890
don't i'm not gonna think about it but

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:32.960
[Laughter]

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.720
what i was saying dude is that so i i

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.000
wore it for four days and i was

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.480
skeptical you were a hood that you

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.480
bought online or you bought online from

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.400
canada on the tip of your dick for four

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.159
days for four seasons four days i

00:26:44.159 --> 00:26:45.679
believe i i think i have four or five

00:26:45.679 --> 00:26:47.919
i'm not sure so i'm wearing one one i'm

00:26:47.919 --> 00:26:49.679
saving two for my brother so i'm i'm not

00:26:49.679 --> 00:26:53.039
wearing two your brother wants

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.360
to my brother so one of them that was

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.480
made out of like almost like a leather

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.600
deck i think i don't know what brother

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.240
yeah

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.120
honestly i have an idea

00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:02.480
honestly i think i have a pretty good

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.159
idea who it is

00:27:04.159 --> 00:27:05.520
so it's like one of them's a little bit

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.039
leather daddy-ish so i've been hesitant

00:27:07.039 --> 00:27:08.799
to wear that it's a little leather daddy

00:27:08.799 --> 00:27:10.480
you don't want that it's just

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.159
the fabric but the rest of them are just

00:27:12.159 --> 00:27:14.000
like it's literally like i put it on you

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.520
don't get any sensitivity the first day

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.559
but like

00:27:16.559 --> 00:27:18.400
you just feel like it's like a bra for

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.240
your dick and i just feel like really

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.000
comfortable i feel like a part of me has

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.360
been missing and i put it on i'm just

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.640
kind of like

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.159
nice i feel secure

00:27:26.159 --> 00:27:27.520
telling you chucky you strap this thing

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.679
up and start moving this is great

00:27:29.679 --> 00:27:31.760
do you think randy's listening i hope so

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.120

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.520

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.720
second but

it's very painful you've got a nice

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.039
pendulous swinging semi at all times but

00:32:25.039 --> 00:32:27.840
the idea that even while sitting at your

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.519
niece's birthday i saw your face while

00:32:29.519 --> 00:32:31.600

[ __ ] you randy for sending matt he's

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.200
[ __ ]

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.279
randy from [ __ ] alberta or wherever

00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:40.720
the [ __ ] he's from

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:41.679

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.080
birthday like while they're cutting cake

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.039
singing

00:32:47.039 --> 00:32:48.720
you have something on the tip of your

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.159
penis

00:32:50.159 --> 00:32:51.919
and you're actively trying to have

00:32:51.919 --> 00:32:54.640
better sex

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.399
it's just a weird there is definitely a

00:32:56.399 --> 00:32:58.159
sexual element to just being on you all

00:32:58.159 --> 00:32:59.279
day because it's definitely what's

00:32:59.279 --> 00:33:00.720
causing your semis you have something

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.640
kind of like yeah you got brushed up the

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.480
tip of your dick's getting brushed

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.760
but it's also protecting it from

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.200
snugging it's snug dude when you first

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.799
put it when you first put it on it's

00:33:08.799 --> 00:33:10.480
like your dick disappears because you

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.840
don't realize how much it's rubbing and

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.279
touching stuff until you block it and

00:33:13.279 --> 00:33:14.960
you're walking you're like i can't feel

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.880

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.480
crazy that's gotta be nice

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.880
it's actually really nice i might need

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.039
to uh chuck one on those two free ones

00:33:23.039 --> 00:33:25.600
yeah i gotta be certain absolutely

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.600
certain it's not one you wore no i

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.279

i've never

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.079
i'll tell you what one one bad thing

00:35:52.079 --> 00:35:54.000
about manhood canada is when you're

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.480
putting it on and making eye contact

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.720
with your friend that's a real weird

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.040
moment

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.359
yeah man that you heard that velcro

00:36:03.359 --> 00:36:04.720

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.839
watching she's watching the [ __ ]

00:36:05.839 --> 00:36:08.240
vampire diaries and she just hears

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.920
she looks at me and goes damn you guys

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.920
are still watching vamp diaries it's

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.680
over she she finished it you guys are

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.040
back on your [ __ ] you're back on the

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.800
bus you back on your [ __ ] with that

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.119
vampire diaries finished it dude so

00:36:19.119 --> 00:36:20.720
this isn't so hard so the vampire

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.160
diaries is the original show and then

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.520
you have the spin-off the originals

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.839
right so the originals are these

00:36:25.839 --> 00:36:27.520
thousand-year-old vampires they're the

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.280
original vampires those are mom's a

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.079
witch and started vampire dog just

00:36:32.079 --> 00:36:34.640
hold on it gets funnier get this

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.640
so apparently they're these and they all

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.480
have like british accents and [ __ ] but

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.760
they were turned into vampires in

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:44.480
mystic mystic falls which is in virginia

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.720
according to the show

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.480
but they're european and they're a

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.880
thousand years old but somehow they got

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.960
turned into vampires in america in

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.880
virginia

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.200
a thousand years ago as white

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.599
european vampires so i'm watching this

00:36:59.599 --> 00:37:01.599
at the finale and i'm like wait a second

00:37:01.599 --> 00:37:03.440
this is in [ __ ] virginia i was like

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:04.720
that's what and i was like this this

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.960
whole thing makes zero [ __ ] sense

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.960
like stat actually they were vikings

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.480
like they didn't there was no white

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.400
vikings and then like as soon as they

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.760
get turned into vampires they just like

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.760
run away and their own they like stumble

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.839
upon like castles with people like hello

00:37:17.839 --> 00:37:19.359
who are you

00:37:19.359 --> 00:37:21.119
from virginia she's like will they

00:37:21.119 --> 00:37:22.960
traveled with like boats and stuff and

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.880
it's like your whole show this is all

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.520
based off of a huge plot hole

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.320
hilarious yeah including vampires no

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.480
dude i mean oh she's a witch

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.560
and witches

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.160
but yeah no you're right that would have

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.599
bothered the [ __ ] out of me that would

00:37:37.599 --> 00:37:38.560
have definitely been the one thing

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.079
pretty much i can't watch it's like wait

00:37:40.079 --> 00:37:41.520
they're a thousand-year-old they're from

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.440
virginia and they're white yeah and they

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.599
have english accents yeah and they're

00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:47.760
vikings with english accents but you

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.520
could say does it show them while

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:50.960
they're in virginia

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.640
just shows them in present day it shows

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.240
them and it shows them living back then

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.920
and they're in like little like huts and

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.520
they're like vikings and [ __ ] it makes

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.599
no [ __ ] sense

00:37:59.599 --> 00:38:01.280
they [ __ ] up they lit because the show

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.040
was a vampire diaries that started in

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.480
virginia it was in virginia so they were

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.280
like

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.800
fine the originals come from virginia

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.880
too but the head writer [ __ ] up ah

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.920
they could have just came from [ __ ]

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.680
belgium maybe nothing would have been

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.240
yeah but the shows for retards yeah i

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.680
mean so it doesn't matter the vampire

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.680
soap opera it's a vampire soap opera so

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.240
historical and geographical inaccuracies

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.760
i mean that's a pretty glaring one to be

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.119
like they're thousand-year-old vampires

00:38:23.119 --> 00:38:25.040
is it glaring from virginia is it

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.560
glaring and it took me a [ __ ] whole

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.320
season to figure it out

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.400
is it glaring it took me 22 hours one of

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.920
the smarter viewers i'd like to think so

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.680
it says a lot i'm sure if i showed it if

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.040
i i'm sure if i showed it to a couple

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.560
broads i know

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.480
they would have zero problem with that

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.880
inaccuracy she goes stop saying and

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:08.720
the way people reacted to it was a

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.559
little odd the movie

first one was kind of funny

00:59:16.559 --> 00:59:17.520

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:01.599
expanding consciousness where i was in

01:00:01.599 --> 01:00:03.359

watching it and i was like all right

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.559
whatever whatever and then at the very

01:00:14.559 --> 01:00:16.480
end when uh

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.960
king killmonger i was i didn't want to

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.480

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:21.839

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.720
king killmonger

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.480
was it i mean the storyline could have

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.160
been sick

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.760
it was the most intricate storyline of

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.359
the lord had some blood in there and

01:00:33.359 --> 01:00:34.559
some violence i know they would have

01:00:34.559 --> 01:00:36.000
made a billion dollars of things how

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.599
about the girls like fighting their

01:00:37.599 --> 01:00:40.079
boyfriends and the girls the men part

01:00:40.079 --> 01:00:41.839
was a little [ __ ] lame yeah i'd

01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:44.319
rather watch uh timothy chamelet or

01:00:44.319 --> 01:00:46.319
whatever get [ __ ] blood pounded by

01:00:46.319 --> 01:00:48.559
army hammer than watch that [ __ ] again

01:00:48.559 --> 01:00:50.720
i'd rather watch timothy come into a

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:54.000
[ __ ] peach and watch old army eat it

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.599
which is [ __ ] insane that they put

01:00:55.599 --> 01:00:57.920
that on that's just [ __ ] insane

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.319
but uh the very end when he's like

01:01:00.319 --> 01:01:02.319
killmonger got stabbed

01:01:02.319 --> 01:01:04.880

[ __ ] comic book movie

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.280

01:01:55.839 --> 01:01:56.960
like

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.960
you know it'd be funny if like there was

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.480
just like that white pilot in there but

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.760
like yeah you know the nigerians had a

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.280
pretty good slave trade going on there

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.799
for a while yeah yeah he's like you know

01:02:04.799 --> 01:02:06.319
the irish were slaves too right they're

01:02:06.319 --> 01:02:08.400
like

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:09.440
yeah that's usually what happens that's

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.960
always whenever i see that i'm like yeah

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.640
you know totally you know

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.559
that's why people's fault but it was a

01:02:14.559 --> 01:02:16.640
little it was a conspiracy of many doing

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:18.799
that and it's like i don't know that

01:02:18.799 --> 01:02:20.319
this is an age-old thing but it's kind

01:02:20.319 --> 01:02:21.200
of like

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.559
i'd rather die and it's like yeah man

01:02:22.559 --> 01:02:24.160
it's cool i'm glad you know i'd [ __ ]

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.599
think i'd like to think i'd jump off of

01:02:25.599 --> 01:02:27.359
a slave ship too but

01:02:27.359 --> 01:02:28.640

wanted to hell no i'm not gonna get

01:02:29.839 --> 01:02:31.760
eaten by a shark i'd be on there like

i'm gonna get out of here this will

01:02:32.799 --> 01:02:34.000
probably be a couple years or so and

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.480
i'll be going oh man there's to jump off

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:39.280
a slave ship you'd have to be

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.440
that'd be [ __ ] to just die at sea

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.920
that sucks true that i'd rather go i'd

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:46.240

were from africa

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.760

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.920
not a lot of circus bulls not until the

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.240
[ __ ] sub-saharan muslims yeah that's

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.400
true

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:17.039
muslims came in starting to talk slaves

like if just someone showed up at your

01:03:31.839 --> 01:03:32.960

lads being around when i was younger i'm

01:05:38.799 --> 01:05:40.000

we were young we we still had polox

01:05:42.559 --> 01:05:44.720

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.319
they lads uh

01:05:46.319 --> 01:05:48.400
i'm talking like 70s not that we were

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.000
young during that i think they were more

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.880
out west 70s 80s i think we had like you

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.200

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.359
yeah you used eastern block [ __ ]

01:05:57.359 --> 01:06:00.559
noodles yeah yeah and then uh 80s 90s i

01:06:00.559 --> 01:06:02.240
think the lads

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.480
made a good run yeah man

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:05.920

in thoughts of suicide yeah so it's like

01:23:48.639 --> 01:23:50.480
it's not that crazy to think sorts of

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:52.159
thoughts of shooting up a school if a

01:23:52.159 --> 01:23:53.520
