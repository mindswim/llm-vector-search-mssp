00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.319
down here

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.560
we came down coming down the street oh

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.319
there was this like a six year old dude

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.840
smoking a blunt with his dog and his

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.280

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.360
these guys these guys were divvying it

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.720

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.479
the deal that was doesn't matter if it's

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.479
16 billion or 16 cents apparently i

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:19.759

married her she was six

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:03.839
okay

00:39:03.839 --> 00:39:05.599
so he got a little ball you get for a

00:39:05.599 --> 00:39:07.119
six six year old that's like buying

00:39:07.119 --> 00:39:08.560
penny stocks dude you're buying when you

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.760
[ __ ] wait

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.680
you [ __ ] let it blossom

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.160
oh blossom wasn't the word i wanted well

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.520
i don't know buying what do i think

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.200
about buying a six-year-old to be my

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.240
wife

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.599
i don't think it's good if that's my

00:39:19.599 --> 00:39:21.920
honest opinion yeah that's not good dude

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.200
however

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.119
i could see the utility behind that for

00:39:25.119 --> 00:39:25.839
me

00:39:25.839 --> 00:39:27.599
i could definitely see like i mean

00:39:27.599 --> 00:39:28.960
that's locking down snizz on another

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.480
level because he already had another

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.440
wife and he's like all right i'm going

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.040
to need [ __ ] anyways

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.079
yeah

00:39:34.079 --> 00:39:35.520
you got to keep that thing going dude we

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.440
had to keep that train going yeah

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.640

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.000
harem dude and stop abducting hot

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.119
six-year-olds it's like the whole thing

00:39:41.119 --> 00:39:42.720
goes off the [ __ ] wheels

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:45.200
that's what happened so when he died his

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.240
[ __ ]

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.000

raised on this yeah since we were young

00:43:23.599 --> 00:43:25.119
it's true

00:43:25.119 --> 00:43:26.880
now it's come to fruition

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.760
because the prophet muhammad

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.760
to kill all after he [ __ ] a

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.000
nine-year-old we believe him

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.160
it is funny they're like yeah he waited

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.880
yeah if if a priest [ __ ] a kid in

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.040
catholicism i mean granted they shift

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.319
him around a little bit and try to hide

00:43:42.319 --> 00:43:45.760
him but no one's worshiping him

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.079
true

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.000
mohammed's getting some followers he's

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.760
got something he's gained he's got a

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.680
strong social media presence his his

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.760
twitter would be 1.3 billion yeah his

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.160
twitter is strong it is despite the

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.240
scout well he's like woody allen

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.280
