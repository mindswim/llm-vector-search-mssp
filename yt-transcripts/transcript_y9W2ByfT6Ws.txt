00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:25.000
[ __ ] scarf now you're looking at two

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.360
weeks later quite a different way to

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.250
that [ __ ] cowboy hat maybe a [ __ ]

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.440
pencil man it may be Austin's just the

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.209
place for you you know maybe New York

00:11:34.209 --> 00:11:36.399
just isn't but I don't like about Austin

00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:38.980
is there there I think that's one of the

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:42.190
my favorite students they're snobs about

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.560
their anti cowboy hat they're too

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.079
progressive meaning but in my view it's

00:11:47.079 --> 00:11:49.329
the greatest had ever made they should

00:11:49.329 --> 00:11:52.240
take back the Hat the cowboy hats get a

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.730
bad rap because I think like some of the

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.199
stupidest things ever said have been

00:11:56.199 --> 00:11:57.860
said while wearing one

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.680
I had itself is brilliant everyone looks

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.600
good wearing one that's not true that's

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.610
I do think it's true not everybody looks

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:05.870
good wearing I would like a make-a-wish

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.510
kid wearing a cowboy hat yeah Mike would

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:13.940

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.519

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:19.910

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.270

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.960
[Applause]

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.700
I used to argue a lot when all the

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.040
anti-bullying campaign Mike used to go

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.720
shucks and driving schools telling that

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.790
story yeah we we bullied that each other

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.560
just flipped like sports and [ __ ] we did

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.650
a lot of hate yeah I'm sure I bullied

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:13.990
somebody in my life but my thing is uh I

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.420
think I'm not saying you should be a

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.340
bully I'd be mortified if my kid was the

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.630
bully in something or whatever you know

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:22.450
yeah and I never intentionally went out

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:25.480
to bully someone with that mindset but I

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.550
think there's a place in the ecosystem

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:28.720
for bullies like it teaches you

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.860
something absolutely

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.720
like when I stuck up to somebody who I

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.940
was nervous that was coming at me when I

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.710
stuck up to somebody for myself but that

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.930
was like that's a thing Jacob you

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:39.760

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.990

guy freaked out after he saw blood and

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.320
what's best is Jacob told him he goes in

over the top there's a couple of those

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.780
like the William Hung that just came in

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.360
but people thought Ben genuinely

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.640
believed they had something going on I

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.830
think the ones that are actually that

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:19.310

they snap we have is this the blonde

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.330

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:34.110
of just talking about your name is Mary

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:36.240

someone who's batshit and immediately

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:46.710

as we kept spiraling further and further

00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:33.510
up the steps someone had to come stand

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:35.940
in our spot or else we'd lose our spot

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:38.760
under the the eye of the giant Miller

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:41.910

00:54:17.819 --> 00:54:20.220
Indianapolis odd town real weird town I

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:23.310

00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:26.160
world's oldest bar there in Indianapolis

00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:28.650

00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:36.630
Midwest yeah it is odd Indianapolis is

00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:38.220
but the first time I ever went there

00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:41.270
there was an epidemic they called it

00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:44.730
epidemic of people from the viral video

00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:46.619
of showing how cold it is outside you

00:54:46.619 --> 00:54:48.780
could boil water oh yeah take it outside

00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:51.089
and throw it and before it really leaves

00:54:51.089 --> 00:54:52.710
the pot it'll evaporate just kind of

00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:54.740
turns to dust almost it looks like and

00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:57.359
there was they were being flooded in

00:54:57.359 --> 00:54:58.740
emergency rooms of people doing that as

00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:00.310
a prank like boiling

00:55:00.310 --> 00:55:01.660

00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:04.570

there it went up and some of it turned

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:43.110

00:55:44.490 --> 00:55:47.890

especially for the guys that show up I

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:07.990
guess they don't have a radio sitting

anymore but they show up for the actual

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:12.040
draft itself so I thought that there was

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:13.000
a chance that I was gonna be a

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.280
first-round pick but there was no way in

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:16.240
hell that I wasn't to show up to the

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:16.660
draft

Purdue in our press box watching the

01:04:49.690 --> 01:04:52.180
draft no cameras there to embarrass them

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:54.670

01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:57.280
media - oh yeah yeah social media it

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:00.150

the game and he has the fans so coached

01:05:36.290 --> 01:05:39.080

some respect for that's cool Andrew Luck

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:01.460
is just I mean they kept the legacy of

01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:05.690
ugly quarterback he looks doofy as all

01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:10.340

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:22.250

he's got the face of a middle linebacker

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.810
but you know what you look at a lot of

01:06:38.810 --> 01:06:40.040
those quarterbacks when they first got

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.480
in the league they're like oh man that

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:43.160
guy came in pretty rough and then they

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.920
as they get I guess they get paid they

skanks it really wrap is a younger man's

01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:13.850
game you're not really supposed to be in

01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:16.700
old Tommy I mean like when you watch

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:19.580
them like [ __ ] wheelbarrow out the

01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:25.610
Sugar Hill Gang or something DMC I think

01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:26.780
what happens you get older and you

01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:28.370
realize you're not gonna get a mansion

01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:36.740
and a bunch of [ __ ] when you have all

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:38.870
the stuff though too it's it's hard to

01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:40.670
stay hungry that's why I said I think

01:09:40.670 --> 01:09:46.400
young poor people make good music when

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.810
you first start to get money you can

01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:49.070
still make good music cuz you're hungry

01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:50.810
to kind of keep that thing but a

01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:53.780
comfortable wealthy clean and sober

01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:56.450
sober forty five year old yeah sobriety

01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:58.070
killed happens bright the second battle

01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:00.200
music it's the same exact and I'm a

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:03.110
fireplace with a large but not crazy

01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:11.030
sized television but you know with roll

01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:13.670
down Windows it's just like players they

01:10:13.670 --> 01:10:16.010
always have their doing okay okay bad

01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:17.510
season but then when it's contract time

01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:21.590
best season of their life everyone hit a

01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:24.080
catch you go for because I'm laying my

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.720
body out for this I tell Mike that

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.220
stairs that was one of the most

01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:30.680
interesting perspective to have all you

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:34.850
got blindsided by Ray Lewis and me and

01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:36.710
you were friends are at that point and I

01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:38.090
was the first time I ever felt that III

01:10:38.090 --> 01:10:40.010
become friends with a couple UFC

01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:42.410
fighters now over time and watching that

01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:44.150
same thing when you have a stake in the

01:10:44.150 --> 01:10:44.780
game

01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:47.000
and Aaron your lovely wife is here i sat

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.440
with her to gain before when you know

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:50.300
you were down for a second and pop back

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.070
up but what an emotional roller coaster

01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:54.230
you know somebody in it like he's down

01:10:54.230 --> 01:10:54.710
he goes

01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:56.980
he's down it's like that means okay okay

01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:59.510
Luis got you holding a hot dog of being

01:10:59.510 --> 01:11:01.400
sad for his Jerry Maguire whole new

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:04.250
meaning I guess I guess you could say

01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:07.190
this is another sanchez story I ran a

01:11:07.190 --> 01:11:09.800
little slant route right at an NFL

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.679
legend the ball was coming my way it

01:11:12.679 --> 01:11:17.869
came oh boy was that save Jess

01:11:17.869 --> 01:11:22.880
that was my buddy Sanchez it was but I

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.860
remember you came to the comic strip one

01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:26.510
night I was like dude I got to ask you

01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:28.849
and I go the impressive part of it all I

01:11:28.849 --> 01:11:30.889
prefaced with you were back the next

01:11:30.889 --> 01:11:31.340
play

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:33.289
I think you draft the one play and then

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:35.210
just came the next play but it was such

01:11:35.210 --> 01:11:37.190
a vicious hit and he was right back held

01:11:37.190 --> 01:11:38.659
on to the ball didn't drop the ball and

01:11:38.659 --> 01:11:39.920
everything I was like that was great and

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:42.020
he was like it wasn't that bad let you

01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:45.020
go now man come on Ray Lewis because a

01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:52.610
murderer playing with the aggression

01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:57.530
that every day is a gift and he decided

01:11:57.530 --> 01:11:59.420
you know what was like he goes it looked

01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:00.530
worse than it was ago

01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:03.260
come on man and soon his sweat it was a

01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:07.520
good hit you know what's so funny is the

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.139
next year in the year after that you

01:12:09.139 --> 01:12:11.090
after that every urine training camp

01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:12.829
every team has an official that comes

01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:14.690
into the locker room and goes over the

01:12:14.690 --> 01:12:16.670
new year's rules this is an illegal hit

01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:19.190
this is a legal hit this right here is

01:12:19.190 --> 01:12:22.340
your example of your ideal hit and I

01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:26.360
became the damn poster boy all my

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:28.250
teammates I'm sitting there just hunched

01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:33.559

reel for the rest your lineup you guys

01:12:34.699 --> 01:12:37.309
like look at the beauty of that perfect

01:12:37.309 --> 01:12:39.949
timing to me everything

01:12:39.949 --> 01:12:41.870
in shoulder pads right below his

01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:44.510
shoulder pads body crumbled up into a

01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:50.900
ball dominating a protein bar oh it was

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:54.110
fine it's fine football man whatever it

01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:56.810
was on that fateful day

01:12:56.810 --> 01:12:58.429
[Music]

01:12:58.429 --> 01:13:01.790
the frozen tundra of meadow Lois men

you thought you'd done huh no no

01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:11.120
honestly it looked a lot worse not just

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.610
that not just that hit yeah so the next

01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:15.770
day you have a little workout that's not

01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:17.719
too much and we have to kind of jog some

01:13:17.719 --> 01:13:20.210
hundreds 100 yards and your body just

01:13:20.210 --> 01:13:21.800
beat the hell down you're sitting there

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:28.160
and it's like laughable you're like but

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:30.170
you you get through it I don't know your

01:13:30.170 --> 01:13:32.090
training kit must it must it all comes

01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:33.380
together the first time you in front of

01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:35.000
the crowd and stuff I assume it's gonna

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.610
be unlike anything Judy the reaction of

01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:39.320
something you do just setting a place

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:42.830
off like that's gotta be the comedy on

01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:44.120
there well I guess Kevin Hart figured

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.830
that out somehow but the rest of us

01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:46.190
won't

01:13:46.190 --> 01:13:48.650
that's football stadium comedy I don't

01:13:48.650 --> 01:13:50.900
know if I made for it I think it's on

01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:56.120
the front row the other side of the

01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:59.540
football field intimate comedy at

01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:02.360
Lincoln Financial Stadium it's open mic

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:04.699
night I I stood on the sidelines at a

01:14:04.699 --> 01:14:07.040
Pats Dolphins game and and Zach Thomas

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:10.850
put a hit on on Bledsoe and it was just

01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:12.739
the sound of a professional football hit

01:14:12.739 --> 01:14:13.880
was [ __ ] it sounded like a car

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:15.830
accident ya know and it's just so wild

01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:17.780
to like they would get up right after

01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:19.219
the play and just shake it off go into

01:14:19.219 --> 01:14:21.080
the huddle I'm just like Jesus [ __ ]

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:22.850

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:31.670
doing this and I was a little bit

01:14:31.670 --> 01:14:35.060
hesitant my biggest hesitation was you

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:36.560
asking me too many football questions I

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:37.790
mean having no damn clue what you're

01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:40.460

work and be surprised how much they

01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:49.190
appreciate it I would guess that

01:14:49.190 --> 01:14:51.080
everybody in this room right now watches

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.489
a little bit more football than I do

01:14:52.489 --> 01:14:55.040
I just watch the Eagles they just watch

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:56.510

they changed their changing rules to

01:15:30.530 --> 01:15:32.179
something I really understand that Clay

01:15:32.179 --> 01:15:35.510
Matthews came through and got three

01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:39.409
sacks on who was Alex Smith in the

01:15:39.409 --> 01:15:41.570
Redskins game three clean Alex Smith

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:43.340
holding the ball still when he hits the

01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:43.730
ground

01:15:43.730 --> 01:15:45.409
they threw flag roughing the passer

01:15:45.409 --> 01:15:47.030
three to all three times ago

01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:50.000
you can't second I don't know what the

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.409
call is that makes no sense if you bring

01:15:51.409 --> 01:15:53.659
a footage that Christine at all when

01:15:53.659 --> 01:15:54.620
someone took a break over they were

01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:56.870
talking football well we can't get any

01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:57.800
thought license saying we'll be around

01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.600
if you keep in touch with a bunch of the

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:00.530
guys you used to play with

01:16:00.530 --> 01:16:02.960

can I'm my days are filled up mostly

01:16:05.150 --> 01:16:06.290
with the kids and that's why probably

01:16:06.290 --> 01:16:08.480
why I don't see so much football cuz

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:09.440

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:11.719

01:16:11.719 --> 01:16:15.949

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:18.739
anything interviewer stuff and

01:16:18.739 --> 01:16:20.270
everything in the stories now go down

01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:22.400
you got such a better story than four

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:23.420
touchdowns in one game

01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:25.340
