the white house and get like a

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.960
a fresh start because we don't want any

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.800
on to the next question who's the

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.120

i'd be a

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.320

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.400
an olympics video game that i play with

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.400

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.920
physical appearance i'm never gonna get

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.680
this close in a video game again with a

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.000
creative fighter see i get like when i

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.319
it's like when i get the bangs kind of

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.440
binocularing my world i get real forlorn

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.280
yeah dude i get real like sean hunter

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.360
vibes dude i just get kind of like

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.239
dude

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.080
it's paranoia inducing too like

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.280
constantly having something in your

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.400
peripheral

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.159
like like your hair like every like

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:57.680
every now and again a movement will just

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.200
like pop your hair what the [ __ ] is over

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.560
there yes you're [ __ ] you know yeah i

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.599
don't like dealing with that all day

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:02.799
long my biggest problem is when i get

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.599
sweaty and i like one piece of hair will

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.840
scorpion tip into my eyeball yep that's

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.760
pretty unpleasant yeah that stinks other

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.760
than that it's all compliments yeah man

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.120
i mean people get pumped on it but it's

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.640
just like it was if it was long enough

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.079
to pony i would have ponied it and kept

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.120
it pushing

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.479
but it's like it wasn't long enough the

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:19.919
pony and i said i need to be high and

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.000
tight right now yeah and you might get

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.960
really you know what would be cool is

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.320
getting really skinny and having a

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.400
ponytail and it's just like never

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.840
getting in the sun letting your skin get

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.960
a little bit gray maybe get some

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.120
wireframe glasses that might be cool

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.560
like a whale man you're talking about

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.560
becoming like a whale man oh whale man

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.000
yeah you go to schools and talk about

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.639
whales to school

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.800
we had a whale man in our school that's

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.880
exactly what this guy did

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.479
word on the street i was using like a

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.280
velcro bracelet

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.520
multiple multiple uh rubber bands in the

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.440
ponytail yeah that's well man status

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.919
being high and tight

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.919
and just kind of keeping it low key

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.400

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.080

giggle and not fart

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.279
it's impossible true

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:01.040
it's also nice though to slide in some

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.200
giggling and then go full stern daddy

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.519

00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:46.959
if a guy came up to you and was like yo

00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:49.040
can we talk yeah he's like look i want

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.200
to be weird but i've been strictly

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.880
masturbating to your wife for the last

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.720
three years i just want to let you know

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.720
i don't hold this in and then they try

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.399
to be like there's nothing you can do

00:11:58.399 --> 00:11:59.600
about it so you're just going to have to

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.279
deal ooh that part i don't how do you

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:03.200
fight that battle though oh man until he

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.480
says there's nothing you can do about it

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.320
i might be like oh dude i'm so glad that

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.000
my wife and i could do that for you but

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.760
until when he goes like and there's

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.600
nothing you do about it i might try to

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.160
pull his head off really yeah i think

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.000
you need to resort to something else

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.360
what do you mean you have to engage him

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.440
on it on that level

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.040
just hold his dick i would throw acid in

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.519
my wife's face

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.720
you have to find people he loves and

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.399
cares about and get him back so he'd be

00:12:34.399 --> 00:12:35.760
like that's cool man well he's probably

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.760
not married so what no i would i would

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.959
grab siblings

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:40.639
mom you know you could yeah just grab

00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:41.760

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.040
my dick

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.399
so now every time she's he's

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:46.639
masturbating like he can't not have me

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:48.320
in that whoa

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.600
no he could block you it's his [ __ ]

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.880

00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:12.639
like oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] this is the best he

00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:14.240
could fight fire with fire pull this

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.959
trick in the boat

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.720
because if he closes his eyes it's just

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.839
a butterly down there

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.720
yeah that's a tricky that's a tricky

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.160
thing to you can't really do anything

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.000
about it

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.760
like if i were to call the president and

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.720
be like

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.120
i'm masturbating to your wife

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.880
do you think i would get like

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.240
you think they would come to me come at

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.680
me or they'd be like totally within your

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.040
right

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.040
god damn dude this is a first amendment

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.279
issue yeah this is this is a 69th

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:45.680
amendment issue

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.959
it's tough i mean how do you take it if

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:49.760
someone would be like yo man

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.519
you probably your first instinct might

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:53.040
be the high five but then you'd stop

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.320
yourself and like hold on a second i

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.720
think i feel challenged right now yeah

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.079
but it would be yeah that's kind of

00:13:58.079 --> 00:13:59.519
strange

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:00.959
so it would just be weird if someone

00:14:00.959 --> 00:14:02.800
shared that with you'd have to be like

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.160
all right like

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.600
like what are we talking like handy's

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.959

look i don't want to start any trouble

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.480
but i've been masturbating to this

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.040
exclusively exclusively to images i hold

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.519
in my head of your wife dude my [ __ ]

00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:32.880
i don't know

i don't know if i should name anyone's

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.000
names in here uh

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.920
a guy i'm related to told me that uh

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.959
when he was married to this lady one of

00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:46.240
his friends came to his job

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.639
to let him know he said hey man i just

00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:50.800
need you to know this and i just need to

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.920
be upfront with you i'm in love with

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.360
your wife

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.519
respectable and i think they like

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:57.360
nothing had happened yet he was just

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.440
declaring his intentions like i'm just

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.480
so you know i'm in love with you he told

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.160
him he had a rival

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.760
that was commonplace back in the day

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.279
you'd be like you'd find the woman you

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:06.720
wanted and you'd find out who your

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.240
rivals were and you'd confront them just

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.000
so you know i you have a rival in her

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.600
love and it's me

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.360
you just go about like showing her who

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.040
was bawling harder and who was better

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.560
yeah wow and you would like sneak away

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.120
to bring that back yeah dude i booked

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.800
zanoni talks about it

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.760
fair [ __ ] the fair lady has a forget

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.839
her name but she has like tons of

00:15:25.839 --> 00:15:27.519
suitors and rivals

00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:29.120
dude dudes must have one like someone

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.360
trades her [ __ ] [ __ ] back

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.480
sorry

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.639
i i agree i totally that makes sense

00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:36.000
like someone traded her for a pig

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.240
because i by the point like at one point

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.440
dudes are just gonna run out of money

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.959
trying to get that [ __ ]

00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:41.920
yeah

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.160
yeah i mean you need to have like a your

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.639
grandfather would just amass wealth so

00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:49.440
that you could just be like

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.880
beat some dude to get a [ __ ] getting

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.639
[ __ ] was like making rap videos back

00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:54.399
then i was like that ain't their [ __ ]

00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:56.079
that's all rented

00:15:56.079 --> 00:15:57.920
they gotta give that back

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.839
i mean wasn't it all arranged like you

00:15:59.839 --> 00:16:01.440
know someone found another agreeable

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.279
household true but like you still have

00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:05.360
to stun on the girl and her dad because

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.399
that would like towards especially

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:08.240
towards like the girls dads used to have

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.920
to like save up to get their daughter

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.920
[ __ ] depends naturally depends on the

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.040
baby

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.800
depends on the babe i don't know if it's

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.199
like a slam and babe you gotta talk i

00:16:17.199 --> 00:16:18.720
think it all took a back seat to like

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.360
making sure your family got hooked up

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.360
yeah but it's also like whoever's kind

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.040
of come whoever's there's a lot of it

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.519
too would be like going into

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:28.959
you want to kind of like

00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:30.480
use your daughter to link you into a

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.160
sick family which

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.920
yeah that's gotta be i mean you know you

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.199
get people who are like i need a son

00:16:35.199 --> 00:16:36.959
it's like well maybe we should start

00:16:36.959 --> 00:16:38.720
being a little more conscious of how we

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.240
wed our daughters and

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.680

00:16:57.279 --> 00:16:58.560
like now you can have a neck tattoo and

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.320
it's like you know

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.759
that's a bad example

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:04.240
i hear what you're saying

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.240

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.480
close to whatever you do

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.760
if you're a [ __ ] with a neck would you

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.959
rather have like a [ __ ] with a neck

00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:12.720
tattoo or like a dude who's really about

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.600
it with a neck tattoo

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.199
yeah you can't i mean you [ __ ] with a

00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:18.559
neck tattoo it's tough you spend a lot

00:17:18.559 --> 00:17:19.760
of time like there's probably a lot of

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.199
dudes listen to this that don't have

00:17:21.199 --> 00:17:23.600
kids you spend a lot of time like

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.600
just hoping that if you ever were cursed

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.720
with a daughter that she doesn't get

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.480
wrapped up with any like

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.799
bad business dudes but like it's so much

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:33.200
worse imagining them with like a [ __ ]

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.919
yeah a wormy [ __ ] dork

00:17:35.919 --> 00:17:37.520
that would be brutal how would you stop

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.039
a bad business dude have you thought

00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:41.520
about this if a bad business dude it's a

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.039
it's it's quicksand the harder the

00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:44.720
harder you try the worse it's gonna get

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.720
for sure really yeah no i know what you

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.520
do you you you you befriend him

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.679
and start inviting him to help you do

00:17:51.679 --> 00:17:53.360
[ __ ] around the house like heavy you're

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.039
talking about grant you're gran torino

00:17:55.039 --> 00:17:57.280

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.720
yeah you're gonna grant me wait sid

00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.840
what's your strategy there are you

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.600
straightening him out like are you are

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.120
you giving him some structure or are you

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.480
trying to wear him out so he can't [ __ ]

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.679
your daughter

00:18:05.679 --> 00:18:06.400
well

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.160
he's so tired

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.280
and he just can't lay it down

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:14.640
well i mean you know in theory the kind

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.480
of stuff that he'd be doing like my kids

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.640
would have been seen been doing growing

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.480
up and when he quits they're gonna be

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.640
like oh what a [ __ ] yeah okay

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.559
i would say

00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:26.480
fair point i would say uh hire private

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.360
eye

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.880
and you'll catch them doing still fight

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.080
like cheat or something you catch them

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.120
cheating

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.400
yeah but when a girl's going to do like

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.240
that cheating is almost cool yeah you

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.679
you don't want to build something that

00:18:35.679 --> 00:18:38.320
they have to work on and change

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.600
yeah i guess yeah i guess you're right

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.799
yeah

00:18:40.799 --> 00:18:42.480
because like the more the more horrible

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.679
[ __ ] that you find during him doing like

00:18:45.679 --> 00:18:46.799
the more

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:50.160
he changed for her eventually when she

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.840
figures out how to make him stop being

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.400
that person yeah dude i saw uh

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.919
this is also the more complicated you

00:18:55.919 --> 00:18:57.520
make the situation like

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.200
there's nothing that a girl who's into

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.200
that type of dude wants more than like a

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.960
driveway confrontation that all the

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.720
neighbors see like when you're putting

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.720
on the [ __ ] show and people are like

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.240
holding you back while you scream and

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.400
point at someone your your daughter's

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.880
just getting so moist she's so wet

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.919
that's true

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:16.960
yeah you can stop guys stop stop

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.200
again this is crazy yeah man

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.280
yeah it's a [ __ ] i'm just gonna have

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.440
him in the backyard picking up oddly

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.200
shaped boulders grunting weird he's

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.720
gonna be like [ __ ] awful man i'm not

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.000
doing this [ __ ] no he's gonna have

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.280
to contend with my jujitsu that's what

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:29.840
level of playing house you have to get

when you rift the the playing house

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.559

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.000

they get like super butt length hair

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.840

cheeks and went to bed

00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:39.120

went below her butt

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.960
out of control female libido

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.679

today today yeah man i guess it's cheap

00:27:02.559 --> 00:27:04.240
haircut when i remember when i was a kid

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.159
like the day you got a haircut was

00:27:06.159 --> 00:27:08.880
probably the worst you could ever look

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.080
and then they could give it like three

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.080
or four days maybe like a week i think

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.520
they covered this on boy meets world and

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.440
your fly sale yeah you had like one good

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.679
hair day and then it was too long yeah

00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:19.200
it was just cheap haircuts that's all it

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.799
was yeah i should go this lady's been

00:27:20.799 --> 00:27:23.279
cutting my hair for for a long time yeah

00:27:23.279 --> 00:27:25.039
when you get a haircut in the black it's

00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:27.039
the next next day your haircut is like

00:27:27.039 --> 00:27:28.399
the best of it so you gotta kind of

00:27:28.399 --> 00:27:30.000
chill yeah because on the first day it's

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.679
like almost too sharp you can still see

00:27:31.679 --> 00:27:32.880
like the lines

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.399
i've seen that i've seen when people go

00:27:34.399 --> 00:27:36.159
like a little too well manicured yeah

00:27:36.159 --> 00:27:38.320
like whoa dude yeah you need one like

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.240
like a good one or two days to let it

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.440
like settle

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:45.200
yeah true what do you do in the meantime

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.480
i mean you just drag you just like

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.399
i mean i was never i'm a natural wave

00:27:50.399 --> 00:27:52.559
guy i never had to wear a do-rag my do

00:27:52.559 --> 00:27:53.440
people

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.440
hate can you explain what that means to

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.120
people who might not know yeah it's like

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.559
so when you brush your hair forward as a

00:27:58.559 --> 00:28:00.159
black guy you get to find out whether or

00:28:00.159 --> 00:28:02.720
not you're a true g or not so if your

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.200
hair waves naturally

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.559
you're a true g if you have to wear a

00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:08.000
wave cap

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.080
oh so they're creating ripples yeah

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.039
that's why they're doing that dude it's

00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:15.039
crazy it's crazy how girly black dudes

00:28:15.039 --> 00:28:17.200
can get like why because you think it's

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.720
tough what about the dudes that like are

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.559
on the bus with like a wire brush just

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:22.640
like scraping their hair forward are

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.720
those dudes real or are those are they i

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.919
mean again they're trying to maintain

00:28:25.919 --> 00:28:27.200
something that happens naturally in my

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.200
hair i don't know i don't get it i don't

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.399
have to brush that much to get the

00:28:30.399 --> 00:28:31.520
weight so i thought it would i thought

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.039
they were wearing them just to look like

00:28:33.039 --> 00:28:34.480
method man you're telling me there's

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.159
like a prop there's like a thing with

00:28:36.159 --> 00:28:38.159
the hair so it's it's actually

00:28:38.159 --> 00:28:39.760
formulating those things it's the whole

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.600
process you got to have you got to use a

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.200
thick grease

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.120
right you put the thick grease on your

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.200
hair you brush it forward you put the

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.760
wave do rag on a wave cap right yeah and

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:53.120
then you just like the longer you uh

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.640
have it compressed under the the wave

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.600
cap

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.520
the the better the deeper your waves

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.440
have the potential to be damn right so

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.520
you they that's why you see people with

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.279
wave caps on all like dude rags on all

00:29:03.279 --> 00:29:04.960
the time true they're just trying to

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.559
like how come in how come they're

00:29:06.559 --> 00:29:08.640
they're never took off like a like a

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.880
trend where like i don't know rappers

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.799
are just like hood dudes were yanking

00:29:12.799 --> 00:29:15.520

doing something gay and if you were to

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.240

00:34:55.599 --> 00:34:57.040
dusty shelf in your brain and you're

he was kind of default and then it was

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.520
like you know you grabbed an ancient

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.280

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:40.800
chaos

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.720
we're going to be doing it together

becoming way more sexual when that

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.560
happens just being like

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.079
i think that's the move to go cutting

00:36:04.079 --> 00:36:06.160
your hair was the wrong move yeah true

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.560
it's hard to display sexuality at

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.040
another dude without something to whip

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.680
no i might go like full raging short

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.440
hair you should get lip injections this

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.760
might be the time to use your uh use

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.160
your feminine coming

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.280
true

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.560
yeah i mean it's something i have to

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.240
stop doing like i can't

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.640
i can't continue this path i'm on yeah

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.440
i'm too autistic too i've i i've never

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.119
been confident that i had a good read on

00:36:31.119 --> 00:36:33.200
a situation like that i always think i'm

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.040
reading it wrong oh i see it i see it

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.400
unless the dude makes

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.000
i've been like sucker punched i've been

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.520
like i think this guy has a problem with

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.599
me

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:43.200
sucking this problem for me is like what

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.720
i don't even care the fact that they're

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.160
like looking at hers they're doing it in

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.760
front of me so they're basically doing

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.440
it to me and i sit there and go you must

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.400
they've declared they've made a

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.160
declaration yeah just like dude what the

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.359
[ __ ] do you think this is they're

00:36:53.359 --> 00:36:54.400
suitors

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.680
they write they're right you're asking

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.599
for that all i do is just spaz and

00:36:57.599 --> 00:37:00.320
they're like what the [ __ ] is this

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.440
but yeah they're declaring their

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.520
intentions and you're flipping out it i

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.200
will say and i don't know what the

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.440
reality of this but i think when like if

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.960
you're like a 19 year old black dude and

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.640
like a [ __ ]

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:11.839
white guy

00:37:11.839 --> 00:37:13.359
spazzes

00:37:13.359 --> 00:37:15.280
it's just kind of like what the [ __ ]

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.720
what is this because we also have like

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.200
in black culture we we do look at chicks

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.119
butts unabashedly

00:37:21.119 --> 00:37:22.960
like staring at declaring you know what

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.760
i mean you're just looking yeah you know

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.000
it's like it's almost it's it's almost

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.760
more disrespectful if you walk through

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.599
that casino and black dude didn't look

00:37:31.599 --> 00:37:33.119
at britney's ass there's a there's a

00:37:33.119 --> 00:37:35.040
window though because if it's like a

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.280
glance whatever people do it to let you

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.760
know they're looking yeah like stop turn

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.920

like it's still time

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.200
it might be why there's so many duels

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:47.380
dude

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.119

deep in black culture i can't even say

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.320

see a [ __ ] black dude trying to kick

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
knowledge like it's always been my

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.760
achilles heel like that's the reason

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.440

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.240
like i'm in there immediately but that's

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.079
the prime that's the target audience for

00:40:28.079 --> 00:40:30.079
a black and smart t-shirt

00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:31.920

at it being like that's god that's kind

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.720
of weird that's a weird choice yeah i'm

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:39.040
black and smart doubt it

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.040
can you believe it yes

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.040
what the [ __ ] is that but you never seen

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.160
that before

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.440
yeah that was uh it was definitely

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.560
strange and i was in the way you know

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:47.920
she's in my way i had to like get like a

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:49.599
little yogurt packets for maya and i was

00:40:49.599 --> 00:40:51.119
sitting there like so i had time to like

00:40:51.119 --> 00:40:52.720
study this shirt and think about it i

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.119
want it to be like it's [ __ ] weird

00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:56.880
it's a weird thing to wear

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.720
so when you see people wear like money

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.640
shirts it's like that's you're poor

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.880
that's a poor poor thing to wear and

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.520
what how do you how do you prove that

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.720
like what do you like what do you i

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.240
should have iq tested her on the spot

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.680
right you should have let's see what's

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.760
up although iq tests are inherently

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:15.440
biased so true i would have done iq eq

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.560
sq

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.560
i would have done like emotional

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.560
q spiritual

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.079
quotient and then i tested her

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:23.119
physically

00:41:23.119 --> 00:41:24.720
i would have tested all aspects of her

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.640
intelligence

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.839
put the cones down like all right

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.240
six times nine okay

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.480
that would be the best part yeah

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.960
love game shows yeah what's funny is if

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.240
you're making anxious

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.240
shirts like black and agile you're like

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.480

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.440
and uh

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.880
you know this

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.559
is this is a girl operation they're all

00:47:38.559 --> 00:47:40.079
singing doing their thing

00:47:40.079 --> 00:47:42.240
uh brittany goes up does a song you know

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.319
and people are what's up

00:47:44.319 --> 00:47:46.000
i'm going down by mary j blige that's my

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.800
song she actually didn't she did journey

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.000
she did a journey i thought you know it

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.599
was a strategic move it was she's

00:47:51.599 --> 00:47:52.960
letting you know that she appreciates

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.400
how much how deep you're going into

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.000
black culture by doing that i think so

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.280
she also she also likes she like

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.760
genuinely likes you right yeah the um

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.200
but also yeah it was like there's like a

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.880
tight-knit group of friends so they're

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.079
all doing their songs together she i

00:48:04.079 --> 00:48:05.200
guess she did a song she was kind of

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.240
playing to the home crowd i guess a

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:07.119
little bit

00:48:07.119 --> 00:48:10.160
um these were primarily whites so we go

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:11.599
in there and

00:48:11.599 --> 00:48:13.599
you know people are kind of singing

00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:14.640
along with her but again they're like

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:15.920
strangers they don't really know her so

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.599
it's kind of like tepid

00:48:17.599 --> 00:48:18.800
they're afraid to sing all the n-word

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:19.599
songs

00:48:19.599 --> 00:48:22.319
dude so then her the other girl goes up

00:48:22.319 --> 00:48:25.359
and does cardi b and i go white girl yes

00:48:25.359 --> 00:48:28.000
i go oh it might be n-word time cause

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.680
i'm like that's a tough so you know

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.040
they've been drinking and [ __ ] so

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.240
brittany goes up and does it with her

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.200
dude

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.680
the first [ __ ] there's a song money

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.520
slips an n-word out this girl just lets

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:39.680
it just i guess she like let it she's

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.359
[ __ ] up let it fly she's charged by

00:48:41.359 --> 00:48:42.960
britney next to her i think so dude i

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.240
think she was just i mean she was just

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.599
in the moment dude she was lost she lost

00:48:45.599 --> 00:48:46.960
herself she lost herself in the music

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:47.760
dude

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.359
she probably puked through his mom's

00:48:49.359 --> 00:48:51.119
spaghetti this is her this was her

00:48:51.119 --> 00:48:52.880
moment and she [ __ ] slipped let one

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.559
fly everyone the whole place just goes

00:48:54.559 --> 00:48:56.400
it's like 12 people but everyone just

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.680
goes like

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:01.160
just look around

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.960
so then it's like you know and britney

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.960
was like whatever i'm like did she did

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:09.520
she somehow like not notice that and i'm

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.040
like whatever you know and again it's

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:12.400
it's got to stop it's going to suck to

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:13.920
like [ __ ] screech the brakes on the

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:15.520
whole party like what

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.040
so it's just kind of like whatever we're

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:18.640
singing everyone's having a good time

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.800
towards the end slips out another and i

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:21.839
was just like

00:49:21.839 --> 00:49:24.960
in song or conversation

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:26.960
before even

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:28.319
before you contend this can then this

00:49:28.319 --> 00:49:30.800
lady it is i'm not so i was just

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.640
reveling in how uncomfortable it was

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.200
it's difficult to self-edit in a song

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.200
and then keep up the rhythm of the fun

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:39.520
and the song after you like if you leave

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:42.000
out a word it's true it's not easy to do

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.079
no it's very hard and it's also that is

00:49:44.079 --> 00:49:45.440
the number one thing people say after

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.680
the n-word is what i can't have fun

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:50.000
without a lot of fun

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.839
i can't edit myself i was literally

00:49:51.839 --> 00:49:54.000
thinking about this on the when i parked

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.359
yeah right

00:49:55.359 --> 00:49:57.280
how funny it is because like like

00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:00.000
minorities always [ __ ] with white people

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.440
like all the time yeah they do it for me

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.960
all the time we almost fight constantly

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.200
non-stop right but like you can't like

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.480
as soon as white people [ __ ] with black

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.160
people it's like it's like racist

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.240
immediately it's the worst possible

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.040
thing

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.119
and it's just funny to me the idea of

00:50:13.119 --> 00:50:14.000
like

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.680
some white guy well we can't [ __ ] with

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:17.359
him we can't just mess with him a little

00:50:17.359 --> 00:50:20.319
bit true but it's also like he's kind of

00:50:20.319 --> 00:50:22.000
got a point i mean

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.280
you can [ __ ] with black people pretty

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.440
good you gotta razz them well i mean

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:26.559
it's kind of tough though if you just

00:50:26.559 --> 00:50:28.559
start razzing if the only black person

00:50:28.559 --> 00:50:30.240
shows up and you start deeply razzing

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.440
him people are invited to stop what are

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.680
you doing stop razzing this guy yeah

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:35.520
and what do you razz him on

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.200
i've seen the popular one of like you're

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.800
out somewhere and like it's like

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.559
summertime and the classic one they'd be

00:50:40.559 --> 00:50:42.559
like putting on sunscreen

00:50:42.559 --> 00:50:44.720
that's the classic razz yeah that's like

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.720
yeah come on man

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.720
but yeah you just can't go the same way

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:50.559
like you can for example you can make

00:50:50.559 --> 00:50:54.000
fun of uh all of the racial tropes of uh

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.680
of a white person like all the the the

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.359
negative ones like oh you can't dance

00:50:57.359 --> 00:50:59.359
smells like a wet dog yeah or weird

00:50:59.359 --> 00:51:01.760
baloney you know that's yeah it's uh

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:03.280
i've heard that oh i've heard them yeah

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:04.559
right you can say you can say all that

00:51:04.559 --> 00:51:06.839
stuff right but you can't be like

00:51:06.839 --> 00:51:08.640
hey black why do black people smell

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.559
weird to a black person like you just

00:51:10.559 --> 00:51:12.240
can't you can't do the same thing true

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.240
absolutely i don't know i went to a very

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.680
integrated high school

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:18.079

different it was a different time period

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:26.960

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:28.559

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:40.960
on um

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:43.119
on the internet and you know abroad

00:54:43.119 --> 00:54:45.040
is and i think we all do this we all do

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:47.119
it subconsciously we're all constantly

00:54:47.119 --> 00:54:48.960
trying to frame reality in little ways

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.200
where like we're winning all the time

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:52.480
even if it's like a daydream like dude

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:53.599
if that [ __ ] guy [ __ ] said

00:54:53.599 --> 00:54:54.799
something to me i would like [ __ ]

00:54:54.799 --> 00:54:56.240

here's me yeah here's my victory and

00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:58.799
then so we do this in our heads all the

00:54:58.799 --> 00:55:00.640
time but i think with comments you can

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.559
now get that juice from like you like

00:55:02.559 --> 00:55:04.160
watch a thing and you frame yourself as

00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:05.280
like being like i'm better than this

00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:06.559
thing and then you explain why and

00:55:06.559 --> 00:55:07.920
you're just like yes i'm winning i'm

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:08.960
winning

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:10.640
that's why i'll never take a position on

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:13.040
the internet again yeah it's tough yeah

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:15.119
oh the only position you can take aside

00:55:15.119 --> 00:55:16.799
from saying that primus is for [ __ ]

00:55:16.799 --> 00:55:19.280
dudes i will never ever share an opinion

00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:20.799
on the internet i think the only thing

00:55:20.799 --> 00:55:22.319
you can do is just be pumped on the

00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:24.480

00:55:54.319 --> 00:55:56.400
australia i think is being taken over

00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.440

trying to say like no that's not even

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:02.960
real i think there's like a lot of

00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:04.480
difference between the different areas

00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.240
dude i was also i also heard that in

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:08.240
australia they have a rule in certain

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.280
areas

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:10.640
that if you have anything making you

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:11.760
fight a kangaroo if you won't get the

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.839
backs true

00:56:13.839 --> 00:56:15.680
dude they're saying uh

00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:18.799
if you have say i had like a you know

00:56:18.799 --> 00:56:20.400
like a brand new cell phone on me but my

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.440
brand new cell phone comes in the mail

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:23.040
and i leave my family

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.240
well if i had a brand new cell phone on

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.760
me the cops stopped me they could sure

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.359
they could search me and be like where's

00:56:27.359 --> 00:56:28.880
the receipt for your cell phone if i

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:30.720
can't produce a receipt they can presume

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.160
that i stole it and then lock me up

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:35.119
that's so that's

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:36.559
there's no way you have that right yeah

00:56:36.559 --> 00:56:37.920
everybody's walking around with [ __ ]

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:40.160
dossier of their paperwork in australia

00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.520
and this was this law was in effect

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:42.799
before like everyone was using like

00:56:42.799 --> 00:56:44.799
smartphones and [ __ ] so you like the guy

00:56:44.799 --> 00:56:46.240
spaniard was talking about it how he

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:48.799
[ __ ] uh he got he had an ipod and

00:56:48.799 --> 00:56:49.839
they were like where's the receipt and

00:56:49.839 --> 00:56:50.960
he's like dude i was just getting his

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:52.480
third hand from an australian wigger

00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.559
three months yeah dude he's dude he's

00:56:54.559 --> 00:56:56.319
dude i'm telling you that guy

00:56:56.319 --> 00:56:58.559
me he's telling the truth he maybe he is

00:56:58.559 --> 00:56:59.599
i don't know

00:56:59.599 --> 00:57:00.960
he'd be dude you just want to disagree

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.319
the stakes are too high there's no way i

00:57:02.319 --> 00:57:04.400
want to accept this the stakes are too

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:06.480
high but but what i have heard is it's

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.000
it differs in different terror like

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.599
territories or states whatever they have

00:57:09.599 --> 00:57:11.200
yeah cause i'm pretty sure aborigines

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.440
don't [ __ ] with paperwork that heavy

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:14.720
that's probably why they have a lot why

00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:16.559
do you think it was more time to do

00:57:16.559 --> 00:57:18.799
crack cocaine than powder cocaine bro

00:57:18.799 --> 00:57:21.520
we're doing this all around the world

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.040
we got this figured out do they still

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.880
call them black fellas

00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:25.920
do they call them black fellas in

00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:27.200
australia yeah it's like black dudes in

00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:28.160
australia i think we're called black

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:30.000
fellas that's maybe the aborigines i

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.760
don't know that's kind of nice is that

00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.920
so i'm this might be her a horrific word

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:35.280
that i'm saying i'm not sure i thought

00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.960
it might be tough with australian slang

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.400
new zealand yeah because sometimes i

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.880
heard someone say

00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.720
no there's not there's a racial slur in

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:51.119
australia you just shorten aboriginal

interesting thing to behold just

01:00:22.799 --> 01:00:24.240

you know everyone just kind of just

01:00:25.599 --> 01:00:27.440
moved past it and then it's funny that

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.720
wasn't even the biggest thing then the

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.799
uh the dog of the house

01:00:30.799 --> 01:00:32.720

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.319
lady's finger

01:00:34.319 --> 01:00:35.920
that was

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.280
that was pretty interesting to see too

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.480
wait where was this the party it's a

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:39.599
little party yeah it was like the small

01:00:39.599 --> 01:00:40.960
roof

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:41.599
almost dock yeah

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.839
dog bite a dog i've like seen this dog

all the time you know just crazy you

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.640
know it's like a

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.799
like a pit mix kind of dog sweetheart

01:00:50.799 --> 01:00:53.280
hit mix that's not a little dog bite no

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.400
that's what i'm saying but it was it was

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.920
like a nibble from him he didn't lock

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.440
but it was like dude

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.280
out of nowhere he just went

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.079
and this lady was like

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:04.000
and dude like she was she got she was

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.440
[ __ ] up did it leave a mark i mean

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:08.319
like yeah bro yeah if i shot a cardigan

01:01:08.319 --> 01:01:10.240
around a dog it would have been tracked

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.160
that's all i'm saying if if a pit bull

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.319
hears cardi b it's biting a human true

01:01:14.319 --> 01:01:18.559
joy every single time just kicks in

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.000
fair point the people might have been

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.119
irritated

01:01:21.119 --> 01:01:23.599
by like the fast warlike tempo of the

01:01:23.599 --> 01:01:26.240
rap music

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.640
yeah i don't like pitbulls

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:31.599
i love people i hate pitbulls what yeah

01:01:31.599 --> 01:01:33.040
yeah i mean they got a bad reputation

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.559
but they are cuddly dogs they're

01:01:34.559 --> 01:01:36.160
sweethearts dude

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.400
this i mean this one is you know [ __ ]

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.680
they're statistically they're they're

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:42.160
like dispurport uh disproportionately

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.880
responsible for uh too many bites well

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:46.559
it's not it's not that mr culture check

01:01:46.559 --> 01:01:48.720
it out

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:53.359
portion of dog bites

01:01:53.359 --> 01:01:55.200
they're like thirteen percent of dogs

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.640
but they account for like ninety percent

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.359
of places

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.599
look up like the american kennel scoop

01:02:01.599 --> 01:02:04.559
it around statistics this is this is

01:02:04.559 --> 01:02:05.839
i mean you're just channeling the spirit

01:02:05.839 --> 01:02:08.160
of larry elder right now he's just stats

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.920
i was thinking about that stat today and

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:11.280
i think it's erroneous the way that it's

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.720
said because

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.400
you when you're the pitbull one or the

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.000
human one that i'm joking about yeah the

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.119
human one that you're joking about

01:02:17.119 --> 01:02:18.640
because the way that we we talk about

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.960
these stats goes against the way it goes

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.280
against logic right so if you say like

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.799
when you compare the stats like black

01:02:24.799 --> 01:02:26.480
people get shot this much white people

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:28.640
get shot this much see this is racist

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.760
because black people get shot

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.440
proportionately more but you can't

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.720
really make that comparison because

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:34.559
people aren't being shot because of the

01:02:34.559 --> 01:02:36.400
color of their skin it's like so are

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.520
white people being shot because they're

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.880
white

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.680
no so the comparison doesn't matter yeah

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.200
do you understand what i'm saying so

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.079
it's like to say 13 of the population is

01:02:46.079 --> 01:02:49.280
responsible for uh 50 of the murders

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:51.520
which is the statistic i believe dude

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.119
it's way more

01:02:53.119 --> 01:02:56.480
insane than that because it's only the

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.799
percentage of people that are

01:02:58.799 --> 01:03:01.280
killing people yeah so it's like a way

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.440
smaller percentage

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.039
have you watching the elder interviews

01:03:05.039 --> 01:03:07.359
no he talks to the press no well i was

01:03:07.359 --> 01:03:08.799
like an hour of him just fielding

01:03:08.799 --> 01:03:10.240
questions i actually did i couldn't

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.160
gather your position from that

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.920
well basically we're saying it's not 13

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.039
it's actually like three percent of

01:03:15.039 --> 01:03:16.640
people are responsible for

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.799
50 sample size is too small no the

01:03:18.799 --> 01:03:20.720
sample size is too big because yeah it

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:22.319
can't it takes into account that like

01:03:22.319 --> 01:03:23.760
you can't use the whole population out

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.599
of 13 there's only three percent of that

01:03:25.599 --> 01:03:27.760
population environment because yeah so

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.039
it would only make sense to use the

01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:31.839
whole population if the people that are

01:03:31.839 --> 01:03:34.000
committing the murders are doing it

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.160
because they're black

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.000
i think that is what a lot of people are

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.720
saying is true yeah i think the i think

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:43.119
the uh it's basically it's mostly young

01:03:43.119 --> 01:03:44.640
men so then when you take it's not

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.960
really 13 it's like three percent that's

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.559
that's how i'm yeah that's how i

01:03:48.559 --> 01:03:49.760
understand but also too it's like

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:51.680
they're not i mean again they're they're

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:53.520
it's

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.520
it's because they're young men you know

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.960
it's like more because of young men than

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.480
it's because they're black

01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.520
yeah

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:00.400
you know what i mean it's because

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.839
they're like they're they're angry

01:04:01.839 --> 01:04:04.079
they're [ __ ] nobody they didn't like

01:04:04.079 --> 01:04:05.839
have the proper guidance for their anger

01:04:05.839 --> 01:04:07.280
through their teenage years i'd say it's

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.559
a poor decision

01:04:08.559 --> 01:04:13.000
definitely murder that fella yeah

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.520
yeah yes it's a horrible idea dude it's

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.440
just so it's just a bad thing it's just

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.880
we throw i just we throw those

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.799
statistics around very disingenuously

01:04:20.799 --> 01:04:23.200
because we don't use them properly i

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.599
mean it's crazy it does like geek me out

01:04:25.599 --> 01:04:27.359
to think that especially like in america

01:04:27.359 --> 01:04:28.720
there's a ton of people being like

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:30.480
tomorrow i wake up and murder that guy

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.720
and it's like what the [ __ ]

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.240
and then being like oh and that that

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.000
guy's like you know within certain

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
circles it's like cool

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.480
i i even just cool like cool on like a

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:42.319
the most like how many days in a row can

01:04:42.319 --> 01:04:45.760
you want to kill a guy and then do it

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.240
i get a 30 second window

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.079
i'm like [ __ ]

01:04:50.079 --> 01:04:52.000
but even that i've chilled on that not i

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.839
don't think around

01:04:53.839 --> 01:04:54.960
don't think i could make it a whole day

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.319
one thing to kill a guy wanting to kill

01:04:56.319 --> 01:04:57.359
a guy

01:04:57.359 --> 01:04:59.119
the whole day wake up the next day and

01:04:59.119 --> 01:05:00.799
still have it in me i don't think i can

01:05:00.799 --> 01:05:02.480
make it a whole day i mean it's not even

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:03.520
so much like you don't want to kill him

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:04.720
it's just you getting so much you'd have

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:07.440
to not come between the initial idea to

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.039
kill the guy and actually yeah as soon

01:05:09.039 --> 01:05:11.280
as you call me it's over dude i'm not

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.960
[ __ ] killing that guy even if you

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:13.839
still want to kill him you're just like

01:05:13.839 --> 01:05:15.359
that's that's a level of effort that i

01:12:16.239 --> 01:12:17.760
we're talking about [ __ ]

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:20.560
oh yeah no animals yeah they crossbeat

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:23.120
they don't piece you [ __ ] donkey and uh

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.960
i think like a mule and a horse [ __ ] and

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.280
they create like a donkey or something

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.440
a mule is when a donkey [ __ ] a horse

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:32.239
yeah correct yeah courtney pull this up

01:12:32.239 --> 01:12:34.000
dude no no one knows noah like majored

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.560
in horses for like every semester

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:39.760
eating animal husbandry

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.440
equine science

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.360
so you're trying to [ __ ] some chick but

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.120
that mule can't replicate right you

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.360
always have to have no they're sterile

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.440
yeah yeah mules are sterile you most

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:52.000
most hybrid species are sterile

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.120
okay

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:56.000
so really yeah it's [ __ ] weird

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.199
because they wouldn't reproduce in the

01:12:57.199 --> 01:12:58.560
wild

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.159
that's true wait

01:13:00.159 --> 01:13:01.760
wait you just said that as if that made

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:04.159
what can a mule [ __ ] feel

01:13:04.159 --> 01:13:05.600
what do you mean what do you mean they

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.360
won't like where are you what are you

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:09.600
talking about because they don't

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.360
they only breed because humans make them

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:12.800
breed usually they don't like live in

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.320
the same like

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:15.679
like areas

01:13:15.679 --> 01:13:17.520
neighborhoods if you've got a girl mule

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:18.880
and a boy mule could they make another

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:22.640
mule no mules are sterile what yeah

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:24.400
they can't spawn

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.280
what the f yeah what the [ __ ] heck

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.600
yeah they can't have you have to always

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:31.040
they just get like you just need to keep

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:33.840
like reproducing like donkeys and horses

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:34.880
what

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.400
and then you so you have this they make

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.080
a thing called a mule that's just like a

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.920
temporary being and you just a mule's

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:43.920
not a donkey no a donkey and a horse

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.280
i feel so stupid right now that i'm

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:47.600
getting late

01:13:49.199 --> 01:13:52.000
they're usually like autistic as well

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.600
no ligers i'm gonna say mules are

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.280
stubborn yeah but are you you're telling

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.440
me liger you tell me tigers and lions

01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.840
don't have any cross territory tigers or

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:02.560
in asia lions are in africa oh

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.239
well they could you know yeah but

01:14:04.239 --> 01:14:06.159
they're they can run fast

01:14:06.159 --> 01:14:08.159
yeah there had to be some sort of land

01:14:08.159 --> 01:14:10.560
bridge cross pollination between tiger

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:11.920
they're the same skeleton they have the

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:13.440
exact same skill you're going back into

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.520
the [ __ ] fossil record now

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:17.360
we're talking what have they done lately

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:18.880
well it's like not really well tigers

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.960
are you tigers are like completely like

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.640
solitary animals

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:24.159
they wouldn't even be mingling with with

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:25.520
uh with a pride of life i'm gonna look

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.960
i'm gonna do you guys want even better

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:30.239
but look you're both wrong all right

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:32.640
let's take it let's stay to mules

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:34.000
no the um

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.760
i had a a

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.920
tragic animal story my uh

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:39.600
my babysitter's roommate they so they

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.280
both adopted cats

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:43.440
and uh her roommate adopted a cat from

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:45.199
like some shelter

01:14:45.199 --> 01:14:47.040
and you know they spay the cats before

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.040
they give them to you and apparently

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:50.640
they [ __ ] up the age of the cat so

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:52.000
this was actually they thought it was

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.920
like a younger cat it was a senior cat

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.360
it's old cat and apparently when you

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:59.600
spay an old cat like they die

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.679
