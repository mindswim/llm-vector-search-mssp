[ __ ] Arrow into the mainstream media

fake and people are like what yeah they

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.840
start to look into it it just completely

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.940
destabilized I watched the BBC this

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.099
morning it's pretty fun to watch

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.959
give it a shot actually they had a

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.060
Canadian correspondent that is 100 your

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.819
Canadian impression I thought I for some

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.140
Peterson's the only guy I've ever heard

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.180
talk like that I thought it was Jess

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.799
Peterson we were saying all Canadians

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.659
talk like that yeah they talk like that

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:55.920
I think it's like the South here but

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.080
there's like a lady North corresponded

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.080
in Ukraine like well it's rather uh

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.060
it's rather peculiar what's going on

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.239
here really yeah in the BBC

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.360
she was on the BBC and then they this

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.879
one guy did like a

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.680
he was he was embedded with some

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.139
Belarusian guys that were gonna go fight

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.600
on behalf of Ukraine it was clearly just

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.400
a gang of [ __ ] idiots

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.100
one of the guys was from America what

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.840
they were like we're about to go [ __ ] up

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.580
Russia it's just a bunch of dudes that

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.800
were clearly like paintball guys

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.840
I might have been with them I might have

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.580
been with them last night oh yeah true I

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.080
had a dream last night I was in a highly

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.580
disorganized operation where they

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.139
dropped me in Russia with a couple of

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.419
people and we I was like I wonder how

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:40.919
dangerous it actually is over here and

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.320
it was like I was in Ukraine I I saw the

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.639
blue skies were magnificent I was like

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:45.900
it's actually a lot prettier here than I

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.160
thought you love the blue skies of

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.259
Ukraine Clear Blue Skies Ukraine dude

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.180
and all of a sudden I got just the

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.560
building I was in started getting bombed

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.540
and chilled and I was just like ducking

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.340
debris and chunks of like concrete and

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.020
like dudes came up and I just was like

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.820
trying to figure out which side they

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.139
were on so I didn't want to reveal whose

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:02.820
side I was on but I couldn't tell them

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.340
apart so I kept being like what uh what

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.620
are you guys doing like yeah yeah you

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.539
guys oh you oh yeah nice nice I was

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:11.820
trying to figure side were you on I was

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.560
just there I was just I don't know why I

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.720
wasn't I was there I was fearing the

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.479
Russians so I think I was there but my

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.460
allegiances were quickly flipped once I

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.660
was like these guys talking about I was

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.160
about to be like yeah this is crazy yeah

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.440
it's crazy in my dream I was terrified I

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.360
was gonna get shot yeah it's a real fear

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.220
and then one dude sold me a gun for like

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.840
20 bucks and I was like sweet now I have

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.520
a gun I feel so much better

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.259
that's good what kind of gun was it it's

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:36.060
a small guy a little James Bond guy yeah

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.400
a little pistol pp7 a little pv7 dude it

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.020
was like fifth I forgot it was cheap I

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.100
remember being like that's pretty cheap

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.479
I'm surprised our economy collapsed

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.100
money doesn't really count yeah I got a

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.360
gun and I was walking around like this

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.800
is pretty scary but everyone was pretty

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.380
jovial for the most part in Ukraine uh

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.639
like these I think these guys I think

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.319
they were rooskis my my glad you're

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:57.300
reporting back on this I might be like

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.979
well just so everybody knows they're

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.220
pretty jovial over there

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.300
yeah they were interested in what I was

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.740
up to and I was just kind of like yeah

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.080
man it's crazy I didn't want to come out

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.699
and ask because I think they assumed I

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:10.259
was on their side for some reason it's

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:12.660
tough just a war of all white people

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.580
everyone's kind of like yeah yeah what

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.380
side it is the good guys what are you

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.120
doing it's usually pretty easy to

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.120
delineate who's the good guy

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.940
this is tough for some reason yeah it's

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.680
very tough dude yeah that was that was a

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.259
disturbing dream that was a very uh yeah

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:30.180
although those blue skies man God damn

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.039
they're magnificent yeah basically just

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:34.259
wasn't you I'm a wartime correspondent

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:36.419
yeah I was there dude you did an astral

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:38.460
tour beating in a building and exploding

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.319
having a building blow up while you're

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:41.880
inside of it like chunks of it flying

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.919
was that was disturbing that would be a

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:45.539
negative experience yeah dude I can't

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:46.740
believe you went through that I was

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.080
Major I was Major I mean I pretty much

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.960
did yeah I was matrixing chunks of

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.120
concrete just like whoa scary

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.880
that's startling stuff it's darling dude

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.560
I know it's about when you put on the

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.479
helmet as a wartime correspondent I'm

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:05.039
like yeah I could see I I couple of them

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:06.599
got dinged up during this thing by the

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:08.039
way I heard some correspondents guys

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:10.500
some died yeah you can rock I mean

this

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.399

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.820
Kid Rock So I searched his name

type their name in and click image what

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.920

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.320
having them you're it's a mental

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.360
disorder

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.039
they were just like what

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:30.659
yeah I don't think they've ever come

00:21:30.659 --> 00:21:32.580
across that even as a joke in their

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.360
Circle

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.460
oh yeah that orgasms for women were a

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.260
mental disorder that was like the first

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.059
that was the breaking news that never

00:21:39.059 --> 00:21:41.220
heard that information they piped down

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.679
though it shut them up really you know

00:21:43.679 --> 00:21:45.179
what's crazy though is in that in that

00:21:45.179 --> 00:21:46.980
commercial or the trailer I saw there's

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.679
like a lady that's like I'm having a

00:21:49.679 --> 00:21:52.980
good time by myself it's like take it

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.960
easy yeah that should be like psychotic

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.460
yeah but it'd be like yeah like bragging

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.500
like hey I'm I don't have sex I just

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.080
whack off constantly

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.940
it was a trailer for the show that I was

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.140
just talking about women being a

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.940
pleasure show yeah well no it's about

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.400
women finding their orgasm

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.679
and I think they were advocating for

00:22:10.679 --> 00:22:12.840
finding it at a very young age but I

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.760
could be wrong who knows what these

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.620
Netflix creeps are up to anymore true

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.860

in love with the Trump supporter you

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.700

documentary like the 87th or something

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.040
there was like that thing about like the

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.960
Brooklyn Police guys in the 70s who

became like wildly corrupt oh yeah yeah

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.520
it was this what yeah it was the 87 78th

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.200
Precinct something what a squad though

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.000

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.859
just wild the [ __ ] out like a whole

00:37:34.859 --> 00:37:35.960
other life dude that's a whole other

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.099
alternate life path I could have taken

00:37:38.099 --> 00:37:40.800
up what being a dirty cop dirty cop or a

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.579
white collar Criminal

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.440
I don't think you could be a white

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.119
collar criminal how so and I'll I'll

00:37:48.119 --> 00:37:49.560
take this with I'll take this ambiently

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.000
but how do you I think in order to be a

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.200
white collar criminal you actually have

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.420
to be a good businessman

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:57.180
yeah you know fair enough I couldn't do

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.280

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.660

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.700
to know what a good trade was I just

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.740
know you get the scoop if you go to that

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.660
company you go to like say I think

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:11.400

I forget exactly what it was I don't

00:43:10.619 --> 00:43:11.520
think you're allowed to say some people

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.140
say like it has to do with the bio labs

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:16.020
in Ukraine but it's like yeah I don't

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:17.579
know that's a Hot Topic right now it's

00:43:17.579 --> 00:43:18.660
another one you're not allowed to talk

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:20.460
about that's where I that's right that's

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:21.839
right that's off the table I went

00:43:21.839 --> 00:43:23.700
through the Ukraine Russia life cycle

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:26.040
where I like I started looking into it

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.460
got really mad

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:31.319
realized I didn't know enough about any

00:43:31.319 --> 00:43:32.400
of it

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.200
stopped looking at and then the bio Labs

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.060
thing came out and I was like I'm going

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.520
back Kelsey averaging crap they're

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:40.680
coming out now get anyone who comes I

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.480
think they were saying on The View if I

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.560
can acclaimed they claimed

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:45.660
conversationalists they were like I'm

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:47.099
just saying people used to get locked up

00:43:47.099 --> 00:43:48.480
for that they should come and like take

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.099
people to jail for that's treasonous

00:43:50.099 --> 00:43:51.599
yeah so they're saying like if you now

00:43:51.599 --> 00:43:53.040
say bio Labs they're like you're

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.079
basically a Russian asset but it should

00:43:55.079 --> 00:43:56.520
be you should be apprehended by the

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:57.380
authorities

00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:59.579
the only saying there's bio labs in

00:43:59.579 --> 00:44:01.400
Ukraine yeah I just saw remember

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.500
Institute of virology yeah yeah stuff

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:07.440
like that stuff like that that's the

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.300
only I just that's that's literally

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.460
where I just checked out remember the

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:13.079
place that I saw some tweet that was

00:44:13.079 --> 00:44:15.240
like they're launching birds or

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.880
something into Russia that was the plan

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.859
10 version of Russia yeah yeah like

00:44:19.859 --> 00:44:21.780
infected birds or something and I was

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:23.040
like you know what whose tweet was that

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:26.180
I don't know Kid Rock

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:30.000
I was just like you know what you can

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.980
spend another minute looking at this

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.319
yeah try not to yeah I try not to

00:44:34.319 --> 00:44:35.640
although I did watch the BBC this

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:36.960
morning did you what they said for about

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.359
12 minutes nothing they just they're

00:44:39.359 --> 00:44:41.819
just as bad as everybody yeah man it is

00:44:41.819 --> 00:44:43.859
funny though that it's a possibility

00:44:43.859 --> 00:44:46.680
that this whole nonsense of the covet

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.420
stuff did start from the Wuhan Institute

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:50.579
of virology and there doesn't seem to be

00:44:50.579 --> 00:44:52.020
a big

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:53.940
push China is still saying they have

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:57.560
zero coveted cases I think yeah Anthony

00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:00.740
yeah because it's not real true

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:03.900
they're telling the truth

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:07.680
um yeah I only just read Tim's tweets

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.680
good point that's kind of my news I

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.540
watch Saga and crystal ball for I

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:14.520
watched six minutes of their videos he

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.440
retweeted this New York Times tweet this

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.420
is an article experts say a new

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.339
generation of less destructive nuclear

00:45:20.339 --> 00:45:22.140
arms may make the prospect of a nuclear

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:23.880
strike less Unthinkable than it once was

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.400
thanks New York Times weight less what

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.960
was it the New York Times basically

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.099
saying the new nukes are a little

00:45:29.099 --> 00:45:31.859
smaller so they're pretty cool nice yeah

00:45:31.859 --> 00:45:34.319
they do that that was that that I picked

00:45:34.319 --> 00:45:36.000
up in the in the little time that I

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.800
spent oh micro getting furious about

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.060
that he'll get us scared of nukes

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.160
there's like there's like local nukes

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:43.560
that you can launch what they're like

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.480
yeah they're tiny nukes you can like

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.280
deploy just like in the battlefield or

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:48.300
something damn soon we'll be able to

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:49.800
like uber I think it's against the

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.380
engineers intervention yeah

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:55.140
a tiny little guy yeah yeah I don't know

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:56.940
I mean I'm not scared dude I'm not

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:58.560
scared of nuclear warfare at all I'll be

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:00.780
honest you know what I so just like if

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:04.260
it happens I I will have played no role

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:06.900
in creating it or stuff that's what you

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:09.599
think that's what you think that'll just

00:46:09.599 --> 00:46:12.300
happen you think there's no amount of me

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.940
looking into Twitter that's gonna help

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:19.079
wow one side or the other settle whether

00:46:19.079 --> 00:46:20.760
we get nuked or not once your guy got no

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.440
power you really stopped digging into

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.119
things didn't you no I stopped you were

00:46:24.119 --> 00:46:25.319
digging into you were digging in that

00:46:25.319 --> 00:46:27.200
Russian hoax pretty hard

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.060
it's all our faults what it's all our

00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:32.280
faults I don't think so oh yeah yeah

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.560
it's everybody oh yeah the fact that you

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.819
know nukes are out there you're not

00:46:35.819 --> 00:46:38.339
actively petitioning to denuclearize the

00:46:38.339 --> 00:46:40.380
world yeah yes you're it's blood on your

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:43.619
hands I yeah I don't know well that goes

00:46:43.619 --> 00:46:45.060
the other way they're like the old like

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.319
you need the nukes that's why

00:46:46.319 --> 00:46:48.119
everything's been so peaceful for so

00:46:48.119 --> 00:46:49.040
long

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.599
because nobody everyone can nuke each

00:46:51.599 --> 00:46:53.040
other it's like all right I guess we

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.359
just yeah it's the first time every

00:46:54.359 --> 00:46:57.079
world leader can die it's only been like

00:46:57.079 --> 00:46:59.280
50 years it's pretty it's pretty good

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.640
Man compared to the last yeah it is true

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.319
but what I'm saying is incredibly good

00:47:04.319 --> 00:47:06.480
if one of those gets fired off we would

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.700
have worked constantly though not really

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:11.520
no not the scale but there's no way they

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.920
could launch I mean there's no way the

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.619
whole world second like Putin's full of

00:47:16.619 --> 00:47:18.440
[ __ ] about launching a nuke

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:22.319
yeah I think I mean yeah I think it

00:47:22.319 --> 00:47:24.480
would be it was just a play if he nukes

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:27.059
Ukraine what's the play by the time by

00:47:27.059 --> 00:47:28.859
the time first of all we would know

00:47:28.859 --> 00:47:30.660
before he started launching them that

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:31.800
they were launching them that's what I

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.300
thought and then we would launch them

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.640
nice and it's and then everyone would

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:37.980
like it would be you think everyone

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:39.359
would launch them out of retaliation I

00:47:39.359 --> 00:47:40.440
think Europe would be like we're not

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.780
doing this they're yeah they might fire

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:44.400
them off though where would he fire one

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:47.220
if you fired one at the U.S or at Europe

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.020
they would launch them for sure yeah

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:50.880
they'd be devastated I don't know you're

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.000
right though Europe might just take it

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.020
oh man

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:56.640
I was just talking to someone that was

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.079
like I don't know if Biden would do it

00:47:58.079 --> 00:48:00.240
like retaliate with a nuke it's not what

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.819
do you mean boys yeah at that point get

00:48:02.819 --> 00:48:05.280
the [ __ ] out of the big Shut the get out

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:06.720
of the way yeah get out of the way you

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.339
[ __ ] idiot the military would just

00:48:08.339 --> 00:48:10.559
completely take over yeah our lives

00:48:10.559 --> 00:48:12.839
become very different I could see Biden

00:48:12.839 --> 00:48:14.040
being and we'd all be in the military

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.839
not by choice imagine him being enough

00:48:15.839 --> 00:48:18.000
of a [ __ ] to not launch one what's nice

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.460
is though he won't if it was Russia but

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:22.020
the whole uh the whole country would be

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:23.700
like you annihilate them I think if it

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.740
was Russia wouldn't it be the West Coast

00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:28.440
that gets hit yeah well the thing is

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.420
they're all in Subs

00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:32.160
so it's like we're not launching nukes

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.079
from here they're gonna do a little nuke

00:48:34.079 --> 00:48:36.300
set like so yeah that's that's all the

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.660
all the nuclear China has nuclear subs

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:42.420
Russia has a couple like we have tons

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:44.819
every like what is the surface up in the

00:48:44.819 --> 00:48:46.819
thing and like what do they do no no

00:48:46.819 --> 00:48:49.680
yeah out of the water there is there are

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:52.020
like all the I think they're the Ohio

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:54.000
class submarines each one of them has

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.520
like 24 like Trident II nuke nukes and

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.339
each one of those tridents has like 20

00:49:02.339 --> 00:49:04.800
Warheads in it and like half of those

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:07.440
are duds like you can't stop

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.780
they they'll launch a warhead that

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:12.480
Warhead will separate into like tons of

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:13.980
War oh you can't like yeah you don't

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:16.260
know which one's real or not

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:18.240
you get one of those subs would

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.339
annihilate

00:49:20.339 --> 00:49:21.780
a country you think like the whole

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:24.599
country yeah whoa

00:49:24.599 --> 00:49:26.640
Jesus Christ and those those are all

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.119
over the place

00:49:29.819 --> 00:49:32.599
I don't think you know [ __ ]

00:49:32.599 --> 00:49:37.140
when it comes to boats I know I don't

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:40.079
think you know [ __ ] I I promise you that

00:49:40.079 --> 00:49:41.819
one one submarine could destroy the

00:49:41.819 --> 00:49:44.280
United States uh I mean well not the

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:47.160
entire major cities you hit a bunch of

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.480
major cities

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:50.160
yeah yeah

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.020
I mean dude that would be like and those

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:54.000
those China has those and we don't know

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.740
where they are they're off the water you

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:57.720
know they're off the West Coast I dare

00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:59.640
try to shoot a nuke dude I'll go over

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.400
there myself personally yeah Mazda got

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.500

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:17.240
bummer Mazda doll 3D hit Kobe Covington

on when he was like talking [ __ ] dumbass

00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:26.160
something like that I think that was it

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.720
I'm not sure how he found did he beat up

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.339
Colby Covington there or no they got in

00:50:29.339 --> 00:50:31.140
a fight at the restaurant there's no

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:33.300
tape of it yet just can't come out damn

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:36.619
wow master balls

00:50:36.619 --> 00:50:39.059
yeah it's because he's from Cuba dude

00:50:39.059 --> 00:50:40.680
yeah he dealt with the Communist he

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:42.059
hates the [ __ ] I thought he's

00:50:42.059 --> 00:50:47.240
Peruvian he's Cuban yeah from Miami

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:49.380
so what would you do if we got nuked

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:53.119
yeah say like Oregon got nuked

00:50:54.059 --> 00:50:56.700
what would I personally do yeah I'd go

00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:58.980
[ __ ] we should nuke them back did you

00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:01.020
enlist what would you enlist

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:02.819
uh

00:51:02.819 --> 00:51:05.099
yeah but I'd go I'd like I'd I'd want to

00:51:05.099 --> 00:51:07.099
like fly a helicopter or something

00:51:07.099 --> 00:51:11.359
I was watching I was listening to like

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:13.200
I was listening to you you wouldn't

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.859
[ __ ] enlist

00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:18.720
no chance you would enlist now if if

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:20.700
enough momentum got going first off

00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:22.920
you'd get there to go no yeah yeah of

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:25.859
course of course I think the minimum age

00:51:25.859 --> 00:51:28.500
to enlist is like 35 or something no I

00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:30.180
think we that'd be there they would wipe

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:31.680
that if we got no if there's a nuke yeah

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:33.960
there's uh oh I put the old dogs back in

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.339
here I'd get in there but I'd go I'd get

00:51:35.339 --> 00:51:36.839
into a thing that took like it would

00:51:36.839 --> 00:51:38.050
take like a lot of training

00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:39.619
[Music]

00:51:39.619 --> 00:51:41.880
trained me for five years before I could

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:43.440
like get into that I was yeah I was

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.359
briefly in boot camp and that is how it

00:51:45.359 --> 00:51:46.680
works they go what do you want to do

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:49.859
yeah and it's up to you you go I want to

00:51:49.859 --> 00:51:51.900
fly helicopters and they go great they'd

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:54.420
be like they're colorblind yeah you

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:56.040
can't do that yeah that would tell them

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:57.660
I want to be a Kamikaze like I want to

00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:59.160
[ __ ] doubt that they actually might

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:01.380
be like we are interested in what you

00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:03.359
have to say if you're like I'd like to

00:52:03.359 --> 00:52:05.460
just blow them up by myself I would like

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:06.960
to go to destabilize countries with

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:08.880
propaganda that'd be pretty tight yeah

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.619
you could do that what type of pro you'd

00:52:10.619 --> 00:52:12.059
have like propaganda posters that are

00:52:12.059 --> 00:52:14.040
like Russia's actually gay oh for sure

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.780
just spread rumors so start spreading

00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:17.160
rumors they're getting kissed a guy that

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:17.510
one time

00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:21.270
[Laughter]

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:30.240
like good soviet-style propaganda

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:31.920
posters of like a horse blowing like

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.839
getting just deep throat no it's all

00:52:33.839 --> 00:52:35.579
it'd be all memes right it's like the

00:52:35.579 --> 00:52:37.500
new the front of the battlefield would

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:39.839
be like can we make the best Russians

00:52:39.839 --> 00:52:41.700
were the best rights all the right wing

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:43.859
comedy was Russia yeah yeah I remember

00:52:43.859 --> 00:52:46.140
that dude having having Putin have to

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:48.920
come out every episode

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:53.040
oh I mean yeah what do you tell me every

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.200
single time

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:57.020
like a nice conversation

00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:59.819
helicopters talking about submarines you

00:52:59.819 --> 00:53:02.599
did spread fake news

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:10.559
dude our democracy damaged our democracy

00:53:10.559 --> 00:53:13.680
the fabric of our democracy god dude I'm

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:14.880
just trying to admit you spread fake

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.500
news when did I spread fake the Russian

00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:18.359
hoax what do you think happened with the

00:53:18.359 --> 00:53:19.859
Russian don't do that you try to do that

00:53:19.859 --> 00:53:22.319
every time I actually know and you don't

00:53:22.319 --> 00:53:24.180
want to know what you think I thought

00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:26.280
it's been debunked it has not you're the

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:27.420
one who's been obsessed with it was it

00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:28.559
called a steal report what was that

00:53:28.559 --> 00:53:29.940
thing called the steal something that's

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:32.220
different what was that that was the

00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:35.180
thing that like that you you tell me

00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:37.859
a [ __ ] [ __ ] man no no it gets to be

00:53:37.859 --> 00:53:41.359
like this no this is what I'm doing this

00:53:41.359 --> 00:53:43.319
I don't know if that's true and you're

00:53:43.319 --> 00:53:44.900
like well then you tell me about it

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:48.920
because what happens is

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:53.460
I get trapped saying just instead of

00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:55.200
trying to be funny on a podcast I start

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.780
reciting facts about Russia
