00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.840
like bonds went up i don't i don't even

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.479
like

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:15.759
something what's up and the market's

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:17.919
gonna go down i say that once a week

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.520
bonds went up bonds went up

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.919
so the market's gonna take a [ __ ] but no

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:22.560
one's got

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.319
like here's here's the american people

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:25.840
we're making some money now

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.840
things are kind of good people are

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.880
working

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.800
no one wants to put their money in

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.160
something where they're getting two

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.240
three percent interest they've been in

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.319

20 on their money uh uh

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.360
so when bonds go up they're like

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.319

didn't change

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.240
it's just outrage that drove the stock

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.039
down

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:49.680
so me and davey boy here we [ __ ] buy

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.120

john's next

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.560
day this is back up because the outrage

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.120

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.319
real for real so we're calling it

00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:01.520
investing yeah

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:03.680
whenever someone drop and drops an

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.319
n-bomb or just a reasonable facsimile

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.199
thereof because

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:10.080
uh elon musk smoked a guy a pedophile

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.360
that saved those

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.960
kids caught in the cave we call him

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.840
enlan musk

00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:17.840
he's awesome you're not allowed to

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.759
falsely accuse people of things i guess

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:20.560

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.160
i've never heard of that so i do it all

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.680
the time is that a thing

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.919
yeah i don't know oh falsely accused i

00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:27.120
was going to say john travolta is a

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.319
[ __ ] but you said

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:32.479
fall asleep okay no no that happened

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:35.519
you pronounced dead wrong there's a half

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:37.200
a dozen masseuses that'll

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.080
yeah the voucher come on come on my

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.839

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.200
pilot of this

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.360
yeah you want to land this thing's going

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.279
to go down if i don't get off

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:52.399
[ __ ] so uh i i did that so

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:55.680
uh anybody who's following my stocks uh

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.519
and wants to can i ask like how it's

00:08:57.519 --> 00:08:59.760
going good it's going really well yeah

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.320
yeah like thousands it's [ __ ] crazy

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.760
yeah well how long ago was this

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.600
it's guaranteed it's like six months ago

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.959
but john's thing not even then we

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
yeah and then you do like nike was a

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.360
prime example

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.839
the the whole kaepernick thing happens

00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:18.880
nike signs them the stock takes a [ __ ]

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.399
buy on outrage lie on outrage and then

00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:25.360
the next couple of days it was like wow

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.399
they're selling a [ __ ] load of

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.120
sneakers

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.600
boom it shoots back up you cash out and

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.720
you're waiting for your next

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.800
gene investment moment because it's not

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.560
like the white people who were burning

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.399
shoes we're buying jordans and [ __ ]

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:38.160
anyway air force ones

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.320
yeah what you should do is one of you

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.320
guys should say something controversial

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.600
and then someone should buy into

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.839
compounds

00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:47.200
like just in case one of you guys says

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.160
like the n-word we'll just keep doing it

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.040
like [ __ ] uh go public and just say

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:53.760
the n-word

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.080
when elon musk uh smoked a joint on joe

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.680
rogan's podcast yeah

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.000
we [ __ ] bought some tesla again and

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.279
then you cash out

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:03.600
buy on outrage because it has nothing to

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.120
do with the mechanics of the company

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.040
all the numbers are the same the math

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.720
didn't change god damn it

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.279
and that works that dropped a [ __ ] load

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:11.839
of money

00:10:11.839 --> 00:10:13.920
for just because uh three executives

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:14.959
walked out

00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:16.959
so it dropped like it dropped an insane

00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:18.079
amount of money for a stock i think it

00:10:18.079 --> 00:10:19.519
was like 15 20 dollars

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:21.360
that's crazy yeah like those big swings

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.560
like that like today

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.000
uh uh tesla was down 15 a share

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.079
and where's it going it's just it's not

00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:29.360
the company's the same but it's that

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.320
stupid bond thing

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.519
i'm buying james bond i wore bonds

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:38.959
i didn't even know bonds were still a

00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:41.120
thing i know but that's just it no one

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.240
cares

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.720
they don't pay off very well it fits the

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.200
wire wire you mic something

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.839

00:10:49.839 --> 00:10:51.120

looking up it's i'm drinking by myself

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:51.120
anywhere anytime a ceo drops the n-bomb

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.480
buy buy buy yeah don't just don't just

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.480
buy pizza stocks you gotta wait for the

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.360
outrage

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.600
no wait i know it has to be a racist

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.399
piece of [ __ ]

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:02.240
wiring was off i didn't hear anything

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.680
you said get out of here anything you

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.279
think if that's all you got from this

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:07.120
you're doing it completely wrong

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.720
i bought all this pizza stock and all

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.320
i've done is lose money you guys over

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.920
arrested me you overestimate my

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.880
mentality

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.360
[ __ ] pizza stock yeah so i buy the

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.160
phone and then

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.920
it's always a pain in the ass you gotta

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.279
transfer everything over and it's pretty

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:20.639
easy now you just put the phone next to

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:21.360
each other and

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.279
kind of put but you still gotta arrange

00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:24.480
your apps

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.560
it doesn't arrange the apps like avid

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.600
just loads them all on

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.800
and now you got to sit there and make

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.800
your folders again and everything and

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.920
it's a pain in the ass

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.320
so i did all that and then i'm realizing

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.480
like there's no difference except the

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.399
screen's a little bigger like i

00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:40.160
i bought it's probably eleven hundred

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.440
dollars and and i have no idea

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.160
why i did it except that i'm brainwashed

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.200
like everyone else

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.000
to buy and the new apple product this

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.440
doesn't drop into an ad

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.519
i'm going to be very confused should

00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:56.079
right no it doesn't i'm sorry

00:12:56.079 --> 00:12:58.240
no i did the same thing that dsi i won

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.160
that's why you got to bet dsi

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.480
that dsi does go into an ad because it's

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.519
either bet dsi

00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:05.360
or stupid ginobisco know what to do with

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.959
all your stock money

00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:10.480
50 aside csi other than like a better

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.920
battery like i went and looked at the

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.480
last

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.920
two and i was like i don't need this

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.519
it's the same [ __ ] thing that's what

00:13:15.519 --> 00:13:17.040
i should have said yeah i just don't

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:17.680
need it

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.600
the battery sucks but that battery will

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.720
suck soon enough

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.200
oh i know they always turn to [ __ ] these

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.200
phones turn to [ __ ] after a while and

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.720
then you have to buy a new one but i'm

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.560
i'm brainwashed that's all that's all it

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.839
is that's what they want

00:13:29.839 --> 00:13:30.959
that's all i wanted to tell everybody

00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:34.399

what happened

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.080

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.159
play air guitar in the front yeah in the

00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:28.720
bathroom while you're smoking cigarettes

ringwald says sex assaults depicted in

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.200
80s movies

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.919
not acceptable in wake of brett

00:31:45.919 --> 00:31:48.000
kavanaugh blaming his disturbing

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.240
high school yearbook references on film

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.120
influences

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.760
so uh kavanaugh was talking about hey

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:54.960
you know some of the [ __ ] we wrote in

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.640
the yearbook it was the same

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.080
around the same time as things like

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.240
caddyshack and uh

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.240
animal house and and the john hughes

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.159
movies and we would just kind of go with

00:32:04.159 --> 00:32:05.120
that you know

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.640
people are influenced by movies their

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.559
language and everything like that uh

00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:11.840
so now she's all pissy about it uh

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.399
saying that the the behavior in these

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:15.600
movies

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.080
were bad even for the time it was

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.279
acceptable back then

00:32:19.279 --> 00:32:21.440
but she says it shouldn't have been

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.960
isn't it great to judge things in

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.880
hindsight like movies especially

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.279
right you take a movie from the 60s 70s

00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:28.080
or 80s

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.279
and not have enough like sense to

00:32:31.279 --> 00:32:33.120
realize oh it was made during a time

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.880
that was completely different than now

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.320
yeah so you're supposed to be able to

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.159
judge everything based on

00:32:38.159 --> 00:32:41.279
today thursday's standards of what the

00:32:41.279 --> 00:32:42.159

it's

00:32:50.799 --> 00:32:53.279
business is good it's easy for her to

00:32:53.279 --> 00:32:55.360
say when uh nobody's asking for her

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.720

the rest of us because you can't keep

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.200
jerking me off all night mine's been all

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.380
out since you sat down

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:48.800
[Laughter]

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.599

works he's pulling it off

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.560
he's trying to pull it off is that bad

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.920
that he's that's gay

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:01.280
interesting interesting take if you

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.920
try to pull it off it's gay if you just

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.280
happen to walk out the door and you're

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.000
pulling it off

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.280
it's awesome like me like you i walk out

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.640
the door people are like what's this guy

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.620
an assistant coach

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.680
[Laughter]

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:17.760
or is he just a down syndrome guy too

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.440
that's true if you were on the sidelines

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.880
it would take me a while to figure that

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.480
out

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.760
is this make make-a-wish or is he

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.280
calling the defense i would think in a

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.200
second like oh wait where's his [ __ ]

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.040

giant wheels on the side of them

00:40:33.359 --> 00:40:35.280

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.599
carolina versus tennessee football game

00:40:37.599 --> 00:40:39.440

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.119
the line for the handicaps

00:40:41.119 --> 00:40:42.960
it was a handicapped section that was on

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.520
the field i just took one step over this

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.520
gate and i just stood in the handicapped

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.240
section

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.000
so what are they gonna do no one said a

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.599
word they're like

00:40:51.599 --> 00:40:53.119

this it was great i got cotton candy in

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.280
a big step

00:41:01.359 --> 00:41:04.640
there one time i i was uh going to this

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.200
[ __ ] school um i wasn't going i

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.560

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.079
wonderful so i was in there and i didn't

00:41:44.079 --> 00:41:45.440
want to i was i was done

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.720
i was grossed out it was everything

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.720
so i went and stood out front waiting

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.920
for her to come out

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.640
and there was a a pole with reflectors

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.400
on it that were on springs

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.599
so i was sitting there and i'm standing

00:41:59.599 --> 00:42:02.000
and i'm flicking the reflector on the

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:02.800
spring

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.440
trying to figure out what the difference

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.240
in length

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.319
would make in the oscillation of the

00:42:08.319 --> 00:42:10.079
spring it sounds

00:42:10.079 --> 00:42:13.760

figure out the science behind

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.680
like the spring and the length of the

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.760

eight years old i'm saying it's that

00:58:51.599 --> 00:58:53.760
pivotal point where some of them are

00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:55.280
older and some of them are not

right i don't understand though either

01:22:40.239 --> 01:22:42.320
what he was accused of really wasn't all

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:44.320
that bad or he wasn't guilty

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:47.040
no slightly ridiculous like a politician

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:47.840

nothing happens to politicians he says

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.679

robot brothels

and in houston and and government

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:10.960
officials are just trying to shut them

01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:11.520
down

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:13.840
i don't understand why they're not being

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:15.679
cleaned exactly as well what if they are

01:25:15.679 --> 01:25:17.600
being cleaned properly i understand shut

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:19.679
it down if i worked there i'd be like

01:25:19.679 --> 01:25:21.920
no no like if they were like yeah you're

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:22.960
trying to [ __ ] robots

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:24.320
i tell them not to i don't do it i'm

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:26.800
like it's what my mouth's for oh

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:30.400
god damn did you even imagine

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.719
yes so people come in oh this is and the

01:25:32.719 --> 01:25:34.480
the theory is you it's run like a

01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:35.280
whorehouse

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:37.920
you come in you pick out your girl uh

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:39.280
you pay the man

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:42.239
and uh and then you [ __ ] this thing and

01:25:42.239 --> 01:25:44.159
then you leave and apparently

01:25:44.159 --> 01:25:45.920
someone's supposed to clean these things

01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:48.320
out right uh there's a cleaning process

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:50.239
that takes hours they say

01:25:50.239 --> 01:25:53.120
uh but i'm not buying it i think maybe

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.239
they'll hose it out

01:25:54.239 --> 01:25:57.600
maybe so is it a health issue probably

01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.360
probably just have some like baby wipes

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.199
that they just oh

01:26:01.199 --> 01:26:03.520
there you go or just some yes some

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:04.880
[ __ ] families

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:08.080
clean up it out eat it out like yes like

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:08.560
[ __ ]

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:11.760
like they're eating your play they just

01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.840
they pop the vagina out and give little

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:15.040
plastic spoons

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.440
gives whole new meaning to greek yogurt

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:18.239
yeah

01:26:18.239 --> 01:26:22.159
oh yeah oh that's uh

01:26:22.159 --> 01:26:26.159
mix yeah ooh probiotics

01:26:26.159 --> 01:26:29.040
that's good this is great for my ph

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:29.600
balance

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:32.639
it's great yeah so i don't know

01:26:32.639 --> 01:26:34.960
but if it's a health issue i guess but

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:36.800
if you are proving that you're you're

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.400
cleaning these things and sterilizing

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:38.800
them

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:40.320
can the government still step in and say

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:41.840

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.600

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:45.120
it you got to think it's got to be

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.440
cleaner than prostitution

01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:14.080
the machine where you

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:17.199
cremate dogs

01:28:17.199 --> 01:28:20.639
all right that's awful well probably

01:28:20.639 --> 01:28:22.239
right

01:28:22.239 --> 01:28:25.600
yes they don't like dogs

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:28.239
that's what they do i mean it's human

01:28:28.239 --> 01:28:29.600
trafficking we can pretend it's

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.440
not but i appreciate that you guys stick

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:33.679
to your guns when it comes to

01:28:33.679 --> 01:28:35.920
american standards oh yeah i mean when

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:38.560
it's like yeah [ __ ] sex robots

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:41.280
why not [ __ ] sex robots i don't care i

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:42.159
think people should be

01:28:42.159 --> 01:28:43.440
allowed to do whatever the [ __ ] they

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:44.719
want we should have legalized

01:28:44.719 --> 01:28:46.159
prostitution the only reason why it's

01:28:46.159 --> 01:28:47.920
illegal is because the same as abortion

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:49.040
it's a woman's body

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:51.360
like we should just completely allow

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:52.880
prostitution wouldn't that be freedom of

01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:54.480
choice on your body more so than the

01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:56.480
abortion i think so yeah a woman should

01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:57.920
have the right to choose what she wants

01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:59.679
to do and if she wants to [ __ ] all day

01:28:59.679 --> 01:29:00.400
for money

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.000
why can't she do that yeah as long as

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.440
she pays taxes

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:05.920
yes yeah that's the important thing it's

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:07.920
a very heavily cash industry

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:09.840

i i was such a strong advocate for casey

01:38:57.199 --> 01:38:58.719
anthony during the trial i

01:38:58.719 --> 01:39:00.800
i kept tabs on the whole thing and i

01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:03.440
knew i knew she was being acquitted

01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:05.119
and you would go to casey anthony

01:39:05.119 --> 01:39:06.480
hashtag casey anthony

01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:07.920
and twitter was set up that way where

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:09.920
you could retweet someone

01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:13.520
and actually change what they said and

01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:16.000
i would change some of the words where

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.920
people were supporting casey anthony and

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:18.400
they were

01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:21.360
like wanted her dead and they'd get so

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:22.159
mad

01:39:22.159 --> 01:39:23.920
and then i would stick up for her and be

01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:25.360
like why are you saying she's been

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.199

01:39:27.199 --> 01:39:28.320
this woman alone

01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:29.850
and just get hounded

01:39:29.850 --> 01:39:31.440
[Laughter]

01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:34.480
it was the greatest troll of my life uh

01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:36.000
but i knew i was like

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.679
i'd watch that trial and go there's just

01:39:37.679 --> 01:39:39.360
no evidence of her

01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:41.280
killing the kid i think she had

01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:42.960
something to do with it she at least had

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:44.159
something to do with getting rid of

01:39:44.159 --> 01:39:45.840
the body i think it was an accident i

01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.600
think it was an accident

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:50.480
due to gross negligence yeah and then

01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:51.520
she got rid of the body

01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:53.679
but there was no evidence of it so i'm

01:39:53.679 --> 01:39:54.960
like she's going to be acquitted

01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:57.040
no she's going to burn in hell is it

01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:58.800
well she got acquitted and i couldn't

01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:00.000

01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:32.880
a source close to casey says uh

01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:34.400
says that for a long time she was like

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:36.400
no way i'm not having kids but times

01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:37.679
have changed and she's now

01:41:37.679 --> 01:41:40.560
open to it in a way she hasn't ever been

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:41.119
before

01:41:41.119 --> 01:41:43.440
just approaching that subject yeah yeah

01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:44.800
exactly

01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:48.239

01:41:48.239 --> 01:41:49.360
another child

01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.040
if i'd be dumb enough to bring another

01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:52.480
kid into this world knowing

01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:53.920
that there'd be potential for some

01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:56.000
little snot-nosed kid would then say

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.679
something mean to my kid

01:41:57.679 --> 01:41:59.600

01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:03.440
that some other kids are going to

01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:05.280
bad-mouth

01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:08.400

boy uh here's a goddamn man

01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:56.480
a couple of real men uh there's a

01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:57.840
veteran here a

01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:00.000
double amputee marine vet and he's

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.600
slamming social justice warriors they're

01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:02.960
trying to redefine the word

01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:06.400
veteran now a veteran is uh a

01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:10.080
soldier somebody who's um served

01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:12.159
our great nation and earned it and

01:47:12.159 --> 01:47:13.840
earned it yes

01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:16.560
and uh now they want to include like

01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:18.960
social justice warriors

01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:22.400
activists people that stop wars by

01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:24.000
protesting and think

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.920
and this guy's like i think this double

01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:27.280
[ __ ] amputee

01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:29.119
yeah i think that's fair if they uh

01:47:29.119 --> 01:47:30.400
immediately grab them

01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:33.679
hand them a gun yeah light them over and

01:47:33.679 --> 01:47:35.840
yeah there you go there you go go ahead

01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:37.440
you're now you can call yourself a

01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:38.480
veteran there you go

01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:41.119
yeah pull yours with the balls the

01:47:41.119 --> 01:47:42.400
[ __ ] balls on

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:44.800
on these people that's disgraceful that

01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:45.920
uh yeah well that's

01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:48.159
that's apparently what they want to do

01:47:48.159 --> 01:47:50.560
and a double amputee has got to address

01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:51.440
something like this

01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:54.000
like it well he uh what happened to this

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.440
guy

01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:56.960
oh here it is can we as a nation begin

01:47:56.960 --> 01:47:58.480
now to consider expanding the category

01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:00.400
of veteran to include the diplomats

01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:02.320
and the mediators who work in conflict

01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:04.880
resolution and activists dedicated to

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:06.239
preventing wars and bringing

01:48:06.239 --> 01:48:08.320
existing wars to diplomatic resolutions

01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:09.840
once they've begun

01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:15.119
blumfeld wrote in lgbtq nation

01:48:15.119 --> 01:48:18.639
i am so tired i'm exhausted

01:48:18.639 --> 01:48:21.280
from this country i'm just like the

01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:21.760
world

01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:24.800
the world is exhausting me see

01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:27.199
see how the see how they're fighting

01:48:27.199 --> 01:48:28.719
with weapons that's called

01:48:28.719 --> 01:48:32.880
conflict resolution the reason why we're

01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:34.639
not being [ __ ] with is because we have

01:48:34.639 --> 01:48:36.000
a bunch of weapons

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.719
right that's able to resolve conflict in

01:48:38.719 --> 01:48:40.080
our favor

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:42.480
that's why that's it's not real no you

01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:44.480
protesting does not make you a veteran

01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:44.960
yeah

01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:47.360

01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:48.320
hope this uh

01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:50.639
i hope something wraps up soon where

01:48:50.639 --> 01:48:52.400
we're done with this where we move on to

01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:53.119
the next

01:48:53.119 --> 01:48:55.360
phase where political correctness and

01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:56.719
all this horseshit and

01:48:56.719 --> 01:48:58.320
comics not being able to say what they

01:48:58.320 --> 01:48:59.760
want to because they're put in the same

01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:00.800
category as

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:04.080
a doctor or a politician as far as

01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:05.600
taking out their word for what they say

01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:08.080
nothing's a bit anymore nothing's a joke

01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:10.719
it's all serious deadly serious and if

01:49:10.719 --> 01:49:11.360
you say it

01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:14.159
you meant to in in the most literal way

01:49:14.159 --> 01:49:15.040
possible

01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:17.599
like that's got to stop already people

01:49:17.599 --> 01:49:19.440
are tired of it i couldn't agree dude i

01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:20.239
couldn't agree with it

01:49:20.239 --> 01:49:23.360
yeah it's that's just pissing me off in

01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:23.920
a way

01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:26.159
yeah it's unreal like even we were just

01:49:26.159 --> 01:49:28.080
talking about like my family and friends

01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:30.080
that have served yeah yeah how hard it

01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:32.639
is that you think that holding up a sign

01:49:32.639 --> 01:49:34.480
or being against a wall to be in the

01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:36.159
same category

01:49:36.159 --> 01:49:38.800
someone that got shot and then goes back

01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:39.920
and becomes a medic

01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:42.639
like that to me is uh unbelievable we'll

01:49:42.639 --> 01:49:44.159
make a little thing called the pink

01:49:44.159 --> 01:49:45.599
[ __ ] patch yeah

01:49:45.599 --> 01:49:48.080
a medal when you hand in your one of

01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:50.719
