00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.879
made much of a difference quite honestly

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.800

from the east village 100

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.960
100 made a difference we would not be

tonight at the stand okay and um first

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:57.919

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.440
seconds there's crossover though and now

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.560
they're sitting through an entire

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.160
podcast and then they have to sit there

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.319
our podcast afterwards so i just feel

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:13.680
like we're getting a sort of already

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.199
used audience that's what happened how

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:17.280
do you feel about comments

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.720
before you no dude matt and sheen did

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.720
the live podcast they were just laughing

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.800

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:27.120
not again i happen to notice when i got

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.639
here there's a lineup of other people on

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.000
the show

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.199

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.960

i'm also doing jokes

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:37.840
that's not overlap you don't think

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.600
that's a problem run your business how

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.800
you want bro

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.680
yeah

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.280
there's gonna be some overlapping i just

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.880
feel like you know i didn't i didn't

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.960
realize that we were the [ __ ]

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.479
you know i didn't realize we're gonna be

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:49.759
booking multiple podcasts per night

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:51.840
which is fine but our podcast because we

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.240
live stream it takes a minimum minimum

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.240
of an hour to set up now it's never

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.479
taken an hour at the stand because it's

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:00.560
brand new they were supposed to have all

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.759
the equipment we were supposed to come

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:03.120
in with a computer yeah i thought i

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.319
thought i would plug into their setup

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:05.919
right and stream becky used the word

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:07.360
before supposed to be plug and play i

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.880
thought that was the whole thing i

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.000
thought the whole thing when they were

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.199
building it was setting up for

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:14.720
podcasting in that room particularly

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.720
the setup now is plug and plug and plug

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.400
and then untangle some wires and plug

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.960
some more then plug buy a wire then

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.199
right now buy a wire then figure out the

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:25.280
the grounding issues apparently let's

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.880
make it impossible to live stream louis

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.960
has to curse out joe harari then more

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.039
wire unfolding than some wire than

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:32.639
putting some wires away so it's taken

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:33.520
every time we've been to the sand it's

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.720
taking like an hour and a half to two

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.240
hours to set up

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.680
because there's so many different issues

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.720
with

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.319
i'm figuring an hour before and an hour

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:42.319
and a half into the show we are setting

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:44.080
up ultra and you guys have heard the

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.680
shows from the same so far the audio is

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.280
[ __ ] suck dick

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.879
and i made it very clear with everyone

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:50.400
involved but we got a solution for that

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.360
i thought

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.879
what's the solution i thought they were

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:54.080
suicidal

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.120
or something a grounding wire

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.639
yeah it's gonna get rid of the hum you

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:00.400
gotta get rid of him

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.400

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.040
uh the studio

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.360
9 17 i get a text from bobby oh yeah

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.040
they're not off stage yet and that's

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.480
when i [ __ ] started flipping out

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.079
that's when i started getting like angry

00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:07.519
angry because i'd already been prepared

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:09.120
for it but once things are starting to

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.920
run late oh

00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:15.279
louis we started at the same time we

start every podcast now we were pretty

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.120
we're pretty late tonight and to be

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.680
honest with you we wouldn't we if i had

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.880
a guess it took us an hour and a half

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.959
last time to set up if i i would give

00:13:24.959 --> 00:13:26.959
ourselves an hour and a half best case

00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:28.320
scenario like an hour and 15 minutes to

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.320
set up over there it's crazy what what

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.760
these guys do they set up an entire

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.079
[ __ ] thing if you told me i had 45

00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:35.600
minutes to set up a computer just a

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.959
computer i'd be like that's literally

00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:38.000
impossible

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.680
who can set up a [ __ ] computer in 45

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.279
minutes they have an entire streaming

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:42.959
setup ready to go live streaming

00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:44.560
everything it's a lot

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.240
but i'm saying like i thought that was

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.720
sort of the uh with leaving the creek

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.480
too was a lot of it was going to be that

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.480
it was going to be much easier yeah to

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.399
do that it's harder

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:56.320
but it takes longer there than it did at

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.480
the creek yeah set it up

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.680
bobby

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.160
it's because their audio setup is not

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.399
compatible with our system so we have to

00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:06.399
figure out how to ground it and it's

00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:07.839
it's we're getting a lot of static in

00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:09.680
the audio when we and it's a problem

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.079
when people listen to their [ __ ]

00:14:12.079 --> 00:14:13.360
system or something it's not a bad

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.399
system

00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:15.600
it's just not

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.519
we have not had the time to get in there

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:19.600
and make our setup completely work with

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.639
their setup and there's there's a

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:22.240
million different pieces of hardware

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.839
software there's all these different

00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:25.040
things that have to work together and

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.880
has to be tested over and over again and

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.639
this is why an hour setup right now is

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:30.000
minimum because we need to test it to

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.160
make sure everything's good but whatever

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.680
we can dwell on the [ __ ] all day could

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.399
you have gone there do you regret going

00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:38.480

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.400
a tell his perspective we're just

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.640
calling dave a [ __ ] because

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.919

dave a towel

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.799

says dave isn't funny on legion of

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.200

a few times but i never looked at it

00:18:17.039 --> 00:18:18.880
through the eyes of a skankfest producer

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.799

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.760
crazy and the setup might even be better

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.360
than the brooklyn bazaar [ __ ]

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.840

00:19:22.559 --> 00:19:24.960
nervous like nervous at one point he

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.240
left the gun range the same way you

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.840
would leave like

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.440
if you were like torturing somebody you

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.720

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.160

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.160

00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:52.000

guy at a gun range what were you

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.160

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.120
said the gun legitimately kept on

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.640
jamming i i had to tell him i go you

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.600
have to teach me this like you're

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.880
teaching an eight-year-old girl to shoot

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.640
a basketball because i'm doing like do i

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.480
hold it here dude you want to put it

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.360
just put it in your mouth

00:20:23.679 --> 00:20:25.039
and then you go in and they give you all

00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:26.640
the ammo they give you the guns and they

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.159
just assume you know how to load it and

00:20:28.159 --> 00:20:29.919
we're we're men so we have too much

00:20:29.919 --> 00:20:31.520
bravado to ask another man for help so

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.640
i'm literally just like looking down the

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.640
barrel like this

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.000
dude it's brutal it's crazy and it's so

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.600
guns are very crude as well like when

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.039
you feel them like

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:42.240
before you hold the gun before you shoot

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.480
a gun you don't realize like it's very

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.280
like a like metal and

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.480
you feel i don't know why you're holding

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.760
a piece of coffee it feels like more of

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:50.960
a device when you think about it again

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:51.919
like it's almost like it's got to be

00:20:51.919 --> 00:20:54.080
turned on and is it you know no this is

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.559
a [ __ ] very crude strange thing and

00:20:56.559 --> 00:20:58.320
when that gun would jam

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.000
i was like i don't want to [ __ ] i don't

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.600
know what i'm doing is blow up in my

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.559
hands

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:04.640
what does it mean

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.919

00:21:05.919 --> 00:21:08.720
to come over and be like look at me

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.720

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.240
gun yeah and i'm like

00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:54.159

that's what was going on there you

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.799

00:25:12.799 --> 00:25:14.080
looking to think so i don't even realize

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.520
i'm just like i'm holding it and i see

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.559
the target through the thing but i'm

00:25:16.559 --> 00:25:18.720

i'll tell you what i won't it's eight

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.120
bullet clip

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.720
i never put more than seven in because

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.000
by the time you get to the seventh you

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.919
could get a push so no hands real sweaty

00:25:49.919 --> 00:25:52.400
it's not that yes but also push you to

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.679
push so hard that i don't even know how

00:25:53.679 --> 00:25:55.520
bullets work i'm like i'm pushing i'm

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.320
like are these is it

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.039
am i going to shoot my own finger with

00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:02.880
my finger

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.600
loading a cl an ar-15 full ar-15 but

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.440
it's so like in the book

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.960
by the way the clip is so crude you're

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.080
like this is what i'm doing you're using

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.120
the right word for it so i keep saying

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.960
it so it is like a piece of plastic

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.320
you're like you're like dude it's a

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.320
plastic watch the bullets go in sort of

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.760
uneven i'm like

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.520
they going uneven and if you try to put

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.200
the next one in it jams for that and you

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.120
have to like did you move it around like

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.640
it just seems all like it seemed to be

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.760
very like

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:26.799
well one point

00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:28.720
the guy the gun jammed and he goes he

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.000
was like yeah and he takes he didn't say

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:30.960
anything he or he's trying to say

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.720
something but it's so loud and you can't

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.960
hear his voice they were just like

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.720
and he puts a bullet on the table next

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.720
to me a lot of fun

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.400

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.600

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.000
is like a dud bullet that's gonna

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.640
[ __ ] kill me yeah but then it's

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.240
harder than you think right you gotta

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.440

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.960

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.400
just oh i said slightly all you need to

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.080
do is one of these and i'm like

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.840
moving too fast legitimately as far away

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.919
as the [ __ ] as the

00:27:21.919 --> 00:27:23.440
as the tv is in the other room over

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.200
there legit as far away as that there's

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.799
a chance with it with a handgun if you

00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:28.640
even line it up you wouldn't

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.399
i mean in my mind i was like let me get

00:27:30.399 --> 00:27:32.000
this target back so i can show you

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.520
sideways like a black guy and it looks

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.520
like no one shot at it

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.360
what are we shooting just a clean piece

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.840
i mean it was never clean but it was no

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.760
rhyme or reason any of it was like

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.679
samuel jackson and uh

00:27:43.679 --> 00:27:45.360
[ __ ] uh bow god what's a queen

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.840
tarantino movie

00:27:55.279 --> 00:27:57.120

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.559
still nervous my hands are sweating i

00:27:58.559 --> 00:28:01.039
like start loading the gun uh with my

00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:02.799
shirt because my hands were too sweaty

00:28:02.799 --> 00:28:04.640
to load the bullets i'd go again to an

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.480
outdoor one why outdoor i feel like

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.679
that's worse

00:28:07.679 --> 00:28:08.640
why

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.320
because i feel like outdoor

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.600
i think this scary

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.360
made me nervous i think i was afraid of

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.720
the scary sounds

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.399

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.559
supposed to do that no that's the only

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:21.600
way i can

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.600

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.080

why not cigarettes you're getting a no

00:28:41.039 --> 00:28:42.880

pretty much every show they're going to

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.320
shut that down eventually eventually

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.000
probably tonight tonight

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.279

uh after hyenas

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.760
nice cigar bar right across the street

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.120

nice place really cool bar

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.320
pretty empty like a very sleepy place

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.320
especially on a thursday i guess

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.520
it turns out all weekend they're kind of

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.880
like that but like

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.080
we're like we told everybody afterwards

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.120
like oh let's go over there because

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.159
we're gonna have a few drinks then we

00:29:38.159 --> 00:29:39.760
could smoke inside and we brought him

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.679
over like a bunch of business at least

00:29:41.679 --> 00:29:43.039
people yeah like fill this place up it's

00:29:43.039 --> 00:29:44.559
not a big bar

00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:45.600
filled it

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.720
and then uh

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.320
the the show ends and we bring over a

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.720
good 50 people and everyone is

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.720
so it's like we're not a party of 50.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.320
which honestly if you're a waiter i'm

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.919
assuming you don't want a party of 50.

00:29:55.919 --> 00:29:57.279
you want to have all people paying to

00:29:57.279 --> 00:29:58.399
take on their own bills you won't have

00:29:58.399 --> 00:29:59.840
to deal with one large group of 50

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:00.720
you're talking about the first night

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.360
still first nights yeah um

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.640
so we come over with you know everyone's

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.760
sort of offending for themselves they go

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.120
to the bar they buy a drink whether they

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.399
sit down or whatever talk amongst each

00:30:08.399 --> 00:30:11.200
other talk outside whatever so um

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.279

00:30:13.279 --> 00:30:15.039

00:30:15.039 --> 00:30:16.799

the thing he's like this is the choice

00:33:49.039 --> 00:33:50.159

with that sort of traffic right so or

00:34:10.879 --> 00:34:13.200
any traffic apparently so what they want

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.800

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.320
my clamps are fogged up

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.839
the first time i took off my first one

00:37:43.839 --> 00:37:45.440
to have the glasses to wipe the [ __ ]

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.720
fog off them i know they're [ __ ] like

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.119
a hot

00:37:53.839 --> 00:37:55.680
my own shells hit me in the forehead

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.200
before like this is not out did you

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.960
think you'd be good at shooting

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.720
going into it i feel like jay had to be

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.400
confident going into this jay was super

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:05.839
cocky he was definitely

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.599
who has trouble walking or holding a

00:38:09.599 --> 00:38:11.200
drink in front of him he was like i'm

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.200
gonna school this guy

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.800
and uh then he didn't yes i was

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.040
i was i thought i'd be okay like upon

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.200
idea when we shot when you were young

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.240
yeah when you were a kid you shut up

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.400
yeah when we got there and they handed

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.599
us the guns in the cases right at that

00:38:27.599 --> 00:38:29.040
desk they also gave us they gave us the

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.119
guns in pink cases we got to transfer

00:38:31.119 --> 00:38:32.560
the guns to the gun range with the

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:33.599
bullets and everything it's like

00:38:33.599 --> 00:38:34.800
something about that once they gave it

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.400
to me i was just like you're not

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.440
supposed to give me this a gun feels

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.359
dangerous yeah it literally there's just

00:38:41.359 --> 00:38:43.359
no other way to put it it feels like

00:38:43.359 --> 00:38:46.320
you're holding a tool of death it's an

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.560
interesting definition yeah i mean

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.160
that's it's all it's for

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.599
uh we're here

00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:53.040

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.480

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.079
take a life with this also missing

00:38:56.079 --> 00:38:59.359

we did also bring

00:41:16.319 --> 00:41:17.839
we brought some people who seem like

00:41:17.839 --> 00:41:19.440
they shouldn't be fans of us and then of

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.200
course the obvious riff raff we did

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.160
bring it yeah

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.160
the group was six years all good people

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.760
they were all very great there was no

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.319
river no [ __ ]

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:30.000
no dude no shitty people though i've

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.079
been at skankfest

00:41:32.079 --> 00:41:34.480
southern southern good people it is

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.160
they're all good people it is but if i'm

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:39.119
from isabella for us to have 60 of our

00:41:39.119 --> 00:41:41.040
people in a place without there being

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.680
anyone who you're like that guy sees me

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.960
what was the problem

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.720
the last night we brought everybody to a

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.119
different bar and it was awesome yeah

00:41:49.119 --> 00:41:50.880
great they think a comment so this woman

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.960
coming up to me and she's like hey uh

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:53.920
you know

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.680
you know you guys if you could sit out

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.280
in the seat you could all um and she's

00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:58.880
being very smiley she but she's being

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.720
sarcastic and she's going she's like

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.000

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.760
could just all sit in one seat you know

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.960
because it's kind of hard to track you

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.480
all down you want 60 people to sit in

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.160

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.119

thing no they lost money by the way

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.240
maybe the bartender that was behind the

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.920

the bar to get drinks and the bartender

00:47:54.559 --> 00:47:56.800
was like i roll and then the first time

00:48:00.319 --> 00:48:01.440
kind of ignorant

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.280

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.680
it could be he was two girls and a boy

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:23.760

00:53:42.079 --> 00:53:43.920

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.839
buddy

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.480
when i was people watching hard

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.160
i'm telling you there was so many like

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:37.200
strip club activity is so funny to

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.480
observe

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.280
i mean like just a schlubby mess of a

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:44.240
guy like standing and he's just got the

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.359
one thing i was watching he had like a

01:07:45.359 --> 01:07:47.039
stack of money and he was like kind of

01:07:47.039 --> 01:07:48.720
letting it like leaf off

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.319
the stack onto a girl who was just

01:07:50.319 --> 01:07:51.839
dancing you could see her face just

01:07:51.839 --> 01:07:53.599
being like looking forward like whatever

01:07:53.599 --> 01:07:54.799
and shaking herself and he's behind her

01:07:54.799 --> 01:07:55.920
really doing like a like he's like

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.839
really jamming like [ __ ] he's having

01:07:57.839 --> 01:07:58.720
crotch

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.200
yeah but it's just like it's sad it's so

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:03.039
both of them are sad it's just a weird

01:08:03.039 --> 01:08:03.920
thing

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:04.880
i don't think

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.640
an nfl player is sad when he goes to a

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.640
strip club no but that's not what jay is

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:11.359
describing

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.400
that girl

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.400
is that how you self-evaluate

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:28.319
whoops

01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:29.600
statement

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.440
every now and then lewis just lets loose

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.960
how he thinks of himself could have been

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:36.080
me or james harden you know

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.159
dude i'm telling you right now listen to

01:08:38.159 --> 01:08:38.960
me

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:40.640
when i go in here i'm like hey [ __ ]

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:41.920
google me

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.440
and then she sees that i'm a

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.199
professional comedian look she never

01:08:45.199 --> 01:08:47.679
googled you do you know who joe rogan is

01:08:47.679 --> 01:08:49.279
is that what you go with because i bet

01:08:49.279 --> 01:08:50.839
that's what everyone

01:08:50.839 --> 01:08:53.199
there i don't really say google me but

01:08:53.199 --> 01:08:54.319
no at one point i do tell i'm a

01:08:54.319 --> 01:08:56.000
professional comedian yeah of course

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.920
yeah of course just look like this

01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.759
club oh to this [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:08:59.759 --> 01:09:01.359
stripper you don't think like in her

01:09:01.359 --> 01:09:02.880
mind you think she think you're a

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:06.120
[ __ ] opener

01:09:11.839 --> 01:09:13.920
is just one they get probably a [ __ ]

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.679
thing because if someone does two open

01:09:15.679 --> 01:09:17.600
mics they can go in and say like i do

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:18.960
shows

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.480
everyone else at the strip club is on

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:22.239
the honor system

01:09:22.239 --> 01:09:24.480
if you also say google me it means

01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:26.319
you're not famous enough for her to know

01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:28.640
who you are and like and like weirdly

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:31.600
like level i don't know i'm joking

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.600
but what no i've hooked up with a decent

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:35.440
amount of strippers so i'm not wrong

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:36.560
because you bring something outside of

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.000
the strip club

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.480
that you missed

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.159
for free

01:09:42.159 --> 01:09:43.520
yes

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:45.440
but you paid for the meal

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:48.960
yeah so you're not free you made

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:05.440
and then i've dated other strippers just

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.800
legitimately

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.719
dated them just like you know

01:10:08.719 --> 01:10:10.080
in their life yeah yeah i met in life

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:11.760
and then they stripped them oh yeah no

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.600
i've i i've definitely hooked up with

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.120
someone's been a stripper before but

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:17.040
i've never like like i said anything

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:19.280
that was beyond like

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.400
when they're like hey you want to hit

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:22.000
the olive garden and maybe like watch

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000

no what i let them touch my super bowl

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:32.719

01:30:45.679 --> 01:30:48.679
hot

01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:55.920
pretty much the same thing

01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:57.679
because paul mooney had

01:30:57.679 --> 01:31:00.000
his son by that time so richard passed

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.239
away in 2005.

01:31:02.239 --> 01:31:04.320
where was his and paul's relationship

01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:06.880
what if he just talked like jay angry

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:10.080
angry [ __ ]

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:12.480
jojo dancing on

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:16.400
the relationship became fragile okay

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:18.719
because paul mooney had richard's son by

01:31:18.719 --> 01:31:20.960
the way

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.639
i kind of feel laughing before that and

01:31:24.639 --> 01:31:26.800
after that it's not funny but

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:30.040
this is

01:31:38.490 --> 01:31:42.000
[Laughter]

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:42.840
no

01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:45.360
1979 is that pre or post you [ __ ] his

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:48.159
son has he yeah he did he [ __ ] he

01:31:48.159 --> 01:31:51.040
defeated [ __ ] by that point anyway

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:53.360
to answer your question fragile

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:54.880
the relationship

01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:58.000
happened fragile

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.560
was fragile because he [ __ ] son

01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:03.600
he violated and that's any man

01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:04.800
uh

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:07.520
if you violate their children like that

01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:09.760
so paul took advantage of of the

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:11.600
situation

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:13.520
and so from there on

01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:15.760
whatever paul mooney was to richard and

01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:17.679
there was a time

01:32:17.679 --> 01:32:19.440
that paul mooney

01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:21.120
was rich's friend

01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:23.120
you know i acknowledge that

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:24.480
um

01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:26.480
which is why the gay community really

01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:28.480
couldn't say anything

01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:31.040
they attempted to about richard because

01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:33.600
paul mooney was his friend

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:35.679
and they laughed so when paul did what

01:32:35.679 --> 01:32:38.639
he did it was a violation of friendship

01:32:38.639 --> 01:32:41.440
first and then my sister's boys booty

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:43.679
haul

01:32:43.679 --> 01:32:45.840
they got friendship first and my son's

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:48.320
second that's a weird order

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:50.560
definitely a violation of the kid it was

01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:51.600
her because they were supposed to go on

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:54.320
vacation together

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.880
god keep playing

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:12.320
and then my son you know um

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:13.840
right

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:15.440
and in some circles that's supposed to

01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:17.199
be dealt with

01:33:17.199 --> 01:33:19.600
so did was there ever a conversation to

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:22.960
retaliate against that yes yes right of

01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:24.080
course

01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:27.199
how to what extent to the extent of

01:33:27.199 --> 01:33:28.880
of richard didn't want him on the planet

01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:31.360
no more he shared it with me and he said

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:32.960
he wanted somebody

01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:35.280
uh killed

01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:37.199

01:33:37.199 --> 01:33:39.920
attribute that he must be high right now

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:42.880

reliable at all they are dumb that by

01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.000

is now dead well i'll tell you what this

01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:03.199

like an acknowledgement like that from

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:07.360
of paul moon even being gay yeah no

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:10.239
paul when he's gay but this is very like

01:34:10.239 --> 01:34:11.679
no one talks he just shows up with a

01:34:11.679 --> 01:34:13.920
young boy at every show oh and also a

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:15.920

01:35:08.239 --> 01:35:10.639
interview

01:35:11.119 --> 01:35:12.880
this is the high day so it's friday

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:15.840

he'll be straight

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:20.800
because i knew the pastor hits friday

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:22.560
and i asked him again because richard

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:24.100
never spoke like that

01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:25.360
[Music]

01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:27.199
and i just said do you remember what you

01:35:27.199 --> 01:35:29.360
said to me last week and he was he was

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:31.360
on it so clear it was like okay it's

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:32.719
serious

01:35:32.719 --> 01:35:35.040
and so then i asked him what is it about

01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:36.480
he said a million dollars i want

01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:38.400
somebody killed i was like damn i'm not

01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:41.280
a killer i'm not that person but i did

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:43.840
give a thought i know some people use a

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:46.320
million dollars

01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:47.600
how old was this but i mean probably

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:50.000
easy to kill you know

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.600
so that's probably he probably runs off

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:52.560
philly

01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:55.920
i could probably catch him easy

01:35:59.199 --> 01:36:00.800
i buy a house

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:03.280
i buy a new car oh play the lottery i

01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:04.800
got a lot of scratch-offs a million

01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:06.880
dollars buy you a lot of scratch

01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:10.920
maybe you can win a million dollars

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:23.570
save some money on the back and on the

01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:33.060
[Laughter]

01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:38.400

01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:42.960

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:13.040
how old was the sun i don't know yet can

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:14.320
you look that up because it's old enough

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:16.560
to love it i by the way i have no idea

01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:18.000
if we're talking about a seven-year-old

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.080
or a twenty-five i know

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:21.679
i know he was young enough i guess he

01:37:21.679 --> 01:37:22.560
said

01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:24.159
they say the years or something it says

01:37:24.159 --> 01:37:27.360
uh the the kids were born in 84 and 87

01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:28.960
they don't say which one it was but the

01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:31.679
incident happened around 85. no that's

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:34.960
impossible so one

01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:49.159
richard pryor's baby

01:37:50.330 --> 01:37:56.349

this whole baby you know i thought we

01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:18.400
were cool and we'll probably get through

01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:20.320
this but that was a weird movie have you

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:22.080
called back there when you [ __ ] my baby

01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:23.520
no well hold on listen but he says in

01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:24.560
the interview because we i don't think

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.239
we watch the whole thing he goes on to

01:38:26.239 --> 01:38:29.280
say two other sons what saved

01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:30.960

01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:32.320
what's what year this summer was born

01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:33.440
the one we're talking about is richard

they're at least teenagers no the one

01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:37.360
that's just a comedy all right no

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:38.639
richard junior race right that's what i

01:38:38.639 --> 01:38:40.159
believe it is the one that just did i

01:38:40.159 --> 01:38:41.119
don't know

01:38:41.119 --> 01:38:43.760
they're apollo they've got to call

01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:45.119
yeah what do you mean he's like in our

01:38:45.119 --> 01:38:46.719
circle now doing no

01:38:46.719 --> 01:38:48.560
no he bombed in the apollo

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:50.159
he bombed he was digging out with what

01:38:50.159 --> 01:38:52.800
he thought was worse

01:38:53.199 --> 01:38:54.639
he's performing to the apollo we're

01:38:54.639 --> 01:38:56.960
getting a very [ __ ] [ __ ] ball

01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:58.639
and then also knowing that paul mooney's

01:38:58.639 --> 01:39:01.119
probably murdered the apollo dude he

01:39:01.119 --> 01:39:03.040
just leveled that place oh dude he

01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:04.320
ripped the apollo you don't remember

01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:05.520
that steve harvey had to come out and go

01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:07.280
come on now his daddy was famous give

01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:10.239
him a second i think i believe his wife

01:39:10.239 --> 01:39:12.320
said yeah yeah basically what he said he

01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:13.840
goes for his dad he goes to show some

01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:15.119
respect for his dad and let this boy

01:39:15.119 --> 01:39:15.920
come out and do his thing and then they

01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:18.320
just like arbitrarily like cheer for the

01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:20.480
same jokes they were like booing before

01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:22.320
it's great they booed if it's richard

01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:25.440
junior uh he was born in 61 and that

01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:28.000
would make him 24 at the time oh so this

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.760
is accept that's not right this is lost

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:31.520
stuff this is sorry it's not that one

01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:33.520
either then that's the one-year-old they

01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:35.520
say your brain before the 24 year old

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:36.560
it's the one it has to be the

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:37.679
one-year-old

01:39:37.679 --> 01:39:40.239
wait no it's the 24 year old and you're

01:39:40.239 --> 01:39:42.560
listening back to this by 2019 standards

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:44.480
this story just makes richard pryor a

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:46.239
homophobic yeah yeah doesn't even make

01:39:46.239 --> 01:39:50.239
paul you violated my adult boy yeah

01:39:50.239 --> 01:39:53.520
my adult my very very especially in the

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:55.440
80s i used to think it wasn't happening

01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:56.960
often because richard junior had to get

01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:58.880
to work you know he was a senior in like

01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:01.119
20 years i [ __ ] james

01:40:01.119 --> 01:40:02.639
it would be suck but i wouldn't say you

01:40:02.639 --> 01:40:04.400
raped him

01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:06.719
he was 24 not the one that he raped no

01:40:06.719 --> 01:40:08.639
you know he's in the one that he raped

01:40:08.639 --> 01:40:10.880
61 that's that's all of richard so when

01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:13.280
he's 24 we could all rape james i feel

01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:14.800
like that's but like i feel like that's

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:16.280
really what if i dated him

01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:17.600
[Laughter]

01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:19.600
not emotionally attached as you're aware

01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:22.920
i wouldn't be here

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:24.719
that's one thing about james you just

01:40:24.719 --> 01:40:25.600
[ __ ] him you know i mean you don't

01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.600
[ __ ] spend any time with him

01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:28.719
i mean he's puerto rican i'm not gonna

01:40:28.719 --> 01:40:30.800
like him

01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:33.119
i'm not gonna like this guy what uh i

01:40:33.119 --> 01:40:34.639
what he said what he goes on to say is

01:40:34.639 --> 01:40:38.000
what saved paul mooney's life was

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.600
the fact that richard fire set himself

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:41.520
on fire that's what distracted i guess

01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:43.600
richard from actually taking it

01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:46.000
on fire we'll do that

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.840
what was i thinking about earlier

01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:49.520
was that in the 80s when did he set

01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:50.960
himself on fire because that's when it

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:52.480
happened that's apparently that's when

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:53.920
it happened that was in the 70s when

01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:55.040
that happened

01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:57.040
late 70s then it makes a little more

01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:58.639
sense because it was like a 16 year old

01:40:58.639 --> 01:41:01.920
kid or 15 or 14 year old kid yeah

01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:03.440
that's the age where that probably makes

01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:05.360
you think about killing someone

01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:07.440
also this [ __ ] poor richard pryor jr

01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:09.119
he's like dude i don't want to really

01:41:09.119 --> 01:41:10.480
share with the world that i was raped by

01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:12.719
paul mooney yeah by paul mooney yeah he

01:41:12.719 --> 01:41:14.800
just kind of like outed that

01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:18.080
prior set himself on fire uh in 1980.

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:20.400
yeah so if this was born was born in 61

01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:23.360
he was like 16 or something not 19 if if

01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:25.760
it was that year but maybe he was

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:27.679
molesting him or hooking up with paul

01:41:27.679 --> 01:41:29.679
mooney was born 41

01:41:29.679 --> 01:41:31.199
which would make him around 40 years old

01:41:31.199 --> 01:41:33.840
at the time i asked him for a a bottle

01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:36.239
opener and uh he had cargo shorts that

01:41:36.239 --> 01:41:38.080
took that was like eight minutes of

01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:39.679
pocket searching

01:41:39.679 --> 01:41:40.719
what happened what did you say bobby the

01:41:40.719 --> 01:41:42.239
last thing i'm sorry

01:41:42.239 --> 01:41:44.639
paul mooney was born in 41 so that makes

01:41:44.639 --> 01:41:46.560
him around 40 at the time

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:47.600
all right

01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:49.280
before he's old enough to consent 40 and

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:51.199
an 18 year old so that's what's going on

01:41:51.199 --> 01:41:52.880
like normal but it's also a little it's

01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:54.159
probably more like richard probably just

01:41:54.159 --> 01:41:56.080
made your own [ __ ] his son and two

01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:57.520
like still there's nothing that his

01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:00.800
son's gay yeah he's probably not

01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:02.960
shane started [ __ ] james when he was

01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:05.679
18. and james are gonna kiss

01:42:05.679 --> 01:42:07.199
just kissing your parents he's gonna pay

01:42:07.199 --> 01:42:09.440
him for sure wait but richard pryor did

01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:11.920
gay [ __ ]

01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:13.040
which what are you talking about his

01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:14.400
last album

01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:16.239
no didn't he be in black i know you

01:42:16.239 --> 01:42:18.239

do you think of eddie murphy training no

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.840

01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:23.520
just came out that he had gay sex with

01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:24.400
people

01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:26.159
with marlon brando wait that's not

01:42:26.159 --> 01:42:28.639
basically

01:42:33.119 --> 01:42:34.320
you guys are saying that because you do

01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:35.760
gay stuff and you're trying to defend

01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:37.440
this [ __ ] you're going to do something

01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:39.520
in a hot room very funny

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:42.400

second ago as well all right what's this

01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:47.199

01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:51.040
digital chat so like you don't that's my

01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:52.560
new york times you don't do that for

01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:53.600
jokes

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:55.600
gas digital chat reports i pay almost

01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:57.199
eight dollars a month for that that's

01:42:57.199 --> 01:42:59.119

01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:10.960
for everyone

01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:16.800

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:25.040
pryor was

01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:27.360
accept that much too maybe he needs to

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:29.119
feel maybe it's what he needs to feel

01:43:29.119 --> 01:43:31.679
she hurts himself you have it all

01:43:31.679 --> 01:43:34.000

01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:50.880
and richard pryor that's not gay that's

01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:53.360
just greatness it's just two comets

01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:55.600
colliding too yeah

01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:58.080
why can't gay be great dude icon oh

01:43:58.080 --> 01:43:59.440
because gay can be great because it's a

01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:00.560
sin

you know it's an abomination come on you

01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:04.400

yeah it's uh if we're going to start

01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:08.000

he's getting really nice

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.920
really he's really into hate like yeah

01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:41.440
that's his role we're gonna pay him the

01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:42.960
jerk off and then he starts jerking off

01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:44.080
the guy and then we take the money back

01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:46.320

01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:47.440
it it's great you just get to come and

01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:49.190
then take the money back

01:44:49.190 --> 01:44:53.560
[Laughter]

01:44:54.639 --> 01:44:55.679
i mean

01:44:55.679 --> 01:44:57.280
it's good writing it's like bob the

01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:58.560
builder and then you know beating the

01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:00.560
[ __ ] out of the prostitutes

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:02.400
pretty much these things just but just

01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:03.600
the trans ones you know the real chicks

01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:04.719
with dick stuff you know i mean the

01:45:04.719 --> 01:45:06.000
freaks

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.560
i let them lay them out yeah so

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:09.920
the

01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:12.000
i mean look in a man i really always

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.840
side with men but because the gay black

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:15.040
man i don't know how to feel about

01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:16.719
siding with him that's a good point you

01:45:16.719 --> 01:45:18.560
know so it's like usually i believe all

01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:19.440
men

01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:20.960
yeah but he's got a couple strikes going

01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:23.440
into this so you don't believe in gabley

01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:24.880
barely believe anything you say you just

01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:28.159
say you what was it you believe all men

01:45:28.159 --> 01:45:30.000
philosophy is believe all men but in a

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.760
gay couple it's like whoa i believe

01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:33.600
who's the man here let's finish the

01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:35.760
video what do you consider a black man

01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:37.360
it's like a black man's three-fifths of

01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:39.600
a man a gay man's one fifth all right

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:41.440
four-fifths of a man four-fifths of a

01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:45.480
man i would consider a gay black man

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.760
there's almost one guy

01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:48.960
fine all right fine three and a half

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:50.480
inches man shane's right that's a little

01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:51.600
bit too much we're gonna look generous

01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:53.440
with this game okay what does that have

01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:54.880
you're right we should dial back three

01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:57.360
and a half fifths of uh man thank you

01:45:57.360 --> 01:45:58.960
shane quote that i'm not gonna

01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:00.239
understand ironically we really need an

01:46:00.239 --> 01:46:01.840
asian burst yeah i don't know i don't

01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:03.440
understand i don't understand this thing

01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:06.560
saying adds to be gay no it takes away

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:08.639
three and a half fifths no you're saying

01:46:08.639 --> 01:46:10.239
it's more than three facts yeah but

01:46:10.239 --> 01:46:11.760
three-fifths of a man is a black man

01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:14.080
he's black then another half a fifth of

01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:15.679
a man as a gay man so he's three and a

01:46:15.679 --> 01:46:16.880
half fifths

01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:18.000
yeah

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.920
half of his so you're taking away some

01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:21.040
of his man points for being again i've

01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:23.199
never seen fractions on top of fractions

01:46:23.199 --> 01:46:24.800
like that so will you say two-fifths of

01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:27.840
a man gay black man two point five okay

01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:29.199
enough to get a kick

01:46:29.199 --> 01:46:30.880
shane is that okay two point five not

01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:33.360
saying anything [ __ ] uh

01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:34.960
no no i'm just high and i don't i

01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:36.560
literally [ __ ] you don't think that's

01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:40.360
high okay all right

01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:46.639
i thought you were progressive dude i

01:46:46.639 --> 01:46:48.560
love the gay blacks you love you love

01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:50.159
gay black i love gay blacks well if you

01:46:50.159 --> 01:46:51.440
left two of them that's equal to one

01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:53.520
regular man really no it's like three

01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:55.440
and a half no we said two-fifths of a

01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:56.719
man that's happened we agreed but shane

01:46:56.719 --> 01:46:58.560
said it was less

01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:01.119
i don't i have no idea two five shane

01:47:01.119 --> 01:47:02.880
two-fifths of a match we finished the

01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:03.760
video

01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:05.440
you see a gay black couple you're like

01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:08.639
dude that dude's pretty jacked

01:47:08.639 --> 01:47:09.840
i want to see the rest of the gut what

01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:12.239
the guy says

01:47:13.670 --> 01:47:17.040
[Laughter]

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:18.800
the biggest problem with those people

01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:20.639
would have been you saying a million

01:47:20.639 --> 01:47:22.159
dollars to them because they would have

01:47:22.159 --> 01:47:24.960
did it for like 10 grand right and so i

01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:27.280
got to figure out what i was going to do

01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:28.560
and this is your first time hearing

01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:30.400
about this system that was the first one

01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:32.320
he told me the first time

01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:33.840
i feel like you'd struggle with it too

01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:36.159
so this is a good impression 990 000

01:47:36.159 --> 01:47:39.119
yeah [ __ ] [ __ ] conversation

01:47:39.119 --> 01:47:41.600
but because he was so adamant about it i

01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:43.600
asked him again that wednesday and then

01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:46.080
he went into detail and that's when he

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:49.199

01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:55.040
between paul moody and his son he's

01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:56.960

01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:01.760
rapist

01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:03.840
he's just a boy i know my son's not gay

01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:05.600
that's a hater

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:07.360
there's no way this is consensual it's

01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:10.159

01:48:28.719 --> 01:48:30.080
he was hurt

01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:32.560
because it happened to his son and he

01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:34.800
was really hurt which i don't think paul

01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:36.719
mooney understood because

01:48:36.719 --> 01:48:38.800

01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:56.159
wow okay

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.920
in his defense he didn't ask a question

01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:07.760
that was even kind of getting into it

01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:10.920
was your favorite

01:50:18.159 --> 01:50:20.239
but that was a roundabout though that

01:50:20.239 --> 01:50:22.159
was my favorite movie yeah

01:50:22.159 --> 01:50:25.119
i like it was good dog

01:50:25.119 --> 01:50:26.400
i'm sorry i'm gonna have to dig deeper

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:28.800
on that middle part so with that paul

01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:31.119
mooney raped richard pryor's son yeah

01:50:31.119 --> 01:50:34.880
ribs you know have sex with him whatevs

01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:37.119
oh potato potato really

01:50:37.119 --> 01:50:39.040
good

01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:41.440
happened to his son

01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:43.040
okay

01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:44.880
wow and this is his son was like young

01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:47.599
at the time yeah richie jr yeah it's

01:50:47.599 --> 01:50:49.280
richard that's confirmed

01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:53.440
rewinding us discussing that prior asked

01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:56.800
or requested was looking for someone to

01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:57.760
pretty much

01:50:57.760 --> 01:50:59.679
put a hit on right

01:50:59.679 --> 01:51:02.480
for a million dollars

01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:04.400
it didn't and you you know years later

01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:06.800
did not happen was there a reason why it

01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:08.560
didn't happen because richard caught on

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:11.280
fire richard byrne and that's what saved

01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:13.760
paul mooney's life today present day is

01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:16.239
because richard caught on fire and then

01:51:16.239 --> 01:51:19.440
that became the primary before that

01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:21.520
it was paul mooney

01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:23.920
you did this to my son

01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:25.599
it was betrayal

01:51:25.599 --> 01:51:27.920
my son

01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:29.440
and then you pretended like it didn't

01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:30.719
happen so

01:51:30.719 --> 01:51:33.280
had richard not caught on fire

01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:34.960
paul mooney would not be here he

01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:37.119
wouldn't be living did rich ever uh i

01:51:37.119 --> 01:51:38.719
guess his son came to him prior junior

01:51:38.719 --> 01:51:40.639
came to him about the incident or

01:51:40.639 --> 01:51:42.800
was it caught on like surveillance uh uh

01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:44.800
um i don't think it was on surveillance

01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:46.639
i don't think paul was that stupid but

01:51:46.639 --> 01:51:48.400
somewhere along the way richard found

01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:52.639
out um yeah and i remember

01:51:52.639 --> 01:51:55.920
letting richard jr know

01:51:55.920 --> 01:51:57.760
here's how your father thought about it

01:51:57.760 --> 01:51:59.599
richard cried then because he didn't

01:51:59.599 --> 01:52:02.080
think his father knew

01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:03.840
and i said your father

01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:05.840
this is what he wanted done to paramount

01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:06.880
yeah

01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:08.719
all that happened by the way

01:52:08.719 --> 01:52:10.639
you kind of like you know seeing your

01:52:10.639 --> 01:52:11.920
father and hearing about your father

01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:13.440
being involved in a hit of murdering a

01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:15.360
guy is a lot to take in too

01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:16.719
somebody goes how much your son your

01:52:16.719 --> 01:52:18.400
father loved you he was going to murder

01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:20.400
the guy who did this to you and then he

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:22.639
just didn't my boyfriend

01:52:22.639 --> 01:52:23.840
okay

01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:25.280
i don't know he was going to murder that

01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:26.880
guy man he caught on fire that kind of

01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:28.639
put the kibosh

01:52:28.639 --> 01:52:29.920
yeah but then every time he thought

01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:31.119
about getting like a murderer he was

01:52:31.119 --> 01:52:33.440
like my skin is literally burning i

01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:34.880
don't know if you guys know but they put

01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:36.800
him out eventually and then his son was

01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:38.560
still raped by paul moon

01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:40.000
that's my point at some point richard

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.840
probably don't do several movies after

01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:43.599
that when you light yourself on fire it

01:52:43.599 --> 01:52:45.599
really puts things into perspective yeah

01:52:45.599 --> 01:52:46.719
i don't know

01:52:46.719 --> 01:52:49.199
it's not as valuable

01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:51.599
my son's just gay oh man look everyone's

01:52:51.599 --> 01:52:53.119
the same age when you're on fire you

01:52:53.119 --> 01:52:55.360
know what i mean you just put albums out

01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:57.199
after that it's like i don't know he

01:52:57.199 --> 01:52:58.960
wanted paul mooney killed then he set

01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:00.400
himself on fire that kind of went out

01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:01.440
the window then i was like you still

01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:03.119
want to kill paul mooney and he was like

01:53:03.119 --> 01:53:04.719
you think this is funny that he did then

01:53:04.719 --> 01:53:06.480
he did so you know he will hear now he's

01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:08.000
hanging out with gene wilder's around

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:09.520
the house

01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:11.280
he was talking to hitman and some pretty

01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:13.119
crazy gang members and then also gene

01:53:13.119 --> 01:53:15.520
wilder was hanging out more often

01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:16.639
i don't know just got lost in the

01:53:16.639 --> 01:53:20.239
shuffle gee wilder yeah it just got lost

01:53:20.239 --> 01:53:21.920
in the show just like you know settling

01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:23.520
the score for your son

01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:25.280
that's what i mean [ __ ] after

01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:26.800
he got on fire and then all of a sudden

01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:28.400
like your son's butthole just didn't

01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.320
hold much value to him anymore

01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:32.159
this guy's story doesn't hold up

01:53:32.159 --> 01:53:34.080
they were having gay sex i don't think

01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:35.280
they were having i don't think there was

01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:36.480

01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:38.480

01:53:47.199 --> 01:53:48.800
outrageous liar at the end of it he's

01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:49.840

bodyguards are literally dude this guy

01:53:56.159 --> 01:53:57.920
was a bouncer at the first bar richard

01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:00.320
pryor started at yes that's who

mooney ain't rape no kids

01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:13.760
i'm just [ __ ] with him

01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:15.520
look i know i i know you guys believe it

01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:18.480
because he would have said it happened

01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:20.159
i knew it was evil

01:54:20.159 --> 01:54:21.920
you look gay you look a little silly in

01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:23.520
the people silly in the shorts you know

01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:24.960
what i'm saying a little like the

01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:27.440
loafers

01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:29.920
it's just gamer sean here

01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:32.639
i said what's up toast hues

01:54:32.639 --> 01:54:33.760
all right well

01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:36.080
that's it i believe him i believe his

01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:37.760
perspective believe all men believe i

01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:40.639
believe from his perspective that he

01:54:40.639 --> 01:54:43.760
believes that that was rape

01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:45.599
but i think what really happened was

01:54:45.599 --> 01:54:47.040
this 18 year old kid you think richard

01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:48.560
pryor believes right

01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:51.280
i think but in that time in 1978 or

01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:53.280
whatever no now do you think richard

01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:55.520
pryor currently believes it was rape

01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:57.520
um i i think that

01:54:57.520 --> 01:54:59.360
at the time he was just like yeah you're

01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:01.119
like raping myself i get the sentiment

01:55:01.119 --> 01:55:02.719
of like your if your 18 year old

01:55:02.719 --> 01:55:04.880
daughter like if one of your friends was

01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:06.639
[ __ ] you're eating a daughter ah this

01:55:06.639 --> 01:55:09.679
is a weird time to bring it up

01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:11.760
oh gee that reminds me this totally

01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:13.119
reminds me but i'd rather do this with

01:55:13.119 --> 01:55:14.719
witnesses around you sort of get the

01:55:14.719 --> 01:55:16.000
senate who isn't jay we all know you

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.360
don't have a million dollars to spend on

01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:19.679
a hit and this is maybe richard

01:55:19.679 --> 01:55:21.920
catch on fire

01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:23.360
but maybe richard was way ahead of his

01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:24.320
time because it's sort of like this

01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:26.000
thing where he's like yeah freebasing

give a [ __ ] it's miss league

01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:55.360
story

01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:57.119
hold on hold on if there's a newspaper

01:56:57.119 --> 01:56:58.480
article that says

01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:01.520
you know man 49 rapes 16 year old girl

01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:02.480
you're not thinking that they had a

01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:03.760
consensual relationship you're thinking

01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:05.199
that he raped their interests

01:57:05.199 --> 01:57:06.719
he took advantage or manipulation the

01:57:06.719 --> 01:57:08.719
point you're making is that 18 how far

01:57:08.719 --> 01:57:11.199
off is from 16 yes he's manipulating

01:57:11.199 --> 01:57:14.480
nobody is defending this

01:57:14.719 --> 01:57:17.040
if they had gay sex

01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:19.679
ladies and gentlemen of the church

01:57:19.679 --> 01:57:22.679
absolutely

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.360
is he guilty of rape you're guilty of

01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:37.199
slander yeah

01:57:37.199 --> 01:57:40.159
it's not even that bad

01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:42.159
all right disable the kids follow this

01:57:42.159 --> 01:57:44.239
case all the way through yeah

01:57:44.239 --> 01:57:45.520
i'd like to know

01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:48.400
rejected us old enough to bleed v old

01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:50.719
enough to butcher

01:57:50.719 --> 01:57:52.639
i'm just saying i don't believe that if

01:57:52.639 --> 01:57:55.040
they had consensual gay sex i understand

01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:56.560
there's a manipulative grooming thing

01:57:56.560 --> 01:57:59.199
there it's [ __ ] up but i wouldn't it's

01:57:59.199 --> 01:58:01.920
very misleading to say that of course

01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:03.840
but isn't it like

01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:06.320
uh i don't actually know but it doesn't

01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:07.840
dan isn't dane it should be called

01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:09.280
statutory relationship like that

01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:11.040
dangerous girlfriend is like or maybe

01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:12.800
she's 20 but they met when she was like

01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:14.480
18 or something like that okay yeah dane

01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:17.599
cook's a baller yeah

01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:20.639
but it is funny that it's like one year

01:58:20.639 --> 01:58:22.560
off from what we would like people would

01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:23.920
just go like probably less you're a

01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:25.840
criminal you should go forever everybody

01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:28.000
