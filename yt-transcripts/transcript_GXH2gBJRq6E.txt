00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.459

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.319
how about the cowboy who just sat up

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.299
front a tank top and drank whiskey is a

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:51.690
baller

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.400
that was crazy yeah I was that guy

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.870

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.049
best sex she's ever had in her life she

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.609
definitely whoever I don't know who was

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.680
lucky enough to have him to receive his

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.230
seat he either gave a girl like the best

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.780
night of her life or just like you know

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.250
paid a visit to the ex-girlfriend and I

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.459
got like chase I think he was running

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.000
through backyards at something he sat

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.530
front row and just drank whiskey

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.840
straight in a tank top bro in a tank top

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.690

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.079
[ __ ] jack - he was he was he wasn't

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.940
like you know a lot of the mass he was

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.079

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.299
jacked [ __ ] pit bull of a dude yeah

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.970
chillin up front a tank top getting

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.620
hammered on empty seats next to him I

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.209
think somebody might have stood him up

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.260
you think so

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.760
they probably it was probably a blind

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.250
date or like a tinder Meetup and then

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.900
they saw him standing in line and a tank

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.069
top and like I was about to say you

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.349
think taxis on the road I'm up front in

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.950
a tank top and they're like but yeah the

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.220
show was good those dudes standing up

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.349
tank top - she just got scared it was

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:59.910
like Truelove's holy [ __ ] I'm wearing a

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.010
tank top as well no tank tops are like

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.870
yeah it's like the opposite side of a

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.639
massive dude it's like when you try to

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.349
put the opposite sides of a magnet there

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.389
just do not well that's also aggressive

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.340
that's too powerful if you if some dude

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.199
rolls up and fall in a tank top

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.569
it's like a safety thing oh you're a

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.130
date and some dudes in a tank top you're

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.310
just kind of like like no like the

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.449
eventually you're gonna get hit

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.520
something's gonna happen you eventually

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.370
there is a hit maybe not tonight but

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.669
just down the road if

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.800
you might be degreed like I said how he

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.810

coming outside of historical context

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.330
yeah you know too much history well

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:37.860
that's your [ __ ] curse that is just

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.600
the idea of like in a military escort in

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.040
a Saturday night hilarious you just know

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:41.670
too much history

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:48.600
yeah is what it is but yeah then I

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.490
watched I watched Watchmen last night

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:53.610
you know I heard bad things it's still

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:55.950
like it's totally just black people

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.440
killing or like it's like all about that

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.640
well it's all about race mm-hmm and then

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.040
I was like whoever wrote this is

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:09.450

and a honky man yeah yeah I mean I

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.690
respect the hustle it's crazy if you're

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:26.160
just like hey you know that cool super

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.630
superhero comic book what if we just

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:31.080
made it cool black superheroes versus

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.020
the Klan yeah perfect

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.360
we're gonna empower them we'll make

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.270
millions sure white Devils dude I'm

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:41.010
telling you man I'd like you that that

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.070
whole thing of like people inciting a

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:46.320
racial disharmony it's like why are

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.360
these companies keep doing this mmm I

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.800
don't think people are really that into

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.280
it yeah they could have done a [ __ ]

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.420
they could have done like a really cool

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.070
thing about because in the beginning and

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:58.740
opens with black Wall Street getting

00:16:58.740 --> 00:16:59.670
attacked

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:01.110
I don't do you know anything about I've

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:05.430
heard about that like in Tulsa started

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:09.230
because a black dude got arrested for

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:14.400
getting a white lady okay no getting

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.350
really I think he got her asked her out

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:18.630
she said yes it was probably that okay

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:19.949
this is probably like an Emmett Till

00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:23.250
like it's just a wolf whistle yeah but

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:26.400
then he was a bunch of hog he's got

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.230
upset and I think he almost got lynched

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:31.770
or was about to get lynched and a bunch

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:32.850
of black people showed up and just

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:36.210
started firing some guns dude in Tulsa

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:38.070
they're like you're not just gonna Lynch

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.540
someone so they shot a bunch of hongki's

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.300
10 hongki's got shot and like we were

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.880
just kidding and then the hongki's went

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.580
wild in Tulsa and just destroyed the

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:53.260
city why killed like almost a thousand

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:57.160
people but they had a plane dude and

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:57.670
ride a plane

00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:59.350
no honkies when they attacked the

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.690
blackmailer at the plane they used a

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.780
plane hold on so that they were there

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.060
they have blamed owing like bombs on the

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.560
town so there was like a bunch of like

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.450
greaser type white dudes just chillin

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:11.800

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.690
girlfriend you saw it like yeah come on

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:14.530

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:15.760
and they went and chased these dudes

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.290
down that's like when you like when

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:18.160
you're little and you keep throwing

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.630
rocks at of bees nests and you get stung

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.340
so they came back and then we're just

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.130
like [ __ ] it they you saw it they hit

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.390
they shot us we got to go now

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:30.400
yeah just bought [ __ ] the town then they

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.090
yeah like women and children really so

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.760
they could have done a really cool

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.350
documentary about that yeah but instead

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:41.320
they just xuan - that into a comic book

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.650
in the watch man yeah so that's the

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.290
start of the whole thing yeah the watch

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:52.240
we're gonna watch the honky yes

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.030
that's literally this yet holy yeah yeah

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:56.710
like we gotta keep an eye on these honky

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:58.900
Devils like even the ones you trust are

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.330
[ __ ] Klansmen funny like open

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:02.440
people's closet and there's like a

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.540
Klansman robe with like a badge on it

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.450
cuz it's the sheriff it's like why is he

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:09.430
wearing the badge on his clansmen robe

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:12.100
that doesn't defeats the robe kind of

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.810
yeah that's guy sure yeah they help

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:15.550
sports numbers their last names yeah

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:18.280
yeah yeah but uh I don't know I don't

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.330
have a problem with the show I think the

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.070
show's okay I think it could be good I

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.750
think it's it's weird I kind of like

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:23.980
that but mm-hmm

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.560
I knew it was hongki's behind it when I

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:27.760
was watching I was like I guarantee

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.120
these are White's evil dirty whites for

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.490
sure making money off this

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.910
I do my thing is like I don't know that

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:38.530
there is that much demand then again I

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:40.510
don't know what's that I think about the

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:44.080
demand for like that I don't think

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.370
watchman's getting great reviews

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:47.260
no all right it'll probably get good

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.880
reviews but not a good audience score

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.280
okay you know it's all those typically

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.540
work oh yeah I've talked about it before

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.200
where they're redoing the

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.560
like the the statistics like the ethnic

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.030
statistics in America and it's going

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.070
pretty is getting to be like 50% white

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:04.370
50% Latino black Asians all so they're

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:07.010
like I guess but I just I don't know

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:08.900
dude I feel like that shit's gotta be

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.750
just weird like constantly yeah it's

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.940
like Braveheart part 27 it's like all

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.460
right to Jesus yeah yeah I don't know

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.780
maybe they get I don't I don't know who

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.130
like how many people still get stoked on

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.040
it if they're like dude this is weird I

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.480
don't know I mean if I was black I'll be

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.810
watching that [ __ ] like I'd be so baby I

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:30.470
mean you know it's good and it's

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:32.120
interesting I like the way the Watchmen

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.860
does like it's like a revisionist

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.860
history of course I like somehow that I

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.720
think one of them I think something that

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.340
happens at least in the movie was like

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.760
the Nazis won or something and the

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.700
United States is still run by Nixon like

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.970
he never left okay and we won Vietnam

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:53.150
now it's a state oh it's kind of cool

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:54.470
that's pretty neat so that's part of the

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:57.350
debauch min world yeah yeah it's also

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.750
weird to to like go fishing around for

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.850
like negative events in history and then

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:05.000
spin like the whole yarn from that it's

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.860
kind of like I don't know do you do that

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.840
with like anybody else yeah it'd be

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.510
tough and then start a movie with like

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:14.600
something like horrible so like Jesse

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.860
Jackson calling for like the death of

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:23.510
Jews you ever see that Jaime tempt yeah

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.700
yeah yeah okay got killed he was like

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.500
they're selling this jewelry and they're

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.890
going to Israel everyone's like yeah I

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:32.300
think he was running for president at

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.940
the time yeah Jesse Jackson or is that

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:39.080
uh knows Al Sharpton I think Al Sharpton

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.480
went bloc was I think it was Jesse

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.490
Jackson was it could be wrong one of

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:45.320
them was Sharpton went ham on the Jews

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.880
before one of them was running for

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.470
president and called it hi

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:50.120
Jaime town though that was different

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.070
Jesse Jackson did that and everyone's

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:53.420
like huh yeah

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.210
al Sharpton there was a kid got killed

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:59.290

I kid got killed and or somebody got

00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:05.929

skinned cats I think there was like a

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:03.850
revolution where the peasants just went

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:05.530
around skinning cats and throwing them

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:08.830
at rich people what think yeah pretty

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:11.830
sick that's I've told you before that's

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:13.120
where the expression let the cat out of

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.270
the bag comes from what's that back in

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.730
the medieval times used to like buy a

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:21.310

there's some dishonest merchants so you

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:32.890
let the cat out the bag open it from the

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:34.090
merchants let the cat out of the bag

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:36.040

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.760
like murder him

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.670

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:44.100

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.350

there's like a [ __ ] yeah and

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:56.010
then also what's funny is historically

00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:57.840
how those like tyrants would put put

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.640

yeah and now there's too much firepower

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.100
back then it was like four guards like a

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.660
musket they could drop atom bombs

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:13.950

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.960
party time and then he you know [ __ ]

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.610
had to do a bit he got locked up some

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:17.720
[ __ ] doing crack and flying the IRS

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.490
here's what you do wait so if you owe

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:22.980
the IRS and then go to jail do you still

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:24.750
own somebody sure when you get out yeah

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:25.919
I'm pretty sure there's yeah they don't

00:32:25.919 --> 00:32:27.600
they don't stop they're not like what

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.000
happened oh yeah but if you go to jail

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.280
for that it freezes no he didn't go to

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.130
jail for that no but like Snipes I'm

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:36.360
pretty sure yeah I don't think the IRS

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.160
is like I think they come get their

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:38.760
money too

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.880
yeah I think Snipes is doing is there

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.410
difference between federal tax evasion

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:45.480
or something I don't know cuz how hard

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.790
you got know anything about taxes it's

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:49.380
kind of [ __ ] up to lock someone up for

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.710
taxes yeah also that is [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:55.260
dude cuz they lock Snipes up but then

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:56.970

00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:58.950
pain like shuffling money to like

Trump dogs should suit up well people

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.140
are talking about the world stage and

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.339
like how does Trump look on the world

00:41:51.339 --> 00:41:52.690
stage it's like bro you're talking about

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:53.170
the king of

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:54.640
Jordan Kim jong-un they're probably

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:59.710
truffles Trump suit adopted he needs to

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:01.150
go over he needs to go over we think

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:02.319
Trump would suit up with that beautiful

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:05.020
canine that he calls a dog did you see

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:06.130
how far it's so funny

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:08.829
he's a canine the one wounded was a

00:42:08.829 --> 00:42:11.440
canine I call it a dog very beautiful

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:15.819
dog I just don't understand how it's

00:42:15.819 --> 00:42:18.549
funny a dog almost died like a dog true

00:42:18.549 --> 00:42:20.680
that's how dogs die dude mindlessly

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:24.010
serving the [ __ ] military well how

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:27.190
old is uh I think the feedback I was

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:28.690
like the blowback against that is like

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:30.099
this could have been his good moment but

00:42:30.099 --> 00:42:32.710
he ruined it it's like of course it is

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:35.770
also I don't think yeah I thought I

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:36.970
thought his speech was kind of [ __ ]

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:39.099
sick dude I didn't see I saw a little

00:42:39.099 --> 00:42:40.390
parts of it and was just laughing though

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:41.920
I saw the whole part he was like look

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:44.410
dude he's crying Trump Trump's like the

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:47.260
you yeah you documentary where they like

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.910
they scored touchdowns and dance they're

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:50.980
up 50 they're dancing it's like dude if

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:52.420
you want to stop him keep him out of the

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:54.280
end zone bro you were to stop Trump from

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.069
dancing and hot dog Keef Malians Oh true

00:42:57.069 --> 00:42:58.990
he keeps scoring dude I mean that was a

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:00.369
big deal they killed that guy I don't

00:43:00.369 --> 00:43:02.170
know anything about that is a big deal

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:04.569
apparently he's a bad dude he wasn't bad

00:43:04.569 --> 00:43:06.400
where they were like Isis is cool New

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:07.809
York Times doing Isis it's cool last

00:43:07.809 --> 00:43:09.369
year for a little bit then they started

00:43:09.369 --> 00:43:10.420
being like hey guys remember I say

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:12.040
remember they're bad and then he killed

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.750
the dude supposedly he was like the main

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:16.299
Isis guy and everyone's like you have to

00:43:16.299 --> 00:43:18.490
be a [ __ ] dick about it it's like all

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:21.730
right you got him to brag about it now

00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:25.270
hard that dude was a fine yeah I mean I

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:27.430
don't know by actually they had maps of

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:29.200
all they were like he ran through the

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.569
tunnels which we all had maps of yeah so

00:43:31.569 --> 00:43:33.490
they could like also do that was the

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:34.799
thing I was thinking of - it's like

00:43:34.799 --> 00:43:38.319
imagine if Trump just invaded Indiana it

00:43:38.319 --> 00:43:39.910
was just like right through it so if

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:41.230
he's like going there fighting those

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:42.609
guys I think it's actually a lot easier

00:43:42.609 --> 00:43:46.869
than they let on what do you mean like

00:43:46.869 --> 00:43:48.520
you met like so imagine like a small on

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.710
equip town in Indiana if I got the

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:52.270
military force like you were sick of

00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:54.460
rural like a [ __ ] town in the middle of

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:56.770
like down in the south yeah that's kind

00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:58.210
of like where they're going to fight

00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:04.150
over there so imagine how I mean I guess

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:06.640
all this way yeah

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.680
or yeah way less wallet way more lawless

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:12.009
it'd be and also like the the regions

00:44:12.009 --> 00:44:14.140
are [ __ ] shitty like it's I don't

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:16.720
know a lot of Craig's a lot of dude I

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.519
just saw like stone driveways I'm like

00:44:18.519 --> 00:44:20.109
this would be like invading Maryland you

00:44:20.109 --> 00:44:22.299
just roll right through we have a secret

00:44:22.299 --> 00:44:23.710
fort like yeah [ __ ] we've been

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:25.529
watching this for like six months yeah

00:44:25.529 --> 00:44:30.759
yes your secret fort but also hide from

00:44:30.759 --> 00:44:35.680
your parents there's a you know there's

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.539
other countries like we'd to fly through

00:44:37.539 --> 00:44:39.730
Russian we had to be like Russia dude

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:42.369
let us fly through with armed people

00:44:42.369 --> 00:44:44.440
when they say look what are you guys

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:50.069
doing I can't tell you but let us do it

00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:53.289
he got real close to being like yeah

00:44:53.289 --> 00:44:56.410
Russia [ __ ] had to listen he almost

00:44:56.410 --> 00:44:58.569
he started talking some [ __ ] on Russia

00:44:58.569 --> 00:45:01.930
but he was right that he was like oh

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:03.759
yeah Russia wants these guys dead just

00:45:03.759 --> 00:45:06.009
as much as we do so it's kind of easy to

00:45:06.009 --> 00:45:08.019
cooperate with Russia chill you know

00:45:08.019 --> 00:45:09.759
well the funny thing is is that it's

00:45:09.759 --> 00:45:11.259
like so okay so there's Baghdady

00:45:11.259 --> 00:45:12.430
but I think you had to fly through like

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:14.859
Turkish Russian like all these different

00:45:14.859 --> 00:45:16.960
air spaces that we lack will shoot you

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:18.489
down if you fly through and they're like

00:45:18.489 --> 00:45:20.650
guys guys we're gonna do something cool

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:22.749

00:45:22.749 --> 00:45:24.700

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:26.019
tell you later I'll tell you that okay

00:45:26.019 --> 00:45:29.230
do the I mean it's funny because there's

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:31.809
like you know the Baghdady guy is like

00:45:31.809 --> 00:45:33.400
this guy's of ruthless tyrant how you

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.140
look at a ruthless tyrant religious

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:38.230
austere holy man there's like Kim

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:40.569
jong-un is leader over there so it's

00:45:40.569 --> 00:45:42.339
like they're like Trump's like you know

00:45:42.339 --> 00:45:44.140
it's very complicated or whatever like

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:46.210
he's a [ __ ] war criminal all this you

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:46.920
know crazy

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:50.259
Putin horrible person every leader of

00:45:50.259 --> 00:45:51.869
every country for the most part is

00:45:51.869 --> 00:45:55.119
considered like a wild psychopath and

00:45:55.119 --> 00:45:57.160
then the United States is kind of like

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.960
for the you know if besides Trump

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.759
everyone just kind of like now we're

00:46:00.759 --> 00:46:03.279
good guys we thought yeah yeah it's like

00:46:03.279 --> 00:46:06.069
you so we have bases in these areas

00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:08.739
ruled by predominantly wild Psychopaths

00:46:08.739 --> 00:46:10.749
we surround their little like

00:46:10.749 --> 00:46:12.849
strongholds and we're you're telling us

00:46:12.849 --> 00:46:14.200

America over here just funny it's just

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:20.110
funny to think about we're pretty good

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:21.250
I mean I would say we don't you know

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:22.630
we're not burning people live in cages

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:25.930

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:28.210
that he did it burn people alive in

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:30.940
cages the that was Isis was they were

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:33.580
their party and it was a very hard they

00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:35.860
were rowdy but also if we didn't have

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:38.800
any money we would do that if the flip

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.810

00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:56.710
expression of someone coming down and

00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:58.570
