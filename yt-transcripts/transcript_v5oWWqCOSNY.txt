00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.079
someone deck

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.000
dude I just you know I have a new lease

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.100
on life I had a reckoning in the bathtub

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.500
the other day I fully comprehended the

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.540
fact that I I could I probably don't

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.940
could have a [ __ ] degenerative brain

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.800
disorder you don't I could have a growth

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.180
yeah I'll be your doctor right now I

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.860
could have a growth hey how are you

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.540
coming to this conclusion because I I

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.339
Googled it yeah Google it but I also

00:14:44.339 --> 00:14:46.260
went to the doctor I've been having very

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.779
things that are very possibly temporal

00:14:48.779 --> 00:14:50.699
lobe seizures which are it's not that

00:14:50.699 --> 00:14:52.199
sounds a lot worse than it is just like

00:14:52.199 --> 00:14:53.399
a weird smell

00:14:53.399 --> 00:14:55.380
so you know look I probably am probably

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.500
fine I'm 99 sure I'm fine but I I just

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.120
faced that one percent possibility that

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.380
I have a humongous brain to him I'm

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.699
gonna die very soon is there any way

00:15:02.699 --> 00:15:04.380
that you see my daughter yourself an

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.820
instructor through life and I cried in

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.500
the bathtub and I've been feeling great

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.699
ever since wait what happened to that

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:10.560
you cried dude I like I was like dude

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.300
what if I do have some [ __ ] up thing

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.459
and I don't get to like Usher my child

00:15:14.459 --> 00:15:16.100
through life yeah

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.440
yeah that's horrible so and then but

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.540
then I said you know what I'm just gonna

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:22.740
[ __ ] I'm just gonna ride this thing

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.120
as hard as I can

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.560
someone's gonna turn the lights on me

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.880
someone's gonna turn the lights off me

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.260
eventually someone shut my lights off

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.360

live laugh love and cry in the tub yeah

00:15:37.199 --> 00:15:38.880

you tell them you were in the industry

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:11.220
I had some waiters and waitresses coming

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:13.379
at me about your thing about not paying

00:34:13.379 --> 00:34:16.760
them I tipped them well I tip them

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.780
well I'll tell you why I took them

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.460
because I just started part of me

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:23.119
[Laughter]

00:34:23.119 --> 00:34:26.240
that's gonna say

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.899
order

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:29.899
um

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:34.159
Oh Shannon come on

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:38.099
oh that was can you yeah you can do that

00:34:38.099 --> 00:34:39.599
I remember that I remember the cool kids

00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:42.480
would do that in my neighborhood

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.859
yeah it's like it's not working

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:48.899
one single black hat on the palm of his

00:34:48.899 --> 00:34:50.520
hand and light it off damn yeah you do

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.260
the bottle I don't know where that was

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.879
that's Billy's yeah do the bottle

00:34:53.879 --> 00:34:55.800
rockets out your hand yeah bad kids yeah

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.859
they're so bad kids so yeah I want it

00:34:58.859 --> 00:35:00.839
the reason I tip so much is because when

00:35:00.839 --> 00:35:02.400
I started at Helium I had zero money

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.020
yeah so like I'd be working a weekend

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.000
and they'd give you free beers and I

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.200
would just not tip them sure because

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.119
first off I was hosting yeah I'd be

00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:11.339
getting 100 200 bucks maybe the whole

00:35:11.339 --> 00:35:12.540
weekend yeah

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.700
and then it got around and some of the

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:16.200
waiters and waitresses at Helium like

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.060
hated me and were like mean about it

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.099
you're poor I was a poor man yeah now I

00:35:20.099 --> 00:35:23.339
come in they're like we love you [ __ ]

00:35:23.339 --> 00:35:26.460
scum you scum that's what I'm saying

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.079
yeah and now whenever I'm out I tip

00:35:28.079 --> 00:35:30.480
excessively I always say well I'm 20 but

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.800
you do not

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.140
well if I don't know I'm a joke I know I

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.240
was like I tip I [ __ ] myself by going

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.859
bro I would tip even when I didn't have

00:35:37.859 --> 00:35:39.660
a lot of money I would tip over high and

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.240
like I remember that's industry code

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.619
like over High whatever what's over High

00:35:43.619 --> 00:35:46.200
over the high yeah like all day in the

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.180
kitchen yeah we got a four armless two

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:51.240
sausages all day so anyway I would do

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:54.660
that and that's over high like over 20 I

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.940
see oh I'm always over yeah yeah you got

00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:58.500
to stay over it but it but I would do it

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.119
but half of it was because I didn't know

00:36:00.119 --> 00:36:01.680
math very well so I would just like

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.599
trying to be like yeah I've missed out a

00:36:03.599 --> 00:36:04.680
couple times I don't know what I'm doing

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.240
so I would always tip high and be like

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.440
wow it's very generous I'm like now it's

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.619
double it

00:36:09.619 --> 00:36:12.000
like there'll be times like oh wow I'm

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.640
like oh [ __ ] yeah damn it I did not yeah

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.020
I tip well but in my head I'm like I

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.520
think we should do it we should I think

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.740
it does a disservice when you uh pay a

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.640
job that high that's that menial

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.640
benefits

00:36:30.359 --> 00:36:31.920
I didn't get [ __ ] benefits forever

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.540
then they complained they're like you

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.339

00:36:35.339 --> 00:36:39.740

00:36:49.859 --> 00:36:52.320
just obviously getting used to it that's

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.119
taxing I'm saying yeah but you don't cry

00:36:54.119 --> 00:36:56.060

00:36:56.060 --> 00:37:00.500

sun all day yeah you're gonna cry I

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.760
think it's more like the way it is you

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.260
know exactly what let's hear from the

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.359
industries what I'm gonna say is that

00:37:30.359 --> 00:37:31.740
you know exactly what the [ __ ] you're

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.480
doing and you're in your element when

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.040
you are dealing with the general [ __ ]

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.480
populace of these [ __ ] animals that

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.920
come in the goddamn building it's way

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.660
different and here's something you've

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:40.859
never had to deal with when you're doing

00:37:40.859 --> 00:37:42.359
this

00:37:42.359 --> 00:37:44.339
yeah you're a busboy but what I'm also

00:37:44.339 --> 00:37:45.240
gonna say is when you're there for

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.680
[ __ ] 13 hours you're dealing with

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.240
another element with people pissing and

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.619
[ __ ] and puking and bleeding all

00:37:49.619 --> 00:37:51.300
over the [ __ ] place that's the

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.680
difference man a lot of people don't

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.660
[ __ ] get that because when you're at

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.940
the goddamn job site you know what

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:58.680
you're doing you don't have to [ __ ]

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.140
deal with other [ __ ] retards you I'm

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.839
[ __ ] telling you dude everybody

00:38:02.839 --> 00:38:05.520
everybody [ __ ] says it and don't get

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.900
me wrong I'm not saying there are

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:08.520
[ __ ] in the industry it's filled in

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.079
Strife with those [ __ ] but the problem

00:38:10.079 --> 00:38:12.320
is

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.599
sits on the industry because like

00:38:18.599 --> 00:38:21.140
I'm pissing

00:38:28.579 --> 00:38:32.160
it is a hard job it is a hard job it is

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.420
if you've never done anything else

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:36.079
that's harder okay I'm not look

00:38:36.079 --> 00:38:39.240
if you've never had any other jobs all

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.160
right all right I'm also speaking from

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.260
fact that I was a bar back I wasn't a

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.000
surf so was I so was I so what I'm not

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.980
you're gonna say on that 13 hour shift

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:48.900
when you're moving a bunch of crap and

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.220
you're also cleaning your birthday to me

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:54.380
someone's diarrhea and someone's puke

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:57.359
yeah that's see you'd quit yeah you

00:38:57.359 --> 00:38:58.740
don't have it because you can you know

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.240
because I was just selling drugs I could

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.780
do whatever I wanted

00:39:02.839 --> 00:39:05.099
I guess I can't [ __ ] compete with

00:39:05.099 --> 00:39:09.140
that I think it is hard

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:12.060
with the fact that you could lose your

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:13.440
job at any minute because someone would

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.240
be like I don't like your attitude use

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.400

I stole a bartender's tips when I was a

00:42:12.599 --> 00:42:15.060

half pound of weed I bet I quit yeah

00:42:29.839 --> 00:42:32.520
when the industry gets disrespected how

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:33.660
do I feel it I'm glad you brought it

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:35.640
because when I've I've been on the I've

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.140
disrespected the industry myself I've

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.540
run into some [ __ ] ass there's too many

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:41.820
antifas in what I'm gonna tell you like

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.619
I said they suck there is a lot of

00:42:43.619 --> 00:42:45.300
shitty people who work in it they're

00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:46.980
they're not gonna get away from that and

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:48.420
you're gonna get away and you're they're

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:50.400
just jerks sometimes they're annoying

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.040
people yeah they shouldn't be in there

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.780
anyway yes but the fact of the matter is

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.220
they're not the Richmond bartender that

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:57.480
guy's actually they're chilling there

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:00.359
are people who are just trying to work

00:43:00.359 --> 00:43:01.560
and get as much money as they can

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.819
because they have other [ __ ] going on

00:43:02.819 --> 00:43:04.740
but when people come in and they're

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:06.119
immediately like oh this guy's working

00:43:06.119 --> 00:43:09.859

00:43:12.839 --> 00:43:14.819

wait what the people do in the industry

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.180
isn't important is that what you're

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:43.740
saying is that what you're surviving no

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:45.780
it's survival microwaves can do what

00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:48.140
they do

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.819
your replacement

just call in yeah it was like a big deal

00:49:09.359 --> 00:49:10.800

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:13.020
they're trying to wipe wait staff way

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:15.060

thieves all first off they're giving

stuff away giving stuff away is how you

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:41.040
build a clientele

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.720
that's how you build a clientele and you

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.819
get regulars that are good you don't

00:49:44.819 --> 00:49:46.020
understand how this game works man

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:48.800

00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:59.660
the sleeves

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:04.819
from a restaurant tours perspective

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.200
who do you think's a bigger restaurant

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.500

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.260

give you a couple ones

00:50:22.859 --> 00:50:25.200
what I'm saying is

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:27.180
I've I've helped open it's like I sailed

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:29.760
a ship the Titanic it was a hell of a

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:32.040
sailing I didn't wait you [ __ ] it up

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.920

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:36.240
[ __ ] it up

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:38.640
yeah man wow yeah jeez dude that was

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:40.079
[ __ ] up all right sorry no it was just

00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:42.180
it was the economy dude yeah the economy

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:44.400
no it was the the staff was just got too

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:46.859
expensive and he had to close it down no

00:50:46.859 --> 00:50:48.119
he sold it he sold it to the dudes that

00:50:48.119 --> 00:50:49.500
worked for him well that's yeah I mean

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:51.540
yeah it still thrives it's wow good it's

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:53.280
still alive but it's not dead what I'm

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.599
trying to say is when you get the macro

00:50:54.599 --> 00:50:55.800
picture

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.660
you see you see the bicker in you see

00:50:57.660 --> 00:50:58.619
the fight and you just go you know what

00:50:58.619 --> 00:51:00.119
it's clean house

00:51:00.119 --> 00:51:01.980
cut them loose you get a new Squad yeah

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:03.240
you're capitalist you get a new crime

00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.119
Tycoon yeah

00:51:05.119 --> 00:51:07.980
that's wildly they get toxic they start

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:09.300
getting like they start getting binds

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:10.380
and fighting I'm telling once they get

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:12.300
home so The Binding in the fight the

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:13.980
fighting is terrible that's you're

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:15.300
always going to deal with that no matter

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.280
who the [ __ ] oh dude especially when you

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.839
own it dude you're hiring slots that

00:51:18.839 --> 00:51:20.579
love Coke and and dudes that love to

00:51:20.579 --> 00:51:23.660
prey on them exactly

00:51:46.339 --> 00:51:48.420
everything everything you're saying

00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:49.980
doesn't really apply to me because I

00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:51.720
don't do any drugs and I never show up

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:54.000
late true that so I never all the things

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.260
that you all these elements you're

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:56.400

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.619
like never I'm always on time or early

00:51:58.619 --> 00:52:01.859
enough sober I don't know let's put it

00:52:01.859 --> 00:52:03.440
this way

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:07.040
let's put it this way

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:10.380
there's not one job I've ever done in

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:12.000
this world where I haven't had a few in

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.520
the chamber oh my God that's the most

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:15.740
that's like

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:17.819
that is it's funny though because that's

00:52:17.819 --> 00:52:19.559
the drunkest dude thing like I'm always

00:52:19.559 --> 00:52:21.380

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.300
I'm never late

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:25.859
always on time I'm never late and I do

00:52:25.859 --> 00:52:27.780
my job accordingly if I [ __ ] up I [ __ ]

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:30.440
up and I own it but dude

00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:32.520

00:52:34.079 --> 00:52:35.880
brain you're goddamn dumb I hear you

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:39.300

00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:41.099
goddamn what do you think about this

00:52:41.099 --> 00:52:43.520

too hard it's like wow is it I don't

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:02.880

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:05.819
Shana with certain parts I am with her

00:53:05.819 --> 00:53:07.980

00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:14.700
biggest issue with this whole thing I

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:16.079
like that people calling it the industry

00:53:16.079 --> 00:53:18.599
I could [ __ ] hate that again I

00:53:18.599 --> 00:53:20.220
despise people gone at the industry to

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:23.099
save restaurants or bars I I don't know

00:53:23.099 --> 00:53:25.020
I don't know why the industry I think of

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.579
like humongous yeah you think of the

00:53:26.579 --> 00:53:28.559
industry I don't know how that got

00:53:28.559 --> 00:53:30.119
adopted there are two things in the

00:53:30.119 --> 00:53:31.980
second in in the bar industry that I

00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:33.420

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:46.200

brother

00:54:49.559 --> 00:54:52.079
I mean you got it again you got to take

00:54:52.079 --> 00:54:54.059
into consideration how much is your job

00:54:54.059 --> 00:54:56.220
that you that the job you perceive and

00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:58.020
how much other [ __ ] you gotta deal with

00:54:58.020 --> 00:54:59.700
and you you got to take your mind the

00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:01.859
match I'm sure a humble Blue Collar guy

00:55:01.859 --> 00:55:03.300
so if you're at the Hawking to him about

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:04.859
this type of big box he doesn't want to

00:55:04.859 --> 00:55:06.180
hear any belly and here's the other

00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:08.400
thing too how much the restaurants pay

00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:10.740
their staff an hour how much do they pay

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:12.960
him an hour right yep what's waste of

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:15.359
like 325 yeah when I first well now it's

00:55:15.359 --> 00:55:17.400
it's up now because of the pandemic

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.240
they're trying to get people to come

00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:20.040
back yeah no one's all the waiters oh

00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:23.460
yeah so that's that's the thing and it

00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:25.800
was also because the clientele got

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:28.500
exponentially worse everyone's a [ __ ]

00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:31.140
[ __ ] now everyone's okay the

00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:32.400
people who come to the [ __ ] bars

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.660
they're terrible they're [ __ ]

00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:34.800
terrible people what do they do they're

01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:49.199
depends on what you see first that's

01:09:49.199 --> 01:09:50.819
also if you're tripping what the [ __ ]

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:51.900

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:13.320
someone just somebody in the industry no

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.300

post I think it's Zulu [ __ ] or

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:08.340
something that's what it's called but

01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:10.800
it's uh I was it was like a jet plane

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:13.380
where the Air Force was working on uh

01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:15.780
ejecting people yeah and the planes are

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:17.460
going too fast so it was tough to figure

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:20.100
out how to get the thing to work so they

01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:22.380
were like testing it out on Bears yeah

01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:24.360
they're just flying the [ __ ] up and

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:26.280
hitting a jack on Bears they're giving

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:28.620
parachutes yeah most of them survived a

01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:31.760
couple died a couple of boys

01:13:45.239 --> 01:13:47.460
oh yeah but then there was what was

01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:49.380
funny about it was in the paragraph on

01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:50.699
the Instagram post it was like they were

01:13:50.699 --> 01:13:53.699
taking guys out of uh like dudes that

01:13:53.699 --> 01:13:55.260
were unemployed were like signing up for

01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:57.239
it oh yeah and they're like testing test

01:13:57.239 --> 01:14:00.739
test the ejections

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:05.699
I heard in the beginning and like uh I

01:14:05.699 --> 01:14:07.260
guess it was in Russia it wasn't in

01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:08.880
America but in Russia when they were

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.560
testing they were like using like

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.420
borderline invalids to go up in the

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:14.280
rocket so like hey look at these monkeys

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:16.260
we're gonna use people because we can't

01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:18.300
design it for like the people going up

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:19.260
the Rockets aren't going to be the size

01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:21.060
of chimps true yeah we got to use people

01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:22.860
so they were just like hey you want to

01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:24.620
make some extra Rubes yeah

01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:27.000

they would tell apparently and again I

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.060
don't know it's like an urban legend

01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:37.440
because they're still orbiting the

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:40.140
planet like the retards from Russia dude

01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:41.340
they would tell them like look you're

01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:43.440
gonna go up there you probably will not

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:46.280
USS yeah

01:14:50.179 --> 01:14:53.280
it's finally reached uh 95 degrees in

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.380
this room oh yeah let's break it up uh

01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:58.980
yeah we'll take a break hour and 12. 14.
