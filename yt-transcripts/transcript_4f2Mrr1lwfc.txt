are all the characters of the bonfire as

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.690
you know well the reason we bring this

01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:57.700

01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:59.830
Danielle bridge only bad baby who talked

01:03:59.830 --> 01:04:02.920
about is uh that's a but what is her age

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:04.300
now officially Christine because I'm

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:07.840
telling you 18 they her producers she's

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.240
not 18 I know her producers do it it

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.090
whoever took her team she got a team

01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:15.100
around her that is doing it right yeah

01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:18.310
because honestly in her Hawken 15 yeah

01:04:18.310 --> 01:04:24.700
she's born in 2003 when I was 58 year

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:26.680
LFO came out with summertime girls oh

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:30.119
man I started working in radio that I

01:04:30.119 --> 01:04:34.030
was a deep into comedy no it's not true

01:04:34.030 --> 01:04:36.970
I was 4 years in but uh she's

01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:38.770
interesting thing because she's got a

01:04:38.770 --> 01:04:40.869
team around her now like they gathered

01:04:40.869 --> 01:04:43.270
around her the right way yeah in that

01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:46.150
even her music she's not overly they'll

01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:47.470
mean they make her look you know good

01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:49.869
they don't over-sexualize her and her

01:04:49.869 --> 01:04:51.940
music yeah she's actually I went but she

01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:54.609
just happens to have mega huge titties

01:04:54.609 --> 01:04:58.330
and a crazy body so she's gonna be

01:04:58.330 --> 01:05:00.369
sexualized by in some fashion no matter

01:05:00.369 --> 01:05:01.720
what but they're not pushing that and

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.580
they're producing the [ __ ] out of her

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:06.340
music so she actually ends up having

01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:08.530
these borderline catchy songs

01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:11.460
alright one of the

01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:58.810
sounds like she sounds like force

01:05:58.810 --> 01:06:05.830
actually anti-drug [ __ ] I'll tell you

01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:07.330
what if you guys know about this but
