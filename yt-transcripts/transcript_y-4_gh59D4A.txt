have to yeah dude I thought I could ski

00:20:26.799 --> 00:20:30.340

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.440
to have a guy on like a jet ski pull you

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.210

the force of me there's people [ __ ]

00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:53.200
cross-country skiing up this slope what

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.360

life dude they're really like trying to

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.980
climb up yeah it's just that's weird

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.429
yeah Ski ski culture he must have been

00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:04.960
sick when people did it as like an

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.600
actual mode of transportation yeah and

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.860
they're like I gotta get into town they

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:18.700
were yeah then my friend made it simple

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.100
things are either for [ __ ] or for pimps

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.830
that's the world you think that's how he

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.320
operates now do you think that sometimes

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.610
people when they do things that they

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:29.260
don't exactly excel at or like these are

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:34.059
for [ __ ] anything I am NOT anything I

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:37.270
can't do that's a good way to do it

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:40.059
though that's how I survived you true if

00:21:40.059 --> 00:21:41.679
I can't do something or be song like

00:21:41.679 --> 00:21:43.480
this [ __ ] guy's gay I see a hot guy

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.970
yeah [ __ ] gay that mean that's true

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:50.220
though why it's gay yeah there's gay

00:21:51.419 --> 00:21:54.040
you're more likely to get [ __ ] or

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.179
[ __ ] other dude

00:21:55.179 --> 00:21:58.149
I don't know how true that is I think so

00:21:58.149 --> 00:22:01.599
why I don't know I just think it's like

00:22:01.599 --> 00:22:03.969
you're gonna have more gay dudes trying

00:22:03.969 --> 00:22:07.179
to [ __ ] you so there that's one thing

00:22:07.179 --> 00:22:09.969
all right and then you might if you're

00:22:09.969 --> 00:22:11.499
like if you get real off on your own

00:22:11.499 --> 00:22:13.749
like persona yeah and like your image

00:22:13.749 --> 00:22:15.070
you probably get real on your own

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:16.719

just laying apparently this is how they

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:09.850
tell people to do lucid dreaming as you

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:10.960
wake yourself up in the middle of the

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.490
night setting alarms like 3:00 in the

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:14.530
morning it splash cold water on your

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:16.300
face and lay back down so you like you

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.740
jar yourself out of sleep but you're

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.690
close enough to falling back in so you

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:21.310
can the way they say to do it is like

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:22.780
there's a bunch of techniques for like

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.520
focusing on like one thought and one is

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.810
like holding on to that as you fall

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:28.120
asleep I'm not a lucid dreamer I can't I

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.430
can't control it but I get the they say

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:31.510
when you're starting to loose a dream

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:32.990
your whole body goes

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:35.809
you're really the vibration no I haven't

00:28:35.809 --> 00:28:37.280
but a lot of people in that sleep

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.720
paralysis documentary talking that's

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.250
what I get I get the vibration and

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:42.350
usually I'd like and I get myself out of

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:44.150
it so I'm laying there I like literally

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:45.800
my dog's the one who woke me up my dog

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:34.400
the head a the indica so then I slip

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.559
into like an actual dream and then I'm

00:30:36.559 --> 00:30:38.179
like it's just some weird I don't even

00:30:38.179 --> 00:30:39.410

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.600
back and forth in my room dreams falling

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.130
back in with all that stuff and then

00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:59.600

the soul in and out a dream to his

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:24.680

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:29.510
was I woke up that next morning it was

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:31.790

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:35.270
tripping really hard the same the same

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:37.100
day I figured out what sleep paralysis

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:38.600
was there's an article on this thing

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.420
like exploding head syndrome which I

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.130
have what's that and I never knew about

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:44.990
it until it like sometimes right when

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:46.280
I'm falling asleep I'll hear like a

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:49.190
super loud bang what super loud like a

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:56.930
bomb holy sea of white flash yeah no me

00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:57.230
neither

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:58.880
that's what it was called there's a

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.290
Wikipedia article about it that's

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:02.180
[ __ ] it I was like oh I have that too

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.770
it's like when I'm falling asleep I'll

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:06.920
hear a loud bang and wake up from above

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.420
right before like with the bang there's

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.450
a loud there's a big flash pretty Wow

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:13.010
I get a thing that's more during my

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:14.330
waking hours for every now and again it

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:15.680
feels like an electric shock out of

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:23.570
nowhere else okay feels like something

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:25.580
misfires in my head the home man but due

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:29.240
to exploding head it's never that scary

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.070
though never like scary so is it more

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:32.360
like is it kind of like the thing where

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.470
you think you're falling really cool

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:35.690
kind of but your head just goes like

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:38.480
there's like a loud noise and you can

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.210

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:02.900
read a little more into the the whole

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:06.390
kids in motion yeah right dude I watched

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:08.250
as soon as we got done with last week's

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:09.690
episode I sat on the couch and watched

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:12.090
the full [ __ ] footage of it and I was

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:14.010
like oh my god we were wrong I felt bad

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:16.350
boy I don't feel bad for trashing the

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:18.420
kids really I mean I don't think you

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:21.060
[ __ ] it's not even I feel the kids

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:23.580
I just feel bad for the fact that I

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:25.500
spoke on something I had I literally I

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.360
didn't even read it in an article I just

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.670
heard about it from you and was like

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:30.330
yeah [ __ ]

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:32.310
somebody then I saw the whole video and

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:34.530
I was like god dammit man yeah I hate

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:36.330
that I did that you'd me too

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:38.400
very might as a very cheap like behavior

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.930
we got we got struck by that we got

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:41.820
compromised I know we were compromised

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:43.800
well the [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah well it's

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:46.890
also - it's like that was crazy the news

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:49.710
apparently got that whole video that's

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:52.050
great and then edited it or edited

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:54.150
imitated whatever how the [ __ ] you say

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:56.510
that edited they used editing software

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:59.040
so then they added that they edited that

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:02.100
thing down and ended just like that kid

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.290
smiling at a Native American dude smack

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:06.270
in a drum the kid that was standing

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:06.630
there

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:09.780
yeah and that old guy walked right up to

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:10.980
him and started banging a drum in his

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:12.930
face yeah so it's like the real scenario

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:15.750
was like you have like the black

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:18.240
Israelite dudes spewing their usual

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:21.360
garbage which is funny to media ignores

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.010
that though they're like oh that's just

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:24.720
[ __ ] black guys being crazy but look

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.270
at these seventh-grade kids and look at

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:28.830
their public decorum and how

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:30.720
unacceptable it is it's like that black

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.190
dude was screaming at them telling them

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:34.560
they're like [ __ ] blonde it's like

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.630
well at the beginning of the video cuz

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:38.190
the video I saw was from the black

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:40.110
Israelite sure that's a [ __ ] the guy

00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:41.760
was like yeah tell them yeah yeah there

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.280
it starts before the kids get there sure

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.440
with them harassing the Native Americans

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.420
well it starts with them being like the

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:50.460
reason you lost your land and your

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.470
society is because you worship [ __ ]

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:55.110
totem poles and not the one true God it

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:57.120
started with them y'all gonna do that to

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.770
it so the whole thing starts with the

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:01.050
black Israelites [ __ ] heckling the

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:02.430
[ __ ] out of these Native American one of

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:04.170
them was uh Larry one of them walks up

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:05.970
and is like hey could you guys not do

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:08.100
that and they're like shut off like they

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.960
just crushed this dude yeah and it's

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.100
like I mean there's no one more

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:12.540
unforgiving than the [ __ ] black is

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:13.560
you're alone oh there was a [ __ ]

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:16.440
there was a [ __ ] with a [ __ ] he

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.630
was ready to go you think he's sick when

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:20.580
Native Americans mix their culture with

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:23.280
like cool western outfits for sure I've

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.020
been a fan of that for a while [ __ ] yeah

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:26.100
back in the day when they would wear

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:28.470
like Western like a vest with like crazy

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:30.600
[ __ ] they had to I love it that was all

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.390
the gear that and some watch it think

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:35.100
about I mean cowboys we're probably

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:36.330
pretty you know like when I was a little

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:38.070
kid he think about like ice always like

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:39.360
dress up as an Indian and walk around

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.970
and do a [ __ ] which Fairley's highly

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:42.299
offensive

00:41:42.299 --> 00:41:44.549
but I still like Walker I remember when

00:41:44.549 --> 00:41:46.109
we moved out to the place I grew up at

00:41:46.109 --> 00:41:47.729
it was like a bunch of land and I would

00:41:47.729 --> 00:41:49.679
walk around for hours and 10 hours a

00:41:49.679 --> 00:41:51.630
Native American nice that was my [ __ ] I

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:54.059
thought it was that's why we such a good

00:41:54.059 --> 00:41:56.459
dynamic I thought name just like get

00:41:56.459 --> 00:41:58.859
these goddamn savages off my land

00:41:58.859 --> 00:42:01.519
I thought they're cool as [ __ ] what I

00:42:01.519 --> 00:42:03.719
saw last of the Mohicans when I was

00:42:03.719 --> 00:42:06.029
young and I was like Indians of the [ __ ]

00:42:06.029 --> 00:42:07.769
I don't know where I even heard about

00:42:07.769 --> 00:42:09.900
them from I just know that I was like I

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.819
was real into [ __ ] walking around and

00:42:11.819 --> 00:42:13.529
like doing like rain dances and stuff I

00:42:13.529 --> 00:42:15.269
was a little kid I walk around myself

00:42:15.269 --> 00:42:16.920
and my momma big dude I don't know what

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.809
the [ __ ] was wrong with you you're

00:42:18.809 --> 00:42:21.059
[ __ ] up yeah I was a [ __ ] up [ __ ]

00:42:21.059 --> 00:42:23.609
up kid but dude that whole thing that

00:42:23.609 --> 00:42:25.079
thing cracked me up though how it's like

00:42:25.079 --> 00:42:27.509
so you have these seventh grade kids who

00:42:27.509 --> 00:42:28.650
they were older than that they were in

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:29.729
high school so they're in high school

00:42:29.729 --> 00:42:32.759
yeah okay probably older it makes more

00:42:32.759 --> 00:42:34.979
sense but it's also weird now to think

00:42:34.979 --> 00:42:36.660
that there's kids like remember when you

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:38.880
were like in high school it was like I

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.170
guess more grade school but even high

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:41.640
school still is like you call the

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:44.219
subcultures of like skateboard goth type

00:42:44.219 --> 00:42:46.170
person and blah blah blah now there's

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:49.140
like young maggots kicking around yeah

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.189
like now you're in high school and

00:42:50.189 --> 00:42:53.069
you're like I'm real into the GOP that's

00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:53.880
[ __ ] weird

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.009
I used to combat the kids that are in

00:42:56.009 --> 00:42:57.599
your high school that are diehard

00:42:57.599 --> 00:43:00.479
[ __ ] both liberals [ __ ] bizarre

00:43:00.479 --> 00:43:02.789
think that that's like a like a high

00:43:02.789 --> 00:43:06.630
school sub PC and that was the Louise

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:07.979
bit to be like you guys what do you guys

00:43:07.979 --> 00:43:10.170
[ __ ] he's like I feel like get drunk

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:12.089
and smoke as much meat as possible now

00:43:12.089 --> 00:43:13.859
little kids like you shouldn't say that

00:43:13.859 --> 00:43:15.539
yeah it's [ __ ] New York shouldn't you

00:43:15.539 --> 00:43:19.079
be fingering but it's so [ __ ] weird

00:43:19.079 --> 00:43:21.029
to think that like they went down there

00:43:21.029 --> 00:43:22.410
a bunch of high school kids went down

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:24.179
there with like like if I were to go

00:43:24.179 --> 00:43:25.469
down to DC like I'm gonna wear my

00:43:25.469 --> 00:43:30.269
Republican t-shirt yeah pens cuz they

00:43:30.269 --> 00:43:32.429
probably went down there to troll sure

00:43:32.429 --> 00:43:34.229
definitely a bunch of high school kids

00:43:34.229 --> 00:43:36.509
on a field trip not one of them gives a

00:43:36.509 --> 00:43:38.279
[ __ ] about abortion true they were down

00:43:38.279 --> 00:43:41.339
there for the March for Life true they

00:43:41.339 --> 00:43:44.729
just wanted to kill DC yeah that's where

00:43:44.729 --> 00:43:46.739
megawhatts wearing their maggot hats

00:43:46.739 --> 00:43:47.880
being like so they went down there to

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:48.660
own libs

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:49.979
they went down there to own lips with a

00:43:49.979 --> 00:43:51.779
pro-life March my high school was there

00:43:51.779 --> 00:43:52.559
the trill

00:43:52.559 --> 00:43:54.599
trace marks drive more lit than it was

00:43:54.599 --> 00:43:55.920
before

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.540
because I went a couple times my mom

00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.309
when I was little I remember I

00:43:59.309 --> 00:44:01.829
confronted a couple engines - I mama

00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:04.349
bring me down there I just [ __ ] stand

00:44:04.349 --> 00:44:05.520
my ground in front of them and look him

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.520
in the eyes and smile

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.530
my mama bring me down there I'm getting

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:12.119
out of school I'll just [ __ ] sucks

00:44:12.119 --> 00:44:15.030
oh really yeah I just walk by cause oh

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:16.380
my god I'm never [ __ ] - this [ __ ]

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:18.510
blows that son however someone told me

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:20.700
this and I should Google this right now

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:22.020
because I just said I would never talk

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.940
about new sources I didn't verify yeah

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:26.940
someone told me now they're in New York

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:29.880
they passed like full trimester

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:32.339
abortions yeah yeah yeah until up until

00:44:32.339 --> 00:44:34.559
the day of birth but wait how do they

00:44:34.559 --> 00:44:37.049
know though well you can get it like

00:44:37.049 --> 00:44:38.760
before the water very pregnant you can

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:42.299
have an abortion there but not it's only

00:44:42.299 --> 00:44:44.940
if the woman or child's health is at

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:47.160
risk it's not like you can just be like

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.869
give me this abortion okay see that's

00:44:48.869 --> 00:44:50.490
what I'm talking exactly so when

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:51.630
everyone does hit me with this somebody

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:54.000
tweeted that yeah like on Friday after

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.130
that's when it was big I was like what

00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:57.869
the [ __ ] this is crazy to like celebrate

00:44:57.869 --> 00:44:59.849
this how was the fobs [ __ ] up which is

00:44:59.849 --> 00:45:01.619
weird because New York did celebrate it

00:45:01.619 --> 00:45:03.780
they made like the spire of the Empire

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:05.640
State Building pink like women's

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.859
reproductive Act is signed we did it

00:45:07.859 --> 00:45:11.430
it's like it's a [ __ ] up law yeah like

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:12.930
let's maybe it's like yeah sure it's

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:14.730
good if it actually is helping people

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:17.040
that like might die giving birth sure

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.960
which is terrifying I think about it's

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:22.410
also like well it's not act like this is

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:24.660
a like in your [ __ ] face Republicans

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:26.609
yeah which is every article it's like

00:45:26.609 --> 00:45:28.109
Republicans have delayed this act for

00:45:28.109 --> 00:45:30.720
years it's like maybe because it's you

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.609
know at that point pretty late for an

00:45:32.609 --> 00:45:34.710
abortion can you do it I mean again I'm

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:37.069
not a UH I mean what they're called an

00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:38.790
obstetrician what are the people call it

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:41.069
deliver babies the doctor called I don't

00:45:41.069 --> 00:45:42.420
know I forget what they're called but

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.250
the UH I thought you can do like

00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:46.290
c-sections and [ __ ] I guess if the

00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:51.020
baby's just like totally [ __ ] rotten

00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:54.000
he's totally breaking down in your body

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.040
I guess you can [ __ ] sure hit him

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.540
with a little but yeah then the first

00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:59.190
news article I looked at how do you

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:01.500
allocate Breitbart for sure that was

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.809
like this is infanticide this is killing

00:46:03.809 --> 00:46:05.220
a baby I thought when I heard it I

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.420
thought they're like pulling them out no

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:07.540
you could like

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:09.010
beheaded or putting like a little tiny

00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:13.060
guillotine invasion real French about it

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.100
yes so they're saying if you're like if

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:17.950
it's it's for compromising your health

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:19.840
or the business that's that's kind of

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:21.340
sketchy I mean it's definitely comparing

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:23.320
the baby self you're gonna kill it so

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:26.980
they're saying like if you feel like it

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:28.600
might not make it might not make it to

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.900
it it's not gonna crush this thing but

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:33.310
if the girl is lay if it's

00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:35.200
life-threatening I guess yeah don't we

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:39.300

00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:46.770
that the other day of like the actual

00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:48.900
origins of like generational like the

00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.030
generational origins of racism how like

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:53.190
like your parents grandparents are

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:55.040
probably my parents grandparents are

00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:57.170
[ __ ] like the [ __ ] like my dad would

00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:58.820
tell me like his grandmama like that

00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:00.020
when he was like a toddler would bounce

00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:01.910
him on her lap yeah and be like stay

00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:02.990
away from the Jews

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:05.840
stay away like my dad would tell me this

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:06.950
like yeah your grandmom would say I

00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:09.110
don't cut you off sure but I was

00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:12.200
listening to [ __ ] Jordan Peterson all

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:15.230
the way yeah and and I'm sure you

00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:16.640
already know this but it's an

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.740
evolutionary like racism is evolutionary

00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:21.290
yeah it's like because people from other

00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:23.600
races or tribes would come in the fear

00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:25.640
of other sure because they bring

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:27.560
diseases like it's an evolutionary thing

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:29.000
to be like get them the [ __ ] out it will

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:29.720
conquer you

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.400
yeah well it states split because

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.780
there's some people who are it depends

00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:34.130
if you're if you're high on openness

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:36.200
you're actually like bring those people

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.780
in here so it's split but it isn't it is

00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:40.220
a definitely an evolutionary thing yeah

00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:42.500
well I mean that's it it's obviously

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:44.990
it's it's in humans for sure it's in

00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:47.060
every part of the globe throughout their

00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:48.680
story and if it's not even rated to your

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:50.510
in-group or Al Kooper stuff yeah not

00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:51.770
necessarily racism but that's what we

00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:54.920
call for sure racism now it's funny to

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:57.950
think about like your grandparents great

00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:59.720
great grandparents we're probably like

00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:01.160
if they saw someone who looked

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:04.760
everywhere like [ __ ] you like go kill

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:13.160

a dishonorable that is pretty design

00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:54.200
really that was something they debated

00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:57.470
was it wasn't Arabic who debated oh the

00:56:57.470 --> 00:57:00.770
Japanese are planning the at all Admiral

00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:04.010
he [ __ ] proposed Pearl Harbor and

00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:05.270
they were like this isn't honorable

00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:08.230
it's not how Japanese warriors fight

00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:11.400
so how they think kamikaze Pearl Harbor

00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:13.630

okay so they just flew please well that

00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:19.180

wasn't it there was no war they just

00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:22.540
attacked us I'm not necessarily

00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:24.400
unprovoked well the funny part is ally

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.500
Japan was like a pure where they were

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:28.570
isolationist right not at that point we

00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:30.430
can't I thought we came up when yeah we

00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:31.750
came up to them basically they were

00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:33.160
isolationist and we came up and we're

00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:34.599
like open your [ __ ] ports and die

00:57:34.599 --> 00:57:37.210

00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:49.359
India mmm the Dutch East rating company

00:57:49.359 --> 00:57:51.609

Japan or they went to Japan like yo like

00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:01.900
no more whatever the [ __ ] weird costume

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:03.160
[ __ ] you guys have going on here gonna

00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:04.690
open the ports and trade with us yeah

00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:07.690
open one port and they they just [ __ ]

00:58:07.690 --> 00:58:09.579
got all of our technology figure it out

00:58:09.579 --> 00:58:10.630
next thing you know they just flew a

00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:11.859
plane or like we're dropping bombs and

00:58:11.859 --> 00:58:14.589
you guys play well what happened was

00:58:14.589 --> 00:58:17.470
they were really [ __ ] up China okay

00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:19.200
they were destroying jet like raping

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:22.030
just baby yeah but [ __ ] China

00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:24.339
literally and they were invade wait a

00:58:24.339 --> 00:58:28.470
few documented but Fox they were also uh

00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:30.790
they were just taking other islands and

00:58:30.790 --> 00:58:31.930
they were expanding like their empire

00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:34.660
was huge and we were supplying their oil

00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:37.240
what you resist roughly this is the 30s

00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:41.079
- so the 30s it was massively accepted

00:58:41.079 --> 00:58:43.060
to go into another country and his [ __ ]

00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:44.470
every literally [ __ ] people in a

00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:46.930
submission it wasn't accepted by the

00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:49.390
Japanese though it was like oh yeah yeah

00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:51.099
they were completely on board they were

00:58:51.099 --> 00:58:53.619
like why are you guys like well their

00:58:53.619 --> 00:58:55.359
opinion was it was better that they were

00:58:55.359 --> 00:58:58.060
colonizing than white people so like we

00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:00.250
gotta [ __ ] these guys their ass we were

00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:03.400
taking all of Asia it's ours okay but

00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:07.150
then they the United States instead of

00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:08.440
intervening because there were a ton of

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:10.780
Westerners in China yeah that were like

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:12.520
this is crazy what's going on here yeah

00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:13.869
we're getting raped talk there there's a

00:59:13.869 --> 00:59:17.319
hard rape there there's a lot of

00:59:17.319 --> 00:59:19.029
right so it was like these days are

00:59:19.029 --> 00:59:21.749
coming like blurry genitals first

00:59:21.749 --> 00:59:24.880
everywhere like just going wild

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:27.069
and then what's funny is there's a bunch

00:59:27.069 --> 00:59:28.479
of Japanese historians that deny it

00:59:28.479 --> 00:59:31.499
there which is still an issue that's

00:59:31.499 --> 00:59:33.819
textbooks don't really acknowledge the

00:59:33.819 --> 00:59:35.289
atrocity they sense well there's so much

00:59:35.289 --> 00:59:36.729
shame dude I can compare that to a

00:59:36.729 --> 00:59:40.959
[ __ ] art textbook yeah slavery I got

00:59:40.959 --> 00:59:42.759
the watered-down version in my grade

00:59:42.759 --> 00:59:45.519
school early on yeah yeah that makes

00:59:45.519 --> 00:59:47.019
sense even high school they didn't

00:59:47.019 --> 00:59:49.059
really hit me with like a lot I remember

00:59:49.059 --> 00:59:51.309
it also didn't really pay attention yeah

00:59:51.309 --> 00:59:53.229
our history definitely filtered in like

00:59:53.229 --> 00:59:55.719
slavery was that every [ __ ] the year

00:59:55.719 --> 00:59:57.880
my yeah my history teacher cut a deal

00:59:57.880 --> 00:59:59.680
with me told me if I just like stop

00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:00.910
disrupting the class he would give me a

01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:06.369
B actually like them alive into

01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:10.630
appeasement guitar lessons and we smoked

01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:13.029

01:00:17.319 --> 01:00:19.059
[ __ ] [ __ ] out in classes the whole

01:00:19.059 --> 01:00:20.289
class goes into disarray

01:00:20.289 --> 01:00:21.940

it so Japan was but [ __ ] China it

01:00:33.999 --> 01:00:36.940
hard him and people were like kind of

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:38.650
calling for intervention but yeah no one

01:00:38.650 --> 01:00:40.449
wanted to like have an all-out war so

01:00:40.449 --> 01:00:41.859
the United States was like we're gonna

01:00:41.859 --> 01:00:43.839

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:54.999
you don't stop but [ __ ] this year

01:00:54.999 --> 01:00:56.680
we're done so I was imagining all my

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:58.509
little like Roman computer legions like

01:00:58.509 --> 01:01:02.140
running yeah yeah the Romans were yeah

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:03.759
so we were like no what we sanctioned

01:01:03.759 --> 01:01:05.979
them we were like we're gonna cut your

01:01:05.979 --> 01:01:09.099
oil off in a year yeah and they if we

01:01:09.099 --> 01:01:11.049
did that they were [ __ ] nothing would

01:01:11.049 --> 01:01:13.690
work if they did that for sure so that's

01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:16.119
why they attacked Pearl Harbor that's

01:01:16.119 --> 01:01:17.949
not a way to hold on your oils yeah but

01:01:17.949 --> 01:01:20.170
then there's oil supplies around that's

01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:23.589
held by European countries Oh in in the

01:01:23.589 --> 01:01:24.969
Pacific they tried to they try to

01:01:24.969 --> 01:01:26.739
backdoor attacked us and then started

01:01:26.739 --> 01:01:28.690
taking up as much resources as they

01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:29.920
could and they had China

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.810
they could that was a ton of resources

01:01:31.810 --> 01:01:35.500
oh yeah [ __ ] pastors today uh yeah they

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:37.390
[ __ ] snuck attack did well that was

01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:38.980
full back that was game fool Game of

01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:41.920
Thrones back that yeah especially then

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.330
that's first thing in the 40s it was it

01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:44.940
was go time there might have been like

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:47.440
two percent of Americans who are like we

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.180
shouldn't [ __ ] bomb we shouldn't do

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:49.540
this

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:51.190
well then when they dropped the atom

01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:52.510
bomb I'm sure people were not to like

01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:54.550
totally stoked I want to sure everyone

01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:56.200
was [ __ ] percentage of people was like

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.300
we're against that you know I bet it was

01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:00.220
incredibly low especially that was

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:01.750
toward that was the end of the war sure

01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:03.670
I mean that were that was probably Don I

01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:05.110
mean that was like getting the Twin

01:02:05.110 --> 01:02:06.610
Towers hit there was probably people who

01:02:06.610 --> 01:02:09.250
were like so stoked and the atrocities

01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:11.590
they were committing yeah to people that

01:02:11.590 --> 01:02:13.840
everyone knew true like everyone knew

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.970
people that were over there mmm-hmm it's

01:02:15.970 --> 01:02:17.170
like [ __ ] get rid of these

01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:21.790
[ __ ] yo chill and like they

01:02:21.790 --> 01:02:22.480
were like all right

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.160
we surrender and then we hit him with

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.350
another one week you better [ __ ] stop

01:02:26.350 --> 01:02:28.930
make the VCRs well the other one was

01:02:28.930 --> 01:02:30.160
like sorry we had to test this other one

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.990
out well the other one again that I've

01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:33.310
said it before the other one was like at

01:02:33.310 --> 01:02:35.350
Russia it was like you guys better

01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:45.160
[ __ ] chill - that's the Cold War was

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:46.900
just a continuation of that of being

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:49.270
like yeah well [ __ ] yeah we're allies

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:50.800
but then as soon as everybody got

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.210
defeated and there were two empires

01:02:52.210 --> 01:02:53.680
there it was just like right well we

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.840
gotta fight you now yeah but uh

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:59.050
hopefully they don't then Pearl Harbor

01:02:59.050 --> 01:03:01.270
was why there are some stories at the

01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:02.320
end of this thing that'll get your

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.140
[ __ ] dick hard for that dude there was

01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:07.150
like it was early enough that on the one

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:09.790
battleship that Nevada they were still

01:03:09.790 --> 01:03:11.320
raising the flag they were raising the

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.270
American flag and the band was still

01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:15.280
playing the national anthem and when the

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.990
Japanese planes started firing armed

01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:18.970
they kept playing the national anthem

01:03:18.970 --> 01:03:24.240
they finished the anthem [ __ ] it is

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.470
America that's crazy man dude how about

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:29.730
the [ __ ] thing we watch in theaters

01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:32.290
why our sick ass thing and yeah at the

01:03:32.290 --> 01:03:35.830
end of it is a Churchill quote about how

01:03:35.830 --> 01:03:38.200
when Pearl Harbor happened he like was

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:41.050
like yes he was like as soon as Pearl

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:42.520
Harbor happened and I knew the United

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:43.690
States was in the war with us

01:03:43.690 --> 01:03:45.520
he's like it was over yeah he's like

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:48.220
Hitler's in its Carlin's voice so he's

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:50.670
like Hitler's fate was sealed

01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:54.700
Mussolini's fate sealed and Japan would

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:57.099
be ground into a fine powder

01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:59.230
damn dude and that [ __ ] drum comes in

01:03:59.230 --> 01:04:03.130
it's like holy [ __ ] us is the [ __ ] it is

01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:04.809
a sewer like there's a bunch of the

01:04:04.809 --> 01:04:06.849
Japanese studied in America too it's

01:04:06.849 --> 01:04:08.650
like Harvard did they really very much

01:04:08.650 --> 01:04:11.890
like now for sure yes back then Dan oh

01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:13.059
there were actually got putting like

01:04:13.059 --> 01:04:14.710
internment camps and [ __ ] yeah we can

01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:16.270
talk that yeah it was but they were like

01:04:16.270 --> 01:04:18.339
if we go to war at the United States you

01:04:18.339 --> 01:04:19.930
have no idea the industrial power of

01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:21.549
what we're up against like I've seen the

01:04:21.549 --> 01:04:24.309
oil fields in Texas yeah and the fields

01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:26.920
in the Midwest like we go to war with

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:28.569
them we can't compete oh they were going

01:04:28.569 --> 01:04:31.720
back to Japan dang guys do not [ __ ] with

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:32.410
this thing

01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:34.660
that's a sleeping giant dude if that

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:36.430
thing wakes up we are in trouble

01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:39.789
[ __ ] that's why Japanese internment

01:04:39.789 --> 01:04:41.980
camps it also ties into that article

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:44.230
this article the Atlantic ran about

01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:47.049
the kids at the Lincoln Memorial with

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:49.180
that Native America he was like don't be

01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:51.250
mad at this be mad at like American real

01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:53.740
atrocities and then listed Japanese

01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:55.660
internment camps as one of them yeah I

01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:58.029
was just like dude that was I mean don't

01:04:58.029 --> 01:04:59.079
get me wrong I'm definitely not

01:04:59.079 --> 01:05:01.000
advocating for anybody in an internment

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.220
camp yeah but in World War two 1940s

01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:09.220
like that's that's kind of fair game

01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:10.990
well I mean okay so yeah well Hitler was

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:13.200
concentration camp in the 30s right

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.130
concentration camps are a lot - that's

01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:16.359
what I'm saying yeah so it's like you

01:05:16.359 --> 01:05:20.410
have that it's like don't do that and so

01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:22.380
they they probably hardly knew about

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:24.520
concentration camps at the time but they

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.619
weren't like forced labor putting people

01:05:26.619 --> 01:05:27.970
in gas chambers and [ __ ] there was

01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:30.190
obviously no gas chambers okay it wasn't

01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:31.329
like they weren't trying to kill these

01:05:31.329 --> 01:05:35.680
people yeah it was unsafe it sucked

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.720
yeah it was a not fun I'm sure was not

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:43.329
the best but yeah it was like so he said

01:05:43.329 --> 01:05:45.450
horribly necessary evil at the time

01:05:45.450 --> 01:05:47.170
Japanese were getting a lot of

01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:49.000
information from Japanese people that

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.559
lived in America did the fact that they

01:05:50.559 --> 01:05:52.470
didn't kill them back then it's like

01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:55.390
it's like okay and there was also like

01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:57.220
there was obviously

01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:59.590
racism against Asians at the time there

01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:02.530
was obviously like people trying to get

01:06:02.530 --> 01:06:04.510
them into camps for money reasons like

01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:07.030
farmers hmm in like California would be

01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:08.440
like these Japanese dudes are killing

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.849
the game let's [ __ ] get them locked

01:06:09.849 --> 01:06:12.040
up like there was definitely some shitty

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:13.330
[ __ ] but it's like if we're gonna

01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:15.849
compare atrocities in the 40s yeah that

01:06:15.849 --> 01:06:16.810
one's not on us

01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:19.480
yeah not here you're saying yeah it

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:21.160
would be like just take it as like we

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.570
were we just locked them up and not

01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:24.130
think about what those boys were all two

01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:26.230
over there yeah it's like we were up

01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:28.450
against Isis yeah in like a

01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:30.430
life-or-death struggle where Isis could

01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:32.700
win

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.530
I was actually laughing earlier you're

01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:42.130
talking about uh 23andme I was like

01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:44.320
thinking about the dudes who discovered

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.240
like you know they say like we have all

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.070
life comes from like the Congo or like

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:50.170
Africa yeah those first light dudes and

01:06:50.170 --> 01:06:51.849
like safari trousers and being like the

01:06:51.849 --> 01:06:53.260
first guys who were like studying this

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.430
and they're like - following the line

01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:55.570
down though it looks like we're here

01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:58.180
they're like alright we're going a

01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.859
little further down finally oh my god

01:06:59.859 --> 01:07:03.750
what the [ __ ] we're all from this yeah

01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:06.130
so funny they first figure that out

01:07:06.130 --> 01:07:08.920
I'm sure yeah check it again draw the

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:10.510
lines again this isn't right check it

01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:16.540
again I'm white yeah the Japanese dude

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:17.290
yeah

01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:18.520
I'm telling you spot was telling about

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:22.960
him dude bad hombre spied put me on to

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:25.359
this other guy to recently [ __ ] uh

01:07:25.359 --> 01:07:29.440
mark pass yeah he's a wild while I'm

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.640

Philadelphia but he's like I watching a

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:36.790
thing it's eight hours it's a [ __ ]

01:07:36.790 --> 01:07:40.000
seminar he does about like natural law

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.290
and all this stuff and how like we've

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:42.730
come out of natural law basically like

01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:44.410
humans are basically enslaved but like

01:07:44.410 --> 01:07:46.270
if you like the government like is

01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:46.720
slavery

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.010
so if you [ __ ] with the government

01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:50.320
you're just a [ __ ] slave so he's like

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.609
we're not we're like totally off of

01:07:51.609 --> 01:07:53.230
natural law I gotta watch this whole

01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:54.280
thing before I know he's talking about

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.560
but apparently he was like a like a

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:59.260
high-ranking satanic priest and he left

01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:00.820
the Satanic priesthood and now he's

01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:02.500
teaching people about like the occult

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.390
which all the occult means is just

01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:05.980
something that's hidden so it's like

01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:07.330
hidden knowledge that people don't know

01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:08.560
he's like if you use this and apply it

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:09.730
to your life it's it's pretty helpful

01:08:09.730 --> 01:08:10.779
but he's like you

01:08:10.779 --> 01:08:12.189

yeah

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:40.059

01:08:40.059 --> 01:08:42.069
[ __ ] around I wouldn't [ __ ] him how

01:08:42.069 --> 01:08:44.079
about saying you would but it's like if

01:08:44.079 --> 01:08:47.589
I could not be a [ __ ] I mean I'm

01:08:47.589 --> 01:08:49.059
watching this guy's thing right now and

01:08:49.059 --> 01:08:51.339
I first I was watching it I was like all

01:08:51.339 --> 01:08:52.750
right but like everything you said he

01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:54.099
always says like they don't I don't give

01:08:54.099 --> 01:08:55.359
a [ __ ] if you believe me or not research

01:08:55.359 --> 01:08:56.559
of yourself he has a thing called the

01:08:56.559 --> 01:08:58.900
arc he'll give it to you for free but

01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:01.029
you have to give him a hard drive and he

01:09:01.029 --> 01:09:02.679
will it's a terabyte of information he

01:09:02.679 --> 01:09:04.359
will put all the information he's ever

01:09:04.359 --> 01:09:05.799
amassed and all the research he's done

01:09:05.799 --> 01:09:07.659
onto this thing and you can research

01:09:07.659 --> 01:09:09.069
he's like it'll take your whole life to

01:09:09.069 --> 01:09:11.199
read this [ __ ] wow this dude apparently

01:09:11.199 --> 01:09:13.569
has researched all kinds of crazy wild

01:09:13.569 --> 01:09:15.400
[ __ ] he's nice he's doing the work where

01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:16.270
he's trying to spread it with everyone

01:09:16.270 --> 01:09:17.739
he's done you know he's not doing it for

01:09:17.739 --> 01:09:18.969
the money tell him tell him we're

01:09:18.969 --> 01:09:20.619
blowing up bro I'm trying to get him

01:09:20.619 --> 01:09:22.119
well we got some listening he doesn't do

01:09:22.119 --> 01:09:23.799
it he specifically says like I'm not

01:09:23.799 --> 01:09:25.029
doing this to make friends the [ __ ] I

01:09:25.029 --> 01:09:26.559
tell people they don't want to hear it

01:09:26.559 --> 01:09:28.420
he's like do you think what do you what

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:31.179
type of [ __ ] does he say he gets into

01:09:31.179 --> 01:09:33.609
like he gets into the occult from and

01:09:33.609 --> 01:09:34.839
again I don't I haven't watched all of

01:09:34.839 --> 01:09:36.130
it yet on natural law but he's basically

01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:38.650
saying that like from what I gather is

01:09:38.650 --> 01:09:40.089
that like there's a there's a natural

01:09:40.089 --> 01:09:42.880
law that like no one should be you're

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.139
none of your actions should have pin

01:09:44.139 --> 01:09:45.489
John anyone else's so he's like you

01:09:45.489 --> 01:09:47.049
should never be impinging on another

01:09:47.049 --> 01:09:49.449
person's life or fringing and fringing

01:09:49.449 --> 01:09:52.210
excuse me I was impinging is in other

01:09:52.210 --> 01:09:57.789
word but I know for sure I didn't know

01:09:57.789 --> 01:09:59.710
if I was even saying that so like even

01:09:59.710 --> 01:10:01.449
he was he was being worried about being

01:10:01.449 --> 01:10:05.409
a [ __ ] now I don't on anybody

01:10:05.409 --> 01:10:05.829
anymore

01:10:05.829 --> 01:10:08.289
I think you'd pin jizz or it as well it

01:10:08.289 --> 01:10:09.789
sounds like I'm google it after but in

01:10:09.789 --> 01:10:11.650
but infringing is a better word for it

01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:14.500
so it's like anything you do if you're

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.210
like stopping someone from doing what

01:10:16.210 --> 01:10:18.280
they want to do your did violate a

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:20.320
natural law okay and that's a lot what

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:21.849
Satanism is about or it's like if

01:10:21.849 --> 01:10:23.409
someone tries to stop you destroy them

01:10:23.409 --> 01:10:23.739
so he's

01:10:23.739 --> 01:10:26.170
devout [ __ ] libertarian he's an

01:10:26.170 --> 01:10:26.770
anarchist

01:10:26.770 --> 01:10:29.710
which I guess is about it which is I get

01:10:29.710 --> 01:10:32.590
one never do this I mean this guy flies

01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:34.690
the Gadsden flag where it's a hat says

01:10:34.690 --> 01:10:36.250
like comb take if you want my guns come

01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:39.070
take home this guy so he's all about

01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:41.350
natural law and anything that infringes

01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:43.239
upon your rights to do what you want to

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:44.710
do is you're not hurting anyone

01:10:44.710 --> 01:10:47.469
it's someone's [ __ ] their meddling

01:10:47.469 --> 01:10:48.370
your life to the point where it's

01:10:48.370 --> 01:10:49.420
totally unacceptable

01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:53.170
sounds like he's also capable of a mass

01:10:53.170 --> 01:10:54.340
shooting I know it goes against

01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:56.020
everything he teaches no it's a thing he

01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:58.840
would know you never dude he would know

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.280
he's easy notes again he doesn't even

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.500
eat meat this guy's a [ __ ] paradox

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:05.469
bro because he's like we don't have we

01:11:05.469 --> 01:11:06.850
don't we just gave ourselves right to

01:11:06.850 --> 01:11:08.500
[ __ ] to kill and dominate me and God

01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:11.230
did but yes dude PD don't even start on

01:11:11.230 --> 01:11:12.460
his takes with organized religion he

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:14.739
doesn't like organized religion despises

01:11:14.739 --> 01:11:16.750
a government even hates New Age [ __ ]

01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:18.489
it's due date which is funny Java Leary

01:11:18.489 --> 01:11:20.710
sit down with him get a good priest toe

01:11:20.710 --> 01:11:22.630
to toe you know I'm not even gonna lie

01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:24.550
this dude would [ __ ] blood [ __ ]

01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:26.890
O'Leary you think this guy is a terabyte

01:11:26.890 --> 01:11:28.930
of information he has Illyria has the

01:11:28.930 --> 01:11:31.660
entire Vatican bad sky does he this guy

01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:34.450

01:11:34.450 --> 01:11:36.250
it and the Pope was problem no he was

01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:38.280
going to challenge the [ __ ] loser

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.120

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.530
fight because I'm not gonna do that I'm

01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:43.510
gonna poke no he wanted to challenge the

01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:44.950
Pope to a debate on ethics because he

01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:46.330
thinks the Pope is totally [ __ ] on

01:11:46.330 --> 01:11:47.410
that he thought he could talk to the

01:11:47.410 --> 01:11:49.030
Pope he wants he challenged them to you

01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:51.760
this guy dude this dude I think of the

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:54.340
Pope started accepting challenges he

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:55.840
wanted to I think like fight the Pope or

01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:58.090

first he said I like to fight him he

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.530
wouldn't do that he I know he wouldn't

01:14:53.530 --> 01:14:57.969
do that so I wouldn't debate him I know

01:14:57.969 --> 01:14:59.679
he wanted to fight him I think initially

01:14:59.679 --> 01:15:00.820
but he said I know the Pope won't fight

01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:02.920
me so I wanted to bait him on ethics one

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:04.420
of the other either he wanted to debate

01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:06.010
him knew he won do that's a challenge of

01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:08.800

you just don't have the information as I

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:20.909

01:17:20.909 --> 01:17:22.409
ignorance because it comes from the

01:17:22.409 --> 01:17:25.560
Latin rude ignore ignorance you have the

information you're choosing to ignore it

01:17:26.909 --> 01:17:28.199
which that he says it's fundamental

01:17:28.199 --> 01:17:30.090
ignorance he should ignore language nor

01:17:30.090 --> 01:17:31.800
instead you should ignore the structure

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.389
of language this guy to help out the

01:17:33.389 --> 01:17:35.369
