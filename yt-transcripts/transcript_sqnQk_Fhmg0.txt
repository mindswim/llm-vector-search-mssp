00:29:53.889 --> 00:29:55.840
waking up in your car waking up in my

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.090

00:30:36.639 --> 00:30:37.720
minorities when you're in a situation

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.519
where you're a minority it's when you're

00:30:39.519 --> 00:30:40.629

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:01.610
yeah man so they oh that was my whole

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:02.919
point so if you go to Southside Chicago

00:34:02.919 --> 00:34:05.299
I'm the only literally the only white

00:34:05.299 --> 00:34:07.460
person I was in a bar and I'm in there I

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:09.290
mean I'm just like my thing - you can

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:10.790
even try to be cool but everyone's going

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:14.240
like kind of like it's different -

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.550
because like if you're the really the

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:18.050
only black dude in a white setting I

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:20.330
feel like it's like there's definitely

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:21.679
the same weirdness but you're gonna have

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:22.550
like you're supposed to be like around

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:24.230

00:42:00.089 --> 00:42:01.619
amassed how tears were like a mass

00:42:01.619 --> 00:42:03.239
armies back then and be like I'm going

00:42:03.239 --> 00:42:05.460
for the glory and it's [ __ ] lose

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.839
they'd have to just go back to a little

00:42:06.839 --> 00:42:08.940
thing like man Herod the Great

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.670
no one liked him yeah he wasn't want to

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:18.809
be jail Herod yeah the boys yeah the one

00:42:18.809 --> 00:42:20.489
he went to get his background but yeah

00:42:20.489 --> 00:42:23.670
dude so funny like Rome I'm polite what

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:25.049
was it who was that there was a Julius

00:42:25.049 --> 00:42:26.670
Caesar yeah the one through and like

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:28.289
just completely destroyed the Roman

00:42:28.289 --> 00:42:31.200
Empire he became the [ __ ] a dictator

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.849
yeah that's where we get that I don't

00:42:32.849 --> 00:42:33.809
know that's where we get the term from

00:42:33.809 --> 00:42:37.710
dude all those like so he fully just

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:39.239
went through but [ __ ] everyone killed

00:42:39.239 --> 00:42:40.950
his enemies and then he was just like

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:43.079
all right I'm dictator I say what goes

00:42:43.079 --> 00:42:44.700
but he kept up a

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:49.339
a mirage of democracy while he was in

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:51.480
yeah it's [ __ ] crazy they'll

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:54.030
triumvirate yeah dude that's weird how

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:55.740
he actually back then was like had like

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:57.540
kind of like he had the elections but it

00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:00.470
was all just like symbolic just fake

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:04.109
dude they couldn't stop well yeah I mean

00:43:04.109 --> 00:43:05.670
they did eventually they got eventually

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:08.579
they got um dude yeah that's that's

00:43:08.579 --> 00:43:10.560
always interesting to me that like like

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:12.720
Caesar I remember that that was one of

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:16.020
like azar yes Caesar oh really Tsar in

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:16.619
Russia

00:43:16.619 --> 00:43:20.670
Anheuser is Caesar yeah yeah he that do

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:22.740
you left a mark yeah Oh for [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:25.589
July yeah dude that's a month after yeah

00:43:25.589 --> 00:43:28.619

yeah yeah I was like it's crazy

00:43:36.859 --> 00:43:39.270
obviously how it connected everything is

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:40.980
through history but like the Roman

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.780
Empire like we're still on their [ __ ]

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:44.820
yeah dude like this is still we still

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:48.450
talk like we are government set up kind

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:49.680
of like the [ __ ] they were doing it's

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.230
the same fight so I was saying they're

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:53.400
july-august all that [ __ ] he said the

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.770
calendar bro that was this calendar yeah

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:57.150

that [ __ ] was [ __ ] he was [ __ ]

00:43:59.579 --> 00:44:03.060

Cleopatra to you [ __ ] the Apache yeah

yeah he went through there and he's like

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:11.400
I think he just took that was like the

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.040
queen or the king over there's Mark

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.500
answer Anthony might have picked up

00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:17.670
where he left off do you think they

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:19.500
[ __ ] tag-team they might have picked

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:21.450
up at Illinois by the way Cleopatra yeah

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:23.369
black Israelite so [ __ ] let you know

00:44:23.369 --> 00:44:24.839
they'll claim Cleopatra was a white

00:44:24.839 --> 00:44:28.500
devil well is she really that's why she

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:32.369
went to the Romans I mean dude someone's

00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:33.900
surrounding your whole castle with like

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.980

no dude yeah I was reaiiy was reading

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:50.040

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.410
Chinese emperor who saying he was like I

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:57.200

was actually was something while but he

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:06.820
that was a guy who basically unified

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:08.140
chat the first guy who let you in a

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.540
fight yeah he basically set up two

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:12.760
thousand years ago what's communism like

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:13.990
just concentrate all the power in the

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:15.460
state and like a lot of those guys who

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:18.820
like gain access or gain power it would

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:20.290
always be the ruling elite and then they

00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:21.760
would figure out how to use like the

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.109
like the common people and have them

00:45:23.109 --> 00:45:24.580
rise up and destroy their ruling elite

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:25.780
and then just take over and be dictator

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:27.910
no dude it's been in the playbook for

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:30.640
2,000 years do the same thing people guy

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:31.570
did the same thing in China

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:32.980
nobody's changed that guy did that

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:34.930
Caesar did it and then just [ __ ]

00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:37.000
became dictator supreme ruler of the

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.920
Roman Empire and just killed and then

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:43.869

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:49.810
Caesar in the first Chinese dude who

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:51.520
just like crushed everyone no it's

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.020
perfect this is how everyone reading it

00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:55.180
dude it's literally it's two page

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:56.920
snippets so you can it's I put it my

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.270
toilet so every time I take it dump I

00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:00.460
read about a tyrant reading about tyrant

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:01.600
yeah it's just two pages you blow right

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.130
through it oh my god that's crazy

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:05.680

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.530
here I say [ __ ] Hitler Hitler's on

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:12.730

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:14.470
there oh yeah I wonder who's gonna be

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:16.080
yeah I wonder who's gonna be the closer

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.500
the only chomp-chomp daddy could be no

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.790
yeah possible time in the future

00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:23.800
hopefully I made it I think it'll be

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.359
probably a probably Trump last page like

00:46:25.359 --> 00:46:28.420

putting all my effort in my presentation

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:49.600
what's your surveillance capitalism it's

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:51.730
computing I had to do a paper on fired

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:53.020
up do you know when people on the reddit

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:55.359

she's showing their whether say like

00:47:00.609 --> 00:47:02.740
actually though Google didn't do that

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:05.040
with the data this is what they're doing

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.340
[ __ ]

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:08.470
actually are you gonna get on that

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:09.310
that's the whole [ __ ]

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:11.020
business model is to sell your data -

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.510
it's like this is the business to be

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:15.400
[ __ ] so clearly propaganda other

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.230
thing - it's like so you think you're

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:19.630
just getting all this [ __ ] for free of

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:21.340

00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:24.490
idiots H if you [ __ ] [ __ ] ya [ __ ]

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:26.710

I mean [ __ ] feeling dude so I I'm

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.400
researching I've never looked into the

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.560
budget how much you think we have a year

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.930
and tax money they coming in no I wrote

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:55.150
no no idea yes six trillion dollars six

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:59.140
trill 2018 six trillion dollars not mine

00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:02.860
I did not chip in well I'm saying that's

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:04.720
it yeah they're not missing your [ __ ]

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:07.150
chump change bro I'm saying they think

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:10.950
they're [ __ ] like wait a second hold

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:12.700
probably why the government shutdown

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:15.040
definite like wait a second there's

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.300
scratching there that counts other

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:24.730
advisers on or like yes six [ __ ]

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:27.580
trillion bro so it's six trillion

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:28.660
dollars this is what everyone says Oh

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:30.370
like we need more tax money it looks

00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:32.200
like you know whatever but I was I was

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:35.620
trying to crunch the numbers they're

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:37.030
always about we're on a deficit blah

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:38.740
blah blah the deficits you know 20

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:40.720
trillion dollars doesn't that what's our

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:45.040
GDP bro for the year 2016 there's

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:47.380
roughly 20 20 trillion dollars it's our

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:48.970
GD so our deficits basically one year

00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:51.040
the GDP yeah it's not you know nothing

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.420
biggest do anything about it till it

00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:54.280
shiny come over well what happened no

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:58.120
what have I made to get rest stops they

00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:59.380
might have been seating the rest stop

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:01.030
they could what happens is on the vince

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:02.890
lombardi rest stop if you get there's a

00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:05.070
threshold with debt if you get too high

00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:07.480
that means like the then we start paying

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.950
so much of our budget goes to paying

00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:10.150
interest payments and that's you know

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:11.380
that's like the bad things to you so i'm

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:13.360
gonna keep getting that down but dude my

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.010
whole thing is that way cuz I always I

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:16.060
always that's like the big thing now

00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:18.370
like are we gonna raise taxes like you

00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:20.230
know sixty percent like Norway and

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:21.910
Sweden or people like we got a lower

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:23.109
level unless you want

00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:24.950
that's a burnt as I'm saying that's a

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:26.600
brain and I'm not I always hear about

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:27.890
Norway and Sweden and I'm like that's

00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:29.780
that deal sounds sweet because it's like

00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:31.460
you get to go to college for free get

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:32.660
through this you get do that I'm like I

00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:34.460
that honestly I think that would be

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:39.160
tight the only thing is so their GDP s

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.840
way smaller than ours but we have so

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:44.240
many more people so but if you go there

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:46.820
population per cap there could per

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:48.740
capita GDP is about like sixty thousand

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:51.530
dollars per person ours is like 58 we

00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:53.450
have we have 250 million people so we

00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:55.910
almost have the same per capita GDP yeah

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:57.320
sounds like technically if they're doing

00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:58.940
it with that amount of money we

00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:01.700
technically could but my argument is

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:03.500
it's not about the increase in our

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.420
decreasing taxes it's about the fact the

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:07.070
system our tax money moves through it is

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:08.630
constantly being sponged by like

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:10.070
[ __ ] nonprofits and all those other

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:12.440
things that's what I'm some going

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.330
between the lines into the grid out of

00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:15.710
the grid so that's all things you can

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:16.940
you can pop them up and down it's like

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:18.410
if I'm gonna start nonprofits where I'm

00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:19.730
like yeah I'll do schools and I'm just

00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:22.340
like I'm paying myself $400,000 you know

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:23.570
two hundred fifty thousand dollars a

00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:25.790
year I'm paying you to 120 at the end of

00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:29.630
the day we're really not doing [ __ ] true

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:31.730
I'm paying you to 70 dude I instantly

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:33.770
took a pay cut dude home with myself and

00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:35.420
[ __ ] I'm just taking a mere 220

00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:37.010
that's how they do it it's like the

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:38.810
founder will take you know X amount all

00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:41.210
these directors and through to the end

00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:42.260
of the day it's like what are you guys

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:43.760
actually getting there's no metrics

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.380
there's no like if you have a non-profit

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:48.710
I know it's just a company that gets

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:50.330
like grant money we're technically you

00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:52.369
can't the company can't report a profit

00:50:52.369 --> 00:50:54.380
you can have a surplus yeah but you're

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:55.880
supposed to like divert that back into

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:57.320
the company so you can just pay yourself

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:59.869
more okay it's far it's crazy

00:50:59.869 --> 00:51:01.609
everybody in DC works in a non-profit

00:51:01.609 --> 00:51:04.070

00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:05.990

some people try hard with clothing

01:04:13.419 --> 01:04:15.039

01:12:11.489 --> 01:12:12.960
not do that [ __ ] with all the fentanyl

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:14.909
and [ __ ] going around [ __ ] why are they

01:12:14.909 --> 01:12:18.060
putting fentanyl in random drugs cheap

01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:21.150
you people get hooked to it it doesn't

01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:23.940
just [ __ ] kill you basically he did

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:25.260
too much but if you do enough it's like

01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:28.409
what the [ __ ] was this yeah so yeah I

01:12:28.409 --> 01:12:29.640
think they're just put in because it's

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:30.929
super cheap and then if you're like damn

01:12:30.929 --> 01:12:33.600
that was [ __ ] awesome yeah imagine if

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.860
you'd be like trick people in a [ __ ]

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:37.020
shooting dope and they're like they got

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:38.790
that high inadvertently and they're just

01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:41.400
kind of like whoa yeah [ __ ] ketamine

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:43.820
rules there's they spray that [ __ ] on k2

01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:45.900
there's people who smoked k2 and start

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:47.280
dipping out and they're like you know k2

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:50.190
