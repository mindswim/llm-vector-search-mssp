00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.360
general backstab to trump

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.800
true i thought he was a yes man but

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.280
in the end dude he was judas he was he

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.319

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.040

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.319
spiteful man you think he'll rise again

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.480
on trump tv trump do you think they're

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.840
going to give him his own oprah tv

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.120
network kind of thing i don't think it's

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.640
up to that

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.239
i think i'll just try it'll be massive

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.920
but it'll just be online and it'll be

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.920
him just he's going to torch

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.720
[ __ ] everybody dude he's going to

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.800
he's going to crush the republicans

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.680
yeah everybody he hates everybody yeah

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.040
you have he'll be on info

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.800
him and hopefully him and alex jones can

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.080
reconcile i haven't been following

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.840
jones a lot but dude if he pops on

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.120
infowars after he gets out of the

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.640
presidency that might be the most

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.599
televised [ __ ]

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.280
it will be just jones being like you

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.560
know i knew about this all the time the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.800
whole time about you mr president

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.840
as far as i'm concerned you're still mr

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.519
president after that coup

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.519
the real coup yeah i was reading an

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.840
article about that last night about uh

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.159
how like they were comparing the the

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:27.440
capital stormers to

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.680
isis basically and being like we didn't

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.440
find any patterns for isis they were

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.560
just like you know

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.159
obviously there's religious fervor there

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:35.599
but really we couldn't really put a

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.280
profile on anybody who would do kind of

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.599
like

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.080
islamic terrorism they did put a profile

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.799
on like the

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.319
the white rappers who like would for

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.080
some reason go out there yes they kind

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.360
of figured out what they were up to a

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.239
little bit

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.319
but they were like saying uh they're

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.239
like running down the profile of

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.480
a capital stormer and i didn't get that

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.920
far into the article but all they were

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.760
doing is making them seem sweet

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.319
they're like well it's like very into

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.959
like you know

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.319
uh declaration of independence 1776 kind

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:03.599
of like when people did it

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.680
but like this version sucks it's not the

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.439
good one i just like you know i think

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:08.560
something popped up my phone and my

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.519
attention wandered

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:10.640
but i'm like damn you're not doing a

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.000
good job on selling me away from you're

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.040
just telling them

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.799
how much these guys rock they're set or

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.799
basically they're trying to be like

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.639
they think they're 1776 but they're not

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:19.919
really 1776 yeah

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.960
it's like we're 1776. anyway you're not

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.360
allowed to say this

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.280
dude when i was driving down there was

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.560

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.759
driving down 95 saw a big billboard for

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:38.639
the fbi

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.320

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.520
surrounded by the military and an empty

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.560
crate it's gonna be like

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.400
it's gonna be everybody's been afraid of

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.840
authoritarianism

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.199
yeah and then it's like what's it look

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.120

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.880
government's posting signs like report

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.680

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.280
it's it's

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.880
it's fun it's fun to be alive during one

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.320
of these times but i think what will be

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.520
nice

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.360
at least at a dumbed down level for us

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.000
is the news will be

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.080
good now mm-hmm so then everybody

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.360
hopefully will chill out

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.759
a little more you know the new oh you

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.120
mean i think the news won't be kicking

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.639
up [ __ ] as much during

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.160
friday yeah you know it's not like this

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.400
is some [ __ ] unique take

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.639
it's just gonna be nice to be like you

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.560
know the masses will get

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.400
pacified a little i think so yeah

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.080
hopefully the news won't be as

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.400
hell-bent on convincing us that we're

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.199
all in like

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:49.520
existential peril but they might just be

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.720
like in other news

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.720
everything's great now yeah we got a

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.840
good president

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.680
the germs have left the air yeah things

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.600
are good we're uh we're all good now

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.880
yeah hopefully things are good

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.160
hopefully they lie and tell us things

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.919
are good i would i would probably

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.160
prefer that lie [ __ ] yeah i'll take it

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.600
i'll just go gently into an

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.680
authoritarian state if things are nice

injustice i love jesus uh yeah that was

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:56.320
fun that was

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.000
a bad movie to report as well what you

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.320
got i watched uh

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.480
news of the world that new uh pedophile

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.920
tom hanks movie

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.079
what's the pitfall tom hanks up to he

00:16:06.079 --> 00:16:07.839
made a movie and i was stoked on it it

00:16:07.839 --> 00:16:09.600
was about the [ __ ] engines

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.680
1870s oh i think it was loosely based on

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.519
uh one of the ladies who had gotten

00:16:15.519 --> 00:16:17.440
kidnapped as a child

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.480
from the comanche and her uncle actually

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.759
like spent his whole life trying to get

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:23.199
her back they made a john wayne movie

00:16:23.199 --> 00:16:23.839
about it

00:16:23.839 --> 00:16:26.880
but then this one i don't know they just

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.240
[ __ ] it up it was pointless

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.759
yeah it was pointless and right when it

00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:31.360
started i was like

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.399
you know i was i was i was alone

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:35.759
so i was able to say things like this

00:16:35.759 --> 00:16:37.120
but i was like i know it's just gonna be

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.000
bad white guys

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.279
yeah yeah like it's gonna be a

00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:41.120
historical movie about white guys being

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:41.600
evil

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.759
was tom hanks evil or like no tom hanks

00:16:43.759 --> 00:16:45.440
so they did the same thing they did in

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.480
greyhound that

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.160
that movie where he was on it where he

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.600
like befriended the cook

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.120
yeah the black hook at the beginning of

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.360
this one the way he finds the girl is

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.399
she was

00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:56.480
her something got attacked with a black

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.000
guy and he got hung

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.839
and it said like white only he got like

00:16:59.839 --> 00:17:01.120
lynched and then

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.920
uh tom hanks like it cuts to tom hanks

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.039
like burying that guy

00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:07.280
and putting like a cross on his grave

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.880
and like

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.919
it's like he and then later you find out

00:17:11.919 --> 00:17:13.919
he was a confederate soldier

00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:15.760
so it's like he had his dark past so he

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.360
he was a confederate soldier but now

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.039
he's like

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:21.439
everybody deserves respect it's like

00:17:21.439 --> 00:17:22.880
beat it movie

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.799
yeah beat it you don't need to show me

00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:25.919
that at the beginning and then i was

00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:27.039
wondering because it's a book

00:17:27.039 --> 00:17:28.880
i wonder if that was in the book yeah i

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.160
wonder if it was or if that was a little

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.039
hollywood like

00:17:31.039 --> 00:17:32.960
little wrestle we need to make sure

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.720
everybody knows he's a good confederate

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.280
soldier

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.679
yeah you know yeah i wonder if i don't

00:17:37.679 --> 00:17:39.039
know if i think tom hanks might be

00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:41.039
getting type casted as like a racially

00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:42.880
enlightened historical exactly

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.480
that's exactly what this was this is

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.640
wrong it was it it is

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.280
it is the perfect tom hanks movie yeah

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:49.679
and

00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:52.880
uh at one point he like starts a workers

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.919
riot

00:17:53.919 --> 00:17:56.000
for no so his job is to read the news

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.840
that's his job she goes down to town and

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.280
reads the news which is pretty funny

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.240
yeah but then the the problems were so

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.919

hanks and the girl

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.000
he asks tom hanks to read the news tom

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.360
hanks tells him what his job is and he's

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:23.600
like

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.760
here read this news and it's just about

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:26.640

the guy is nice it's like his own

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.000
newspaper that he writes

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.280
and he wants to tell all the talents

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.640
people how great he is so he gives it to

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.440
tom hanks

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.559
and then inexplicably tom hanks refuses

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:37.520
to read it

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.679

he reads to the workers

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.039
yeah who of course immediately break

00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:48.480
into a riot

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.720
after one minute of hearing this and the

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.520
the guy who's

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.760
running the place is like well i just

around too all week dude

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.520
what were you doing just doing podcasts

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.720
hanging out with other guys seeing a

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.159
podcast [ __ ] dude yeah

00:27:08.159 --> 00:27:10.320
what's going on just being a [ __ ] dude

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.760
yeah that was my college years

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.240
disgusting dude you know the [ __ ]

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.440
aren't making enough right now they're

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.080
pissed

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.840
[ __ ] are not making enough money yo did

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.799
you see 140 000 people lost their jobs

00:27:20.799 --> 00:27:22.880
in december and they were all women

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.720
what yeah is that where that stat came

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.559
from yes

00:27:26.559 --> 00:27:28.960
oh it's just the most misleading way to

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.080
present that stat

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.760
because i saw there they were talking

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.360
about um

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.120
you know how now that like pretty much

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.399
only women lose their jobs they have to

00:27:36.399 --> 00:27:37.279
be [ __ ] now

00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:39.200
that was the article being like women

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.880
are losing their jobs and they have to

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.000
do only fans

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.760
but now there's so many [ __ ] on only

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.320
fans it's not worth any money now

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.159
so now that like it's funny well you

00:27:48.159 --> 00:27:49.200
kind of think about it it's kind of like

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.559
one of those economic things where it's

00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:51.039
like

00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:52.960
if you take away all the taboo around

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.640
like you know sticking pens up your butt

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.600
on the internet

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.960
suddenly it's not that valuable for

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.880
service so

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.360
i yeah you know so we want it's good

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.000
that we're all set

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.080
very sex positive now but now you can't

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.120
get like 200

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.440
an hour for just like quaking and you

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.799
know like peeing on your sheets or

00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:10.080
whatever people are up to on that

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.039
yeah that sucks saturated a lot i don't

00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:13.919
you know i don't want to see

00:28:13.919 --> 00:28:15.600
you know the [ __ ] in poverty but that

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.960
was like that was like the

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.240
the gold rush yeah just the rush of

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.880
women settlers to be [ __ ] yeah dude

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.480

paving the streets out here and i mean

00:28:26.399 --> 00:28:28.159

[Laughter]

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:02.559

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.720
breaks and just stretching themselves

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.039
just

00:30:07.039 --> 00:30:08.960
[ __ ] fisting their like i'm almost

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.000
there i just got to hold this down for

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.039
another week

00:30:11.039 --> 00:30:12.240
yeah but apparently they're not making a

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.679
lot of money as much as they thought so

00:30:13.679 --> 00:30:15.440
now like they've just like put stuff

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.760
out about themselves online and uh it's

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.120
not it's not paying off

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.240
and welcome to podcast i think yeah

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.360
yeah it can backfire but i think uh

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.039
i think probably the december thing was

00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:28.399
a lot of women are in the service

00:30:28.399 --> 00:30:29.440
industry

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.600
uh and once it got cold out a bunch of

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.360
businesses had to

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.799
shut down yeah right isn't that

00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:38.880
probably simple yeah probably although

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.399
there's a lot of nurses

00:30:40.399 --> 00:30:42.960
true a lot a lot of business is booming

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.399
they're crushing it right now yeah i

00:30:44.399 --> 00:30:44.640
mean

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.880
they're not just overtime hero status

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.399
dying

00:30:48.399 --> 00:30:49.840
taking are they dying are the nurses

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.360
dying i think the nurses are toughing it

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:51.760
out

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.039
but i think they're fine yeah yeah i

00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:54.399
think they're getting a little sickly

00:30:54.399 --> 00:30:55.919
they might get sick clearly yeah sickly

00:30:55.919 --> 00:30:57.519
i think there was a doctor who died he

00:30:57.519 --> 00:30:58.799
got the coven vaccine and

00:30:58.799 --> 00:31:01.120
instantly died from the vaccine he died

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.960
well there so the companies are like

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.000
look

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.279
that's you know it could have been

00:31:05.279 --> 00:31:07.519
anything and the wife's like he was very

00:31:07.519 --> 00:31:09.120
healthy and took that and died a week

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.200
later so his wife's being like

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.559
it's funny when it's the vaccine they're

00:31:12.559 --> 00:31:14.399
like it could have been anything yeah

00:31:14.399 --> 00:31:15.679
meanwhile if he would have died of just

00:31:15.679 --> 00:31:16.080
cove

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.080
they'd be like it was coming 100 you got

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.760
to watch out yeah

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.480
yeah man but yeah so he he uh yeah he he

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.080
died like a week afterwards

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.679
and but the wife is being i mean then

00:31:25.679 --> 00:31:27.600
again it's like bro well i don't think

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.960
you can sue vaccine

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.799
company like drug companies for vaccines

00:31:30.799 --> 00:31:32.080
specifically i think that

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.200
was one of the things they did with

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.679
operation warp speed really was make

00:31:37.679 --> 00:31:39.679
sure that you couldn't get sued

00:31:39.679 --> 00:31:41.679
four for what they're putting out i

00:31:41.679 --> 00:31:44.159
believe pretty tight i could be wrong

00:31:44.159 --> 00:31:46.240
because that's why vaccines i mean not

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.000
just the science obviously

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.399
take like decades to get done yeah

00:31:50.399 --> 00:31:51.440
there's also like

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.760
it's a liability yeah and i think with

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.840
this trump dog was like nah dude

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.960
fired up fired up fired up yeah i wonder

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.000
if he got paid

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.559
trump dog yeah you just have to assume

00:32:02.559 --> 00:32:03.120
yes

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.559
you have to man if you're the president

00:32:04.559 --> 00:32:06.159
there's not like dude you could

00:32:06.159 --> 00:32:08.640
it's within your hands to be like not

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:09.279
that one

00:32:09.279 --> 00:32:11.919
yeah he also freed weezy yesterday free

be it'll be very fun

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:15.359
this is my prediction um watching people

00:41:15.359 --> 00:41:15.839
get

00:41:15.839 --> 00:41:17.760
disenfranchised within like the the

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.599
corporately led political system because

00:41:19.599 --> 00:41:21.119
now everyone's all in everyone's just

00:41:21.119 --> 00:41:22.160
like

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.640
yeah the government [ __ ] rules dude

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:25.920
you know we were

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.440
with bush everyone was kind of off the

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.880
government bandwagoning but we're back

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.000
on big time

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
we're just like tell us what to do we

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.440
will do it and it'll be funny to watch

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.240
us all lose

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.839
collective faith and you know what was

00:41:35.839 --> 00:41:37.359
essentially propaganda again

00:41:37.359 --> 00:41:39.200
and be like hey i think these guys are

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.400
up to something then immediately like

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.599
wait what what's going on

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:42.800
something's out there get us just tell

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.160
us what to do we'll stop being bad

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.440
please basically yeah

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.440
it'll be fun to watch you know yeah i

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.440
agree with that i think that'll happen

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.880

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.079

be the next bad guy

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.760
i think muslims could make a comeback uh

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:56.560
now that

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.160
they're gonna well obviously white

00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.280
supremacist yeah they're gonna white

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.240
supremacists will be

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:02.319
for a while getting us for a while ultra

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:03.680
right-wing militias

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.680
that'll be yeah you're right be fun to

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.119

all right [ __ ] i used to be able to

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.160

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.480
zero problems really yeah i have too

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:53.920
sensitive of a soul dude no it's

terrible i can't

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.000
see those things and i've been thinking

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.599
about it and i think you'll agree with

00:43:57.599 --> 00:43:58.160
me on this

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:01.280
yeah that type of

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.400
it's on par with not on par with

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.240
but it's close it's the closest thing to

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.599
child porn

00:44:07.599 --> 00:44:09.599
when it comes to things we shouldn't be

00:44:09.599 --> 00:44:11.440
watching

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:14.480
horrific murders on camera it's next on

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:14.880
the list

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.520
are dead like horrible yeah it's pretty

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.119
bad you shouldn't be watching it

00:44:19.119 --> 00:44:20.640
i think so i think it's pretty bad it's

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.400
a terrible thing it's also sin

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.240
what's it doing to your mind dude it's

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.760
doing wild [ __ ] to your mind

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.839
yeah it has to [ __ ] your brain up yeah

00:44:27.839 --> 00:44:29.359
that's why i think i stopped watching

00:44:29.359 --> 00:44:30.000
them

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.280
like yeah six years ago maybe big bills

meryl streep tom hanks and then just

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.040
write a movie that would like

a movie

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.680
celebrities to sell their own values i

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.200

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:09.040
remote viewing app so i'm in a

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.400
tournament right now of remote you know

what

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.880
remote viewing is no remember the one

00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:14.480
time i told you i was on the elliptical

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:16.000
and i was trying to like view where you

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.920
were and what you were doing

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:20.720
so if i'm like somewhere if i'm not at a

00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:21.280
place

00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.799
to be able to try to visualize what's

00:58:22.799 --> 00:58:24.160
going on there like what's contained

00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:24.480
there

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.760
yeah it's called remote viewing it's a

00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:27.200
skill that was the day i don't know if

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:27.760
you remember

00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.040
yeah i hit you with the time and you

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.640
said i was in your dreams which yes i

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:31.839
might have just been you know no i

00:58:31.839 --> 00:58:33.119
remember that i might have gone beyond

00:58:33.119 --> 00:58:34.400
remote viewing yes

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:37.040
dude so i've been doing this app and

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:37.839
i've been

00:58:37.839 --> 00:58:39.280
you haven't even tried to remote view me

00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:41.119
since but whatever uh

00:58:41.119 --> 00:58:42.079
i'm still bringing about it the other

00:58:42.079 --> 00:58:43.280
day i was like i've tried to pull the

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:44.319
boy up a couple times

00:58:44.319 --> 00:58:46.880
he's trying to remove him i try to pull

00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:48.000
you up i thought you could remove

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:52.000
me very easily that's sitting here going

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.119
that's it or watching you know

00:58:55.119 --> 00:58:57.200
dude i have dreams i have to give you my

00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.160
my results are

00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:59.599
and i don't want to scare the viewers

00:58:59.599 --> 00:59:01.200
i'm still the same guy i've always been

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:01.839
i just

00:59:01.839 --> 00:59:05.359
psychically capable uh dude look at look

00:59:05.359 --> 00:59:06.079
at his history

00:59:06.079 --> 00:59:08.480
so it's the thing is how it works so you

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:10.240
get remote viewing tournament

00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:12.480
it's an app on your phone and you get

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:13.280
these

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:15.040
so it'll just give you a number so you

00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.319
have like a number so you can match it

00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:17.280
to the image

00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:18.640
so you write down the number on the

00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:20.480
little sketch pad and then

00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:24.000
you predict what you're going to see

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.559
okay and it flashes you two images and

00:59:26.559 --> 00:59:27.920
only one of them is the correct one so

00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:29.359
you have to connect with the version of

00:59:29.359 --> 00:59:29.920
yourself

00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:33.040
but this this is not real

00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:35.440
what are you talking about dude i'll let

00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:36.640
me let me just show you let me show you

00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:37.920
something dude let me show you my

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:38.799
history

00:59:38.799 --> 00:59:40.960
so what how much of you believes that

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.000
this is it's

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.359
there's something behind this okay let

00:59:43.359 --> 00:59:45.200
me just i'll show you 100

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:47.440
okay let me show you my history so this

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:48.799
is what you believe you can

00:59:48.799 --> 00:59:51.200
predict so and it's not like one-to-one

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.000
it's just

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.760
you can start look so this is my

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:55.520
prediction i write down the serial

00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:56.000
number

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000
i just an image i close my you know i

00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.520
slow my mind and just

00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:00.960
an image comes to me of just a bunch of

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.640
little circles and then i get a sense

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:03.760
that there's green somewhere in the

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:04.559
picture

01:00:04.559 --> 01:00:06.079
so and there's the thing they show you

01:00:06.079 --> 01:00:07.680
two images sometimes you see the one

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.960
that's not the one and you get it wrong

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.240
it's very common

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.000
so here is the uh here's the outcome

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.880
dude target image

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.559
what do you see that's how you pick it

01:00:16.559 --> 01:00:18.480
so i drew little circles and i thought

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.280
green

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.960
bam it's obviously this thing of rocks

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.880
with the grass that was correct

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.359
it's no big deal that's remote viewed

01:00:25.359 --> 01:00:26.559
it's not a problem

01:00:26.559 --> 01:00:29.760
dude explain this one all right this is

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.200
all i don't see any pictures so what's

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.640
the serial number that you're writing

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:32.960
down

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.319
that's so you can match the image that's

01:00:34.319 --> 01:00:36.400
the original okay so i write down the

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.280
serial number

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:40.559
elephant cobblestone well yeah dude

01:00:40.559 --> 01:00:42.799
and again you know it's not perfect but

01:00:42.799 --> 01:00:43.920
check this out

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:46.960
what's the image dude

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:50.640
[ __ ] elephant dude a [ __ ] elephant

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.640
so i pick elephant wrong it was actually

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:53.680
this one but

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:55.280
they said a lot of times you you know

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.720
what's that other image there for just

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:57.680
to kind of help you

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.680
so they'll show you two i'll give you a

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:01.119
cobblestone well on that bridge

01:01:01.119 --> 01:01:02.960
too that tunnel well that's the problem

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.960
is they say you start to see

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.799
you'll see both of them but you got to

01:01:06.799 --> 01:01:08.000
get good enough where you connect

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:08.960
yourself to start

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:11.359
seeing let me let me try one we'll do

01:01:11.359 --> 01:01:12.480
we'll try one for real

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.640
so then uh i'm getting feedback in 68

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:15.920
minutes on last night

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:18.400
so then i did another one this is kind

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.200

is it fake uh and just any words at all

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.160
you got to close your eyes and connect

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.079
with the version of yourself

01:02:12.079 --> 01:02:13.760
in the future that's going to see the

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.440
image like yeah get the image i've

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.960
already connected i know the answer

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.119
go ahead write it down you can oh you

01:02:19.119 --> 01:02:20.640
can draw even if there's little shapes

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:21.520
or things

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.440
you can draw kind of what you think that

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.599
is

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.680
i don't want to do it i i need like you

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:30.960
know you really need to get in kind of a

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.720
deep meditative state to do this so i

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.680
don't want to

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:36.720
done what you got

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.880
traffic light blue hell yeah i'm just

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:41.839
for the sake of it

01:02:41.839 --> 01:02:43.359
i promise that's the answer i'm going to

01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:46.880
go in the future have you really

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.240
show today's result let me see let me

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:51.359
see if i can tap into

01:02:51.839 --> 01:02:52.960
i don't know why i'm getting a beach

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:55.359
ball i don't think it's correct but

01:02:55.359 --> 01:02:57.200
i'm getting some sort of tool in the

01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:58.559
earth so i'll draw that there but

01:02:58.559 --> 01:03:00.000
this cool in the earth this one does

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.520
this one doesn't count alright so you

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.720
did they teach you how to give vague

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:03.200
answers

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.799
no so no not at all so they said use

01:03:04.799 --> 01:03:07.280
your slider say how confident are you

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.400
oh they're not going to show me the

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.400
image actually oh what

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.960
why not when do you get the image result

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.760
you get it in like a couple hours

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.359
my settings are [ __ ] up god damn it

01:03:17.359 --> 01:03:19.200
hold on it'll it'll show me

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.559
i think my settings are [ __ ] up so

01:03:20.559 --> 01:03:22.319
this is what's the name of this app

01:03:22.319 --> 01:03:26.160
rv tournament okay rv tournament nice

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.680
it's [ __ ] wrong it's you versus other

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.599
clairvoyance so if you

01:03:29.599 --> 01:03:31.520
get a certain level they'll give you

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.520
like 10 bucks or so you'll get they'll

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.400
pay you

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.000
if you start to do they'll pay you the

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.680
guy who started this

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.760
he said it's only so far it's only been

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.119
like slightly over 50

01:03:41.119 --> 01:03:42.960
which is to be expected but you can show

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:44.240
me any picture right now and that will

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:46.079
hold up because i was channeling me in

01:03:46.079 --> 01:03:46.880
the future

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:49.359
we'll see depending just do any random

01:03:49.359 --> 01:03:50.319
result

01:03:50.319 --> 01:03:51.920
how so if it has nothing to do with

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.359
either of these and then you have to

01:03:53.359 --> 01:03:54.559
select the correct one

01:03:54.559 --> 01:03:56.319
so it's more so than just chance because

01:03:56.319 --> 01:03:57.920
you get two images so you can't just

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.520
pick oh i think i kind of saw that

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:00.960
because one of those is fake

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.720
so i think that's how they do it okay

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.880
and this guy said he's gotten with like

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.680
i think like 55 he he's using the people

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.960
who do the best on this

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.960
he's been able to predict nasdaq at

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.160
correctly 55

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:14.319
of the time pretty tight i mean it's

01:04:14.319 --> 01:04:15.920
it's it's almost

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.400
i think uh significance and you do

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.200
genuinely

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.400

have it so i could reveal it right away

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.960
that would have really made my day i was

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.240
just thinking of random

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:00.319
internet images to always click the

01:05:00.319 --> 01:05:04.000

01:05:17.599 --> 01:05:19.440
well the idea is it's not really like

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:20.480
it's just something like if you

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:22.559
completely relax your mind

01:05:22.559 --> 01:05:23.920
there could be states of consciousness

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.280
that we're just not in touch with so

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:25.760
it's like

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.760

it's the easiest thing in the world

01:12:14.719 --> 01:12:16.719
which makes difficult dude yeah i think

01:12:16.719 --> 01:12:17.120
dude

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.640
yeah that's what i'm getting as i'm

older it's like if you don't have a

01:12:19.679 --> 01:12:21.120
clear purpose it's like

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.040
[ __ ] starts to get really weird yeah and

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.320

01:12:32.719 --> 01:12:34.480
the only creatures who need to like make

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.360
sense out of the things

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:37.679

and eat stuff and we could it's not

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:42.080
always something that's what i've been

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:43.040
doing

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.159
some you know again it's like the

01:12:44.159 --> 01:12:46.320
classics yeah i've been coming and

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.480
eating is this all there is dude calming

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.760
and forking and

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:53.360
[ __ ] sucking asses

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.199
yeah but yeah dude that's the um that's

01:12:55.199 --> 01:12:56.719
the 2021 move dude

01:12:56.719 --> 01:12:59.199
taking full command of the day and uh

01:12:59.199 --> 01:13:00.880
you know the thing with the peloton too

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:02.400
is pretty cool there's a

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.000
thing called like elastic habits where

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.199
it's like say you're not gonna do like

01:13:05.199 --> 01:13:06.640
you know four [ __ ] hours or like an

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:07.760
olympic level thing yeah

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.199
you put a calendar and then you say like

01:13:09.199 --> 01:13:10.640
all right i i can have a thing where i

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:11.920
do 10 minutes of it

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:14.080
there's another level if i do 30 minutes

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.080
maximum levels me doing it for an hour

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:17.360
so you just do it for 10 if you're not

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.400
going to do it at all you just do it for

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:19.679
10 minutes and you have a calendar where

01:13:19.679 --> 01:13:21.040
you put like a color-coded sticker

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.400
versus like which level thing

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.000
they have back in them on the app do

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.840
they really yeah exactly it's called

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.360
your calendar it's called elastic habits

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.719
dude yeah that's not a big deal

01:13:28.719 --> 01:13:30.480
and it rewards you for how many days you

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:31.840
do it and then they now they're doing

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.880
that there's a thing where it's like

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.320
programs mm-hmm

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:36.080
it's good it's dude it gives you a

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.360
program it's like people need us

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:38.880
people need it dude yeah i need it and i

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.480
mean [ __ ] i

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.320
i had a long period in my life where i

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.000
didn't have to

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.800
go to work and stuff and dude it would

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:47.600
just start to like

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.440
[ __ ] with me dude yeah you get you get

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.199
full i got a taste of like

01:13:51.199 --> 01:13:53.840
retirement kind of sort of i'm selling

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:54.340
drugs but

01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:56.080
[Laughter]

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.440
but the like you know i had the whole

01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.679
data also makes you wonder like if those

01:13:59.679 --> 01:14:01.440
old women

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:03.520
were appreciative of a guy coming in the

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:04.880
window with a hammer and being like all

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:06.239
right no more hanging out

01:14:06.239 --> 01:14:09.040
no more hanging out i thought you said

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:09.600
whether they're

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:12.400
selling drugs hanging out yeah i think

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:13.280
once you're 70

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:16.080
it might rule it out yeah i doubt

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:17.440
there's any like internal pressures

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.199
gonna suck dude no i've been hanging out

01:14:19.199 --> 01:14:21.600
go to the same store for like 70 years

like i need to do something i need to

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:33.520

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:47.840
it's like when you accomplish something

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.120

long as you don't have a burger for a

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:33.520

little

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:45.040

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.080
whoa

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:47.280
that's what i that's what i'm working on

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:49.280
right now with helium comedy that was

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:50.880
one of the tight watts they're

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.159
tight wads are you know they're doing

01:20:52.159 --> 01:20:54.320
what they do they just lowballed me

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.320
pretty good

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:57.760
just got hit with a good low ball but

01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:59.360
that's fine yeah

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:00.560
so i was like just give me enough money

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:01.920
that i can just split it every week

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:03.920
evenly with everybody

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:05.600
and it's somewhat worthwhile yeah

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.120
because i think we'll sell it out pretty

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:08.080
regularly probably

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.600

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.280
people are like oh [ __ ] this is

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.840
good stand up that we can see yeah

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:14.480
regularly

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:16.560

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:24.880
this something you're interested in what

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.360

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:30.880
yeah yeah yeah wow

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:33.280
kind of big timing yeah what's this what

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:34.159
was that move

01:21:34.159 --> 01:21:36.000
what are you trying to do there what's

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.480
that yeah

01:21:40.159 --> 01:21:43.199
that's what you get you just busted that

01:21:43.199 --> 01:21:45.120
chair

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.560

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.159
why would you do that towards me why

01:21:48.159 --> 01:21:49.280
