what up dude it's got to be so nice to

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.710
doing stand-up when you know you have

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.300
the dogs in the crowd yes about it

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.530

just having a good ol time

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.770
so I almost it's like in a way that if

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:22.910
you listen to someone's pocket

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.290
a lot then you go to you like you watch

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.090
them do stand-up it must you must feel

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.460
kind of like oddly connected to it for

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.050
sure this is crazy I listen sky talk

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.460
even if you're not doing well they're

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.600
still in a plane or they hear your

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.530
thoughts so much and they're watching

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.720
you do whatever like oh my god this is

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.300

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.610

exactly and it's definitely the

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.800
prototype of like shat Nations

especially podcast specific patriotism

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.320
it's like through the [ __ ] route

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.000
that's what I mean yeah we demand

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.760

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.820
sorry yeah you're good but apparently

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.320
taking someone to the cherry blossoms

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.150
it's like when they I guess I don't know

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:51.280
when they're in season

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:57.230
bloom oh really yeah the Japanese game

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:59.360
to us nice little gift from this yeah

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.440
yeah also a lot of our like weed trees

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.180
like like there's weird trees that

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.560
growing Lots in Philly that drop like

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.080
the

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.760
Thank You balls and alone yeah they're

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.070
Chinese trees they came over when they

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:12.779
they should pack they see use their

00:18:12.779 --> 00:18:14.340
seeds as like packaging peanuts and the

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.440
old railroad days Oh in stowaways we get

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.730
out there you know be digging through

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.350
the steel and [ __ ] and the crates they

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.820
would run away from the cops and trail

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:28.169
those bunch of Murdock's and they spread

00:18:28.169 --> 00:18:29.880
those little monkey see monkey balls are

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.059
called a stinky little trees that's how

00:18:33.059 --> 00:18:35.190
we have them they're using day like it's

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:36.480
like a huge problem it's invasive

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.029
species yeah yeah oh yeah lotta they uh

00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:40.470
yeah a lot of the stuff we have is on

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.389
not on purpose I just got a flash of

00:18:42.389 --> 00:18:43.740
facial just like one of the boats

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.090
pulling up to the docks and like the

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.730
talkies it's a small mark up a bunch of

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:50.490
autistic dudes wait wait in the wings bi

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:52.490
oh no one treats her this yeah hey

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:58.289
autism is on the rise now they're trying

00:18:58.289 --> 00:18:59.519
to say like it's it's been like

00:18:59.519 --> 00:19:03.149
skyrocketing here's my thing with

00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:06.330
vaccines it's diagnosis also I mean

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:07.409
obviously they took that into

00:19:07.409 --> 00:19:09.360
consideration when they said that yeah I

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.429
mean sure when they first started doing

00:19:11.429 --> 00:19:12.600
it I mean yeah maybe they came up with

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.000
like new and cooler forms of autism

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.029
saying well yeah I'm saying instead of

00:19:18.029 --> 00:19:19.950
just being like yeah my kids weird yeah

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:23.340
yeah like he's autistic I'm saying in

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:27.210
the 60s weird the more people understand

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.590
it the more it'll diagnose it no that's

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:29.850
that's I can see that but apparently

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.399
it's like been happening more and more

00:19:32.399 --> 00:19:34.740
and more there's like no no one really

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.330
knows how to explain it but the weird

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.419
thing with of anti-vaxxer Fizz like

00:19:38.419 --> 00:19:40.889
people do get if you're like they're you

00:19:40.889 --> 00:19:42.090
know they're trying to like from what

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:43.470
I've heard they're trying to set up a

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:44.820
thing that's like a vaccine schedule for

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.139
adults currently there's gonna be

00:19:46.139 --> 00:19:48.480
mandatory vaccine in adults but you I'm

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.830
not really in it I don't want to do that

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.929
so if I'm like now I'm cool if you like

00:19:51.929 --> 00:19:53.580
your say like I'm cool on that vaccine

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:55.409
you're a psychopath but you can be like

00:19:55.409 --> 00:19:57.299
I don't trust big pharma it's like the

00:19:57.299 --> 00:19:58.980
same people one of them with a needle

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.990
there's a pill you can be like [ __ ]

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:02.429
big farmers [ __ ] but if you if

00:20:02.429 --> 00:20:03.510
you're talking about needles that give

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.039
people it's like what are you [ __ ]

00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:08.580
nuts lunes like dude I mean look I'd you

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:09.779
know vaccines work but if they're gonna

00:20:09.779 --> 00:20:11.519
put out of X if the people who brought

00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:15.120
you all the way like oxycontin now now

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.980
you need a [ __ ] shot every month it's

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.440
like nah dude now they're making it so

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.060
like if you talk out against back

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.680
you're looked at as like a [ __ ]

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.960
nutcase so they rule out the thing if

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.100
you're like I'm cool in the vaccine

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.420
schedule you're gonna look like a dork

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.710
there's so many people are trying to go

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:30.450
get vaccines from the mandatory adult

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:33.090
vaccine thing mandatory adult vaccine

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:34.500
but trying to they were saying they're

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.300
trying to roll it out yeah that's insane

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.670
yeah dude it's like if you go to the

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:39.870
doctor your doctors gonna be like here

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:42.060
you need these and if you're like no

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.480
it's like like what are you crazy on

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.220
record saying no to vaccines your doctor

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.120
that you really like all this guy's a

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.800
[ __ ] this guy's a school shooter hmm

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.300
they do remember usually other thing

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.980
about my my ex weed doctor how he got

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.650
busted no no I didn't know was that

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.390
actually him on it was actually him

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.980
Brock there was the thing on the reddit

00:20:58.980 --> 00:20:59.340
where uh

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.160
the guy got my weed card off of he like

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.300
got in trouble they're trying to say

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.740
like he gave too many cards out or

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.750
something but he also had vlogs where he

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:09.030
was going on and being like enough Lea

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:10.230
he wasn't like these like a video

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:11.580
podcast where he would go on and be like

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.290
if I you're a female and I'm spending

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.900
time with you time clocks on just know

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.010
you better give it up like [ __ ] like

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:24.540
that he was getting real sick with it he

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.980
was doing like he was getting real sick

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:30.450
with it dude the girl the girl [ __ ]

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:32.670
who rode up his uh the thing about him

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:33.750
being like you know he was there

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.970
basically saying like the guy was he was

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:37.770
a doctor prescribing medicinal weed but

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:39.570
like was broadcasting himself using

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:40.860
unhealthy amounts of weed and they're

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.150
like dude you know which I'm like yeah

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.660
fair enough but the via the girl who

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.880
wrote the article is like since he said

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.530
like you know clock's ticking if I'm

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:50.850
gonna spend time with you like you bet

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:52.110
I'm a doctor like if I'm not working

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.730
like I'm supposed to I'm not in the

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.380
freest basically said like I don't sit

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:55.980
in the friend zone

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.740
and then the lady tied that comment a

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.990
right-wing terror to terrorism being

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:02.880
like well this guy's clearly in cell and

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.310
as an in cell he's clearly like ready to

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:07.200
attack and do a domestic terrorism it

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.480
was [ __ ] insane the jumps they took

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.610
so if you're misogynistic now dude

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:12.870
you're basically a terrorist that's a

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.360
reach it was wild dude this lady wrote

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.430
this article people like yeah [ __ ] him

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:19.290
and it's like dude I get it not the most

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:21.150
likable dude in the world but you like

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:23.220
make that jump of like well he's mean to

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:24.750
women so he probably doesn't have sex so

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:25.950
he's probably then so on his in cell

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:27.660
he's definitely a far away a right-wing

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.850
yeah like conspiracy theory freak show

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.410
who's like definitely gonna like shoot

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:32.520
up a [ __ ] school and these are the

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.870
guys we need a lookout for and it's like

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:34.509
what

00:22:34.509 --> 00:22:37.179
[ __ ] yeah yes it's made a pretty [ __ ]

00:22:37.179 --> 00:22:38.919
huge jump in logic there this is on the

00:22:38.919 --> 00:22:40.929
good doctor to something good doc well

00:22:40.929 --> 00:22:43.179
he's a great doc so what happened he got

00:22:43.179 --> 00:22:45.729
his colorful card pulled and publicly

00:22:45.729 --> 00:22:47.619
shamed that's what we've definitely been

00:22:47.619 --> 00:22:48.849
building dude the weapons of mass

00:22:48.849 --> 00:22:51.099
shaming dude yeah like we're not ready

00:22:51.099 --> 00:22:52.989
for the shame we can direct on people

00:22:52.989 --> 00:22:56.469
now is like it's so insane cuz everybody

00:22:56.469 --> 00:22:58.419
you get so many people from everywhere

00:22:58.419 --> 00:23:00.789
to jump in on it and like yep I'm with

00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:02.619
you man it's like did he add the biggest

00:23:02.619 --> 00:23:04.539
[ __ ] it's like I mean take it easy

00:23:04.539 --> 00:23:06.070
dude I was listen to a thing today

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:08.859
that's the computer I think the computer

00:23:08.859 --> 00:23:10.419
as we know it was just like they were

00:23:10.419 --> 00:23:13.239
built to build atom bombs like the the

00:23:13.239 --> 00:23:15.879
ones and zeroes it's a like what's the

00:23:15.879 --> 00:23:16.839
[ __ ] it called like there's like

00:23:16.839 --> 00:23:18.309
digital computation and analog

00:23:18.309 --> 00:23:20.229
computation and the digital one was like

00:23:20.229 --> 00:23:22.569
in order to like I don't I can't [ __ ]

00:23:22.569 --> 00:23:23.769
explain particle physics but it's

00:23:23.769 --> 00:23:24.999
basically about like how you can get

00:23:24.999 --> 00:23:26.169
those things and move so fast so it

00:23:26.169 --> 00:23:27.579
creates like that basically hydrogen

00:23:27.579 --> 00:23:29.229
bomb yeah they built computers for that

00:23:29.229 --> 00:23:31.539
reason and now we have the same thing

00:23:31.539 --> 00:23:33.729
student it's like they're trying to

00:23:33.729 --> 00:23:36.579
start analog computers dude yeah you

00:23:36.579 --> 00:23:39.069
guys [ __ ] with analog computing no I

00:23:39.069 --> 00:23:41.379
don't understand that's a word I'm right

00:23:41.379 --> 00:23:42.909
now basically what it is it's like like

00:23:42.909 --> 00:23:45.099
nine words in that last comment that I

00:23:45.099 --> 00:23:47.799
have no idea what yeah baby I've been

00:23:47.799 --> 00:23:51.549
bacon vape pens dude okay I'm like

00:23:51.549 --> 00:23:53.019
completely starved and just out of my

00:23:53.019 --> 00:23:54.339
mind no they're talking about like so

00:23:54.339 --> 00:23:56.859
analog computing is like I don't really

00:23:56.859 --> 00:23:58.209
understand it but it's kind of like your

00:23:58.209 --> 00:24:00.009
body is like an analog computation

00:24:00.009 --> 00:24:01.809
system where it's like it's a system

00:24:01.809 --> 00:24:04.299
that flows and like computing is like an

00:24:04.299 --> 00:24:05.859
artificial thing of that where it's just

00:24:05.859 --> 00:24:07.749
like that valve that moves on and off

00:24:07.749 --> 00:24:09.879
and the codes information that way but

00:24:09.879 --> 00:24:12.429
like for like Facebook to get as big as

00:24:12.429 --> 00:24:14.409
it gets it needs to start using analog

00:24:14.409 --> 00:24:15.729
computers which are you and your cell

00:24:15.729 --> 00:24:16.809
phones and like transmitting the

00:24:16.809 --> 00:24:18.879
information that's an analog computer

00:24:18.879 --> 00:24:20.349
network so an analog computer is like a

00:24:20.349 --> 00:24:23.669
that's when they say like a cybernetic

00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:26.859
organisms like an organism oh nice but

00:24:26.859 --> 00:24:27.999
like nature is like an analog computer

00:24:27.999 --> 00:24:29.649
it runs on like systems that like people

00:24:29.649 --> 00:24:32.289
can't really understand mmm so maybe

00:24:32.289 --> 00:24:36.759

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.850
tight dude it's uh I still have to lose

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:41.289
like two out two more hours left in it

00:25:41.289 --> 00:25:43.419
talks about the AI and [ __ ] what is this

00:25:43.419 --> 00:25:46.419
a documentary no no this is a who's a

00:25:46.419 --> 00:25:47.769
[ __ ] doobie always sam Harris Sam

00:25:47.769 --> 00:25:49.809
Harris hello okay I special is coming

00:25:49.809 --> 00:25:52.389
it's a [ __ ] dude the cut the the

00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:53.710
computer stuff coming in the next ten

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:54.909
years people are ready for it - it's

00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:56.049
gonna be out of [ __ ] control

00:25:56.049 --> 00:25:58.720
yeah we're not ready for social media no

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.880
we weren't ready for that Tony Awards

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.039
obviously things there's a big shift

00:26:03.039 --> 00:26:04.600
prediction right now my one buddy who's

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.309
a tech guy was telling me about that

00:26:06.309 --> 00:26:07.720
like with Apple basically he's gonna

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.700
take the fall and it's like why is it

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.279
because if you look at technology that

00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:15.100
happens it has to happen like Apple

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.620
can't stay where they are like people

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.029
are just gonna be like nope and it's

00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:20.830
everything else trickles down and then

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.019
it just makes this huge shift to wear

00:26:23.019 --> 00:26:24.760
something else is the popular thing and

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.500
it's weird cuz he broke it down for me

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.000
he's like I was like all right I guess

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.559
that makes sense he's like it has did

00:26:29.559 --> 00:26:31.539
that s'what happens I was like all right

00:26:31.539 --> 00:26:34.090
you're saying it can't last it'll really

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:35.529
it's like kind of little Wayne how he

00:26:35.529 --> 00:26:37.330
was on top of the rap game no I kind of

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:39.130
Mego so it's like yeah you kind of

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.990
fizzle out I mean I don't know because

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:44.169
apples such a monster but that's that's

00:26:44.169 --> 00:26:46.000
almost like he's saying that's almost

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.799
their downfall because they are this

00:26:47.799 --> 00:26:49.510
[ __ ] big and everything so expensive

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:51.220
and everybody's is gonna be like I did

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.750
we can't [ __ ] afford this [ __ ]

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.220
you mean like somebody's gonna come out

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.230
and lowball cut out their legs and then

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:58.600
that's gonna be the new trend yeah Apple

00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.769
will fall there will be some cooler

00:26:59.769 --> 00:27:00.660
hipper thing

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.330
exactly I want to be I hope it goes back

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:05.040
like beepers oh we go backwards it's

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.910
gonna be it's gonna be like brutal we're

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.490
cool new we have company yeah that's

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:13.230
what it's gonna be hopefully it's all

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:13.800
women

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.780
you think sounded better because our

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.180
phones women are so powerful dude did

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.710
you watch that documentary

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:21.780
the the lady who ripped everybody off no

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.450
I saw oh god bad Bloods dude the lady

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:29.670
from fair knows yeah basically just lied

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:31.890
about the the machine that her company

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:34.590
was developing that could develop it but

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.270
it doesn't analyzes your blood and it

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:38.580
does like 35 different tests or

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.110
something but really it could maybe do

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.000
like one or two and it was half-assed

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.730
and took like an hour so she dude it was

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:45.870
while they're doing it was opposed to be

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:47.550
an immediate pronounced yeah and then

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:48.840
they advertised it like that and it was

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.180
wildly what didn't work at all so they

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:52.620
would mail it to a lab real quick get

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:53.790
the results and send it back and they

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:55.890
were trying to do they set up like CVS

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.230
is like that like Walgreens Waldron s of

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.390
Concord but she's like [ __ ] I'm in I got

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:02.250
a do this what were they selling them so

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:03.570
it was like the ability to get a blood

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:04.890
test we're like rather than getting like

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:06.090
you know they take blood and all these

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:08.310
vials send it out to a lab come back you

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:09.780
would prick your finger and off a drop

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.880
of blood it would test and tell you like

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.520
what things you have what genetic

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.380
weaknesses you might have yeah so it was

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.150
like all in one thing and it never

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:19.950
worked like they never got it to work

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:21.270
but they kept getting funding because it

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:22.500
gets sounded so [ __ ] cool so they

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.940
kept getting contracts and they got in

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:25.860
with like the Department of Defense I

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.320
think Dick Cheney but like yeah it was

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.690
doesn't own a patent it was a mad dog

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:32.520
general that guy yeah he was on the

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.750
board so he was like this thing's a

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.910
magical man is not ya know Madison it

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:37.020
was on the board of this thing so they

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.910
kept getting bigger and mattis Maddox

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:40.740
yeah so give getting bigger and bigger

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.290
and no one ever like kind of they had

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:46.140
such a like tight non-disclosures and if

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.760
you try to like come out against them

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:51.420
they're just [ __ ] sue you to death go

to jail the security billions of dollars

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.500
to where the the machines were at the

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:55.920
office

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.950

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.350
[ __ ] these little claws like inside

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:27.210
working on extremely dangerous

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:28.860
it's just needles and you have to go in

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.679

you did and [ __ ] super loud like dude

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.120

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.190
former professor her former professors

00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:41.460

[ __ ] hands look like this they

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:47.730

00:31:51.600 --> 00:32:00.270
big watch of documentaries I had really

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:02.610
good performer professor she went to

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:03.870
Princeton and I think dropped down

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:05.730
because she was like I knew this was

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:07.830
gonna work and her former professor like

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:09.809
physically I was like told her he's just

00:32:09.809 --> 00:32:11.580
like yeah she was a really bright girl I

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.559
knew she would do something in this

00:32:13.559 --> 00:32:15.270
world to be good I knew it wouldn't be

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:17.330
that because I told her it is

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:19.890
scientifically impossible to do all

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:21.480
these I told her that like three times

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.850
this cannot happen and she's like I

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:28.260
figured it out yeah she's been working

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.030
genetics on her [ __ ] throat because

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:33.540

00:40:00.059 --> 00:40:02.130
feel gay for even bringing this story up

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:07.230
on any [ __ ] story it was I mean it

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:11.180
was just cool ya know you're a [ __ ]

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:14.369
and then you just making rock laughs but

00:40:14.369 --> 00:40:18.960
the Uni walked out so go ahead I think

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.309

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.400
run into each other too many times or we

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.539
don't really know each other anyway

00:40:51.539 --> 00:40:52.789

dude yeah Silver Seraph that thing he

00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:39.500

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.140
[ __ ] oppression like I've been right

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:55.190
to bunch hello hello Sydney Opera House

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:57.530

00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:00.890
monuments of mankind talking ripe how

got your big cake now yeah that's

00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:23.130
another way you go about it it's like

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:24.569
you watch people be funny like really

00:44:24.569 --> 00:44:25.680
I'm funnier than that you watch someone

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:27.150
like talk about their trials and

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:31.289
tribulations you like my trials I'm

00:44:31.289 --> 00:44:34.019
gonna go that's [ __ ] sucks though that

00:44:34.019 --> 00:44:36.119
that's a mindset some of like AHA could

00:44:36.119 --> 00:44:40.499
be way worse than I have my life yeah I

00:44:40.499 --> 00:44:42.089
think it kind of happens on column I

00:44:42.089 --> 00:44:45.569
mean now it's like it's cool it's like

00:44:45.569 --> 00:44:48.150
in vogue to be like aggrieved somehow

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:50.160
like it to be seriously aggrieved that's

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:50.700
crazy

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.109
you're not you're kind of like kind of

00:44:52.109 --> 00:44:55.470

the open mic dude you mean like you

00:46:05.009 --> 00:46:06.480
don't need to [ __ ] be telling people

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.920
the only way much of fun is if

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.480
everyone's getting [ __ ] up and then it

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.489
like it's fun yeah well if you're

00:46:11.489 --> 00:46:13.200
getting rowdy you having fun then it's

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.210
great yeah but as soon as it began

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:16.980
that's kind of what happened at like the

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:17.910
open mics in Philly

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:19.859
yeah like then that wave of like the

00:46:19.859 --> 00:46:23.900
comedy being like I'm impressed

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:25.970
this is a not fun this is their kind of

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:28.190
blackout means it's been it's just it

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:30.589
being infiltrated it got room set were

00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:31.819
like there's limits about what you could

00:46:31.819 --> 00:46:33.760
talk about there was like these weird

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:38.240
like 1984's fake laughter around people

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.829
who weren't funny at all I did watch the

00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:42.349
whole thing happen it was like I would

00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:43.640
watch people laughing like they're doing

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.470
a girl community to came on one time in

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:48.559
everyone bigger we'll have to see who's

00:46:48.559 --> 00:46:52.549
laughing max yeah I'm telling I it was

00:46:52.549 --> 00:46:54.559
like the weirdest thing to witness yeah

00:46:54.559 --> 00:46:56.900
it's like or I'm nuts oh we're I'm just

00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:58.670
some old fashioned bogie who came and

00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:59.960
was like I'm threatened by all these

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.970
girl comedian we were threatened or I

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:04.190
sat there and watched I'm like why am I

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:05.480
not laughing right now and I was like oh

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:06.950
this isn't that [ __ ] funny yeah

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:08.329
there's nothing funny that's happening

00:47:08.329 --> 00:47:09.440
that's why this is hard

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:11.720
yeah and it's awkward to watch all you

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.940
guys fake laugh yeah dude that was like

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:17.390
that was a really you know again though

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:19.400
what's been nice is it's not

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:22.609
I don't do open mic set-offs anymore

00:47:22.609 --> 00:47:25.190
which is [ __ ] incredibly helpful yeah

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:27.049
that's like how much you hate stand-up

00:47:27.049 --> 00:47:28.730
yeah if you're not doing open mics it's

00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:30.980
pretty great just yeah it shows yes

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:33.819
[ __ ] wonderful yeah the open mics

00:47:33.819 --> 00:47:35.839
also I thought New York was gonna be

00:47:35.839 --> 00:47:38.119
like super gay it's not at all every

00:47:38.119 --> 00:47:40.880
single comedians like I mean it's kind

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.500
of to the point where it's annoying but

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.210
every comedians like PC culture sucks

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:46.279
really like just about every on the new

00:47:46.279 --> 00:47:48.109
very good comedian is you wake up for

00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:50.720
this [ __ ] yeah I haven't got the

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.250
memo back here this is like when Japan

00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:55.329
still thought it was in the World War

00:47:58.059 --> 00:48:01.400
memo would also yeah for sure it also

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.200
know what happens is your people who

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.490
doing stand-up to still like you know

00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:06.170
get laughs and like do stand-up and then

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:07.789
it's evolved in the social scene to

00:48:07.789 --> 00:48:10.369
where it was like there's also guys who

00:48:10.369 --> 00:48:13.579
are just trying to get [ __ ] doing

00:48:13.579 --> 00:48:14.869
stand-up in a way that might get them

00:48:14.869 --> 00:48:16.369
[ __ ] so there's two different agendas

00:48:16.369 --> 00:48:17.809
happening and they were like when

00:48:17.809 --> 00:48:19.160
someone would do stand-up and do well

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:20.569
they would start being like yeah you're

00:48:20.569 --> 00:48:22.039
not doing it right you're [ __ ] racist

00:48:22.039 --> 00:48:24.529

00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:39.740
yeah why don't you do stand-up yeah man

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:41.599
what are we doing yeah I know did the

00:48:41.599 --> 00:48:43.880
art of blacking out at open mics is

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:46.069
that's lost oh and that's a sock state

00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:48.619
that's the only way yeah that's the road

00:48:48.619 --> 00:48:49.940
to Mordor dude that's how you do it

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:52.309
that's how open mics are it's like yeah

00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:54.349

01:05:52.850 --> 01:05:56.869
praise the Lord I was born the traveler

01:05:56.869 --> 01:05:58.760
like flash in front of the chapel

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:01.730
[Music]

01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:03.410
my cholesterol

01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:07.160
[Music]

01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:12.520
let's believe that it was naked [ __ ]
