00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.000
dude just comes in and she's like what's

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.919
going on like drop trousers literally

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.360
you see that that's what she goes what's

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.600
going on i was like i gotta [ __ ] rash

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.120
it's you know it's all i'm like ew dude

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.560
what did it look like

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.479
it's just like red inflamed circular

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.240
rashes it's [ __ ] wrong

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.919
but it was like it was because it kept

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:25.360
going away and coming back because i put

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.039
the cream on

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:28.400
and i didn't flame it and whatever and

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.680
it was just it just kept coming so

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.880
you're supposed to put the cream on for

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.320
like a month even after it goes away

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.720
it's all from your [ __ ] dick wax dude

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.280
i think so definitely you're right

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.400
i asked

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.919
well originally i blamed it i blamed it

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:41.120
on brittany to the nurse and i think

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.240
like my girlfriend i could have got it

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.680
from a yeast infection from her and they

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.720
were like

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.240
nah dude that doesn't happen i'm like i

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.600
feel kind of bad for blame that on her

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.800
for the last three months so i was like

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.240
all right

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.039
i was like this clearly

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.680
so then she comes in and she's like yeah

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.720
well it's funny because i didn't see a

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.919
rash on you anywhere else i was

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:58.960
wondering where it was and i was like

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.639
jesus [ __ ] christ i'm like this [ __ ]

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.880
this [ __ ] sucks so then she's alright

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.319
we'll be back so i start [ __ ]

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:05.360
fluffing the house dude i started

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.440
[ __ ] just jolting it up a little bit

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.800
so the black dude comes back in like

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.840
had

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.360
a medical people call me up and be like

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.720
yo you might have herpes and i'm like

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.160
[ __ ] and i'd be like i don't have any

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.000
herpes they're like well that's the test

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.120
for herpes yeah do you have herpes

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.800
is that what they said to you no no i'm

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.479
like i've i've had multiple people from

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:48.880
my past no no i mean did the doctors

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.720
no say anything about herpes no they

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.919
were just like pissing this cup and

we'll tell you if you have anything

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.840
so i feel like when i got i one time i

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.960
got a test where the maybe it was just a

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.520
question before the test

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.639
yeah that's definitely what it was in

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:04.319
hindsight but this whole time i thought

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:05.840
that's how they tested for herpes do you

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.840

i was like no and she was like all right

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.879
you don't have herpes

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:14.720

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.640
[ __ ] gay dude like jokes are sporting

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.720
[Music]

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.560

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.640

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.040
though they're like yeah you [ __ ]

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.240

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.399
you got a [ __ ] mad max dick dude you

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:42.160

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.560
rashed up dick my dick's the undead dude

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.959
it's a white wall

00:09:46.959 --> 00:09:49.440
so that's that's all good news dude my

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.200
in the ongoing journey of my dong dude

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.640
this is just another [ __ ] hurdle it's

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.399
sick if you dick's a white walker look

00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:56.160
after you [ __ ] tricks they open their

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.020
eyes and they're blue

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.839
[Laughter]

00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:04.200
they just follow you everywhere you go

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.920
so that's been going pretty sick dude

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.360
that's nice yeah i was thinking though

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.600
this whole time was uh

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.839
i usually don't like to point out sexism

00:10:13.839 --> 00:10:15.600
and comedy because usually i'm on the

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.160
other side of this but

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.839
here's an example of where it is because

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:22.160
if this was women uh-huh talking about

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.160
how their vaginas are gross

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.240
yeah this would be truly unless notable

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.160
podcasts oh definitely would be if if i

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.240
heard two chicks like so my [ __ ] was

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.959
all beat up i'd be like oh my god

00:10:32.959 --> 00:10:34.640
my [ __ ] has a ring worm on it it was

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.399
like oh my god turn this off well the

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:37.839
dude the nurse was actually said

00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:39.519
something to me where she was like i've

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:41.120
had something similar happen and for the

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.279
last like four days i'm like did she

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:45.200
have [ __ ] like her thigh or a like

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.760
where was her ring worm

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.519
so it's kind of like i've been kind of

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:51.040
puzzling over that

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.160
but she's like just keep putting the

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.079
cream on i was like you got it i was

00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:57.040
like did the nurse have a dong bro

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.279
might have had she was stout dude she's

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:01.279
probably using [ __ ] wax she might have

00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:02.720
been using it probably gave it a shot

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.920
she might have got it off before i

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.040
launched it on the market she probably

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.200
got it

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.880
dude i had some people asking about your

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.320

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.320
just one shirt

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.360
definitely

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.720
i could have sold merch a couple times

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.760
the last few yeah i i don't want to but

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.000

really does do stand up yeah he honestly

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.559
is if he crossed over and doing stan

00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:50.559
into like bill maher's stand up i would

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:51.679
just

00:17:51.679 --> 00:17:53.200

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.640

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.480
for him yeah i mean that's definitely

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.400
why he goes down and he's like everyone

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.440

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.679

00:18:13.679 --> 00:18:14.880
dude

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.640
so anyway he

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.640
he was just like if they kneel you

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.280
should fire those sons of [ __ ]

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.720
and they were all like yeah

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.640
[ __ ] it so i'm sure the timing was like

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.000
nice nice

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:26.840
good

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.000
job but uh then it just resulted in

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.160
everybody in the nfl kneeling yeah well

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.000
they all like locked arms and like yeah

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.440
they're [ __ ] they they shall overcome

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.000
i dude i was i was looking at the screen

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.600
of that at the gym and i for a second

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.960
was like

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.039
thinking trump was on some like ultimate

00:18:45.039 --> 00:18:47.039
meta strategy of like i'll be such a

00:18:47.039 --> 00:18:48.559
[ __ ] [ __ ] that everyone will

00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:50.960
unite against me and then i saw like

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.120
something else he tweeted about like

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.640
it was like new travel ban i was like

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.960
yeah [ __ ]

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.679
maybe he's just doing this on purpose

00:18:59.679 --> 00:19:01.360
and it was like him being like people

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.360
can't come in here from venezuela now

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.559

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.080
believe in yeah yeah which is which is

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.320
totally fair which is fair but this is

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.320
the weird effect and i've been wondering

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.160
about this for a while this is a weird

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.440
effect social media's starting to have

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.880
everyone's in their own little world now

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.400
and they're like yeah i believe in this

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.080
and it's just like so he became a

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.240
conservative meme

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.240
yeah and all the other guys kneeling

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.640
became a liberal meme that was it

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.240
yeah exactly it's all just from memes

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.840
just got sucked up into the internet

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.600
everybody's in the meme world now what

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.280
the [ __ ] you have to decide are you a

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.520
republican meme or a democrat

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.120
that's all you can be right now if

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.320
you're in the spotlight you have to pick

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.720
a meme that's crazy man

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.320
but you saw them all locking arms and

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.840
stuff and then like i saw ray lewis down

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.520
there you see that one yeah i saw him i

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.520
saw him down there that was funny there

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.799
was a bunch of funny memes about that

00:20:38.799 --> 00:20:40.320
what was this oh about him being like i

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.000
wasn't there i didn't do it well yeah it

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.200
was like

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.880
that moment when you realize you're

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.159
protesting

00:20:46.159 --> 00:20:48.480
the death of black men and you've killed

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.640
a few black men so yeah that's funny

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.559
that's pretty [ __ ] funny but yeah

00:20:52.559 --> 00:20:55.039
it's just i don't know there's something

00:20:55.039 --> 00:20:56.400
like i said to you earlier like there's

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.280
something about it i don't like yeah

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.320
and uh

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.919
everybody that listens like they would

00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:02.880
point to that and be like yeah that's

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.400
cause you're racist

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.600
it's like i don't know i think there's

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.880
something in there that there's

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.960
something [ __ ] shitty about all these

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.720
guys doing this what if they were doing

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.400
it i've been i've been trying to wonder

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.240
this too i'm like what if they took a

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.679
knee because they're like 911's a

00:21:15.679 --> 00:21:17.200
conspiracy in need during the national

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.960
anthem how would you feel sick yeah i

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.880
feel like

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.880
it's not that like and also i don't i

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.799
don't care if they kneel yeah like i

00:21:24.799 --> 00:21:25.919
don't care at all and i think they

00:21:25.919 --> 00:21:27.600
should be able to there shouldn't be

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.960
repercussions for that but

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.960
i just i don't get it that's what i was

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.240
asking you i'm like what and you know

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.080
what what's what are they doing i mean

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.640
what what like what's what's the uh

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.159
end game to be like all right so like

00:21:40.159 --> 00:21:41.440
what what do you want what do you want

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.799
us to do so you stop it like what should

00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:44.559
we do

00:21:44.559 --> 00:21:45.679
i don't know

00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:47.600
i guess and racism

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.840
yeah we should probably stop racism all

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.120
right

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.120
could you please yeah dude i don't know

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.240
you need to check your privileges i

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.480
guess racism dude you racist all the

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.600
time

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.440

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.600
[ __ ] remain standing no i i don't

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.360
i'm sure if i was on a team i'd [ __ ]

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.039
kneel if everyone else was kneeling i

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:12.720
saw i saw a thing on tv where it was

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.240
like who will be the first white guy to

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.760
take a knee and i was like jesus they

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.200
are christ well now they are i think

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.840
there was one guy was the first

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.200
he probably beat someone down by like a

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.960
millisecond it could be wrong i think it

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.280
was chris long maybe yeah i think i

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.960
don't know i mean i get it if they're

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.360
doing [ __ ] like that like in st louis

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.200
last year two seasons ago well two

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.760
seasons ago uh-huh during ferguson yeah

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.120
that makes sense if you're gonna do

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.440
something but like

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.520
oh but neil you guys trump they're all

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.880
kneeling against trump which is like

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.480
they're stopping nuclear war dude

00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:48.320
i have no idea what the [ __ ] just

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.559
becoming memes yeah i think it it's

00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:51.919
fashionable i'm telling you man it's a

00:22:51.919 --> 00:22:53.520
fashionable

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.120
that's one of the things that i know is

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.880
bothering me about it yeah like i can't

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.240
tell if it's genuine number one yeah and

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.240
like the whole

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.840
and again i just want to make sure

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.360
everyone listens knows that i'm

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.280
definitely for people kneeling if you

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.280
want to kneel [ __ ] kneel

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.880
but

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.240
there's something like there's something

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.120
about it that's like

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.640
no i know what you mean without coming

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.960
off as racist it just

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.039
seems [ __ ] weird

00:23:21.039 --> 00:23:23.520
yeah it's just a weird time man i mean i

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.320
wish i wish it wasn't happening

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.120
maybe

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.880
i mean again yeah it's tough you know

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.200
it's tough to talk like to really figure

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.679
it out but it's like when they were like

00:23:33.679 --> 00:23:35.840
spraying people with fire hoses and [ __ ]

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.600
and like like in the 60s when like they

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.960
were in her 50s when they're integrating

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.400
schools

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.640
that and i wonder if it's just like

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.480
like that would see that's looking back

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.760
on that i'm like oh that totally makes

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.039
sense people will gather but now i'm

00:23:47.039 --> 00:23:49.440
looking around kind of like

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.440
what the [ __ ] what's going on what's

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.880
going on right now what's the direct if

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.760
it's like

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.440
let us into schools let us do that it's

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.960
like okay that makes perfect [ __ ]

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.000
sense

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.600
but now it's kind of like this vague

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.799
like systematic oppression and it's like

00:24:02.799 --> 00:24:05.440
all right so what should we do

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.559
you know what i mean

00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:08.000
that's all i when i read those articles

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.240
i'm always like so what should we do the

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.400
answer is to literally

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.880
go through every single organization

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.240
and make sure they

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.039
uh

00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:18.400
like

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.440
show

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.520
the population demographic wise so if

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.960
you had a couple like helium would have

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.480
to have like the the spreadsheet would

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.600
have to have nine girls four latinos six

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.919
gay guys like ten white guy and like

00:24:29.919 --> 00:24:32.240
that's what they that's the end goal and

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.480
then the knee will rise off the astro

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.360
turf and we can watch football again

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.360
i don't know yeah it's uh i think it's

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.279
more social media based

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:43.120
i think it's all for likes dude likes

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.159
and then there's

00:24:44.159 --> 00:24:46.159
now there's news that just go for clicks

00:24:46.159 --> 00:24:47.760
there's no absolutely no substance to it

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.080
whatsoever it's just like this nazi

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.760
kicked off the thing and it's like click

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.039
click click click and they're like yeah

00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:54.320
none of this is true

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.679
yeah the uh

00:24:55.679 --> 00:24:58.080
another thing this is a kind of a theory

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.360
but we keep

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.360
they keep making these

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.279
civil rights movies

00:25:03.279 --> 00:25:05.840
and like human rights movies where like

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.520
and like you see a movie and you want to

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.200
be the good guy yeah you know what i

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.720
mean like

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.919
you watch a movie you're like that's how

00:25:11.919 --> 00:25:13.679
i should act now you should be like the

00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:15.760
cool guy in this movie

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.679
and uh you make enough [ __ ] remember

00:25:17.679 --> 00:25:19.360
the titans in those movies every black

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.480
person's like

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.200
i need to be denzel

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.279
i need to fight for my [ __ ] people

00:25:25.279 --> 00:25:26.960
right now yeah that's true it's like

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.120
dude this isn't the [ __ ] 50s and 60s

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.240
yeah

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.080
yeah i don't know i don't know

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.520
no it's true it's making me sound like a

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.799
[ __ ] idiot but it's not making it

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:36.000
sound like an idiot and there's all

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.520
obviously the caveat that we're not

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.360
black and you know we don't understand

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.240
it yeah we can't understand but but i'll

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.760
say if i were

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.360
black and someone gave me a time machine

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.279
i would say no thank you

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:49.840
shut the door and be like i'm good yeah

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.520
i will not be stepping into that thing

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.159
or i might go into the future dude

00:25:54.159 --> 00:25:57.720
just become morpheus

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.480
but that is that is [ __ ] bizarre i

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.720
just want to start taking the knee dude

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.799
i might knee on stage kneel on stage i

00:26:04.799 --> 00:26:06.480
might kneel end your set by kneeling and

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.880
throwing up a fist i might

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.240
that's the worst part about it is when

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.240
you literally see like uh

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.120
you know that happened there's a singer

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.799
in detroit he sang the national anthem

00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:18.159
and then at the end took a knee and held

00:26:18.159 --> 00:26:20.640
up a fist

00:26:20.799 --> 00:26:23.679
it's just so funny

00:26:23.679 --> 00:26:25.520
i really think it i'm telling you man i

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.159
think it's more it's like

00:26:28.159 --> 00:26:30.960
they've almost turned and again this is

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.559
i'll you know this is my personal

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:34.960
opinion they're turning like

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.720
black power into a gap commercial that's

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.480
what it almost feels like to me for sure

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.679
you know what i mean that's what i get

00:26:39.679 --> 00:26:41.279
from it where i'm like like dude you see

00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:42.640
all the this is dude this has been

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.000
killing me did you see the uh

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.919
all the billboards for that new show

00:26:47.919 --> 00:26:50.799
about like the mayor yes the black guy

00:26:50.799 --> 00:26:53.440
oh i've watched that i've watched that

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.600
who who are you talking to dude the

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.559
second the second i saw that i was so

00:26:58.559 --> 00:27:00.559
angry dude did you see this

00:27:00.559 --> 00:27:02.799
did you see the tagline for that no like

00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:04.559
it says check yourself before you elect

00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:06.960
yourself

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.400
it's literally i'm telling you man what

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.159
they're doing right now and this is my

00:27:10.159 --> 00:27:12.080
prediction i've come up with today

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.840
they're mainstreaming blackness to the

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.760
point where it's going to become

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.919
just kind of passe or it's just like it

00:27:17.919 --> 00:27:19.120
does it's not going to carry the same

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.640
coolness oh it's definitely not it's

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.320
already losing its coolness dude it is

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.760
it's crazy it's losing its coolness to

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.919
the point where i don't want to be black

00:27:25.919 --> 00:27:27.279
exactly because you would ask me three

00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:28.720
years ago i've been like [ __ ] i wish i

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.880
was black

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.840
i love chance the rapper come on

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.360

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.360
listen to country now look i gotta get

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.520
to get to my white roots dude i think

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.200
we're entering like a uh

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.559
it's gonna be like a fairy tale if they

00:27:42.559 --> 00:27:44.880
like push blackness too mainstream it's

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.240
gonna be like a cinderella effect on

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.679
wiggers where they just like shed their

00:27:47.679 --> 00:27:48.640

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:13.039
[Music]

00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:14.480
it's not black people's fault that this

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.799
is happening this is white people

00:28:16.799 --> 00:28:18.480
hijacking i know

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.200
black culture and just being like yeah

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.279

00:28:23.279 --> 00:28:25.039
stop at pressing this and it's like dude

00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:26.880
i've i was in a car

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.320
[ __ ] britney and she saw it and she

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.919

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.360

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.880
dude

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.039
black people don't like it dude it's not

00:28:37.039 --> 00:28:38.640
or it's like a black nerd writing that

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.399
you know what's the same it's the same

00:28:40.399 --> 00:28:42.559
thing as what i said about hood of jason

00:28:42.559 --> 00:28:44.880
this is written by white girls for white

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.799
girls yeah that's what that is i think

00:28:46.799 --> 00:28:48.640
they'll have like

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.399
some black nerd overseeing it out of

00:28:50.399 --> 00:28:52.640
there like yeah like well he's obviously

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.320
oh by the way somebody contacted me

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.679
after

00:28:55.679 --> 00:28:57.120
when i said that about her jason and

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.159
they were like yeah you're right that

00:28:58.159 --> 00:28:59.360
was a white

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.360
white girl really yeah that was yeah i

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.640
know a girl that's on that she's a white

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.559
girl wow she writes for yeah i was like

00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:06.880
yeah i figured the it was hacky race

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:07.760
jokes

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.000
it was clearly out of touch race jokes

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.120
yeah

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.360
and uh the mayor if you the listener if

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.760
you don't know what that is is uh

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.679
it's like a black kid i guess he's a

00:29:17.679 --> 00:29:18.880
rapper

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.960
yeah and he runs

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.679
for mayor and he wins

00:29:23.679 --> 00:29:25.600
and of course like

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.520
so of course he's like a

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.000
very well-spoken nice rapper

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.880
as they all are yeah obviously

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.559
let's make that mainstream rappers are

00:29:34.559 --> 00:29:36.320
clearly nice guys that this is just

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.600
poetry

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.880
the messages in their songs

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.760
the billboards are so funny dude

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.960
i'm telling you man i'd be pissed if i

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.320
was black right now

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.480
if i was just like had this like almost

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.399
like witch-like coolness and i saw

00:30:06.399 --> 00:30:07.840
people kind of stealing it out from

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.360
under my [ __ ] fingertips i'd be like

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.559
what the [ __ ] yeah but i think that's

00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:12.080
what annoys me about like the kneeling

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.840
and all that stuff is because it's like

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.120
they're still siding with

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.559
the side that's

00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:20.159
ruining their [ __ ]

00:30:20.159 --> 00:30:21.520
what do you mean like

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.159
there's they're on the same team as like

00:30:24.159 --> 00:30:26.000
the liberals that are making [ __ ] like

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
the mayor true you know i mean like it's

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:28.720
like

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.880
realize that you're being exploited by

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.960
the other side yeah that's true you're

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.960
not being exploited by the dumb trump

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.200
nazi rednecks yeah

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.200
you're it's getting done by

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.039
the other guys yeah you think are on

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:42.480
your [ __ ] team

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.880
that makes sense nice call a nice decree

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.200
against white liberalism yeah [ __ ] that

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.120
[ __ ] yeah i know it is lame it is

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.960
[ __ ] lame dude that is i mean that's

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.480
what this podcast really has been trying

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.080
to fight and it's [ __ ] since it's

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.440
infancy yeah they're probably people

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.880
probably getting [ __ ] tired of it but

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.720
whatever dude dude that that i'm telling

00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.760
you sure this is the only time they get

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.520
to [ __ ] hear it because outside of

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.840
[ __ ] garbage like infowars and fox

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.240
news no one's unreasonably stating this

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.440
nobody's talking about this in the

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.880
office dude like you see the [ __ ]

00:32:28.399 --> 00:32:30.240
dude what is that should check it out oh

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.000
with the ken burns vietnam documentary

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.200
it's good i like the other ones better

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.640
you did a civil war one too dude civil

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.960
war that was lit civil war was lit but

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.919
all these are just perfect to sleep too

00:32:39.919 --> 00:32:41.840
this is like reading a [ __ ] book that

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.159
makes sense yeah the newer one is at

00:32:44.159 --> 00:32:46.000
least updated the old the civil war one

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.919
is so hard to watch

00:32:47.919 --> 00:32:50.640
this old southern historian who like

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.760
it's the he's he's the quintessential

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:56.240
civil war historian dude he's so funny

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.399
what's he doing he's like well

00:32:58.399 --> 00:32:59.600
general lee

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.159
and what he did he was an honorable man

00:33:02.159 --> 00:33:03.919
he came down

00:33:03.919 --> 00:33:06.640
now ulysses s grant he knew

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.240
he had hard work

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.120
it's just it's exactly like he was there

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.880
basically it's crazy but uh the ken

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.399
burns one

00:33:14.399 --> 00:33:16.320
i don't know it's uh it's pretty cool

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.000
but

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.679
i don't know vietnam

00:33:19.679 --> 00:33:21.600
was gay yeah

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.600
the whole thing was [ __ ] what they

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.000
did yeah it was and it's funny that

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
everyone's like we lost that

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
and i guess kind of

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
but you look at the casualties dude we

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.240
[ __ ] rocked them we didn't like a

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.559
million to 50 000. well i think that's

00:33:36.559 --> 00:33:38.240
the uh whoever their leader was at the

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.679
time was like all we have to do is just

00:33:39.679 --> 00:33:40.960
keep living here

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.080
yeah he's like all we gotta do is just

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.600
not all die and we will they made some

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.880
good points that like

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.360
ho chi minh had been preparing for this

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.960
and like using communism and all this

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.880
stuff for like 20 years before we got

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.360
there damn so he was ready for

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.600
they were ready that's sick we i mean we

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.760
had obviously technology and everything

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.399
we [ __ ] him up like again a million to

00:34:00.399 --> 00:34:03.120
like 50 000 really i mean it was not

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.720
even close jesus christ but they won

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.720
they were there yeah [ __ ] that's pretty

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.799
awesome

00:34:09.919 --> 00:34:11.520
dude

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.359
that'd be that was dude that must fight

00:34:13.359 --> 00:34:15.040
be [ __ ] nuts to be because you were

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.800
like they were like 18 19 over there

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.320
like yo just kill all those [ __ ]

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.320
dudes oh i heard an interesting stat i

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.639
had to look this up because this was uh

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:24.399
because of course now that it's modern

00:34:24.399 --> 00:34:26.079
it focuses a lot on

00:34:26.079 --> 00:34:28.399
civil rights mm-hmm

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:29.919
yeah of course they have to i mean not

00:34:29.919 --> 00:34:32.320
that that wasn't a huge part of vietnam

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.679
it was obviously during like the black

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:36.079
power movement all that but uh

00:34:36.079 --> 00:34:37.679
they were talking about how

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:40.320
black casualties were disproportionate

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.639
yeah like black people were upset that

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:44.240
they were getting killed they were

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:46.159
claiming that they were cannon fodder so

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:47.440
i had to google that turns out that

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.399
wasn't true

00:34:48.399 --> 00:34:50.399
really yeah they were i think they

00:34:50.399 --> 00:34:52.480
represented 12.5 percent of the

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.720
casualties in vietnam

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:55.679
which is

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:57.920
yeah proportionate to the population

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.760
interesting yeah the interesting facts

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.680
next time you hear someone tell you that

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.040
there was i heard someone say i know

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.320
some guy who was over there he was a

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.960
black dude he said that he uh

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.359
they used to make the the viet cong i

00:35:09.359 --> 00:35:11.280
guess they were called they used to let

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.800
the black guys go first because they

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.000
would send them into scouts and they

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.920
would let them go and then wipe out

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.760
their platoons behind them so this guy

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.800
literally said that happened to him but

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.320
he was a scout so he had it i mean if it

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.240
happened yeah i mean i believe him but

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.520
yeah i don't yeah i don't know that they

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.960
were really yeah i don't think they did

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.040
say early in the war

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.400
they're sending the phones they're

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.000
sending the soul they sent in so early

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.599
on they were letting soul playing land

00:35:31.599 --> 00:35:32.720
first

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.240
check it out

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.680
earlier it made sense they sent him as a

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.119
scout and he's like he's this guy

00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:39.200
literally told me he's like i walked up

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.640
nothing happened and then like i was 50

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.400
feet ahead and my whole platoon got like

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.240
wiped out maybe enough players took a

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.040
knee

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.560
that the u.s government was like all

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.760
right we're disproportionately sure

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:48.800
there wasn't enough people [ __ ]

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:51.040
kneeling during the [ __ ] nationalism

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.480
especially like those basketball short

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.760
shorts you see like nothing but nut

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.119
sacks hanging out back then you're like

00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:58.320
damn dude take some knees

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.240
some dong tips sticking out of the

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.320
shorts that's [ __ ] wild

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.160
yeah that was uh that's that's what that

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.520
is interesting

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.480
you've been checking you've been

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.280
checking war stats dude

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.800
you gotta [ __ ] figure out because

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.560
when you hear these true racial stats

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.320
and things it's nice to look it up and

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.920
figure out what the [ __ ] going on yeah

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:16.960
of course especially if they're just

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.160
being like oh there it was definitely

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.400
disproportionate it's like okay well

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.560
let's just find out plus if i'm [ __ ]

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.640
if i'm a black dude over in vietnam and

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.800
like two of my black friends die in my

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.640
head i'm instantly being like oh they're

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.920
[ __ ] sending us here you know what i

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.440
mean like this must be so crazy that

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.560
like you didn't sleep

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.640
clearly sending us here first yeah

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.160
now if they actually plus two i think

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.599
early on they were

00:36:37.599 --> 00:36:39.280
maybe that's what it said when i looked

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.560
it up they were firing that was like

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.880
early the first half of the war it was

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.960
disproportionate really they got it

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.640
someone took a knee dude someone kneeled

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.520
and they were like all right this is

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.480
wrong

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.320
[ __ ] uh i can't think of an old

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.000
football player i've seen a name on i

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.680
almost said bill walton oh my god jim

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.440
brown dude jim brown would be fired up

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.839
yeah he was a he was a heavy who's the

00:36:57.839 --> 00:37:00.000
civil rights would do with the buzz cut

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.359
howie mandel or something what's his

00:37:01.359 --> 00:37:02.800
name howie long and how he learned how

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.400
he long probably hit a [ __ ] knee dude

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.839
well that was his son chris long that

00:37:05.839 --> 00:37:08.240
would have been the first guy white guy

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:10.240
nice and pretty certain he just secured

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.599
his [ __ ] seat on the announcer's

00:37:11.599 --> 00:37:13.839
table in 15 years old baby back when i

00:37:13.839 --> 00:37:16.960
was taking knees and then

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.599
i knew i had to do the right thing

00:37:19.599 --> 00:37:21.040
to take a knee

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.560
i knew everyone was going to hate me for

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.160
it yeah right yeah everyone's going to

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.760

where you get your last names that makes

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.440
sense his ancestors in him true

like he's a handsome man

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.240
definitely say that take it easy ew dude

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.839

no hands back there cubes no hands

00:38:17.359 --> 00:38:18.960
there was no respect for women's sex

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.400
guys came in two minutes because they

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:23.280
didn't have porn they're like

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.839
it was just every time you sucked a dog

00:38:25.839 --> 00:38:27.280
it was like two weeks worth of comment

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.000
like 10 seconds

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.720
you gotta watch the deuce dude

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.400
all right that's what it's all i i don't

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.960
like when they do two of the same person

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.240
yeah that's kind of annoying usually

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.440
pisses me off because that's all i think

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.040
about when they're both on screen yeah

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.400
that's tough they pulled obviously they

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.320
pulled off well but that is tough

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.440
the whole time i was like dude he's

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.119
getting his 90 professor on oh that's

00:38:47.119 --> 00:38:48.640
all i think and the facial expressions

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.720
when the other one's talking it's weird

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.640
like seeing an actor replying to himself

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.359
philosopher's stomach

00:43:05.359 --> 00:43:06.640
yeah they have

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.240
they have the thought that no one else

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.480
has had yet exactly

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.520

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.680
voice my opinions about touchy issues

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.920

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.560
i don't hear or excuse me i don't talk

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:26.480

the first paragraph

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.240
so does everyone stand in their living

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.160
rooms when the national anthem is played

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.000
does everyone take their hats off during

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.040
the songs

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:39.839

the [ __ ] does that have to do shut the

00:44:05.359 --> 00:44:08.079
[ __ ] up though it is funny to see how

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.000
the opposite of a nazi website like it's

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.839
on the other end of the spectrum of just

00:46:59.839 --> 00:47:00.640

wonderland that these people live in

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.920

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.720
transgender expansive south asian and

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:16.560

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.599
itself is absolutely hilarious and

00:48:31.599 --> 00:48:32.800
there's one

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.480
part of it where it's like

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:37.680
it's literally it's nazi propaganda or

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:39.760
very so

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:42.000
the one thing is uh

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.480
okay so

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.640
here right here

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:48.559
it's the number six is when we find

00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:50.800
comfort and whiteness

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.800
which you better not you better [ __ ]

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.839
not dude but they go on to say quote

00:48:55.839 --> 00:48:57.599
when we grow up with white people we

00:48:57.599 --> 00:48:59.520
love to we learn to love and care for

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.599
them we see them we see white people as

00:49:01.599 --> 00:49:03.920
fully emotional and complex human beings

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.599
this isn't wrong in fact it's great to

00:49:05.599 --> 00:49:07.280
be empathetic and understanding yeah

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.640
this isn't wrong they actually are

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:11.599
humans dude well to be fair we've called

00:49:11.599 --> 00:49:13.520
it asians like robots and asians are

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:15.440
robots

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:17.760
if you read that article in an asian

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.280
voice it's actually hilarious it's like

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:22.640
it turns out i'm a very trans

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.960
gender neutral

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.330
i don't like assists

00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:28.800
[Music]

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:31.359
the funny part is is like

00:49:31.359 --> 00:49:32.960
we're obviously joking and they're

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.160
serious though this is a very real

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:35.359
article that's all this is a very

00:49:35.359 --> 00:49:36.800
serious article like white people are

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.800
human it's like what is wrong or

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.720
actually violent is when due to our

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:42.319
ignorance we place the emotions of white

00:49:42.319 --> 00:49:44.319
people over the structural environment

00:49:44.319 --> 00:49:45.359
virus

00:49:45.359 --> 00:49:46.800
the structural violence that they

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.720
perpetuate through unexamined privilege

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.880
structural violence that white people

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.559
perpetuate professionalism unexamined

00:49:52.559 --> 00:49:54.319
privileges unexpectedly you've been

00:49:54.319 --> 00:49:55.680
checking people's privileges i check

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:57.119
everyone's privileges

00:49:57.119 --> 00:49:59.520
but also keep in mind that uh asians

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.359
have never committed atrocities

00:50:01.359 --> 00:50:04.880
definitely not a very important term

00:50:05.359 --> 00:50:07.599
i can't i can't stop that [ __ ] rape

00:50:07.599 --> 00:50:10.079
of nan king never happened right you

00:50:10.079 --> 00:50:12.000

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.400
that jesus christ but that's i've read

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.079
that line i was like humanized like

00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:18.319
they're complex emotional like human

00:50:18.319 --> 00:50:20.720
beings it's like yo bro yeah the most

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:22.400
complex lady

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:25.040
we're number one

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:27.760
number one in all of america

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.920
but yeah that had me [ __ ] laughing

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.599
yeah that's uh also

00:50:31.599 --> 00:50:33.119
in that doesn't she describe herself as

00:50:33.119 --> 00:50:35.920
a non-black south asian yeah she's not

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:38.079
black asian throughout that article it's

00:50:38.079 --> 00:50:39.440
i think that's a new term dude you have

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.359
to be non-black non-black asians we're

00:50:41.359 --> 00:50:42.880
non-black white guys yeah definitely

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:44.640
dude i would i would go so far as to say

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:47.119
anti-people

00:50:47.359 --> 00:50:49.200
we could have a non-black uh

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.920
non-black italian

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.000
you know what i mean

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.160
