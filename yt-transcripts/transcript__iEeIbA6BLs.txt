retreating that was like his number one

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.080

though show up be like nah yeah run away

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.479
like nice 1789 that's when he started

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.880
well most of the guys it was so hard

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.880
like a lot of the army didn't want to be

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.040
there and didn't have to be there it's

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.919
crazy like 1776 the year that washington

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.800
did all all that insane it's crazy

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.199
that people kept they kept expecting the

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.520
army to flee yeah

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.000
but they hung in there with with little

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.759
it's not like they were like we're

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.560
making america that's coming later yeah

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.280
they had no idea

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.440
so he's he's as good as they were

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.120
basically and it's not you know you

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.720
picture him on this horse like talking

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.240
but no most of them didn't even look at

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.240
the guy they didn't see him

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.440
you know like in the movies when they

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.440
show a guy making a speech

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.840
to a whole army and there's three guys

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.120
can hear it's impossible and the rest

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.199
are like what is what's even happening

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:28.800
and they're all yeah it's like

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.280
round braveheart we're all just getting

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.400
the only people that can hear him are

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.520
like shut up yes yeah the english are

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.759
too many

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.120
[Laughter]

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.800
yeah we will live

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.000
that's a good point i never thought

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.240
about that yeah no one heard that no one

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.759
heard any of their speeches so it was

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:49.360
really these guys all got together i

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.880
don't know they got together they

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.520
decided to just keep doing it

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.720
i don't want to spend too much time on

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.800
washington yeah washington

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.880
i never really i mean the great thing he

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.080
did

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.160
was leaving when it was time to go it

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.840
was like the thing because he a lot of

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.560
them wanted him to be king yeah a lot of

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.960
them wanted him to be permanent

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.880
he's the one who said the thing where

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.600
they wanted him to be adams yeah wanted

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.560
him to be

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.000
your majesty

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.080
or your excellency they went by his

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.759
excellency and he said

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:22.720
mr president no no jefferson

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.800
was the first mr president

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.720
yeah but washington wanted mr president

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.720
washington went with his excellency

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.960
because adam's had this long one

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.280
his majesty all this what

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.960
washington kept his excellence according

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.160
to the hbo series about john adams

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.800
yeah but i looked into it

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.120
washington said i want mr president

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.960
maybe he did but he went by his

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.039
excellency he therefore the reason he

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:48.800
did it was because he didn't want to

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.120
shake people's hands and back then that

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.039
kind of because he was like howie mandel

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:54.319
yeah he was like he'd rather just have

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:55.599
people

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:56.960
i don't think he was a germaphobe as

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.960
much as he just was like this does

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.880
command some respect because this is the

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.319
first time in his life he started to get

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:04.240
criticism really because when he was a

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.479
general everybody globally

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:07.840
outside of england was like this guy's

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.520
the by the way president like to

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.280
talk about that word for a second what a

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.520
president is like just for just an

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.400
overall president thought here the why i

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.039
love about presidents

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.440
is there is that it's a human being it's

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.720
a person

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.280
and to me like it's like uh

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.120
you know like some college professors

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.440
teach the bible as literature you know

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.120
what i mean yeah like they don't teach

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.039
the bible as a religious

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:35.039
subject they teach it as like

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:37.039
what it what what it's done for history

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:38.639
and what the stories are about and you

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:40.639
know that kind of thing i look at u.s

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:41.759
presidents that way i don't have a

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:43.440
political view about any of them i just

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.840
think they're fascinating

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.759
and president the word by itself like

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:50.080
your pr president is nothing it's not

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.720
you're not a leader

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.000
you're not a

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.560
uh ruler you don't rule

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.560
you preside

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.000
i mean that's literally what it means is

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.479
that there's a whole group of people

00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:03.840
uh that are

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.440
running the government by the people's

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.759
will and you preside you just happen to

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:09.360
be there it's like in the senate

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.639
whenever they show people in the senate

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:12.319
speaking they always say mr president

00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:13.680
over and over again

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.199
and they're speaking to whoever is

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:16.960
presiding it's never the vice president

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.960
is literally the president of the senate

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.120
but it's whoever takes the chair that

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:21.919
day

00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:23.440
who's presiding it's a it's an

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.400
incidental title given to an equal

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.879
who is chosen for them for that minute

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:33.039
to preside that's what i like about

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.399
that's why i like that's what i like

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:36.399
about how they framed it yeah

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:37.919
when did they set term limits i didn't

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.000
even look into that because he just left

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.680
right he was the first one to go i could

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.159
stay but i'm uh let's get going let's

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.519
get this started

00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:48.080
there's some famous moment where he was

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.320
speaking to the congress and they were

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.000
trying to get him to

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.160
king himself

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.399
and he was apparently really vain about

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:58.399
that he wore glasses so no one ever saw

00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:00.160
him with glasses on

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.680
and so the moment that's supposed to be

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.760
this shocking moment was that he took

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.519
out his glasses and put them on and he

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:06.560
said like

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.680
i fear i didn't see you

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.120
for what you are that was supposed to be

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.440
this big moment

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.200
i like to think but if he did like he

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.600
was really hoping if he missed

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.320
he's like i fear i didn't see and

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.640
they're all like yeah you wear glasses

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.880
we all

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.720
you know what i'm saying though yeah

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.399
like he keyed the whole thing on this

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:30.240
moment

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.160
see what i'm saying and they're like

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.279
george

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:34.640
yeah it's also a good moment for him to

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.480
be like yeah you're right you should not

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.160
how do you turn down king's status funny

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.920
jokes what how do you turn that like

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.120
that's what makes you a king and you're

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.959
like that's what makes him the man dude

00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:44.320
that's wild dude that's what makes him

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.839
well also he wasn't again none of these

00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:47.200
people knew the future he didn't know

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.399
that he was giving away the keys to

00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:53.519
later nuclear war america true yeah he

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:54.880
thought we were

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.920
a dumb like what yeah these were

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.560

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.640
a separate nation

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.480

he was you know had a decent farm but

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.600
not much but he made his brain work

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.680
and he excelled and and and passed that

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.720
on to his son

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.880
talking about he ruled in the

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.360
revolution yeah adams was the man adams

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.800

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.480
guys um uh

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.959

great all these guys are great i'm not

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.399
judging any of them but he wasn't he was

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:25.680
of limited use because he was intrigued

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.000
by america but he didn't give a

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.240
yeah he never would have shed a

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.480
any blood sweat or tears for the country

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.480
he just was interested and he had a huge

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.519
brain so he'd lend it when he felt like

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:38.959
he was also full of you know like

00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:41.440
he was supposed to he was supposedly

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.600
uh invented electricity but some other

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.440
guy he saw a guy in his own

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.760
autobiography what he saw he i just

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.800
watched

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.720
on him i'm pumped on him right now okay

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.839
so he saw a guy do the kite what and he

00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:57.600
was like that's cool and he paid the guy

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.120
for like the license to the to the gag

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.120
and he then he got one of his sons to do

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.200
to go around doing it for money it was

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.959
just a thing that he

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:08.720
he picked up other people's ideas which

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.800
is its own well you know things he also

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.399
all of his inventions he would never

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:13.279
patent

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:14.720
he was pretty sick he was like all my

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.639
inventions are for everybody yeah he was

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:18.000
what did he what do you call it uh uh

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.760
open source open source he did get a

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.040
little jealous because all of a sudden

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.880
because he was the man yeah he was the

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.959
american that everybody loved before

00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:26.160
then he and then

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.639
washington became the man the general

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:30.639
like the french were like the gen

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:33.120
general washington's the guy so he got a

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:33.920
little

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.839
he was a fame hungry did you ever read

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:38.959
his autobiography no it's

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:41.680
amazing because he has no judgment of

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.120
himself

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.880
so he's the only a lot of people that

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.399
write autobiographies it's kind of

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:47.680
careful

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.360
but like he tells the story about he was

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.120
living in london and there was a guy who

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.279
worked for him kind of like a half

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:55.279
tradesman kind of guy

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:57.920
who he befriended and the guy had a

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.800
woman

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.040
he wanted to marry a maiden but he

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.560
didn't have a position

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.959
and he didn't have his own home yet

00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:06.720
so and his mother didn't want i don't

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.880
remember all this logistics but it was

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.000
that

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.920
that he asked benjamin if he could move

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.519
his wife into his

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:14.480
house

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.160
so that they could marry and he said

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.040
sure

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.600
and he said and she moved into my home

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.360
and then i um i i took it of my pleasure

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.079
to

00:13:24.079 --> 00:13:25.600
you know

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.600
to partake of her

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.880
sexually

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.800
and she um

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.839
you know spurned my advances so i threw

00:13:33.839 --> 00:13:34.880
her out

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:35.680
and

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.600
that was the end of their marriage

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.199
i never saw him again he was real upset

00:13:39.199 --> 00:13:40.800
and i never saw him again

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.720
but i know i but both their lives were

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.160
destroyed

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.240
uh and then in may i

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.720
with jefferson jefferson was like a

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.880
depressive freak

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.880
and so he would just like leave

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.120
washington he would just go like ah my

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.800
wife is dead whatever

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.120
he would get on his horse and just leave

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.959
because also he was a man of great

00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:43.680
wealth and he had his his life

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.000
in monticello and in virginia was we'll

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.440
get to him but

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.680
the point is that adams was just a

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.880
doggedly hard-working he was oh he was

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.360
the only one who worked constantly yeah

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.040
and it was really the three of them in

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.160
madison but he was the guy who did the

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.399
hardest work to get this started

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:03.279
yeah

00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:05.279
he also apologized for cursing

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:07.040
adam's in one of his things he's like i

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.120
meant to admit that i sometimes cursed

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.120
which i feel shameful about

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.360
also when adams did his uh did the

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.680
constitution of massachusetts

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.600
math the constitution of the

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.240
commonwealth of massachusetts

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.920
is like the most liberal document in the

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.920
world because adams was like he's like

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.040
i'm going to get it right everything

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.120
that i couldn't get done

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.279
in the american constitution i'm doing

00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:32.079
in this and there's stuff in there about

00:15:32.079 --> 00:15:33.839
jews having rights there's even

00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:35.360
something about gay people in there like

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.079
he was into like gay rights jews that's

00:15:38.079 --> 00:15:40.079
pretty gay back then pretty gay pretty

00:15:40.079 --> 00:15:42.720
good it's gay to be a gay jew it's gay

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.279
to be into jews

00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:47.519
being a jewish rights in the 1700s was

00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:50.000
gay those parliaments undeniably gay

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.600
crazy back then i don't know what about

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.040
jews people like get the out of

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.920
here shoes back then have a room full of

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.440
dude and powder wigs being like boo yeah

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.519
and the jews looked exactly that they

00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:03.360
look the same as they do now

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.519
the big black coats exact same outfit

00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:08.399
same outfit same way

00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:11.199
what adams did while he was in office

00:16:11.199 --> 00:16:12.720
he was worried that

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.120
his his logic was another country could

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.440
just come take this at any moment so he

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.000
came up with the alien and sedition act

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.959
which meant

00:16:20.959 --> 00:16:23.040
if you talk on the government we

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.560
can jail you

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.120
so he started arresting journalists

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.120
he started well because he got he was

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.880
the first liberal

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.600
who got befuddled by

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.680
guys back then it was another democrat

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.800
it was uh

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.199
jefferson yeah put going like whatever

00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:40.399
it takes to win

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:42.320
yeah it's always been like the different

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.160
parts of american

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.240
democracy the different kinds of people

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.920
the people who are like we got to get

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.560
this right we got to sell our good ideas

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.399
and convince people we're right but then

00:16:52.399 --> 00:16:54.320
the other guys who are like we just got

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.240
to take office we just need to win and

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.560
nerds lose that fight adams was the

00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.759
first

00:16:59.759 --> 00:17:02.079
one term nerd president there's a few of

00:17:02.079 --> 00:17:04.160
them yes you're exactly right but bush

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.000
the first is another one he's a one-term

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.799
guy he was from 97 to 0-1 yep let's move

00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:10.880
to jefferson jefferson he's number three

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.839
that's 01-09 he was a two-term guy adams

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.600
was a federalist washington was

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.439
obviously independent jefferson was a

00:17:17.439 --> 00:17:19.360
democratic republican he was the first

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.120
mr president president

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.400
right when he got in the french and the

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.160
british started going to war

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.319
so everybody in america was like

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:27.280
england

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.440
also france just helped us yeah

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.039
england let's join it and he was he was

00:17:31.039 --> 00:17:32.799
he loved the french he loved the

00:17:32.799 --> 00:17:35.039
revolution in french yeah he did the the

00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:37.039
adams didn't because it was bloody and

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:38.640
horrible didn't like the french he

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.280
didn't and and uh and jefferson loved

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.960
the revolution and he loved he had all

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.480
these his friends over he spent a lot of

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.640
his life there yeah but they started

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.240
americans started being like

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.720
england let's join france in the war he

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.400
was the only one with the foresight to

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.679
be like we have

00:17:53.679 --> 00:17:55.919
40 guys in our military and three boats

00:17:55.919 --> 00:17:58.080
yeah let's shut the up

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.400
so he declared neutrality and everybody

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.799
called him a then england started

00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:05.280
blocking his like ships i think

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.480
he didn't he

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.799
he might have been the one who said

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:10.000
we're just not going to trade with

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.200
either of them

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.960
so then our economy the american economy

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.559
just plummeted

00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:16.080
england started just saying if you're

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.360
not trading with us we're just going to

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.960
confiscate your ships

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.360
steal kidnap all the sailors make them

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.840
join the british navy who's getting

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.080
punked by england you're talking about

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.600
jefferson jefferson well it's

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.600
interesting because adam's what ended

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.160
his presidency was a fake rumor that

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.600
jefferson started

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.679
that adams was trying to start a war

00:18:35.679 --> 00:18:37.360
with the and start a navy and do the

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.440
stupid name it was all fake

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.280
but then it ended up kind of haunting

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.280
jefferson because the truth about all

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.480
that ended up him a lot

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.559
i one thing interesting about jefferson

00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:51.039
is because he's so famous for having had

00:18:51.039 --> 00:18:53.360
a slave and having haven't had like 50

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.120
000 slaves yeah or whatever that not

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.520
that many um

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.000
and having had children with his slave

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.679
and i don't think he ever even gave him

00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:03.039
he didn't freedom didn't freeze he

00:19:03.039 --> 00:19:04.320
didn't free the kids he's free a couple

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.080
years he freed a couple

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.559
yeah and the rest he kept enslaved until

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:10.960
he died and what was interesting about

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.640
them damn you did the ultimate because i

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.799
said so is the dead

00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:17.200
can i stop being a slave he's like no

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.039
i said no

00:19:19.039 --> 00:19:21.280
they were like white

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.760
real his slave children the woman he had

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.160
the woman that he had kids with sally

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.160
yeah was like half white

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.080
or like was very light-skinned yeah i

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.320
think her mother because her mother was

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.320
in his family for a long time and his

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.160
dad was like yeah i mean it was

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.720
like but she was kind of a product of

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.360
his father i'm not sure about it

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.760
i'm not sure about that but it's

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.520
but an interesting thing about him in

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.080
terms of slavery and american politics

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.080
is that his first

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.200
um elected position was in the uh

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.919
virginia legislature he was like a

00:19:55.919 --> 00:19:58.240
a house a reps

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.240
guy in virginia

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.200
and the very first act he ever the first

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.320
thing he ever did as a as a politician

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.120
was to propose a bill in the virginia

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.480
uh government

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.320
uh to abolish slavery in the state of

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.559
virginia it's the first thing he did was

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:16.720
of course he got shot down but it was

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.840
his

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.919
it was his desire and his dream yeah

00:20:19.919 --> 00:20:21.039
because he was big on that with the

00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:23.679
french revolution yes

00:20:23.679 --> 00:20:26.559
yeah yes and all of these guys

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.799
all of these early guys

00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:32.400
wanted slavery out but there was no way

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.880
the south was going to do it yeah and

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.720
they wanted the southern

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.799
um because so the choice was to have

00:20:38.799 --> 00:20:40.480
like just two countries or four

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.840
countries over here

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.159
or have a unified country and just deal

00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:45.840
with it yeah we're going to have slavery

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.480
but create a framework

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.720
yeah where in the future when it becomes

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.039
possible when things change when things

00:20:53.039 --> 00:20:55.600
get more modern we can

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.120
that we can get rid of it in the future

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.200
and i could be wrong but i think the

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.640
north had abolished slavery early like

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.480
1806

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.960
which is why jefferson's in office i

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.480
could be wrong i don't know it was

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.400
around the exact same time as england in

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.480
fact maybe before oh really the north we

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.159
were right us northerners we got it

00:21:14.159 --> 00:21:16.240
right a fun jefferson story that i like

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.320
is that when he was in paris he had this

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.400
woman a girlfriend named caught

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.720
something causeway or something his wife

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.880
died when he was pretty young

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.000
and she made him promise on her deathbed

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.600
that he would never have another woman

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.440
which is a horrible thing to do

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.200
yeah a young man that you're

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.720
 yeah it's like not even somebody

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.159
to take help take care of the kids they

00:21:36.159 --> 00:21:37.840
had like no i promise

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.799
yeah i know but he's oh for sure so it

00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:42.480
was part of the reason that all of

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.320
including sally hemmings that his loves

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.679
were all

00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:47.360
secret because he was ashamed of every

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.520
woman that he loved after that and so

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.520
there was a woman in in

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.559
paris

00:21:52.559 --> 00:21:54.880
she was a british painter and her

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.600
husband she was a woman she was married

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.039
but she was a painter and she fell in

00:21:59.039 --> 00:22:00.880
love with thomas jefferson and they were

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.720
very much in love with each other but

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.880
then the way they broke up was very

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.480
funny to me because

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.440
he was

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.760
he wrote her these beautiful letters she

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.280
was in love with him he's along with her

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.360
but then um the french when he was

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.280
leaving france they wanted a great

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.039
portrait of him to put in the national

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:18.720
gallery and they said to him you can

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.120
choose any painter in the world

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.039
and he was like no i want you know a

00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:24.840
real

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.280
guy his girlfriend was like why not me

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.120
and he's like baby come on

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.720
i mean you're good you're good but

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.720
you're not like that grown man

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.679
you're not like

00:22:33.679 --> 00:22:36.159
 i'm not for history true these

00:22:36.159 --> 00:22:37.360
guys were his that's the weirdest thing

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.960
how history mine they were like knowing

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.240
they were going to get sucked into

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.400
history which is crazy to think about so

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.679
here's a good one because we got to

00:22:43.679 --> 00:22:47.520
speed up yeah yeah uh so he goes over

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.320
so

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.840
napoleon's in there

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.159
in france yeah post-revolution this is

00:22:52.159 --> 00:22:54.000
the this is the louisiana purchase they

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.559
sent james monroe over that was his bro

00:22:56.559 --> 00:22:58.400
he goes to france they thought they were

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.120
negotiating the sale of just the port of

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.720
new orleans

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.320
this is all thanks in part to the

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.240
 haitian revolution which

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.640
france look into the haitian revolution

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.760
it rules

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.039
uh

00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:13.280
he gets over there monroe finds out oh

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.480
they're trying to sell

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.120
all of the louisiana like it's from it's

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.880
from new orleans to the rockies to

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.840
canada

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.919
it's huge from the appalachians to the

00:23:21.919 --> 00:23:23.520
rockies basically

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.960
and uh

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.799
they didn't have time to consult

00:23:26.799 --> 00:23:28.960
congress so thomas jefferson just bought

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.559
it on the spot

00:23:30.559 --> 00:23:32.480
which he was like

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.720
i abused the out of my power and he

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.240
was that was his whole thing his

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.159
government should have no power yeah he

00:23:38.159 --> 00:23:40.000
was against any well that's what

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.360
jefferson's whole life was like doing

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.880
 up things and then saying nobody

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.480
should be able to like see slavery he's

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.760
like people that need to stop having

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.279
like he's a slave and he's like

00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:49.200
somebody's gonna stop this we gotta stop

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.799
this yeah somebody's gonna stop

00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:52.080
somebody's gotta stop these

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.880
things yeah well we shouldn't be me

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.360
but i need to this one right now

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.279
those arguments must have been crazy all

00:23:59.279 --> 00:24:01.520
right the uh well yeah that was big

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.960
because that secured the southern port

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.279
we had yeah and monroe was secretary of

00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:08.000
state monroe yeah and then wasn't he the

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.200
um no no

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.159
madison

00:24:10.159 --> 00:24:11.840
usually the secretary of state would end

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.440
up being

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.520
president vice president

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.360
at this point

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.720
although who was it was jefferson adams

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.559
jefferson was adams as vice president

00:24:22.559 --> 00:24:24.799
yeah so that's three straight or two

00:24:24.799 --> 00:24:26.640
straight vice presidents then we got

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.880
james madison he was a dork

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.360
yes he was a huge dork he was a nerd he

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.840
was a frail nervous thinker what he was

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.760
gerbies really he but this is sick so

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.919
basically he had the first

00:24:39.919 --> 00:24:40.880
they said

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.760
his lady was the first first lady dolly

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.760
madison that was like really like they

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.200
would have parties at the white house

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.480
they would like try to get it and also

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.159
he was jefferson's men he was another

00:24:50.159 --> 00:24:52.799
guy like adams who was there all the

00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:55.440
time yeah he was like a worker he kept

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.080
 going and he would write jefferson

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.600
and stay in

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.919
in france and go can you come

00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:03.520

just enjoying paris and i don't want to

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.799
do it

00:25:08.799 --> 00:25:10.720
and then he would float in and just take

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.559
the big job

00:25:12.559 --> 00:25:14.000
and yeah madison gets four years and

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.240
people like dude you're boring

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.480

[Laughter]

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.840
so madison takes some of the flat

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.279
because everybody was calling jefferson

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:45.760
a for not fighting england so he's

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.440
like you know what it

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.520

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.400
shitty white house yeah

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.880
so first off washington dc was a swamp

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.480
it was literally a swamp it was a

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.039
hole no one lived there

00:26:17.039 --> 00:26:18.000
uh

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.200
war of 1812 we england up

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.559
fort mchenry

00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:24.080
star spangled banner all that

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.480
battle of new orleans we smashed them in

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.000
new orleans was uh what's his name

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.159
jackson jackson yeah and jax they were

00:26:30.159 --> 00:26:31.440
fighting the battle of new orleans the

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.200
war had been already over for a while oh

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.360
really yeah the war was already yeah

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.880
treaty was 1815.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.919
yeah once you get to jackson he's

00:26:41.919 --> 00:26:44.400
 he's wild incredible so first

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.960
trump he was the first trump yep

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.679
first so also in america that's our

00:26:49.679 --> 00:26:52.320
first war as a country yeah so now

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.240
america also before that because because

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.480
england was just taking pot shots

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.960
england would just park a ship

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.279
like outside of like uh you know

00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:03.600
baltimore or whatever just start heaving

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.600
 fireballs

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.679
for no reason like you know we're hot do

00:27:07.679 --> 00:27:09.679
you know hudson new york it's a town in

00:27:09.679 --> 00:27:12.080
the hudson it has a weird

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.000
maritime feeling to it it looks like

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.480
nantucket and that's because it's all

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.080
people from nantucket used to be this

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.320
little whaling village in nantucket and

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.720
in the 1810s the british would just park

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.440
a ship and just set houses on fire for

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.039
 fun

00:27:27.039 --> 00:27:28.720
so all the people that lived in that

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.840
town

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:33.039
found a they founded hudson and they

00:27:33.039 --> 00:27:35.279
would go out and wail in the ocean and

00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:37.600
then they'd drag a whale up the hudson

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.840
river holy and they would

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.360
slaughter it and then send it down the

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.520
river was a great way to send

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.600
whale meat and oil

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.679
down to here new york city

00:27:47.679 --> 00:27:50.080
and that established a hub in new york

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.679
up and upper new york state hudson

00:27:51.679 --> 00:27:53.840
became a very big important and that's

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.360
where you ever heard a guy named lex

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.039
diamond because diamonds diamond street

00:27:57.039 --> 00:27:59.200
was like the first horror street

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.039
it sounded like hudson became a place

00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:02.559
for farmers

00:28:02.559 --> 00:28:06.080
to bring their herds and get laid and

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.799
get you know just and

00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:11.520
gamble and and have their animals

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.799
slaughtered and brought down here on

00:28:12.799 --> 00:28:14.799
boats and then they go paid

00:28:14.799 --> 00:28:17.440
damn yeah anyway so that's what was

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.960
going on that's how much things like

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.600
just the english of one english ship

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.919
lobbing fireballs changes a ton of

00:28:23.919 --> 00:28:25.600
things yeah and they finally needed it

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.679
to stop resulting in some guy getting

00:28:27.679 --> 00:28:29.440
ahead

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.720
i'm never going to be able to face me

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.080
wife

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.200
me wife so okay so yeah so now you were

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.279
kind of unified that was the first time

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:41.200
madison the madison war of 1812

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.880
it was a draw i mean they signed a

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.559
treaty after two years nothing changed

00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:46.080
though nothing the english stopped

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.320
harassing us yeah but we declared war

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.320
they came over yeah we kind of

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.679
them up though i looked at the casualty

00:28:51.679 --> 00:28:53.520
numbers it was like double that doesn't

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.679
matter no historical story of course of

00:28:55.679 --> 00:28:57.360
course but i always everybody always

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.039
acts like

00:28:59.039 --> 00:29:00.159
because they got over here and they all

00:29:00.159 --> 00:29:02.000
died of disease kind of immediately they

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.600
got up it was hard and they were

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.679
like this we can't afford to fight this

00:29:05.679 --> 00:29:08.320
while we're fighting the french truce

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.640
uh that brings us to monroe monroe is

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.399
kind of the main monroe was the last

00:29:12.399 --> 00:29:14.320
founding father to be a president

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.919
fought in the revolutionary war was at

00:29:15.919 --> 00:29:18.240
valley forge he came up with the monroe

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.480
doctrine which is neutrality we got the

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.799
americas nobody with us because

00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:24.000
they were all worried europe was going

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.440
to spain or europe was going to come

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.120
back and take well that was all the

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.640
source of all our problems was these

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.240
other european countries being

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.840
involved in their wars so he was the

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.679
first guy to go yeah we're never going

00:29:33.679 --> 00:29:35.679
to go get involved in their wars oh yeah

00:29:35.679 --> 00:29:37.600
yeah yeah and that's that's kind of what

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.640
they were saying was that's like the

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.640
most lasting

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.399
policies of any of the founding fathers

00:29:42.399 --> 00:29:44.399
was like american neutrality europe you

00:29:44.399 --> 00:29:45.600
can have your wars we're staying the

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:49.360
 out obviously it lasted 100 years

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.919
um added florida monroe got florida from

00:29:51.919 --> 00:29:54.080
the spanish nice so the reason that

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.279
happened though

00:29:55.279 --> 00:29:58.000
was because of jackson because jackson

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.720
was taking his troops to florida and

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.200
monroe was sending a guy on a horse i

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.480
don't know if they had telegrams yet but

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.440
it was taken eight days to say leave

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.399
florida alone we're trying to negotiate

00:30:10.399 --> 00:30:13.279
yeah uh um a price but finally monroe

00:30:13.279 --> 00:30:14.960
decided we don't want florida anymore

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.880
they're asking this the span spanish

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.399
owned it

00:30:18.399 --> 00:30:19.760
we can't afford to buy it i can't

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.039
justify it i'm not going to get it

00:30:21.039 --> 00:30:23.520
through congress and jackson was writing

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.840
back and saying i'm just gonna take it

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.840
i'm just gonna take it militarily i'm

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.919
gonna attack them

00:30:29.919 --> 00:30:33.120
and monroe said no

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.360
you may not i'm the president you may

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.880
not do that and jackson just ignored him

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.919
yeah so

00:30:39.919 --> 00:30:40.960
he did it

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.760
he took florida and then he showed up in

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.760
dc and was like right that was good

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.000
right and monroe's like yes thank you

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.679
very much yeah he's like but also i

00:30:49.679 --> 00:30:51.600
bought it good job yeah also i think we

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.679
paid for it we paid for it and it was a

00:30:53.679 --> 00:30:55.760
moment while jackson was while jackson

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.200
was like with them the spanish

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.320
were like

00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.840
to monroe they're like yeah you can buy

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:00.480
it

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.919
he went and killed him

00:31:01.919 --> 00:31:03.200
he was down fighting though but he was

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.399
like yeah actually you know what yeah

00:31:04.399 --> 00:31:06.240
we're gonna sell it there's two generals

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.000
that did that him and macarthur did that

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.080
too just did without permission

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.000
yeah and then showed up and said it

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.519
right mr president wasn't that the plan

00:31:13.519 --> 00:31:14.880
all along because i guess it was the

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.000
plan all along whatever you want

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.519
whatever so you got that but this is

00:31:17.519 --> 00:31:19.039
interesting because monroe is the first

00:31:19.039 --> 00:31:20.720
part that uh

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.559
this is where the slavery issue starts

00:31:22.559 --> 00:31:23.519
to take

00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:24.880
real issue because it was the missouri

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.000
compromise

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.799
so missouri was becoming a state

00:31:28.799 --> 00:31:31.440
it was another slave state pro-slavery

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.440
yeah so every just every time they added

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.600
a slave state they'd have to add a free

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.440
free one to make sure it was balanced

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.080
yeah that's when we added maine

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.080
missouri got to be a slave state that's

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.200
it for him

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.360
john quincy adams yeah so john quincy

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.600
adams was secretary of state

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.600
john quincy adams had a big

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.120
role in the

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.720
in the um

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.039
in florida yeah and he had a big role in

00:31:55.039 --> 00:31:57.279
that compromise that was a big party he

00:31:57.279 --> 00:31:59.039
was a statesman john quincy adams

00:31:59.039 --> 00:32:01.120
 fascinating guy i read his

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.360
biography the thing about him and his

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.240
father is that they wrote copious really

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.720
long diary entries so we know a lot

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.399
about those guys

00:32:10.399 --> 00:32:13.200
but um he was he traveled with his

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.360
father to england he was like the last

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.440
link to the great revolution yeah

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.120
because he was with his father wherever

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.960
he went and he took him to

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.120
uh france he ended up being a diplomat

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.919
he was the first um american uh

00:32:25.919 --> 00:32:27.679
ambassador to russia

00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:30.720
he lived in saint petersburg russia and

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.519
him and was he the one who helped them

00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:35.519
kind of revolutionize i don't know or

00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:37.600
was that before remember that okay but

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.760
he was in russia way way back then he'd

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.799
take like a sleigh to to you know

00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:44.159
countries that aren't there anymore like

00:32:44.159 --> 00:32:45.200
prussia

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.080
and uh he was he traveled all over he

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.320
traveled more than any like human being

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.640
back then and he went across the ocean

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.960
several times so like something like 12

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.559
times back and forth

00:32:56.559 --> 00:32:58.559
no he's an amazing guy he's incredible

00:32:58.559 --> 00:33:01.279
guy his opponent was jackson in this

00:33:01.279 --> 00:33:04.399
election yeah jackson dominated

00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:07.360
one he won the popular vote by a greater

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.000
margin than reagan beat carter it was a

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.679
landslide victory

00:33:11.679 --> 00:33:13.120
for him but

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.720
jackson

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.559
in the battle of new orleans came out

00:33:16.559 --> 00:33:18.159
and said all the guys from kentucky were

00:33:18.159 --> 00:33:19.840
being cowards

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.519
so then when it comes to the electoral

00:33:21.519 --> 00:33:23.519
college the guy counting the votes

00:33:23.519 --> 00:33:24.799
happened to be like a senator or

00:33:24.799 --> 00:33:26.880
something from kentucky what i was like

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.559
 this guy

00:33:28.559 --> 00:33:31.519
and he just swung like 10 states

00:33:31.519 --> 00:33:32.559
because back then back then the

00:33:32.559 --> 00:33:34.640
electoral college made perfect sense

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.880
nobody in any state had ever heard of

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.799
one of these guys there was no news

00:33:38.799 --> 00:33:40.159
there was no anything now you

00:33:40.159 --> 00:33:41.919
needed somebody yeah you needed super

00:33:41.919 --> 00:33:43.519
delegates you needed to do it just get

00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:46.480
your local guy yeah and be like

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.240
you go figure it out yes yeah but that

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.320
was enough for this guy to swing all

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.240
these dudes in the meetings to be like

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.799
dude jackson's a

00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:57.360
we need john quincy adams so he's swan i

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.200
mean it was john quincy adams was

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:02.159
another nerd one term nerd yes who just

00:34:02.159 --> 00:34:04.000
couldn't get i mean as a president he

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.080
couldn't get and he got almost nothing

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.079
done partly because jackson and his

00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:11.679
people just thwarted every single thing

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:13.119
the whole country loved jackson

00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:15.760
everybody loved that dude so

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.079
much he was trump he was trump he was

00:34:18.079 --> 00:34:21.200
imagine if trump like dueled as much as

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.359
jesus jackson died

00:34:23.359 --> 00:34:25.760
with something like 12 bullets in his

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.240
body yeah what that never left his body

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.839
he dueled all the time yeah let's just

00:34:29.839 --> 00:34:31.760
go straight to jack jackson

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.119
he's the next wait

00:34:33.119 --> 00:34:35.679
just he can't not be mentioned john

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:36.639
quinn

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:38.720
 john quinn john quincy adams well

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.480
after his presidency he was in congress

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.440
forever from massachusetts he died at

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.960
his seat

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:49.200
in congress he died in at his desk

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.879
he was make because his thing he was a

00:34:50.879 --> 00:34:52.560
huge abolitionist he was like the only

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.639
guy in the congress willing to be an out

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:56.720
and out the slave states had so much

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:59.839
power that they passed a law a gag law

00:34:59.839 --> 00:35:02.800
that said you can't say the word slavery

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.200
in congress it used to be there was a

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.640
thing in congress back then called

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:08.079
petitioning

00:35:08.079 --> 00:35:09.920
anyone could send a petition to their

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.160
congress person and they had to say they

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.320
had to mention it so like you could send

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.440
a thing to congress saying um i want all

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.960
you know i want retards to be allowed to

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.880
drive whatever you would do

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.320
i want people to have driver's

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.920
licenses yes

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.520
and he would say

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.839
he'd have to go okay the petition from

00:35:27.839 --> 00:35:29.440
shane gillis

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.480
he wants retards to drive the honorable

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.160
and everyone would go

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.839
i moved to table it and then they just

00:35:35.839 --> 00:35:37.440
tabled it

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.720
but

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.400
they passed the law saying you couldn't

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.760
even

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.680
you couldn't even mention a petition

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.839
that said the word slavery

00:35:45.839 --> 00:35:47.920
because that's how electrified that it

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.599
was like we don't want anybody we know

00:35:49.599 --> 00:35:51.200
you're trying to get rid of slavery we

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.480
don't even want you to say they passed

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.440
it so john uh quincy adams would do it

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.880
and he would just break the law and he

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.560
would just say over and over again he

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.000
would read petitions about slavery and

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.680
he would get sent then they would all

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.720
yeah the dudes on the trail of

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.480
tears they were like we got to bring our

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.040
slaves if slaves are available

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.960
folks get slaves that's just the way

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.560
that goes i couldn't believe it but when

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.079
when he was peaceful

00:40:44.079 --> 00:40:45.359
that's what the part you don't hear is

00:40:45.359 --> 00:40:46.720
like the indians are like you know what

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.079

00:40:48.079 --> 00:40:50.240
slaves yeah slaves had it real bad on

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.319
yeah tell me about it didn't they like

00:40:52.319 --> 00:40:53.520
share everything with their slaves

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.520
though

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.960
yeah they were way better

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.800
like real peaceful it was egalitarian

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.200
dude there were no good slave owners

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.920
the natives there is some story from the

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.400
some chief big chief went to the white

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.680
house

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.079
to meet with the jackson because jackson

00:41:10.079 --> 00:41:12.960
was very honest he didn't underhand ever

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.200
he didn't play politics he did horrible

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.319
things but he just went ahead and did

00:41:16.319 --> 00:41:18.800
him like there was a slave revolt during

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.640
his presidency where they took over a

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.640
fort the slaves took over fort and just

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.040
said we just want out we just want to be

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.280
taken to the north or canada or whatever

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.440
and so he just got a bunch of cannons

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:31.920
and just he just lit the whole place

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:36.400
he didn't care so some famous

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.920
like a name you'd recognize it wasn't

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.400
like sitting bull but it was some big

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:43.119
uh all of the indians the tribes all the

00:41:43.119 --> 00:41:45.359
tribes chose this guy

00:41:45.359 --> 00:41:49.359
yeah to negotiate with uh jackson and he

00:41:49.359 --> 00:41:51.040
went and talked to jackson just the two

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.400
of them

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:55.200
and he came out crying and said

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.880
we're not we're in trouble yeah he's

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.200
we're not he this is gonna go bad oh

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.520
he's gonna go back no no he was he just

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.520
had his way of thinking about how it was

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.720
going to go he's like no we got to clear

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.160
these guys out of here also in line with

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.760
trump he was like this is where the term

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.599
mud slinging starts yeah it was him and

00:42:09.599 --> 00:42:11.119
john quincy

00:42:11.119 --> 00:42:13.440
their election or their debates and

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:14.400
was

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.839
he would just talk they would talk

00:42:15.839 --> 00:42:17.359
there would be nasty rumors in the

00:42:17.359 --> 00:42:19.119
papers whatever it took yeah whatever it

00:42:19.119 --> 00:42:21.520
took no i remember i have a friend who's

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.079
a trump guy who i've known for a long

00:42:24.079 --> 00:42:25.599
time i'm not going to say that his name

00:42:25.599 --> 00:42:28.920
is nick apollo

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.680
knowing nick has always given me some

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.079
insight into the into the mentality of

00:42:34.079 --> 00:42:35.680
that kind of guy not just trump but guys

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.079
like jackson i remember once i was with

00:42:38.079 --> 00:42:40.160
nick and a lot of people and he was um

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.160
and like three

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:45.359
uh democrats were yelling at him and he

00:42:45.359 --> 00:42:47.760
was starting to say crazy up

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.040
things to them and at one point i'm like

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.359
nick you even you know that's wrong and

00:42:51.359 --> 00:42:52.480
he goes

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.720
it's three against one

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.880
like what do you want me to do

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.040
like he's in and i and it gave me that i

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.560
because and then it brought me back to

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.240
when i was like 19 and i was uh friends

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.680
with nick and we were comedians in

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.160
boston and there was a uh a pinball

machine we really liked playing at this

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.359
one club so we're playing pinball

00:43:11.359 --> 00:43:13.280

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.160
turn i was starting to beat his score

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.680
and he just put his hand over my hand

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.440
so i couldn't flip and he just looked at

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.359

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:27.260
[Laughter]

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.800
jackson was yes jackson was the first

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.400
yeah he was a football player yeah a

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.640
college football player jackson was the

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.280
first president to go like

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.359
uh you i'm i'm winning i'm winning

00:43:39.359 --> 00:43:41.440
this i don't care what happens to you

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:43.839
we're gonna we're gonna you know

00:43:43.839 --> 00:43:45.760
so he also one of the big things with

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.839
jackson he was that he vetoed more bills

00:43:47.839 --> 00:43:50.000
than every president before him combined

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.319
nice he hated the banks he he like went

00:43:52.319 --> 00:43:54.880
to war it's crazy that he's on the 20.

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.200
yeah it's like a joke because he hated

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.040
the idea of a central bank he hated the

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.560
idea of a treasury

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.319
he thought that it should just be folks

00:44:02.319 --> 00:44:04.079
have their money use gold and you trade

00:44:04.079 --> 00:44:06.960
and he wanted so i think the u.s bank at

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.079
the time i think it was called the

00:44:08.079 --> 00:44:09.680
united states like the bank of the

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.839
united states was up for

00:44:11.839 --> 00:44:13.119
re

00:44:13.119 --> 00:44:14.800
to be renewed

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.400
and he just happened to be the president

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.160
and he vetoed it yeah and it was a thing

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.160
you don't veto you can't veto it no but

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.160
he vetoed it so then the next guy we'll

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.000
get to him is his vice president van

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.400
buren he takes over he takes over a

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.880
completely destroyed economy because he

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.720
vetoed the bank that's that's the way it

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:33.440
goes yeah the cool guy

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:36.560
america is made of cowboys and nerds so

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.720
you got cowboys who show off and who

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.079

00:44:40.079 --> 00:44:42.079
have nerds who actually get things done

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:44.400
but the cowboys get the credits yeah the

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.480
nerds get he got his

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.680
nickname was van ruins

he was another total nerd and everybody

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:57.200
hated van buren he was like a little

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.119
yeah he was supposed to be i think he

00:44:59.119 --> 00:45:00.400
was one of those vice presidents that

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.920
was supposed to be a link

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.079
like because jackson was the man in the

00:45:04.079 --> 00:45:05.359
south kind of

00:45:05.359 --> 00:45:06.720

yeah he was uh

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.400
the the legend is that you know he was

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:20.160

like the mass press started to get big

00:45:25.359 --> 00:45:27.040

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.359
later what yep uh

00:46:27.359 --> 00:46:30.160
that brings us to tyler he did nothing

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.680
tyler was uh

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.680
party abandoned no hope to get a taylor

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.760
he was harrison's vice president so

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.520
harrison dies the one thing he did do is

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.280
set the precedent that the vice

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.440
president stays as president nice so

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.480
everyone was like

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.000
what we don't know what to do here the

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.680
president's never died

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.040
do you

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:49.440
take over as an interim guy until we

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.800
find a new guy

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.000
and he was like no i'm just the

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.440
president of the president and enough

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:56.079
that his party hated him for that so

00:46:56.079 --> 00:46:57.920
they were they his own party abandoned

00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:59.680
him they didn't put him up for real

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:00.720
because they thought they wanted to

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:01.760
choose another guy they wanted to be

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.760
able to put a stronger guy yeah so he

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.880
stayed he had no parties supported him

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.880
he got nothing done he was never up for

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.000
reelection again it must have been

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.760
awkward that brings us to our guy though

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:14.319
this is who i wanted to get to hulk dude

00:47:14.319 --> 00:47:16.560

know nothing about pogba no he was one

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.839
term because

00:47:19.839 --> 00:47:21.760
he was a dark horse out of nowhere and

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.480
he promised everybody in his party i'll

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.720

ready you can take over i promise to do

00:47:30.319 --> 00:47:32.160
one term

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.359
when he was running his opponent's

00:47:33.359 --> 00:47:35.839
slogan was who is james k polk like

00:47:35.839 --> 00:47:37.520
people were talking

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:38.960
as soon as he got in

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:40.640
oh this is good he was a tiny guy he was

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.720
five eight which was like that's really

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:45.119
small yeah he was five eight and when he

00:47:45.119 --> 00:47:47.040

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:56.079
[Laughter]

00:47:56.079 --> 00:47:57.520
so right away polk starts going but it

00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:58.960
was kind of a joke it's like if a

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.280
walked in yeah

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.880
it's just a little guy

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.599

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.839
oregon hunting

00:48:27.839 --> 00:48:29.680
so the british were hunting the

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.359
british and americans were both

00:48:31.359 --> 00:48:33.200
hunting on the same territory and polk

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.839
was like nah we're done with that and he

00:48:35.839 --> 00:48:37.520
said alleged the the latitude and

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.400
longitude was 54 and 40. so he came out

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.880
of the slogan 54 and 40 or fight he was

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.079
saying that to the british he was like

00:48:44.079 --> 00:48:45.920
we're going to you guys up true he

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.440
came out with that and the british

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.359
people were really into they loved

00:48:49.359 --> 00:48:51.680
attitudes and longitudes they were then

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.599
so he called that and the british were

00:48:53.599 --> 00:48:54.960
afraid to call his bluff they were just

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.800
like fine taking like that slogan is so

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.559
cool

00:48:58.559 --> 00:48:59.680
these guys

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.280
you came up with the you use the

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:02.960
longitude in latitude so he takes that

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:04.800
territory which is huge

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.720
and then it's not just organs washings

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.800
and all that you know how why oregon is

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.800
uh portland is called portland

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:31.920
and named it portland and there is a

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.359

he starts with the mexicans

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.319
like say they would send troops down

00:49:44.319 --> 00:49:46.000
just to see if the mexicans would shoot

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:46.880

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.559
finally they did

00:49:48.559 --> 00:49:49.920
immediately

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.160
finally they shot so many times

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:54.960
to get off their free plays and

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.720

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
who is the general who's the general

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.520
that penetrated all the way to mexico

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:20.319
city that that's later right uh this was

00:50:20.319 --> 00:50:23.200
the next guy who was uh

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.839
zachary taylor

00:50:24.839 --> 00:50:27.200
yeah was the big uh

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.040
mexican-american warrior yeah he was the

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.960
warrior what zachary taylor was

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.960
dominating together he went into mexico

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:35.599
city and if you go to in mexico city

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:38.240
the big thing is los ninos these six i

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:41.280
think it's four six kids so they stormed

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:42.720
they went all the way to mexico city and

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:45.599
the citadel the the uh chapultepec the

00:50:45.599 --> 00:50:47.440
palace

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:49.280
uh the army was so decimated that it was

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.200
finally just the cadets

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.760
of the military school were the only

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.839
ones defending the capital

00:50:55.839 --> 00:50:58.240
and they were fight they were just four

00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.520
kids

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.359
firing on the american army is just

00:51:01.359 --> 00:51:02.720
coming

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:04.960
and they finally they wrapped themselves

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:09.359
in mexican flags and jumped and dove and

00:51:09.359 --> 00:51:10.720
killed himself that was how they end

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.800
this war and the moment is zachary

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.240
taylor was holding one of them and he's

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.240
saying they were just kids like he had

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.160
no idea they were they were like

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:19.760
12 15 years old

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.680
and then in chapel to pack there's four

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.359
big pillars

00:51:23.359 --> 00:51:25.040
uh that are still they're like hey war

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.800
heroes that's pretty awesome yeah what

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.559
did mexico have back then like it was it

00:51:28.559 --> 00:51:30.720
like a king or like they oh well they

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.960
had max so uh

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.079
the what was going on all these years

00:51:36.079 --> 00:51:37.119
um

00:51:37.119 --> 00:51:38.720
napoleon

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.800
assumed

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.480
that the south would win the civil war

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:43.599
eventually that the south that there

00:51:43.599 --> 00:51:46.559
would be like europe always been a bet

00:51:46.559 --> 00:51:48.559
on the south

00:51:48.559 --> 00:51:50.559
because the south was was a uh

00:51:50.559 --> 00:51:52.640
aristocratic

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:55.599
america it was about plantations and old

00:51:55.599 --> 00:51:57.760
families and that's a european and they

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.000
loved europe in the south the north was

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.440
always against europe and wanting to

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.920
start something new so during the civil

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.880
war

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.200
so maximilian was just a habsburg but

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.880
the way kings worked back then there

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:11.440
were some royalty factories so the

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.680
habsburg family who i think were like

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.599
flemish or whatever the

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:18.079
they just had like somebody a cousin of

00:52:18.079 --> 00:52:20.800
a king they went maximilian and his wife

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.559
they're like you guys take mexico you're

00:52:22.559 --> 00:52:25.839
you're so so napoleon sent french troops

00:52:25.839 --> 00:52:29.599
to mexico and in installed max

00:52:29.599 --> 00:52:31.920
maximilian but then this is what cinco

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.480
de mayo is yes and then so then the

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.800
the mexicans finally

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:37.839
uh

00:52:37.839 --> 00:52:39.760
over because when we lost the civil war

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:42.880
when we lost the civil war

00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:47.119
what made me say that no when the

00:52:47.119 --> 00:52:49.200
when the south lost the civil war

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.119
napoleon was like all right this

00:52:51.119 --> 00:52:52.720
well when napoleon was gone for this or

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:54.400
whoever the french pulled there pulled

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.000
their well there was like three napoleon

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.559
oh true i think it was a later napoleon

00:52:58.559 --> 00:53:00.000
yes

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.480
uh support yeah

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:05.440
and maximilian um

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:08.240
uh they beheaded him they fed

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.240
peyote to his wife

00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:12.400
and sent her home and there's some

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.960
little village somewhere in like

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:16.319
the netherlands

00:53:16.319 --> 00:53:18.000
where they tell you like

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.280
she's gonna come get because she would

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.119
run in the streets she went insane she

00:53:21.119 --> 00:53:23.280
would run the streets screaming and they

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.960
tell kids if you don't get to sleep

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.480
because she comes out at night you don't

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:27.920
go to sleep she's gonna oh she's gonna

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:29.760
come get you yeah that's how far that's

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:32.000
how far in mexico is i'm sorry to derail

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.839
you but so no that's so zachary so you

00:53:33.839 --> 00:53:35.760
were still at poke in the table but

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.280
still so one thing that was cool was

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.119
when polk was instigating this war with

00:53:39.119 --> 00:53:40.480
mexico

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.079
you got to cut that part where i say we

00:53:42.079 --> 00:53:44.319
lost no that's cut that i don't know you

00:53:44.319 --> 00:53:45.520
corrected it

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:46.880
immediately

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:49.040
this is pretty sick so polk was up there

00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:51.200
like they're with us

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.760
they they shot at our troops a nice an

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:56.000
old one-term senator from illinois at

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
the time stood up and said were we on

00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.839
their territory when we shot him there

00:53:59.839 --> 00:54:01.040
was one guy that was opposed to the

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.960
mexican-american war a guy by the name

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:06.000
of abraham really abraham lincoln people

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.400
are like hey shut up yeah dude

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.079
we're trying to take texas shut the

00:54:10.079 --> 00:54:11.760
up he's like you guys did were we like

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:14.000
 he was like sorry yeah i think this

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000
was wrong anyway that's why polk's kind

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.880
of man he he added one third of the

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:21.200
entire united states in a four-year term

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:23.359
damn pretty good well in territory i

00:54:23.359 --> 00:54:25.200
know but still still like those big

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.960
texas and california and they were just

00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:28.559
really half of our population

00:54:28.559 --> 00:54:30.559
they were sitting i wish he hadn't added

00:54:30.559 --> 00:54:31.520
them

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:35.240
especially texas

00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:41.610
[Laughter]

00:54:44.110 --> 00:54:46.880
[Laughter]

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:49.040
again that was a smashing we

00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:51.680
america destroyed mexico it was mean it

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:52.960
was mean

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:54.160
um

00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:56.400
then this is good polk he was working

00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:57.599
his tail off

00:54:57.599 --> 00:55:00.160
his tail he was tired he got he was he

00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:02.319
was so exhausted when he got done he

00:55:02.319 --> 00:55:04.240
went back to tennessee and just died

00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:06.880
like right away right yeah yeah

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:08.319
he was like that was too much i should

00:55:08.319 --> 00:55:10.000
have done a lot of work

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.760
yep just died

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.839
so then comes zachary taylor this is

00:55:13.839 --> 00:55:16.880
1849 to 1850 that's a quick term

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.520
uh old rough and ready yeah pretty sick

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:21.599
nick there all dead and yeah he's always

00:55:21.599 --> 00:55:23.440
about to be dead yeah he died i don't

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.839
remember what he died of he was a just

00:55:25.839 --> 00:55:28.799
being in the 1800s yeah he was one of

00:55:28.799 --> 00:55:30.319
the largest slave holders in the south

00:55:30.319 --> 00:55:32.079
so when he got elected the south was

00:55:32.079 --> 00:55:34.480
like nice because at this point the

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:37.280
territories he just added polk did all

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:39.839
that in four years which was sick but it

00:55:39.839 --> 00:55:41.839
also it was too much because now there's

00:55:41.839 --> 00:55:44.640
so much territory and the slaves versus

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.640
the abolitionists debate every state

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:49.040
they had to add there was a debate

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:51.839
uh there's a debatey um all southern

00:55:51.839 --> 00:55:54.319
pres so many southern presidents yeah i

00:55:54.319 --> 00:55:56.559
mean outside of the atoms is pretty much

00:55:56.559 --> 00:55:58.720
nonstop virginia yep and then it gets

00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:00.559
into like tennessee and

00:56:00.559 --> 00:56:01.839
they started digging into their their

00:56:01.839 --> 00:56:04.000
bench was not they came to tennessee and

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.680
then we started kind of with ohio we

00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:07.520
started coming back yeah

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.440
um actually kind of northern presidents

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.920
tended to suck lincoln ruled

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:14.400
yeah but he was well he was kentucky uh

00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:17.920
illinois yeah yeah illinois

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:21.119
which i always forget one i think he

00:56:21.119 --> 00:56:22.559
you think he was born in kentucky in a

00:56:22.559 --> 00:56:24.640
log cabin in kentucky and then he was

00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:27.040
there he was the illinois illinois

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.559
 knows there's no way to know we

00:56:28.559 --> 00:56:29.680
weren't right about it we will never

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:31.040
know we were never correct about half

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:33.359
these facts but we're having fun oh yeah

00:56:33.359 --> 00:56:35.520
i could be i'm just i love just acting

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.760
like i know that's great

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:41.119
uh so one thing taylor gets in there

00:56:41.119 --> 00:56:42.480
everybody's like nice everyone in the

00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.760
south is like nice this guy's pro

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:45.680
slavery he gets in he tends to start

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:46.720
actually

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:48.240
leaning towards

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:49.359
uh

00:56:49.359 --> 00:56:50.960
standing with the north

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:52.400
this is all leading to the civil war

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:53.599
because like guys like this start

00:56:53.599 --> 00:56:56.240
 this up as soon as he says we're

00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.000
going to establish abolish slave in the

00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.599
western territories

00:56:59.599 --> 00:57:01.200
uh south carolina says they're gonna

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.119
succeed taylor says he's gonna

00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:04.960
hang everybody down there if they do it

00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:07.040
what yeah he didn't react well to this

00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:09.680
yeah no he wasn't like let's talk and

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:12.079
send it

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:26.720
podcast about

00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:28.640
all right go ahead how did he die he

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:30.559
went to washington dc for independence

00:57:30.559 --> 00:57:32.319
day and he ate too many cherries and

00:57:32.319 --> 00:57:34.160
milk what

00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:35.520
because like i said it was a swamp so

00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:37.440
there was like a colorado

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:39.599
pop rocks and coke yeah he had cherries

00:57:39.599 --> 00:57:43.440
and frosted milk and that was exploded

00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:44.319
um

00:57:44.319 --> 00:57:45.440
by the way you know how many pr there

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:48.079
were uh

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:50.319
four presidents when you think about the

00:57:50.319 --> 00:57:52.240
fact that four of them were assassinated

the out of him

00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:00.559
he was

00:59:00.559 --> 00:59:03.119
insane

00:59:03.359 --> 00:59:05.200
were they all crazed lone gunman type

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:06.559
things or was it like

00:59:06.559 --> 00:59:08.079
yeah most of them were crazy people

00:59:08.079 --> 00:59:09.520
there's a few other guys that were shot

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:12.000
at somebody took shots at them

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.839
and uh but that they didn't get her oh

00:59:13.839 --> 00:59:16.000
what's his name uh

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.319
well fdr they killed the governor right

00:59:18.319 --> 00:59:20.000
who was sitting next to him

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000
somebody a spray of bullets and he

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.599
wasn't hurt but the governor sitting

00:59:23.599 --> 00:59:25.520
next to him was killed jesus governor of

00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.280
georgia or florida i don't know

00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:30.240
anyway go on but yeah like over 10 like

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:33.119
12 of them had been shot have been shot

00:59:33.119 --> 00:59:36.400
so it's an intense job

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:38.000
there's a good chance it is like a

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.240
higher rate than actual soldiers in war

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.280
oh yeah

00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:42.799
well i don't know it's probably i guess

00:59:42.799 --> 00:59:44.559
so i bet it is

00:59:44.559 --> 00:59:46.079
it might be up yeah because in

00:59:46.079 --> 00:59:48.400
like regular like revolution shit's like

00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:51.520
70 000 soldiers 2 000 dead what's crazy

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.440
like that but before it used to be like

00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:55.359
when you know you like uh what's his

00:59:55.359 --> 00:59:57.119
name alexander the great and whoever

00:59:57.119 --> 00:59:59.520
some kings used to lead heads of state

00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.359
used to lead charges

01:00:01.359 --> 01:00:03.760
yeah the front horse

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.920
like going right headlong into an army

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.920
that would be nice to be a lot of roman

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.240
roman guys did that and jackpot yeah

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.319
 god holy he's coming right

01:00:12.319 --> 01:00:14.090
at me he's coming right

01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:17.139
[Music]

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.920
all right so now we're at fillmore uh

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.440
the thing that sucks about

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:24.160
uh taylor dying is he was like

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.319
kind of a beast that could have maybe

01:00:26.319 --> 01:00:29.359
prevented the civil war that was looming

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:31.760
no more was it just a schlub filmer was

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.119
a schlub

01:00:33.119 --> 01:00:35.040
he signed this is where it all starts to

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.599
 up every single one of these guys

01:00:37.599 --> 01:00:39.440
up to lincoln is just up

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.160
immensely he wanted to do something

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.559
so taylor was offered to sign the

01:00:44.559 --> 01:00:47.839
compromise of 1850 which was

01:00:47.839 --> 01:00:50.240
uh some about one slave state one

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.319
regular they get to decide like

01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:53.359
that

01:00:53.359 --> 01:00:55.599
as soon as taylor died fillmore

01:00:55.599 --> 01:00:57.280
takes over and signs it

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.960
uh southerners were mad that california

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.880
would join as a free state northerners

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.480
were mad about the fugitive slave laws

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.920
so they both compromised and were both

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:06.640
pissed fugitive slave law was if you

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.799
kept if you find a slave in the north

01:01:08.799 --> 01:01:10.480
there's u.s marshals that'll catch them

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.000
and bring them back to the south you

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.240
have to help them get them back and

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.440
there were dudes that were just like

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:18.000
grabbing black people yeah got him

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.520
where's my bounty

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.280
so it was it was better the slave guy

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.680
got taken oh is it yeah he wasn't

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.839
he was a free northerner

01:01:25.839 --> 01:01:27.839
who's just kidding by one of those guys

01:01:27.839 --> 01:01:29.920
damn it was bad happened all the time he

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.680
was the last member of the whig party

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.119
they didn't run him a second term here

01:01:33.119 --> 01:01:34.799
comes franklin pierce

01:01:34.799 --> 01:01:36.880
uh he was a pals with jackson son of a

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.559
revolutionary war hero he's from the

01:01:38.559 --> 01:01:39.920
north but he was pro-slavery they

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.359
thought this was gonna work

01:01:41.359 --> 01:01:43.599
uh two months before the this is crazy

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:45.520
two months before his inauguration he

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.359
and his family were in a train crash and

01:01:47.359 --> 01:01:49.280
the only casualty was his 11 year old

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:52.000
son damn so his entire time in office

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.559
he's blacked out drunk and depressed

01:01:54.559 --> 01:01:56.319
he's the saddest guy of all time he's

01:01:56.319 --> 01:01:58.480
not listening his kid just died his wife

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.799
blamed him for the death constantly she

01:02:00.799 --> 01:02:01.839
was like we should have never been on

01:02:01.839 --> 01:02:03.520
that train you just had to be the

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.359
 president oh you gave birth to

01:02:05.359 --> 01:02:07.359
him

01:02:07.359 --> 01:02:09.119
you were on the train you were you had

01:02:09.119 --> 01:02:12.240
fun yeah dude uh

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.319
so he's there

01:02:14.319 --> 01:02:15.359
during pierce they do the

01:02:15.359 --> 01:02:17.520
transcontinental railroad this is this

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.760
is like the real this is a up for

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.440
the the north wants it to be from

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:23.520
chicago to la

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.520
or one of those places out west the

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.520
south wants it to be from atlanta at la

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.960
in order to get it done they have to get

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.720
rid of the missouri line compromise

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.480
which made it

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.480
nothing north or south of here was the

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:37.200
slave line uh they decided to make it so

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.799
every new territory got to decide

01:02:38.799 --> 01:02:41.119
themselves they got to vote in order to

01:02:41.119 --> 01:02:43.200
get the transcontinental railroad

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.599
um so this opened every single thing we

01:02:45.599 --> 01:02:47.359
did to build this nation ran into this

01:02:47.359 --> 01:02:49.520
slave problem yes every single thing we

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.280
tried to do was like yeah but the

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.280
 north south slave slave

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:54.720
states non-slave states

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:56.000
we need to build a railroad across

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.559
that's the first interstate yes thing

01:02:58.559 --> 01:03:00.799
the first interstate objective yeah it's

01:03:00.799 --> 01:03:02.319
the first thing that is the first thing

01:03:02.319 --> 01:03:03.680
that need you need a federal

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.280
government's why we start the federal

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.799
government got stronger and stronger

01:03:06.799 --> 01:03:08.160
because every state gets to do their own

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.599
thing but you want to take a

01:03:09.599 --> 01:03:10.640
train

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:12.640
from one to the other you guys these two

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.640
states have to make a compromise so you

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.079
needed a federal government to make

01:03:16.079 --> 01:03:18.559
these it was like the precursor to union

01:03:18.559 --> 01:03:19.680
non-union

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.599
they'd just blow yeah yeah organic like

01:03:21.599 --> 01:03:22.720
inflatable

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.079
yeah yeah

01:03:24.079 --> 01:03:25.440
yeah it's and it's

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.359
the other reason just just a general

01:03:27.359 --> 01:03:28.880
thing that you the federal government

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.640
became what gave the federal government

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.039
power was the states wanting parity with

01:03:33.039 --> 01:03:35.039
each other like when environmental laws

01:03:35.039 --> 01:03:37.359
became a thing they were state laws

01:03:37.359 --> 01:03:39.440
so like indiana would make a law you

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.119
can't dump

01:03:41.119 --> 01:03:43.440
you know sludge into the river anymore

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.160
so every company in indiana has to pay

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.280
extra

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.359
to do a better job of dumping their

01:03:49.359 --> 01:03:50.799
and take it to the ocean or somewhere

01:03:50.799 --> 01:03:53.280
else ruin somebody else's life yeah but

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.079
so

01:03:54.079 --> 01:03:55.920
next door to indiana is illinois and

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.839
they're like we dump we go and we dump

01:03:57.839 --> 01:03:59.760
anything we want yeah and so all the

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.520
business goes there

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.920
and so the

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.680
the indiana the illinois company's like

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:07.359
we don't want to dump

01:04:07.359 --> 01:04:08.799
we don't want to hurt the environment

01:04:08.799 --> 01:04:10.880
but we can't compete with these guys

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.559
yeah right

01:04:12.559 --> 01:04:15.039
so they would go the so they all the

01:04:15.039 --> 01:04:16.640
states would go to the fed and say

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:19.359
please pass a law that affects everybody

01:04:19.359 --> 01:04:20.880
so that we can all do the right thing

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.599
that we want to do without having to get

01:04:23.599 --> 01:04:25.839
squeezed out by this guy yeah and that

01:04:25.839 --> 01:04:28.240
worked until we started doing with

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:31.119
mexico and india and china

01:04:31.119 --> 01:04:33.680
uh but anyway go on but yeah it's taylor

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:34.880
it was interesting

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.280
we're at uh i think pierce here right on

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.880
the on the transcontinental railroad

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.520
yeah that turns out to be like

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.200
that's what started it i mean obviously

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.720
there's a ton of major factors but that

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.400
was like a big one because it opened

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.640
what was called the nebraska kansas act

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:50.880
which is they got to decide to vote

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.720
whether they were pro-slave or pro

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.799
abolition so then a bunch of people just

01:04:54.799 --> 01:04:56.960
rushed in

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.799
from the north to the south and they

01:04:58.799 --> 01:05:00.559
started killing each other what

01:05:00.559 --> 01:05:02.400
it was the it was i forget the names

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.440
they were pretty sick it was like the

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:06.000
free staters versus the border ruffians

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.599
this is where john brown and his son was

01:05:07.599 --> 01:05:09.599
out there oh yeah yeah they started

01:05:09.599 --> 01:05:11.839
hacking people with swords to death like

01:05:11.839 --> 01:05:13.440
that was that was that was it and

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:16.000
franklin pierce was like uh

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
he did nothing he didn't get involved

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
yeah but it must have been crazy when

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.599
you had a bunch of slaves like this is

01:05:21.599 --> 01:05:23.680
wrong you had to be like

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:24.400
uh

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.240
you know it'd be something crazy to be

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.920
like no i don't think it is well you

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.280
just would pretend not to or you just

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:31.039
wouldn't i mean you'd see it on the

01:05:31.039 --> 01:05:33.440
newspaper was faded and it was like i

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.839
don't know that much about

01:05:34.839 --> 01:05:37.599
it just not being able to go down to my

01:05:37.599 --> 01:05:38.960
slaves i treat him okay yeah they're

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.079
great

01:05:40.079 --> 01:05:41.520
right tell him

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.119
oh yeah he's great yeah he's all right

01:05:43.119 --> 01:05:45.760
use it no it's fine

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.440
no and meanwhile the north was starting

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.359
to get uh i mean this is getting after

01:05:49.359 --> 01:05:50.799
pierce's who

01:05:50.799 --> 01:05:52.160
buchanan

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:54.079
so buchanan's the guy who lincoln who

01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:55.839
right before lincoln yes right

01:05:55.839 --> 01:05:57.119
because the other thing that was going

01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:59.599
on is the north is industrializing and

01:05:59.599 --> 01:06:01.839
the north is starting to build

01:06:01.839 --> 01:06:04.160
sweat houses and factories and so part

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.520
of the

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:08.000
argument that people were having that is

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.359
like the kind of argument we would have

01:06:09.359 --> 01:06:11.440
now if it would be interesting to take

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.920
this culture with twitter and everything

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.400
and supplant it to slavery days and how

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.319
we would have handled that debate back

01:06:18.319 --> 01:06:20.400
then true because there were people that

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.960
were saying you know the north has free

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:25.200
workers and a ton of them immigrants

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:27.119
that had started and they're treated

01:06:27.119 --> 01:06:29.280
like garbage they're living like

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.359
and they're dying in large numbers and

01:06:31.359 --> 01:06:32.559
getting sick

01:06:32.559 --> 01:06:34.880
uneducated not all and being not allowed

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:38.720
to be educated kids are working uh heavy

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.720
shifts southern political cartoons that

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.319
are like that that are about how bad

01:06:42.319 --> 01:06:45.119
they were in like our slaves

01:06:45.119 --> 01:06:47.280
we uh we we give them their own house

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.559
with their plot of land they get to do

01:06:48.559 --> 01:06:50.319
this and that we you know most slave

01:06:50.319 --> 01:06:52.160
owners where this were better that this

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:54.319
is the argument and that the north was

01:06:54.319 --> 01:06:57.839
just like wholesale destroying lives

01:06:57.839 --> 01:07:00.319
yeah and uh you know read uh what's his

01:07:00.319 --> 01:07:02.880
name uh upton sinclair the what

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:04.960
 was going on in chicago in the

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.240
slaughterhouse

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.720
what's it called uh it's uh there's not

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.240
the meat packing right yeah the

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.799
jungle what's it called the jungle yeah

01:07:12.799 --> 01:07:13.599
yeah

01:07:13.599 --> 01:07:15.599
so another important thing about that

01:07:15.599 --> 01:07:17.760
that point of the the industrialization

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:18.880
of the north

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:21.119
it just flooded with immigrants so now

01:07:21.119 --> 01:07:23.440
their population is so big that they get

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.319
more votes they get more electoral count

01:07:26.319 --> 01:07:28.480
so now the south's like we need to we

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:30.480
need to get power we need so now we need

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:32.799
more states we need more states

01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:33.520
because otherwise they're going to

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:34.880
abolish slavery and we're going to be

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:35.920
poor

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:37.599
and but they're also hanging on to a way

01:07:37.599 --> 01:07:39.039
of life in the south yeah and in the

01:07:39.039 --> 01:07:40.400
north they're not they're trying to do

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.160
anything that's new and anything that's

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.680
next and anything that's

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.680
large amounts of money and large amounts

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.200
of industry and they're but they're

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.119
they're

01:07:48.119 --> 01:07:51.039
manufacturing in huge amounts in the

01:07:51.039 --> 01:07:52.400
south they're just trying to play a

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:55.280
fiddle and whip the guy

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:58.000
grow grow a little tuft of cotton shirt

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.280
one shirt every six months

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:03.039
that's the thing you point out it's

01:08:03.039 --> 01:08:04.799
important to know yeah

01:08:04.799 --> 01:08:06.480
that was the fight it was an insanely

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.559
different yeah we still wanted to be one

01:08:08.559 --> 01:08:10.480
country we wanted to be one country so

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.640
it was this weird con a conflict that

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:14.559
never went away so definitely does it

01:08:14.559 --> 01:08:15.920
continue to morph till now it's just

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.239
like something it does

01:08:18.239 --> 01:08:20.080
like no we need to talk about

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:21.679
yeah yeah it's kind of tough but this

01:08:21.679 --> 01:08:23.359
okay so what's his name now we're at

01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:26.080
james buchanan who's probably the worst

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.000
yeah i think he's just he was frozen by

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.920
two he had so much pressure he was a

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:32.159
lawyer from pennsylvania that was just

01:08:32.159 --> 01:08:34.080
about the law yeah which was the last

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:35.679
thing he needed to be as the president

01:08:35.679 --> 01:08:37.040
which was like well that's the rule but

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.359
he had all of lincoln's problems with

01:08:39.359 --> 01:08:42.239
none of his charisma and guts yeah and

01:08:42.239 --> 01:08:44.239
blood that was you know james buchanan

01:08:44.239 --> 01:08:46.319
had the dress building up to kill dred

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:48.880
scott was under james buchanan which was

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:49.679
where

01:08:49.679 --> 01:08:50.719
if you don't know about that that was

01:08:50.719 --> 01:08:53.120
about a slave living in free territory

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:56.400
and he was suing to get his freedom it

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.400
went all the way up to the supreme court

01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:01.040
where they ruled uh he was an object so

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.600
he had no he was not a citizen therefore

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.600
that ruling made sure every black person

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.159
in america was an object and not a

01:09:08.159 --> 01:09:10.640
citizen and uh

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.400
buchanan responded by saying that's the

01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.400
law it that settles it

01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:16.560
instead of standing up he just had to

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.880
follow the law yeah so he was like an

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:21.199
extension of the court yeah

01:09:21.199 --> 01:09:24.000
that's not that wasn't his job yeah man

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.520
that brought us to lincoln and as soon

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:27.359
as lincoln gets elected

01:09:27.359 --> 01:09:29.759
the south secedes yeah every state

01:09:29.759 --> 01:09:31.920
starts to say we're not america anymore

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.400
like immediately before he takes

01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.319
office it's also crazy checking in on

01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:38.080
the headlines and they're like nah they

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.679
said you're a chair basically you're

01:09:39.679 --> 01:09:43.279
like yeah yeah dude uh you got

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:45.520
lincoln though you know lincoln well we

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.960
could just maybe skip him because he'll

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:49.359
be the whole yeah we could still

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:50.960
look and stop with lincoln let's stop

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:52.319
and then you go on to some guys you're

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:54.560
interested in afterlife all right

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.320
yeah we're good

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:57.760
we can go as long as we want i'm talking

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.840
about an hour okay well you're not

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.880

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:07.440
great day no i'm not i hate this decent

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.760
time really no i'm having a good time

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:12.100
how much fun you decide which one

01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:17.679
[Laughter]

01:10:17.679 --> 01:10:19.520
the thing i liked about i mean i gave

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.280
you that book about lincoln that's a

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.760
great uh what's him carl sandberg it's a

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:26.880
weird kind of stream of consciousness

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.480
telling of lincoln's story in four

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:30.320
volumes it's crazy just the warriors

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.560
just from when he took office

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.960
and um when he was coming here there was

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:36.320
everything hell was breaking loose there

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.239
was supposed to be a january 6th there

01:10:38.239 --> 01:10:40.800
was supposed to be one there was a plan

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:44.080
to stop the certifying of the vote and

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.719
so they went to uh

01:10:46.719 --> 01:10:49.120
general what was his name

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.040
he was the only american general then

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.640
because we didn't fight wars anymore

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:53.520
yeah

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.199
so the army was kind of like

01:10:55.199 --> 01:10:56.000
not

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.440
you know i think he was the commander

01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:58.800
he's it's a name you just know when

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.800
you're here like scott something oh yeah

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:03.280
winfield winfield scott yeah perfect

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:05.120
so they went to winfield scott the guy's

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:06.560
running the government then they said we

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.000
think there's going to be this thing

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
where they're going to try to stop the

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.560
so he said he said if anyone he did made

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:15.360
a declaration he's publicly he said if

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.600
anyone tries to stop the counting of the

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:20.159
votes and the democratic process from

01:11:20.159 --> 01:11:22.560
happening either by force or by

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:25.679
infiltration i i will stuff them into my

01:11:25.679 --> 01:11:28.400
cannon and fertilize my lawn with them

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:29.760
that's what it is lincoln said that

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:33.199
that's what he said what he did no

01:11:33.199 --> 01:11:35.360
yeah but and what he did in real fact

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:38.080
because he was a really smart guy he

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:41.040
gave all of the capital police and all

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:43.040
those guys that they had the the day

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:46.159
they said go home and he went and got

01:11:46.159 --> 01:11:48.880
uh policemen from baltimore from new

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:51.440
york city all kinds of like badass cops

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.679
and he had them in plain clothes

01:11:53.679 --> 01:11:56.239
all over the capitol heavily all heavily

01:11:56.239 --> 01:11:58.159
armed but in plain clothes

01:11:58.159 --> 01:12:00.480
so and people know so if somebody

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.760
started something the guy would just go

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:04.000
like this or elbow him or whatever

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.080
but the appearance was that it was

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.600
peaceful and that there was no military

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:08.880
presence

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.040
but nothing happened

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.040
um that's what it took to get lincoln

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.640
everybody up to the minute that happened

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:15.840
everyone was like i don't know if he's

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.360

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.800
he would never be president dude he

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.159
wasn't even on the ballot in the

01:12:20.159 --> 01:12:21.600
southern states

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.280
not even on the ballot yeah what he

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:25.760
didn't win one southern state

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:28.400
a lot of people big big people who would

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.159
be like whoever now

01:12:30.159 --> 01:12:32.320
wrote long things saying don't take

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:35.199
office your presidency your the your

01:12:35.199 --> 01:12:38.239
victory is hollow it's not real not even

01:12:38.239 --> 01:12:39.520
just people from the south but people

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.520
from the north that were everyone was

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:43.600
afraid that lincoln

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.840
was going to just immediately free the

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.760
slaves and start war with the south and

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:48.840
his first

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.400
inauguration

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.840
he says

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.600
first things for first thing out of his

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:56.640
mouth is i have no intention

01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:58.640
of freeing the southern slaves or

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:01.440
changing their slave laws and yes we

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.400
will

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.239
chase down and bring you back your

01:13:04.239 --> 01:13:05.840
slaves when they come up here within

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.760
reese he puts like a tiny thing like

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.040
we're not gonna like make it our

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.960
obsession but we will do it like so the

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.320
first thing out of his mouth it bothers

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:14.400
me about people like people that are

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.960
critics of him hang on to that and

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.000
they're like you know lincoln didn't

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.600
want to do it it's like dude the whole

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:20.800
time that's what he wanted of course he

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.159
did that's what again it goes all the

01:13:22.159 --> 01:13:24.480
way back to the framers they all wanted

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:27.920
this to be a better country than it was

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.840
so they they knew they couldn't they

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:32.560
couldn't create a nation without slavery

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:35.040
so they said let's create a nation where

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:37.120
people can change

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.120
peacefully they can change not only

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:40.239
leadership

01:13:40.239 --> 01:13:41.760
but the laws

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:42.640
that

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:45.120
create a situation where people figure

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.880
it out for themselves and move forward

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.000
and change instead of like a

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.280
constitution

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.280
could have been a very permanent thing

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:52.560
it could have been a very solid

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.000
permanent thing but they actually made

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.480
it elastic on purpose

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.560
um and that's yeah lincoln was like

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:01.199
we'll do it guys yes we'll do it yeah we

01:14:01.199 --> 01:14:02.960
need some time and boy what it

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:06.000
cost yeah is crazy

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.159
and a lot of people who didn't want

01:14:08.159 --> 01:14:11.520
slavery were really angry at lincoln for

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.760
how hard he pushed that war and that he

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.679
didn't just settle it just let the south

01:14:15.679 --> 01:14:17.199
do whatever they want we have we have

01:14:17.199 --> 01:14:19.360
our free blacks here let them take their

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:20.880
chances down there

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.960
um you're killing millions or however

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:24.159
many i don't know how many

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:26.080
people was like quarter million people

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.440
died in the civil war yeah probably

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:28.719
around there something like about how

01:14:28.719 --> 01:14:30.560
many we killed in iraq in a day yeah

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.800
pretty much true yeah for less for doing

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:34.640
nothing less than the middle eastern

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:37.280
civilians yeah yeah measure like persian

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:39.520
weddings yeah

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:42.320
exactly uh but yeah it was yeah

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:44.560
lincoln's the lincoln's the best

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.760
yeah it was really something i mean it

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.760
just took a lot a lot of political guts

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:50.159
a lot of doing a lot of

01:14:50.159 --> 01:14:54.000
 yeah yes

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.920
just trying to talk to these

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.719
 from the south

01:14:58.719 --> 01:15:01.440
it's just like clearly this is for money

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:03.040

a brutal brutal war a uh

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:31.120
incessant war and he had to wait until

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.719
he got a victory

01:15:32.719 --> 01:15:34.400

fixated he was interested he didn't

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.679
notice the assassin's creed thing it was

01:16:35.679 --> 01:16:37.520
hamilton

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:40.960
he was sitting there like what was it

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:42.400
nice

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:43.679
he was sitting there watching it like i

01:16:43.679 --> 01:16:45.600
got to pretend to like this yeah it's

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.040
 hamilton

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:48.480
and then they shot him he was like thank

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:51.679
god this place christ this sucks so

01:16:51.679 --> 01:16:53.199
bad

01:16:53.199 --> 01:16:54.320
um

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.760
so that brings us to

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:58.960
johnson so johnson was right first first

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:00.880
uh guy to be impeached

01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.960
was oh yeah first got to be impeached

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:04.960
yeah johnson shows up this is great he

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.000
was

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
he was like a tough guy he was supposed

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.560
to be the counteraction to lincoln well

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:12.080
he's one of the reasons the war was

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:13.440
prolonged because everybody knew if we

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:15.440
could just get rid of lincoln

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:17.440
johnson was behind him with there was a

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:18.880
deal to be made it was like don't was

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.480
like don't talk outside the family he

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:22.560
was like so you know yeah sonny liked my

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.719
deal didn't he sonny was hopping

01:17:24.719 --> 01:17:26.800
johnson would have settled in a

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:29.199
minute johnson started his life as an

01:17:29.199 --> 01:17:30.880
indentured servant

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.280
no and worked his way up

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.520
how sick is that that's impressive and

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:38.159
then before his inauguration he got

01:17:38.159 --> 01:17:40.880
 up on whiskey and just couldn't

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:41.760
talk

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:44.000
his inauguration it was in the rain in

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.840
the mud right after lincoln got shot and

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:48.239
everyone was like he's he's the one who

01:17:48.239 --> 01:17:50.320
proved you can you can impeach a

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.640
president but you cannot get the

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.960
votes it's a waste of time and he ends

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:57.600
up stronger yeah it's the dumbest move

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:00.239
in the world it's v it's vanity yeah

01:18:00.239 --> 01:18:01.840
it's just the congress hates the

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:03.760
president it's just yeah but it

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:06.159
doesn't accomplish anything they they i

01:18:06.159 --> 01:18:07.760
don't remember why they went after him

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:09.600
whatever he's very corrupt he's

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.440
up guy i don't who knows it's all

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.199
that i heard because of them

01:18:13.199 --> 01:18:15.600
but they they impeached him

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:18.080
and then failed to get rid of him

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.440
i knew nothing else about him but i

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:22.560
don't know either but then grant

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:25.600
grant amazing guy great guy amazing guy

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.440
i feel like his presidency was a bit of

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.760
a letdown for how cool he was i

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.600
mean he did so

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:34.000
christine much this guy oh true to to

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.840
help the south he was pretty good what

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:38.480
do you do well he was he was

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:39.760
first of all some people get on him

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:41.600
because he owned a sl he owned us one

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:44.800
slave because his father

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.199
his father-in-law his wife's

01:18:47.199 --> 01:18:49.520
father hated him because he was an

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.440
abolitionist he wasn't like an active

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:53.520
athlete sure but he was against it's

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.199
just for not having a slave back then if

01:18:55.199 --> 01:18:56.320
you didn't have a slave you were a dick

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.760
to certainly yeah

01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:00.400
so you were like put on a mask yeah you

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:01.679
were that guy you were like why do you

01:19:01.679 --> 01:19:03.679
have slaves yeah and they're like why is

01:19:03.679 --> 01:19:05.199
this guy making me feel uncomfortable

01:19:05.199 --> 01:19:06.480
yeah

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:07.360
so

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:09.679
he hated him because he had slaves and

01:19:09.679 --> 01:19:11.440
he didn't want one so he gave him one

there's like no adjectives in it it's

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:21.760
like all verbs and nouns the entire book

uh throat cancer like right as he

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:50.480
finished the book and then his wife was

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:53.520

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:07.679
and when he died the nor there was

01:25:07.679 --> 01:25:10.159
this huge funeral and it was northern

01:25:10.159 --> 01:25:12.400

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.400
were allowed to put back on

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:16.320
their southern uniforms because it was a

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:19.040
big thing that his casket was carried by

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:20.719
north and south

01:25:20.719 --> 01:25:21.920
it's too bad you can never get away with

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:23.600
wearing a confederate uniform in harlem

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:26.840
these days

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:30.719
yeah but he was he was awesome

01:25:30.719 --> 01:25:32.560
at the when when lee surrendered he was

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.080
very like i mean it was it was

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:36.080
unconditional surrender so he was like

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:37.520
you guys are gonna give up but

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:41.600
he was like keep your guns go home start

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.360

01:25:44.719 --> 01:25:46.639
was very chill

01:25:46.639 --> 01:25:48.800
i think custer stole the sword

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:50.239
he hated yeah

01:25:50.239 --> 01:25:52.080
i think custer stole lee's sword maybe

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:54.719
he got it back but i think

01:25:54.719 --> 01:25:57.440
the story was grant wouldn't accept it

01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:59.040
or something along those lines keep it

01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:00.480
and yeah customers

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:02.719
thirsty and then on on the parade back

01:26:02.719 --> 01:26:04.800

all black people

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:37.440
just he didn't want to get deal with it

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:39.679
so he just he just did away with it and

01:26:39.679 --> 01:26:41.679

is what it's called it's all yeah

01:26:49.679 --> 01:26:51.520
but this is where like it goes from

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:53.520
we ended slavery to now

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:56.560
just right back into just just racism

01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:58.639
not slavery but just every law against

01:26:58.639 --> 01:27:00.880
them subjugation just like just every it

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:03.520
became the same obsession as before yeah

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:05.520
but without slate we just became all

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:07.199
about not letting them vote keep them

01:27:07.199 --> 01:27:08.639
off them and that goes all the way up

01:27:08.639 --> 01:27:11.440
until like now yeah yeah like we're just

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.360
just yesterday 28th we figured out you

01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:15.600
figured out yesterday thank god

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:17.679
finally we got a nice

01:27:17.679 --> 01:27:19.520
yeah louisiana cleaned up their act a

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.840
little true in alabama my favorite

01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:23.520
president just jumping way the

01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:25.280
ahead

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:27.840
is uh nixon is my favorite dude he's

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:30.000
awesome he's the best and again as a

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.760
character yes nixon gave the country one

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:37.199
great gift that i i wish was like

01:27:37.199 --> 01:27:39.840
i wish it was taught

01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:43.360
like the speech that lincoln has on his

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:46.239
monument and the ask not what's your

01:27:46.239 --> 01:27:48.719
country and all that

01:27:48.719 --> 01:27:50.639
the greatest thing that he did because

01:27:50.639 --> 01:27:54.080
it speaks more to what americans live

01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:57.600
is that when nixon was shamed and

01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:00.239
destroyed and had to leave office he had

01:28:00.239 --> 01:28:02.320
to resign

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:04.320
he had to give after a couple of i'm not

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:05.920
a crook and this is all he had

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.840
to go and say well

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:10.960
all right i'm gonna go

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:12.800
still not cook but i'm gonna get out of

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:13.840
here

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.600
gerald ford would take the oath of

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:18.239
office at this time in this office

01:28:18.239 --> 01:28:20.800
and he left but before he left he gave a

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:22.800
speech to his staff

01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:24.719
um to the white house staff that was

01:28:24.719 --> 01:28:26.800
impromptu it was just on his way to the

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:30.159
to the to the uh helicopter

01:28:30.159 --> 01:28:33.440
and he's just and he's copiously crying

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:35.040
in a speech this video of it that you

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:36.000
can see

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.760
you have to try to find the whole thing

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:39.280
because there's clips that you can find

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:41.360
on youtube but i actually ordered from

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:42.800

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:45.840
uh dvd of the whole speech

01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:47.040

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:48.639
um they're all

01:28:48.639 --> 01:28:50.719
bawling the whole staff and his family

01:28:50.719 --> 01:28:52.800
standing behind him and he just tells

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:54.239
them look don't

01:28:54.239 --> 01:28:56.239
he's encouraging them he said this is a

01:28:56.239 --> 01:28:58.320
tough moment for all of us he said first

01:28:58.320 --> 01:28:59.840
of all i don't want to encourage i don't

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:01.040
want to discourage young people from

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:02.000
taking

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
from being in public service he was

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.239
afraid of what would

01:29:06.239 --> 01:29:07.199
what the

01:29:07.199 --> 01:29:10.480
what has happened yes he was right he

01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:12.560
said don't be discouraged from public

01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:14.880
office it's a great calling and he said

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:17.120
in for for any mistakes that we made and

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:19.520
all the everything that's happened not

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:22.840
one person in this administration

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:25.199
um gained

01:29:25.199 --> 01:29:27.440
financially from anything from being

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:28.320
here

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.159
left richer than when they got here he

01:29:30.159 --> 01:29:32.080
made him first so he defended everybody

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:34.080
that was there and then he just starts

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:36.159
reflecting he reads from teddy

01:29:36.159 --> 01:29:39.520
roosevelt's uh autobot from his diary

01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:42.560
when teddy's uh wife and

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:43.600
mother

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:46.480
died at the same night they both died of

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:48.159
the cholera or whatever on the same

01:29:48.159 --> 01:29:50.159
night he was going from room one room to

01:29:50.159 --> 01:29:52.400
the other oh yeah and they both died and

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:55.120
he was like at 21 or something and he

01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:56.960
wrote this quote that was like the light

01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:59.199
has gone out and it'll be darkness

01:29:59.199 --> 01:30:01.840
forever and he said so he read it to his

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:03.520
staff and he said that's how he felt

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:05.520
having lost his wife and his

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:06.800
mom

01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:08.639
and he went on and had this incredible

01:30:08.639 --> 01:30:10.400
life so he's trying to say don't so he

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:14.320
says don't be discouraged never be petty

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:16.960
uh don't hate your enemies because

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:18.480
that's when you'd start to destroy

01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:20.480
yourself he started he gets it really

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:21.760
introspective about everything that

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:23.360
happened without talking about it and

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:26.080
then he says it's horrible he goes um

01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:27.520
he says

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:28.960
they'll never write a book about my

01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:29.920
mother

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:32.159
but she was a saint

01:30:32.159 --> 01:30:34.560
oh man and i think of her

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:36.239
like one of his brothers had

01:30:36.239 --> 01:30:38.880
tuberculosis and they had no money so

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:41.120
she moved to arizona where the air was

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:42.080
better

01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:44.719
and she was a nurse uh wet nurse she

01:30:44.719 --> 01:30:46.880
nursed other people's babies

01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:48.960
for money in order that her son could

01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:51.440
live in arizona and he talks about his

01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:53.280
father who was a lemon farmer who had a

01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:55.920
failing lemon farm and then he was a

01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:58.719
switchman on a on a street car

01:30:58.719 --> 01:31:01.280
and he just talks about his parents and

01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:04.239
and what they did for him and

01:31:04.239 --> 01:31:06.239
all that he just he and he just

01:31:06.239 --> 01:31:07.600
cries

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:09.600
oh it was it's beautiful but it

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:11.679
shows you it just a man at the at the

01:31:11.679 --> 01:31:14.320
height of american experience

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:16.159
destroyed from that height which is the

01:31:16.159 --> 01:31:18.080
worst thing that can happen to a person

01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:20.400
is to get that high and fall and he just

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:22.480
went here's how this feels he just told

01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:24.880
the world this is how this feels is what

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:26.159
this looks like

01:31:26.159 --> 01:31:27.120
yeah

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:29.360
and uh here's all i can say and then he

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.760
went and he left incredible i mean he

01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:33.440
was one of the most influential people

01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:36.080
in american history yeah he ended

01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:38.080
vietnam right yes

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:40.000
that was already he was in that he was

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.560
in he was um eisenhower's vice

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:44.719
president

01:31:44.719 --> 01:31:45.760
he

01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:47.679
there's there's uh there's a guy we know

01:31:47.679 --> 01:31:48.880
that's a

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:51.199
bit of a conspiracy guy but he's been

01:31:51.199 --> 01:31:52.800
pretty correct on everything so far and

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:54.960
he's got a book coming out on watergate

01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:58.320
yeah okay and about how that was more it

01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:00.880
was a little darker than it seems like

01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:02.719
back when ice was first living in the

01:32:02.719 --> 01:32:04.320
city as a comedian

01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:09.280
um there was a guy named frank um

01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.480
gannon

01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:12.800
who had a cannon frank gannon wrote

01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:15.520
speeches for nixon and was a very close

01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:16.639
friend of his

01:32:16.639 --> 01:32:18.800
and weirdly he became the guy who books

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:21.280
the comedians on letterman

01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:22.960
and when i moved to new york back in

01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:25.040
1990

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:27.040
or so being on letterman was the all

01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:29.199
anybody wanted so gannon was the most

01:32:29.199 --> 01:32:31.520
important person in comedy at the time

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:33.600
and he was a strange guy

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:35.280
who was very serious and he would just

01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:37.360
come and he'd watch you and if he liked

01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:39.120
you he'd get morty to come

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.400
and maybe you'd be on the show so he

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:43.120
liked me he never got me on the show

01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:45.600
but he liked me so i i went to

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.520
letterman's office and met him and i

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:49.040
asked him about nixon because he he

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:51.440
wrote nixon has one big biography called

01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:52.719
rn

01:32:52.719 --> 01:32:55.520
that gannon co-wrote

01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:57.760
and he told me that when you get a few

01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:00.159
drinks in nixon

01:33:00.159 --> 01:33:02.560
he says same people that got

01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:05.040
the kennedy's got me it's the same

01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:06.639
same people he got yeah he said it's the

01:33:06.639 --> 01:33:10.000
same machine whoa that took out

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.600
yeah john roberts kennedy came after him

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:14.880
he said they just couldn't use bullets

01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:16.719
anymore because it was getting too

01:33:16.719 --> 01:33:18.080
they're getting they were exactly what

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:19.600
we said yeah this is we said that

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:20.960
without the watergate was he said

01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:22.400
watergate was something that happened

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:24.400
all the time it was just like and still

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:26.719
does i mean it's not like oh my oh my

01:33:26.719 --> 01:33:28.239
goodness yeah yeah

01:33:28.239 --> 01:33:30.320
it's how things are done yeah yeah it's

01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:31.600
a safe with a million dollars in it what

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:32.960
president doesn't have a say for the

01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:35.520
millionaires yeah it was uh so that's

01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:37.520
that's nixon's story that was that was

01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:39.840
nixon's story he didn't say it in public

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:42.239
sure because the same as he conceded the

01:33:42.239 --> 01:33:44.400
presidency to kennedy

01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:47.120
which kennedy stole

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:48.159
um

01:33:48.159 --> 01:33:50.719
i mean hope everyone knows that that his

01:33:50.719 --> 01:33:51.600
father

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:52.719
took

01:33:52.719 --> 01:33:55.280
suitcases of money to delegations and

01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:59.040
stole the presidency and nixon knew it

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:00.719
and he was like i'm not gonna that's not

01:34:00.719 --> 01:34:02.080
good for the country to get into that's

01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:03.840
why he resigned instead of standing

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:04.800
trial

01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:07.199
and that's why he doesn't talk about

01:34:07.199 --> 01:34:09.440
that's that's the story you know yeah

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:10.400
um

01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:13.120
yeah that's a good that's a good uh most

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:15.280
interesting president most interesting i

01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:17.120
think to me yeah i mean johnson was also

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:19.199
a fascinating guy johnson was

01:34:19.199 --> 01:34:21.360
and reagan was uh kind of an

01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:22.639
empty-headed

01:34:22.639 --> 01:34:26.159
genius incredible knows how to just be

01:34:26.159 --> 01:34:28.000
as long as somebody else is in the room

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.639
reagan was brilliant

01:34:30.639 --> 01:34:32.480
but i'm not sure he had any

01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:33.920
thoughts

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:35.360
yeah i mean there was people like that

01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:37.840
yeah he he was like a actor that was you

01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:39.600
know i guess i'll be a republican while

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.880
he was there

01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:42.880
and then which was which was pretty

01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:44.880
admirable at the time because he was

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:46.000
actually no it wasn't because it was in

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.440
the middle of the red scare he was like

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:49.760
one of the guys being like

01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:51.360
you're a communist

01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:54.320
he just became the man

01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:57.600
my favorite film of reagan is larry king

01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:00.480
interviewing him after he was shot

01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:02.719
and saying so what do you what do you

01:35:02.719 --> 01:35:04.159
how do you what do you feel about this

01:35:04.159 --> 01:35:05.840
guy and he said well i just pray for him

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:06.880
he's a

01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:08.560
sick man he's just
