all

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.400
boot camp was at west point was like

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.320
walking and standing

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.680

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.160
going home i was like i want to go home

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.080
that was really it yeah there's no

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.160
dishonorable discharge no anything like

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.440
that it's just honorable discharge

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.720
you're just honorable yeah yeah yeah

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.639
okay because day one you swear in yeah

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.320
i'm sorry i was a [ __ ] soldier

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.400
technically yeah and i've told this

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.520
before but it's funny because

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.800
technically

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.440
i did join during wartime if you

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.080

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:37.840
decorated veteran do you have a medal no

you could order it i could have ordered

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.440
it it would have been [ __ ] insane to

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.680
order that

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.360
i'm a decorator

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.600
to steal valor but technically legally

doing it yeah yeah uh but no i got there

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.240
and it was funny when i quit

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.680
i was dumb

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.199
i was a dumb [ __ ]

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:47.199
this is the worst way to go into boot

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:49.840
camp

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.479
[Applause]

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:54.000
what a terrible way to enter the

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.280
military

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.680
you exited pretty cool i was out dude i

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.280
got in there and i was like i'm [ __ ]

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.199
this was a huge mistake well it was

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:02.400
funny too because i knew i made a

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.720
mistake like yeah when when i made a

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.280
mistake like two months ahead so after i

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.680
committed i was like this is

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.080
i [ __ ] up but you know i was i was 17

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.400
or 18 at the time so he's it's new like

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.400
[ __ ] up like that i didn't know what

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.280
to do

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.599
and uh i remember the night before boot

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:21.840
camp i was in a hotel like with my

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.199
parents because your parents dropped you

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:27.280
off at like 5 a.m or 6 a.m so

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.720
i was just laying there with them and i

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.160
was like geez this is in a hotel room

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.280
and uh

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.720
were they supportive did they think this

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.319
was a good thing or they were like hey

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:38.160
we don't have to pay for college he goes

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.800
right we're so proud i'm so proud so

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.400
that was yeah that'll come back with yes

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.520
they've been proud of me twice

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:52.400
and both times catastrophic failures

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.960
that seem to last about the same amount

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.319
dude same amount

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.280
i mean truly i've had six weeks in my

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.879
entire life with my parents being proud

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:05.199
but uh

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.520
so

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.400
they

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.160
so while the night before boot camp i

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.840
called my friend jamal who was playing

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.080
d2 somewhere else so i called him and i

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.080
was like what's going on and he was like

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.680
i'm just playing madden we're gonna go

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.160
to a party i was like [ __ ]

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.080
i [ __ ] up like i'm in a hotel with my

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.000
parents about to go to boot camp i

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.680
should have went d2

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.800
should have went to another could you

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.599
have yeah i could have played dc yeah

00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:31.199
yeah i the other schools i was going to

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:33.919
was like one double a 1a was anyone else

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.000
other schools looking at you at the time

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.159
yeah for sure who else uh

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:40.240
in hindsight who would you have picked

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.800
uh that was knocking so i'll tell you

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.959
after army i transferred to elon and

00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:46.800
played one season of college football

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.399
okay so no matter where i went i was

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:50.880
gonna quit i quit after that full season

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.959
uh because college football did suck but

00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:54.800
uh yeah i should have won one double a i

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.040
should have went to like duquesne or

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.800
the smaller and you think you would have

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.279
played out there

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:02.800
i don't know i probably wouldn't have

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.440
finished the foot the the one season i

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.399
finished at elon if i hadn't quit

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:10.240
west point already you can't quit like

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.480
twice back to back in like a month

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.279
although i would have did it sucked so

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:16.080
uh

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.600
when you hit the realization that you're

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.240
gonna leave what bothers you more like

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.320
telling your parents about this that was

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.399
annoying because they were coached

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:25.600
because everybody that goes to west

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.839
point cries and tries to quit everybody

00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:30.000
does like every when you go basically

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.279
everybody obviously there's dudes that

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:32.959
are like patriots

00:09:32.959 --> 00:09:34.640
that like want to be in the military

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.640
yeah yeah but uh everybody that goes

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.360
there has like a 1600 on their s.a.t and

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.200
it's kind of like a dork so when you get

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.560
into that competitive like getting

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.800
yelled at in the morning dorks [ __ ]

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.839
spaz

00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:47.519
and uh

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:48.800
that's funny

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.560
uh

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.120
so yeah the parents were coached to say

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.720
you can't come home got it so when you

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.480
call your parents like hey i'm quitting

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.760
they're coached

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.600
by like drill instructors and recruiters

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.600
to be like say no say they're literally

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.440
not allowed to come home so my parents

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.720
when i called them and i was like i'm

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.399
coming home i'm [ __ ] quitting they're

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:07.839
like you cannot quit and i was like you

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:11.040
guys are [ __ ] losers

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.760
i was so mean i was like you guys you're

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.519
a [ __ ] teacher mom shut the [ __ ] up

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:19.920
it was it was really regrettable stuff

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.920
dude

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.079
it was embarrassing

00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:26.640
i mean dude imagine crying on the phone

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.800
with your body and other dudes crying

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.399
waiting to get with your mama

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:34.959
you're a loser

00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:36.399
and then they finally the next time i

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:37.839
call they're like all right of course

00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:39.440
you can come home we were told to say

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.399
that

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:41.680
uh

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.440
but yeah they it was funny because when

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.560
they

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.079
this was very funny so when they drop

00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:48.800
you off they you drop they drop you off

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.640
in regular clothes and your parents say

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.000
goodbye to you and then at the end of

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.600
the day there's a parade of all the new

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.920
cadets in front of all the parents and

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.079
now they see you marching in a uniform

00:10:58.079 --> 00:11:00.480
head shaved at the end of the day

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.600
so

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.680
during that parade i see my mom like

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.600
waving a flag like one of those mini

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.440
flags and i walk by her and she was like

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.880
yes and i was like

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.720
in one hour

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.079
and she literally went like this dude

00:11:16.079 --> 00:11:17.920
she goes

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.040
she dropped her flag

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.839
i'm getting the [ __ ] i was like i am

00:11:23.839 --> 00:11:26.079
[ __ ] out of here

00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:28.240
oh [ __ ] yeah it was a huge and what was

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.760
funny is like while you're quitting i

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.200
was still getting letters from people

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.959
back home that were like we're so proud

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:35.040

you're already out i'm out dude you're

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.000
already sitting on the couch i was

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.279
getting letters from people that were

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:40.640
like we love you we're proud of you and

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.079
i was like i'm going to community

00:11:42.079 --> 00:11:44.240
college

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.160
yeah

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.399
uh oh that's great yeah so that was a

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:50.720
pretty big uh how did you fail did they

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.480
ever talk to you about it like did they

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.320
tell you they were disappointed or you

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.959
just knew no you could see it yeah yeah

00:11:56.959 --> 00:11:59.360
i mean my dad who was once like your dad

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.279
i would imagine my dad was he a military

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:03.600
guy no no that was another thing he said

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.920
that i was like what if i [ __ ] die

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.600
like i was talking about it

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.760
because one day temple

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.680
recruited me temple was recruiting me

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.839
and army was recruiting me and i told my

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:16.720
mom i committed to temple and she cried

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.120
and i was like oh you guys like because

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.880
when army recruits you they get your

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.000
parents

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.200
you know what i mean what do you mean

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.800
they tell your parent because

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.720
if you're getting recruited to army

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.000
chances are the other schools you're

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.600
getting recruited to

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.399
at the d1 level are shitty you know it's

00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:35.279
like eastern michigan temple right like

00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:37.519
normal schools that anybody can get into

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:39.680
army is like

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.639
going to ivy league right uh so

00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:44.240
when they're recruiting you they're like

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.680
drilling it to your parents like your

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.959
kid's gonna be a [ __ ] loser if he

00:12:46.959 --> 00:12:48.959
goes to eastern michigan we can make him

00:12:48.959 --> 00:12:51.040
a senator i think so your parents are

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.639
like oh you got to go to army right you

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:54.800
have to go to army so when i told my mom

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.440
i committed to temple she like was sad

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.720
and i didn't commit to temple i just

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.560
wanted to see what she would say and she

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.720
like cried and i was like damn so like

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.639
they get your parents so my parents were

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:07.920
like west point's the best place ever

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.360
uh

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.040
yeah they're like they're all in my dad

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.959
had like army hats but i remember one

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.959
time i was talking to my dad about army

00:13:14.959 --> 00:13:17.519
and i was like what if i [ __ ] die and

00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:19.680
he's like is that so bad is that so bad

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.680
for your country yeah i was like you're

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.200
a salesman

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.440
just don't tell me that yeah

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.760
yeah that's okay yeah i was like what if

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.600
i died is that bad to die for your

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.959
country i was like you didn't [ __ ]

00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:32.839
serve what the [ __ ] are you talking

00:13:32.839 --> 00:13:37.200
about yeah so there was a lot of that

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.279
so you get out and then you i get out i

00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:40.480
transfer

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.000
immediately i go

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.160

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.959
enough and west point's

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:49.199
boot camp is early enough

00:13:49.199 --> 00:13:51.519
that you start in like june so i

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:52.959

00:13:52.959 --> 00:13:55.920
time to go make another school's oh okay

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.000

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.639
straight like a week later to elon

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:02.240
university in north carolina because

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.680
their coach at the time

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.839
was at lehigh and he was recruiting me

00:14:05.839 --> 00:14:08.480
there and uh so i get to elon

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.399
and that [ __ ] that sucked

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:12.480
that was harder than boot camp i mean

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.560
football is college football is harder

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.760
than

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.040
west point's boot camp i'm not saying

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.120
like marines in what ways

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.959
you physically get beat up like you're

00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:23.440
going up against girl like jacked

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.160
giant dudes that are physically

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.320
dominating you for

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.720
four hours every single day

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.959
so that sucks just beating you oh man

00:14:32.959 --> 00:14:34.399
dude i was and i

00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:35.680
i was like you're going up against

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.360
something

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.199
well even the safeties would like come

00:14:39.199 --> 00:14:41.519
down dude guys that was like 180 pounds

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:43.920
would just [ __ ] level me dude i

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.800
sucked i [ __ ] sucked

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.959
oh man and it's [ __ ] ronnie lot over

00:14:48.959 --> 00:14:50.959
here it was such a harsh reality because

00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:53.600
you go from high school where i was 6'3

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.440
290 in high school i was bigger than

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.880
everybody yeah i could literally just

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.959
walk towards someone and they'd move

00:14:58.959 --> 00:15:00.880
and then you get to college and like

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.760
those dudes are huge so the reality is

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.519
like you go from being the best guy on

00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:06.880
your team to

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.279
the worst guy in the conference the cop

00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:12.560
i was so bad dude when i my o-line coach

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.360
elon [ __ ] hated me he hated me and

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.199
when i quit i was like i feel like i'm

00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:18.480
probably like one of the worst guys on

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.839
the team right and he was like yeah

00:15:19.839 --> 00:15:21.279
you're probably

00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:23.519
yeah when i quit he was like yeah you're

00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:26.000
fine you're doing the right thing yeah

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.440
yeah

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.680
it was rafted that was rough

00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:33.600
that was my whole identity my whole life

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.880
i was like i'm a football player i'm a

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.399
football player then

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:38.320
you find out you're not and it's like oh

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.199
[ __ ]

00:15:39.199 --> 00:15:40.959
and then what do you do you pivot to

00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:43.839
what so i left elon went to

00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:46.000

not sure if it's writing a cast okay and

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.240

difficult

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.960

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.760
i don't say that word and then she was

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.440
like here's a clip of you saying it was

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.880
literally a video of me saying it and i

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.039
was like all right maybe i said it

00:27:43.039 --> 00:27:45.600
looks like i said it yeah

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.039
but it was it was because i was in a

00:27:47.039 --> 00:27:49.039
train i was going in and out of service

00:27:49.039 --> 00:27:50.799
so like i was getting like texts that

00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:51.919
were like

00:27:51.919 --> 00:27:53.679
did you say this and then like 20

00:27:53.679 --> 00:27:55.440
minutes later be like you need to call

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.159
me

00:27:56.159 --> 00:27:58.080
like and then the whole way and by the

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.480
time i got to the stand like tmz was

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.960
there no no

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.799
they met you there they got there before

00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:06.080
you did yeah

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.799
get those [ __ ] outta here crazy

00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:11.120
yeah that and so you walk into that

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.120
situation yeah dude i'm going from open

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.399
mics to literally tmz the next day

00:28:16.399 --> 00:28:18.720
and comics like oh you're in trouble and

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.559
so you got a little bit of a heads up

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:22.480
what was happening just because of the

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.720
daily communication on the train and you

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.440
walk into that yeah and do you talk to

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.880
them right there no i didn't talk to him

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.240
i just walked in did they come to you

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.600
and i was like hey man what's going on

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.320
hey you know they're like nice tmz is

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.000
like nice to you yeah they're like hey

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.360
man it's tough what's going on you got

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.720
anything to say they try to like bait

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.799
you in to be like yeah [ __ ] that yeah

00:28:40.799 --> 00:28:41.840
yeah

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.720
yeah

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.000
uh so yeah just that was it and then i i

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.600
went on stage like while it was all

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.440
happening and i was like

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.919
i think things are bad like i was like i

00:28:51.919 --> 00:28:53.200
think i'm in trouble yeah i was like i

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.799
don't think this is good

00:28:54.799 --> 00:28:56.080
it was funny too because everybody

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.520
including lauren michaels the whole time

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.039
was like you're gonna be fine don't

00:28:59.039 --> 00:29:00.720
worry this happened really yeah they

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.000
were all confident because every

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.440
everybody they've had

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.200
the last couple years gets this

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.120
treatment like they always have one or

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.240
two

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.520
like something will come up where they

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.880
tweeted something a while ago but it was

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.440
never a video of them saying a slur you

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.679
know what i mean right so the whole time

00:29:15.679 --> 00:29:18.080
i was like no i'm not like this is bad

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.679
if they're going through my podcast like

00:29:19.679 --> 00:29:21.120
this is bad

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.960
uh so i was kind of like i'm definitely

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.799
getting fired the whole time

00:29:24.799 --> 00:29:26.960
um

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.279
yeah that's and then that night i'm on

00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:31.360
the phone with like

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.960
lauren and all these people telling me

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.720
what to do like don't apologize

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.320
apologize say all this [ __ ] what's

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.640
lauren telling you lauren's

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.600
so nbc is saying here's the statement

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.080
you need to say and it's like a written

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.120
out like

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.120
what i said was inexcusable i've learned

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.799
from my mistakes like that like

00:29:48.799 --> 00:29:50.799
paragraph you need to tweet this i was

00:29:50.799 --> 00:29:52.840
like i'm not gonna tweet that like

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.080
that's you know that's crazy

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.200
um

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.640
but then lauren was like i just need you

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.080
to give me something

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.840
so i was like all right that's fair it's

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:02.880
reasonable

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.039
and uh so yeah i just had like five

00:30:05.039 --> 00:30:06.159
minutes he was like i need something in

00:30:06.159 --> 00:30:08.320
the next 10 minutes so i just sat there

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.960
and typed something out and tweeted it

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.880
yeah

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.960
that was it and that didn't do anything

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.039
for him no [ __ ] no i mean i sent it to

00:30:17.039 --> 00:30:18.799
him first and he was like all right yeah

00:30:18.799 --> 00:30:21.120
we'll we'll try post this see how it

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.159
goes and there's no apologizing

00:30:24.159 --> 00:30:25.039
you know

00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:26.559
nobody if there's nothing i could have

00:30:26.559 --> 00:30:28.399
said in that moment where any all these

00:30:28.399 --> 00:30:30.240
people that wanted my job would have

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.360
been like

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.399
oh

00:30:32.399 --> 00:30:33.919
you know what i mean yeah when you tweet

00:30:33.919 --> 00:30:35.760
an apology there's no it's not going to

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.960
do anything no

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.320
they're going to just rip it apart

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.840
they're going to be like he doesn't care

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.600
right you know now it's more fodder to

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.440
tear apart yeah

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.840
yeah so then when do you get the actual

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.799
call that you're not going to be

00:30:48.799 --> 00:30:50.880
like four days later

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.960
yeah right because it was are you just

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.720
[ __ ] [ __ ] yourself like dying it

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.480

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.159

00:33:20.159 --> 00:33:23.039
cast members like tried to keep me yeah

00:33:23.039 --> 00:33:25.840
so yeah i like those guys so what

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.440
happens to you

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.519
personally after this like where do you

00:33:29.519 --> 00:33:32.960
go emotionally personally this first day

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.039
after this ah yeah i don't know i can

00:33:35.039 --> 00:33:39.039
consider quitting do you consider none

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:42.960
because i mean there was a part of me

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.720
that was like this is it not cool but

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.120
like this is crazy like this is all like

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:50.720
i was on cnn and like it was crazy so

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.000
yeah you were everywhere i wouldn't say

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.240
it was cool but it was it was definitely

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.480
like exciting in some sense

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.120
you know to go from zero to that

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.960
um

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.399
i was worried you know you're worried

00:34:02.399 --> 00:34:04.240
about like other things coming out or

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.440
like

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.200
you just get very paranoid i'll still

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.679
say still vtsd oh yeah i would imagine

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:11.119
like they're gonna go dig through

00:34:11.119 --> 00:34:12.720
something i said and take it this way

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.399
and get that out there just keep piling

00:34:14.399 --> 00:34:16.079
it on i put that special out yesterday

00:34:16.079 --> 00:34:18.079
and all day i was like it's the same i

00:34:18.079 --> 00:34:19.760
did rogan's podcast and it was the same

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.119
feeling i was like what are they gonna

00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:23.040
pull out this is gonna be something bad

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.399
and then i put out that special

00:34:24.399 --> 00:34:25.679
yesterday and i was like this is gonna

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:27.919
be bad so like it does

00:34:27.919 --> 00:34:30.159
i don't want to get too emotional yeah

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:31.679
but it does take something from you like

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:32.720
i don't

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:36.159
i lost a lot of joy in doing things

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:37.599
you know what i mean yeah and do you

00:34:37.599 --> 00:34:39.520
find yourself overthinking now for a

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.599
certain extent for sure do you think

00:34:41.599 --> 00:34:43.599
it's a detriment though

00:34:43.599 --> 00:34:44.879
i don't i don't

00:34:44.879 --> 00:34:47.040
i don't overthink things in comedy like

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.359
uh like i'll do something and say

00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:50.800
something and put it out and then when

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.879
i'm done then i'm like oh [ __ ] what did

00:34:52.879 --> 00:34:54.960
i just do what did i put out here's how

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.560
it's gonna be taken

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.359
this is bad people and it's it's a it's

00:34:59.359 --> 00:35:01.599
tough to explain to people

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:03.280
because every every fans like [ __ ] it

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.040
dude [ __ ] them put it out and it's like

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.440
i don't it [ __ ] me up you know

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:09.839
i can imagine it was awesome yeah

00:35:09.839 --> 00:35:11.599
tell me about your parents then you said

00:35:11.599 --> 00:35:13.200
what happened they were good they were

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.440
like proud and supportive and even when

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.520
i got like in trouble they were like

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.200
we're with you don't worry

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.040
so that was nice

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.040
yeah and then my dad did like a [ __ ]

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.200
interview with like a local paper and i

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.119
called him i was like listen don't talk

00:35:27.119 --> 00:35:28.640
to anybody

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.720
because that's what happens is like

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.079
as soon as you're in the spotlight like

00:35:32.079 --> 00:35:34.000
that everybody somehow gets everybody

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.839
you know his phone number like i was

00:35:35.839 --> 00:35:37.119
getting phone calls from everybody my

00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:38.880
family was getting phone calls really

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.720
yeah out of nowhere like there's no

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.480
quotes [ __ ] they're trying to get you to

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.760
say something

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.359
and so i like had to call my dad be like

00:35:45.359 --> 00:35:46.960
make sure you don't say anything and he

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.079
was like ah

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:49.599
and i was like what he was like i just

00:35:49.599 --> 00:35:51.040
did an interview i was like don't do any

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.560
[ __ ] interviews he didn't interview

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.760
he did an interview that was like my son

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:58.359
did nothing wrong yeah it was nice

00:35:59.599 --> 00:36:01.280
yeah i think they were shell-shocked too

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.280
you know because they it was kind of

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.960
like west point where they had like a

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.280
lot of time to be probably proud and

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.880
yeah i don't want to say braggadocios

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:09.839
but they were you know they're with

00:36:09.839 --> 00:36:11.359
their friends right our sons going to

00:36:11.359 --> 00:36:12.880
west point they're like they had a

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.119
couple days to be like our son's gonna

00:36:15.119 --> 00:36:17.440
be on saturday night live yeah and

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.280
everyone was like oh great and then as

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.640
soon as you get canceled it's like

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.119
[ __ ] loser you know now has that ever

00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:25.520
happened to anyone on snl before where

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.480
they've been

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:30.160
cast and then fired no prior to actually

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.640
getting to the show no you're the you're

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.880
the owner of history yes you made snl

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.839
history i did make it without ever

00:36:37.839 --> 00:36:39.839
no you set foot on that stage i did you

00:36:39.839 --> 00:36:41.520
all did technically i did set foot on

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.760
the stage but uh

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.440
yeah i don't know it's weird to say

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:48.320
because it makes me look like uh

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.440
i don't know i don't want to sound like

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.520
like they're all nice everybody at snl

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.040
was nice to me

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.720
there's no real heart i don't have any

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.520
hard feelings with snl right they tried

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.359
and i understood why they fired me you

00:36:59.359 --> 00:37:01.119
know what i mean yeah of course i know

00:37:01.119 --> 00:37:03.839
what you mean yeah but but i do i loved

00:37:03.839 --> 00:37:06.560
seeing like uh i watched norm back you i

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:07.599
saw a lot

00:37:07.599 --> 00:37:10.160
so tell me about that who um

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.800
who from the old cast came forward and

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.119
and supported you um

00:37:15.119 --> 00:37:16.240
i remember

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.640
seeing david spade and bill burr and jim

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.480
jeffries did like a clip on his show

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.400
about it and that was cool to watch that

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.480
was nice uh

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.160
but yeah like norm

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.920
mcdonald that he was very vocal who's

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.920
like one of my he's my guy right i mean

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.240
come on he's incredible in fact i just

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:33.920
watched his special last week again this

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.440
is the best

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.960
and uh

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.560
yeah that was cool because he put out a

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.560
thing like while i was he tweeted

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.040
something like congratulations yes and

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.240
it was like while i was definitely

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.599
getting fired

00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:46.800
and he didn't think i was going to get

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.480
fired right so he was like i didn't

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.400
think like it almost seemed like he was

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.680
being a dick

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:54.320
to outside people like tweeting like

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.359
people were trying to ruin it this is

00:37:55.359 --> 00:37:56.720
the best day of your life like while i

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.000
was getting fired

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.839
um

00:37:59.839 --> 00:38:02.160
but yeah he called talked to yeah

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.280
everybody

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.400
they were all pretty supportive

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.960
it was yeah it was crazy it was wild

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.200
so what's the how long did you wait to

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.040
get back on stage and do stan oh that

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.119
night i just kept doing it yeah and and

00:38:15.119 --> 00:38:16.480
people were like talk about it on stage

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.400
that night yeah yeah did you for sure

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.480
yeah there was a night the night i got

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.320
fired i went and did a show and ari it

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.640
was me and ari on stage talking about it

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.240
it was pretty cool it was fun but then

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.680
of course there's reporters going to

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:30.320
shows recording everything you say

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.200
posting it posting articles about it is

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.520
like damn how long was that happening

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.200
that was probably about a month but it

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.800
still sticks with you coming to f it

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.800
still sticks with you so now like

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.640
and like on stage i'd see people like

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:43.760
talking to each other because that's

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.760
what happens in clubs like people talk

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.119
at the table and i'd be like are they

00:38:47.119 --> 00:38:48.000
[ __ ]

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.079
talking [ __ ] like it's just in your head

00:38:50.079 --> 00:38:51.520
for so long where you're like everybody

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:53.280
hates me it's a negative thing a

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:54.880
negative thing yeah which is not good to

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.960
have on stage no to like look out to a

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.119
crowd of people and be like half them

00:38:59.119 --> 00:39:01.680
hate me right yeah it's wild but nobody

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.920
ever nobody said one thing to my face

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.800
ever no never you've never had anyone

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.040
come up to you no no one's low back no

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.079
one has ever

00:39:10.079 --> 00:39:12.400
in person come up and be like [ __ ] you

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.680
ever

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.280
so

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.640
it's how it works yeah everybody just

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.160
tweets and then when they see you in

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.079
person they're like oh hey how are you

00:39:20.079 --> 00:39:22.000
these fake [ __ ] yeah but that was

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.839
another thing that i like

00:39:23.839 --> 00:39:25.839
i understand because i have a podcast

00:39:25.839 --> 00:39:28.160
when i was an open miker in philly

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.240
trashing everybody every single comedian

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.160
i'd be like oh they [ __ ] suck i'm

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.839
[ __ ] better than that like all the

00:39:33.839 --> 00:39:35.680
time so like

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.960
when people would do that to me i'd be

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.480
like all right i get it i understand i

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.800
know i know the place of like insecurity

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.400
that comes from to like trash another

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.440
comic on your podcast it's just you know

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.760
yeah so like i get it i don't no hard

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.079
feelings towards any of them either

00:39:50.079 --> 00:39:51.200
so

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.280
like creatively and strategically how

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.599
has this changed you and because you

00:39:55.599 --> 00:39:57.760
obviously pivoted and

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.560
you've moved right forward so what

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:03.119
you know do you work a different way now

00:40:03.119 --> 00:40:04.400
do you no

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.839
so what it what did it do did it

00:40:05.839 --> 00:40:08.160
motivate you more in the long run do you

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.760
think it's

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.280
yeah i would i would assume it mo

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.640
because i don't know how else i would

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.720
have been if i did or didn't get it

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.240
would you have done these sketches and

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.240
stuff that you do now had it not been

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.280
for

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.839
this whole snl i don't think so i think

00:40:21.839 --> 00:40:24.560
if i got if i didn't even get offered

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.119
snl nobody would have ever looked into

00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:29.280
my podcast or tried to get me in trouble

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.640
because that was like one of the few

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.000
jobs i could have gotten where people

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.160
were like look at how shitty this guy is

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.000
um listen i probably would have been

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.119
doing

00:40:37.119 --> 00:40:39.520
acting like tv [ __ ] and all that because

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.920
at the time i was i was getting a lot

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.520
you were of auditions and stuff like

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.880
that so yeah i probably would have just

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.640
been in shows

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.560
you know but do you find like for

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:52.160
instance with your special right now

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.319
that's out on what your youtube yeah

00:40:54.319 --> 00:40:55.119
right

00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:57.359
do you find do you prefer it that way

00:40:57.359 --> 00:40:58.720
that you just

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.240
did you even try to shop it around did

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.160
you just say it was funny it might not

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.000
either yeah my agents were like let's

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.520
let's hold off on this let's try to shop

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.119
this to like hbo or netflix i was like

00:41:07.119 --> 00:41:08.400
they're not going to [ __ ] buy it

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.160
right nobody's going to buy this for and

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.400
also it's going to be a year of emails

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.880
back and forth and [ __ ] for to get a

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.400
no then this [ __ ] could have been up a

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.800
year ago yeah yeah of course uh and the

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.480
goal is just put it out on youtube and

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.480
hopefully the next special gets picked

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.079
up right you know right because at this

00:41:24.079 --> 00:41:26.240
point now i kind of have to prove that

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.839
i'm good

00:41:27.839 --> 00:41:30.079
you know a lot of times

00:41:30.079 --> 00:41:31.359
uh

00:41:31.359 --> 00:41:33.040
they just kind of pick you they tap you

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.319
they're like all right this is our guy

00:41:34.319 --> 00:41:35.760
we're going to put him on comedy central

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.960
on hbo

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.280
whereas now i kind of have to make my

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.280
own stuff and be like here's a body of

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.160
work

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.800
now can i be on something

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.119
um and that's a cool route to go alright

00:41:47.119 --> 00:41:48.960
it is but even if you can't be on these

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.400
other things yeah those are places you

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.280
can be of course and youtube is a viable

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.680
place to be of course honestly you're

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.359
probably getting more views on your

00:41:57.359 --> 00:41:59.599
sketches there than snl is certainly you

00:41:59.599 --> 00:42:00.800
know

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.440
i don't know about views compared to nbc

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.240
but

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.240
i i would say it's probably competitive

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.480
to be honest i hope that'd be nice but

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.480
uh it used to be when you pitched shows

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.280
it was um well we're cable we don't have

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.119
a lot of money it was all that [ __ ]

00:42:15.119 --> 00:42:16.880
and then yeah yeah well i remember being

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.400
in a meeting one time and somebody said

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.720
that i was like well can you what what

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:24.480
uh networks can do your kids know

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.800
what what network is your kid watching

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.680
they're not watching nbc abc cbs or

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.839
[ __ ] fox they're watching nickelodeon

00:42:31.839 --> 00:42:34.079
they're watching mtv they're watching

00:42:34.079 --> 00:42:35.359
all these other things so get the [ __ ]

00:42:35.359 --> 00:42:36.800
out of here with that k boy you are

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.000
where all the money is yeah

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.680
yeah i mean

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.480
youtube's yeah it's perfectly like i

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.160
think the views i would get on youtube

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.240
versus if i sold my special to like a

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.319
streaming service is definitely better

00:42:50.319 --> 00:42:51.760
definitely better and in the long term

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:52.720
like

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.640
getting i don't know how much money if i

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:55.520
would have sold it to a streaming

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.359
service you get like 40 grand or

00:42:57.359 --> 00:42:59.280
something i have no idea did you ever

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.960
read the fine print that appears when

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.520
you start browsing in incognito mode it

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.280
says that your activity might still be

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.200
visible to your employer your school or

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.960
your internet service provider how can

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.440
they call it incognito to really stop

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.599
people from seeing the sites you visit

00:43:13.599 --> 00:43:15.359
you need to do what i do and use

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:18.079
expressvpn think about all the times you

00:43:18.079 --> 00:43:20.720
used wi-fi at a coffee shop or a hotel

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.480
or even at your parents house with that

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.800
expressvpn every site you visit could be

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.560
logged by the admin of that network and

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.720
that's still true even when you're in

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.880
incognito mode i mean do you really want

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.000
your parents to see what you've been

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
looking at you definitely don't what's

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.599
more your home internet provider can

00:43:35.599 --> 00:43:37.520
also see and record your browsing data

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.760
in the us they're legally allowed to

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.640
sell that data to advertisers expressvpn

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.839
network data and re-routes it through a

00:43:45.839 --> 00:43:47.839
network of secure servers so that your

00:43:47.839 --> 00:43:50.480

peer-to-peer you don't need that

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.160
[ __ ] anymore and what's nice is when

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:07.599
you put like the special i put on

00:46:07.599 --> 00:46:10.000
youtube it's just it's shared by every

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.079
comedian everybody's

00:46:12.079 --> 00:46:14.319
pulling for each other and it's it's

00:46:14.319 --> 00:46:15.680
pretty nice it's less competitive

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.920
because i would imagine i've only i've

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:19.280
only been this is the first special ever

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.400
put out i've only been kind of

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.319
headlining within this

00:46:22.319 --> 00:46:24.720
era of comedy i would imagine before

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.520
when like four guys got a special a year

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.520
it was pretty [ __ ] cutthroat and

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.040
comedians would probably be like ah [ __ ]

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:33.839
that guy right [ __ ] this now who could

00:46:33.839 --> 00:46:36.240
who could be mad that i put a youtube

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.079
special out right no anybody can do it

00:46:38.079 --> 00:46:39.680
anyone can do it so

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.200
it's not like i'm taking someone's spot

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.640
i'm just like there was room for all of

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.119
us before sure there was yeah there's so

00:46:45.119 --> 00:46:46.800
much more room for all of us with the

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.280
internet now yeah i mean there's so much

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:51.200
and if you don't like it [ __ ] move on

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.119
yeah there's plenty more for you to see

00:46:53.119 --> 00:46:54.400
of course

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.880
so nice man i i you know i'm i really

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.200
think it's impressive and uh

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.119
you know you've had to dig out of quite

00:47:01.119 --> 00:47:04.640
a hole yeah and to keep your focus yeah

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.400
and to stay positive like what did you

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.680
what are some of the things you did to

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:11.839
stay positive during that time

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.599
nothing

00:47:13.599 --> 00:47:16.400
i'm pretty negative

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.560
literally nothing

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.400
stand up that's it but what gate see

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.240
that's the only thing through my hardest

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.400
times like i remember

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.400
splitting from my daughter's mom and

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.319
stuff and just freaking out about losing

00:47:28.319 --> 00:47:30.240
feeling like i'm gonna lose my kid and

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:33.119
oh man and it was stand up it was not i

00:47:33.119 --> 00:47:34.400
mean it didn't matter whether i was on

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:37.359
that stage for 12 minutes or an hour

00:47:37.359 --> 00:47:40.160
for whatever reason none of my troubles

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:43.040
go through my mind none of them none not

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:45.359
one and i'm like man that's the only

00:47:45.359 --> 00:47:47.920
place i'm 100 free is up there where i

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:49.520
don't think about the [ __ ] in my

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:50.319
life

00:47:50.319 --> 00:47:52.079
that's [ __ ] crazy how do i how do i

00:47:52.079 --> 00:47:53.760
get that time to be more yeah either

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:56.160
that or drinking

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.079
yeah yeah you could just drink right out

00:47:58.079 --> 00:47:59.839
of that

00:47:59.839 --> 00:48:01.520

where you're like oh this is it's

00:49:19.599 --> 00:49:21.280

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.119
you really [ __ ] with you but when are

00:49:25.119 --> 00:49:26.640
the moments that would get to you it's

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.200
almost like it's almost like when

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:30.880
you're depressed like you don't realize

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.000
it until you're done right that's what

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:32.880
i'm saying like i didn't i didn't

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.720
realize it until like recently how

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.240
[ __ ] up like

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.319
and it's still it's still

00:49:38.319 --> 00:49:39.520
what do you look back and see you

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.119
mentioned seeing yourself on it after

00:49:41.119 --> 00:49:42.880
yeah you're just saying like a clip or

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.079
something yeah where i'm like oh i'm

00:49:44.079 --> 00:49:45.760
definitely

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:46.800
different

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.520
uh it affects like relationships

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:51.040
for sure like all of a sudden the only

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:55.040
thing i cared about was stand-up versus

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.359
other you know it it [ __ ] you up i

00:49:57.359 --> 00:49:58.800
don't know how else to it's almost

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.480
impossible to describe to anybody that

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:02.400
hasn't

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.319
experienced yeah

00:50:04.319 --> 00:50:05.520

yeah i don't know you do it's it's it's

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.319
exactly like being like depressed where

00:50:08.319 --> 00:50:10.319
you like while you're in it i was kind

00:50:10.319 --> 00:50:12.160
of like blocking it out i was like

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.119

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:06.720
then of course

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.240
it's funny because i have fans now so

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.520
like if somebody tweets at me or just

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.200

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.200
saying the n word like two years ago

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.280
and it's like shut the [ __ ] up you idiot

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.720
right yeah i don't think people

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:20.400
understand how this works

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:23.200
like if you throw stones like that if

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:24.720
you're like hey look at what this guy

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:26.319

just going to look what you've done yeah

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.480
let me go back through you're so here's

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:32.480
10 minutes of you screaming the n-word

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:35.599
on a podcast you [ __ ] dunks yeah yeah

00:51:35.599 --> 00:51:37.920
yeah so i try not to i try not to do

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:40.079
that to people i try not to be like hey

00:51:40.079 --> 00:51:41.680
look at this but

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:44.160
everyone smile i'll get someone

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.760
you know

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.920
do you think it motivated you in a way

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.160
to to

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:52.559
to do more

00:51:52.559 --> 00:51:54.240
yeah definitely i mean

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.160
it's hard because i

00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:57.599
i talked to

00:51:57.599 --> 00:51:59.440
some comics about this

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.599
i talked to louis about this louis ck

00:52:01.599 --> 00:52:03.359
about like how i was like well now i

00:52:03.359 --> 00:52:05.440
want to prove myself like i was like i

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:07.280
want to prove that people were a that

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.040
they were right to pick me because that

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:10.400
was kind of a

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.760
that was kind of a prevailing theme

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.359
where people would be like

00:52:13.359 --> 00:52:15.359
he would have never done well there this

00:52:15.359 --> 00:52:17.520
was a mistake all that stuff

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.119
uh so there's a part where you like want

00:52:19.119 --> 00:52:21.280
to prove them wrong and be good

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:23.040
and uh he was like you don't have to

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.240
don't he's like you don't have to prove

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.720
anything you do it for yourself

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.160
so like i've tried to i've tried to

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.280
adopt that

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.880
like i'm not trying to prove prove

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:33.359
proved what to who that's what you do

00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:35.599
yes that's kind of all it is yeah and uh

00:52:35.599 --> 00:52:36.559
yeah

00:52:36.559 --> 00:52:38.559
do you see yourself if i hate talking

00:52:38.559 --> 00:52:40.319
seriously about anything you have to

00:52:40.319 --> 00:52:42.319
this is tough dude that's hard very

00:52:42.319 --> 00:52:44.880
comfortable i want to know um do you see

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:47.440
yourself acting again in other things if

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:49.680
the opportunity presents itself are you

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.040
interested or are you just like yeah

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:52.720
that's sour i'd like to do that i'd like

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:54.559
to do that but i'm not i i would imagine

00:52:54.559 --> 00:52:56.400
it's not going to be on like a sitcom or

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.559
like a family show so hopefully it would

00:52:58.559 --> 00:53:01.119
just be a project that would

00:53:01.119 --> 00:53:03.200
again be with like my friends which is

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.559

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:18.240
making it ourselves and then why not

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:19.839
right yeah and we don't have to listen

00:53:19.839 --> 00:53:22.079

00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:27.119
[ __ ] garbage that's why it's so bad

00:58:27.119 --> 00:58:28.640
dude

00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:30.880
there are some sketches that are very

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:32.400
good and i know the people that work

00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:33.920
there that are very

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:37.280
very funny talented people but

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:38.960
you know it's rehearsed it's on national

00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.400
television it's

00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:42.240
it's like it's live so of course it's

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:44.720
gonna be clunky and they've given i

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:47.200
think they've stopped trying to

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:48.240
i don't know lauren said something

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.760
interesting where he was like

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.040
everybody's favorite is when they were

00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:52.160
in high school

00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:53.280
that's when they're like that's when it

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.559
was funny and that's always been the

00:58:54.559 --> 00:58:56.960
case and now i think recently

00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:58.640
it's even more so because now it's even

00:58:58.640 --> 00:58:59.920
it's even

00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:01.760
way more political i believe than it

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:03.599
used to be you know

00:59:03.599 --> 00:59:04.880
like it felt like they used to make fun

00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:07.359

01:01:26.799 --> 01:01:28.240
i was talking to some comics about this

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.400
the other night too like that happened a

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.400
while ago that had to be it was like one

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.319

hollywood uh does their tours when they

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:46.960
stop in front of the laugh factory it's

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.559
not like you'll see committee go this is

01:01:48.559 --> 01:01:52.000
where michael richards is

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.680
not this is where you could see blah

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.599
blah blah when i saw the stage last

01:01:55.599 --> 01:01:57.599
night for the first time i was like

01:01:57.599 --> 01:01:59.359
there's the balcony there it is that's

01:01:59.359 --> 01:02:01.440
it there it is that's where kramer went

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:04.160
down and went nuts and so he had like he

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:06.319
had to go he went on tv and like on

01:02:06.319 --> 01:02:08.559
letterman and like cried kind of and

01:02:08.559 --> 01:02:09.839
apologize which i'm not judging him

01:02:09.839 --> 01:02:12.400
because i understand the stress of that

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.280
uh but he he was already famous right so

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:17.359
he had a lot to lose he did and he was

01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:19.200
losing it you could watch him lose it

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.200
like with me i didn't lose anything so

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.240
it was a little easier like your

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.319
american express contract didn't yeah i

01:02:24.319 --> 01:02:28.240
didn't even know yeah i had zero dollars

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.720
i had zero dollars

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:33.359
yeah yeah so i wasn't like oh my life's

01:02:33.359 --> 01:02:35.520
in shambles i was like no i'm still

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.960
living in a hallway in queens yeah

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.720
back to i was like wow that was a crazy

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.960
week

01:02:44.079 --> 01:02:46.240
what a week in comedy back to where i

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:50.079
was last week last week yeah yeah

01:02:50.079 --> 01:02:51.920
man and but i'm saying it's impressive

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:54.559
that it didn't [ __ ] derail you and

01:02:54.559 --> 01:02:57.039
yeah well i think i think one thing it

01:02:57.039 --> 01:02:58.400
could have done is i could have leaned

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.640
into being like a [ __ ] free speech

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:03.359
guy and like i'm i am right wing i am

01:03:03.359 --> 01:03:04.880
like you know what i mean and that could

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.640
have been very lucrative but yeah that's

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.160
not who i am i wasn't going to become

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.440
like a and there's nothing wrong with

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.039
being free speech because free speech is

01:03:11.039 --> 01:03:14.559
important yeah obviously but like

01:03:14.559 --> 01:03:16.079
it's not going to be your mantra movie

01:03:16.079 --> 01:03:16.720
no

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.640
i think it's i think as soon as you get

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:21.520
sucked in to being like if i if i like

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.520
let being canceled define who i was and

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.240
like

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.760
talked about it i mean i talked about on

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.000
every [ __ ] pocket but

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.160
if you let it like consume who you are

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.760
and what you're creating that's how you

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:32.640
lose

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:33.760
you know what i mean that's like

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:36.160
actually getting canceled meanwhile the

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.480
only way to not get canceled is to just

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.640
keep moving and keep doing comedy

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:42.640
because that's what my [ __ ] job is

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.559
that's it like if i let that consume me

01:03:44.559 --> 01:03:47.359
and i was like every day i was like

01:03:47.359 --> 01:03:48.880
i don't know

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:51.039
you know what i mean yeah of course yeah

01:03:51.039 --> 01:03:53.280
um so i didn't tell you this before we

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.720
started the show but it's something i

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.400
ask everybody their first time on the

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.359
show

01:03:57.359 --> 01:03:59.280
um especially now after everything we've

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.520
talked about um and that's advice you

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.920
would give to your 16 year old self

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.280
and it could be anything you [ __ ]

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.920
want it to be yeah but i'm curious what

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.200
sitting here through everything you've

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.640
been through now

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:14.000
going back to your 16 year old self

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.799
what would you say

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.319
uh

01:04:18.319 --> 01:04:21.599
don't cry at boot camp

01:04:21.599 --> 01:04:23.839
definitely just quit don't let everyone

01:04:23.839 --> 01:04:25.680
watch you cry

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:26.960
i mean go look

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:29.039
i'm happy with where i'm at career like

01:04:29.039 --> 01:04:31.680
in my life so everything kind of led me

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.760
to this like maybe if i went to a

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:36.000
regular d2 school played football there

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.240
i'd be a salesman in pennsylvania yeah

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:39.599
and that's fine there's nothing wrong

01:04:39.599 --> 01:04:41.119
with that but

01:04:41.119 --> 01:04:42.640
i like what i do now so kind of

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:44.160
everything

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.440
got me here

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.960
it goes the way it's supposed to go

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:48.720
maybe i'd say like sometimes everybody

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.160
in the house knows you're jerking off in

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.760
the shower

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:54.400
everybody everyone in the family knows

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.400
that was revealed to me recently what do

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.880
you mean uh my sisters were just like

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.079
you know everyone knew you were jerking

01:05:00.079 --> 01:05:02.400
off in the shower and i was like what

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.240
they're telling you like how do you guys

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.359
know they're like you're in the shower

01:05:05.359 --> 01:05:06.839
for an hour every

01:05:06.839 --> 01:05:08.480
day

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.880
so i'd let 16 years old my steps on his

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:13.280
mom i'm like he's he's jerking off in

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.880
there she's like he is not i'm like

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.400
trust me yes he is he's been in there

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.960
for 45 minutes and p.s i was 16 with a

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.880
dick he is definitely in there doing

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.400
that right now yeah i'm like how come

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.760
every time we walk in he's taking his

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.520
[ __ ] for 45 minutes but it never smells

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.640
like [ __ ]

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:28.000
never smells like [ __ ] in here he's

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.520
cranking one out yeah

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:32.000
uh yeah i don't know what would you say

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.839
what'd you go with i'm sure you've had

01:05:33.839 --> 01:05:36.079
my 16 year old self oh man i don't i

01:05:36.079 --> 01:05:37.680
don't know i don't remember mine but i

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:40.000
know 16 was when my father died so i

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.680
would definitely say

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.920
just i mean i know i would say stick

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:45.680
this [ __ ] out because it gets way far

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.839
better sure but it's going to suck for

01:05:47.839 --> 01:05:51.839
about 30 [ __ ] years oh

01:05:53.119 --> 01:05:54.720
how'd your father pass if you don't mind

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.720
me uh hard it's well

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.240
it was ruled a heart attack when he

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.160
passed but then

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:04.240
it was closed no this was 89. yeah so

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.240
years later when i turned his same age

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:09.200
42 six years ago i [ __ ] start having

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.640
all these health problems kidney stones

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:12.960
all this [ __ ] they take me in

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:15.440
it's they're thinking i have cancer all

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:18.240
this [ __ ] six months in the testing they

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.000
find out i have this like blood disease

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.400
in my legs it's called factor five light

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:23.520
and and it's

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:25.760
just my blood's prone to being thicker

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:28.799
which makes me susceptible to clots

01:06:28.799 --> 01:06:31.280
and now going back through everything

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.960
they're like there's a really good

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.960
chance that your father's death wasn't a

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.480
heart attack and it may have actually

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.799
been this because my mom doesn't have it

01:06:38.799 --> 01:06:40.960
and neither do my brothers wow so

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:43.039
there's a chance 30 some years later i

01:06:43.039 --> 01:06:44.480
find out that

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.880
his [ __ ] was yeah maybe something

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:48.240
something yeah

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:50.319
yeah so i gotta watch my [ __ ] 16 year
