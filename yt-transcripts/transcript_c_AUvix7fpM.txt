bazooka I guess once you have a bazooka

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.730
though the rules do change as soon as

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.519

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:27.900

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.470
saw the bazooka and I was like man I

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.299

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.940
videos oh [ __ ] shooting them and

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.620

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.099
out the back not to run no the [ __ ]

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.500
Stinger missiles that are on the better

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.940
like attached to the wire that they can

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.489
control what I think that's what a

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:03.900
Stinger missile is I could be wrong I

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.220
thought a stinger was the one they shot

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.109
and it had like a like a missile head

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.090
out of it now they go fat bazooka like a

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.370
skinny bazooka there's one that's like

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.680
on a tripod that is attached to a wire

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.000
it looks like it's attached to a cord

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
that the missile is actually controlled

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.430
what any I right dude I used to watch

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.650
these videos at helium like before we'd

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.090

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.520
so like slowly like hit a group of

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.530

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.639
to like see it coming

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.400

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.349

socialist dictator well just funny how

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.479

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.039
socialism does find its way and it's a

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:46.419
pretty bad plate like every time like

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.159

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:58.659
yeah they're always those points like

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:00.849
Scandinavia yeah look look at that and

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:05.650

you gotta pay the taxes well taxi forty

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.090
percent on it yeah the yeah man so they

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.220
went for this guy also okay so the

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.840
government and the CIA are claiming like

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.610
dude we had nothing to do with this but

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.170
there was an amphibious attack so these

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:35.260
dudes pulled up on Venezuela soil trying

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.580
to go get this guy in the way they

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.530
pulled it so the whole thing foiled

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:39.760
America is like no we have nothing to do

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.500
with it some dude apparently from

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.060
Florida was like yo I did that sometimes

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.940
like that was me he's like he apparently

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.800
was going around everyone being like we

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.750
got to get these guys now Venezuela has

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.370
two Americans to kind of barter

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.250
and like now you go get them I think

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.279
that we should leave those dudes there

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:01.779
well they're there apparently if they

00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:03.580

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:03.910
there

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.279
operation Gideon dude they're there to

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:08.230
free the Venezuelan people and what they

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.560
got captured then there was a guy they

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.900
think that the guy who claimed he did it

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.940
was actually working for was it was like

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.010

United States what they allege idli did

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.550
was went into like Venezuela like poor

Venezuelans were like [ __ ] yeah do that

00:09:42.339 --> 00:09:46.180

calling it could be that are like a lot

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:00.880
of people are being like it's a

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.100
Venezuelan false flag because the guy

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.230
wants to keep lockdown so they're saying

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.180

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.850
as was in lockdown yeah there's a

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:12.040
lockdown really people are say which is

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.810
weird Associated Press is like yeah well

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.130
Venezuela might be wanting to extend

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.420
their lockdown just to kind of take

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.490
advantage of their citizens anyway where

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:20.050
you're masking it's like yeah yeah yeah

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.240

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.580
unplanned and fibia it doesn't make

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:37.839
sense that there was just these random

00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:39.730
dudes who were like all right we're

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.310

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:45.730
like a pineapple Express these days yeah

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:46.959

leader event as well and they just like

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.190

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:56.260
he was like the security on Venezuela's

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.029

00:10:58.029 --> 00:11:00.760
operation Gideon got infiltrated by the

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.190
Venezuelan regime so they knew there was

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:04.510

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.840
like a suit you don't got to go full NBA

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.290
MBAs like soups or indoors yeah but if

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:25.779
we go football just yeah you can wear a

00:13:25.779 --> 00:13:28.930
hoodie yeah we really be more

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.240
appropriate than a full uniform we're

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.440
like baseball pants

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.060

some goofy throwback day you got a dress

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.520
in the same uniform it is kind of weird

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.370
it is odd and there's always been jokes

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:44.200
about that like if NFL cut like Andy

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.810
Reid had to wear like a full [ __ ]

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:49.570
skin tight NFL form for no reason

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:52.000
yeah specially when like you're whenever

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.770
someone plays football who's like not

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.810
really in shape they're like but always

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.839

that's pretty sick actually I'm making

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.339
and then I got caught I got caught

00:14:21.339 --> 00:14:23.680

locker room before the game a spaz I

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:31.390

00:14:34.089 --> 00:14:35.530
like it's always like I'm about to play

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.540
in a football game and then I forgot my

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.250
helmet or I don't have a pad or

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.200
something like that that's fun never

actually play in the game how they dress

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.100
how stress for you when the guy was like

go back and get your stuff on I was

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.640
pretty stressed cuz I just remember my

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.760
coach being like what the [ __ ] I was

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.770
like a captain it was at coin toss like

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.060
I was out at midfield and the guy was

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.380
like you're not wearing any pads go put

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.730
those on or you're not allowed to play

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:01.930

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.120
go through there there's our locker room

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:15.910

it was definite like a lazy jog and

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:24.970
probably an argument I probably lipped

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.740
off to the raft it probably mouth off

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:30.730

she would stand at the top of the

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.470
bleachers with his arms crossed he'd

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.199
stand in the top row and just dude there

00:15:44.199 --> 00:15:45.370

watch practice what are you really he

00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:49.269

00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:52.540
football practices damn yeah that's

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.459
pretty tight it actually is pretty swag

00:15:54.459 --> 00:15:55.870
he would just go out there and dip and

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:58.360
watch football practice that's probably

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.589
just trying to get out of the house I

00:15:59.589 --> 00:16:01.329

I got big news for you I just got in a

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.920
car accident right before this dude so

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.740

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:22.870
uh I was so this truck all right so it's

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:24.760
the more embarrassing part is what I was

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.980
doing I was going to buy a cord from

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.000
Best Buy for my xbox 360 so I could play

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.519
NC double-a 14 no doubt so I borrowed my

00:16:33.519 --> 00:16:35.860
mommy's car to drive to Best Buy to get

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.420
a video game cord and a truck hit me

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.760
wheeler hit her car what well so I

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.040
pulled up next to him and he was taking

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.889
a right turn an illegal right turn

00:16:46.889 --> 00:16:49.480
mm-hmm no it there was literally a sign

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.069
that said node right turns for trucks

00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:53.769
yeah at a red light so I figured he was

00:16:53.769 --> 00:16:55.149
turning left cuz he was already kind of

00:16:55.149 --> 00:16:57.040
in the left part of the lane because he

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.600
was he was giving himself a room to take

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.100
it right I didn't know that no turn

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.410

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:03.880
up inside of him because I was gonna

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.850

1774 dude this guy was saying that like

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.370
there was a battalion or something that

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:54.810

like forked and paid for it and if you

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:11.670
look at it there's people who didn't pay

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:13.740

about Panama let's not get it well I

00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:49.830
will say this this is a good thing this

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:51.960
is a good thing I one of our dogs reach

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.760
down at patreon I get a lot of people I

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.560
get a lot of the corrections on patreon

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.660
which first of all I will say and I mean

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:00.030
this is just you know I guess this is

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:01.500
just a mark of our intelligence and what

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.770
we're attracting but the a lot of times

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:05.910
when people correct us on the page

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:07.470
ground it's always very gracious they'll

00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:09.300
be like hey man you guys rule but this

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.320
one thing you guys are talking about

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.290
you're way off here's why so I mean a

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:14.820
lot of the dogs argue on first

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.010
principles it's just you know if you're

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:18.450
if you're a person using mental models

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:19.920
you don't just like lash out you just go

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.569
like well here's what I know to be true

00:35:21.569 --> 00:35:23.910
you know you you attribute people

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:25.980
shortcomings not to malice but just do

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.569
general misstep that's that's what a

00:35:27.569 --> 00:35:29.339
person of you know more refined person

00:35:29.339 --> 00:35:31.410
does so someone reached out and he was

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:33.900
like a man you're wrong about de Blasio

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:37.890

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:40.349

but and this you know again I told him

00:35:44.039 --> 00:35:45.119
I'm like I'm on the side of the truth

00:35:45.119 --> 00:35:47.970
bro de Blasio gave the permit to that

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:50.010
function that he shut down of those two

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:51.390
thousand Jewish Jews he or his office

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:55.260
he went and shut it down just to look

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.900

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:29.280
losing it yeah dude I was in the I think

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.220
I was watching like a panty job bit I

00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:33.510
was getting in a painting jobs dude

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:36.420
paint it was just that cell tap that was

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:38.310
there you go into like way long long

00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:42.000

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.380
like just resume resume the operation

00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:49.530
dude and then it was like I was getting

00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:51.290
backed up to the point of having like

00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:53.790
stutter rope so being like

00:54:53.790 --> 00:54:56.850
oh that's the best yeah man but then it

00:54:56.850 --> 00:54:59.190
was like the problem is like I'll have I

00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:01.230
know I have stutter ropes in me and then

00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:03.960
it's like I just look scrolling pornhub

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.790
and it's like my soul just [ __ ] dies

00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:08.220
and was like Jesus [ __ ] the stutter

00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.260
ropes I I never get the stutter ups from

00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:12.510
jerking off that's usually it actually

00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:15.390
it's usually explicitly for a beach not

00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:17.070
from a beach it's a guaranteed stutter

00:55:17.070 --> 00:55:25.800
rub it's like well yeah usually like

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:27.480

really what I don't know dude I got a I

00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:39.630
the only thing I've been thinking about

00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:42.150
today is somehow recapturing the 3-way

00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:44.700

I need that again time yeah I mean that

00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:50.990
would be something you can get used to

00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:53.100
you put in headphones and have one in

00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:54.530

was thought therapy was pretty gay I did

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:03.269
I did therapy once I told you this I

01:08:03.269 --> 01:08:04.500
went in once and the guy was like what

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:05.759
do you wanna do with your life cuz it

01:08:05.759 --> 01:08:08.069
was like right out of freshman year at

01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:09.089
college it was right after I quit

01:08:09.089 --> 01:08:12.040
football little bummed out

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:16.440
sit in a healthy like 320 pounds yelling

01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:22.810
who's wild depressed this flop and he

01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:24.100
was like what do you want to do with

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.800
your life and I was like I kind of want

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:28.000
to be a stand-up comedian and he was

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.980
like well you can't make money doing

01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:31.570
comedy what do you really want to do and

01:08:31.570 --> 01:08:35.500
I was just like I [ __ ] this guy he was

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:36.730
like I know some people that do it as

01:08:36.730 --> 01:08:38.470
like a hobby you could do that but like

01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:40.990
you need to start focusing on I mean

01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:42.520
realistically he was giving good advice

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:45.460
to 99 percent of time he would have been

01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:47.290
right what was this guy's therapist like

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:48.250
a school counselor

01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:50.020
I just [ __ ] know I think it was a

01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:51.550
therapist I don't know that's bad

01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:53.080
practice you're never supposed to advise

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:54.670
dispense cuz you know you're not that

01:08:54.670 --> 01:08:56.380
person so for him that's bad advice but

01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:58.030
never yeah well I knew it suck this is

01:08:58.030 --> 01:08:59.440
what you do bro you're supposed to sit

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:00.970
there and be like okay why do you think

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.830
you want it all he did was try to

01:09:02.830 --> 01:09:06.370
prescribe me antidepressants so he was

01:09:06.370 --> 01:09:07.930
like you're not funny here's Olaf get

01:09:07.930 --> 01:09:12.340
out I never went back I went to one

01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:13.720
meeting and he was like I don't know if

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:15.040
you should try to do stand-up and I was

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:18.850
just like well that well I'm gonna yeah

01:09:18.850 --> 01:09:20.950
dude I actually was told the same thing

01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:23.140
when I was you know my arm got twisted

01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:26.230
into doing uh during my first marriage

01:09:26.230 --> 01:09:27.640
my arm got twisted in a marriage a

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.380
couple of couples counseling and so you

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:31.000
had to do a group so it was me and her

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.740
in the couples counselor and I was just

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:34.360
like yeah not I'm not feeling this I'm

01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:35.920
out and then they're like all right well

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:36.760
I'm gonna meet with you guys

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:38.230
individually and then when I come back

01:09:38.230 --> 01:09:40.690
to do like a you know a check-in so I

01:09:40.690 --> 01:09:42.370
went by myself and I was just basically

01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:45.070
like [ __ ] this she's like what do you

01:09:45.070 --> 01:09:46.000

don't understand like I need you to

01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:49.510
explain to her that this is done she was

01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:52.180
like no I'm not doing that but was then

01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:53.530
she can't she's doing the same thing sex

so what do you do you do stand-up yeah I

01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:57.730

01:09:57.730 --> 01:09:59.140

great podcast yeah contact also you

01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:00.280
[ __ ] it all so dad made also all of

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:03.010
them but uh that's the only three I can

01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:07.870
think of but uh uh Michael Jordan would

01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:09.370
literally like he'd have like a bad game

01:11:09.370 --> 01:11:11.290
and somebody would always end up saying

01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:13.060
something to him like on another team

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:16.240
would be like nice game Mike spaz out

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.730
kill them the next game like every

01:11:18.730 --> 01:11:20.440
single time someone was like I think

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:25.120
Michael Jordan lost his step you just do

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:28.210
you rely - he relied entirely on either

01:11:28.210 --> 01:11:30.790
actual slights or self like perceived

01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:32.770
slights yeah like a coach from another

01:11:32.770 --> 01:11:34.060
team one night they were out to dinner

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:36.460
during a series during the layoff series

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:38.650
so they had like four or five more games

01:11:38.650 --> 01:11:40.060
to play against each other after the

01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:42.100
game one he had a bad game and the other

01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:43.720
team's coach was at the restaurant and

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:45.400
did it say hi to him he just left and

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:46.900
did say hi to Michael Jordan yeah

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:49.600
Michael join was just like I make

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:53.530
[ __ ] kill them because like some

01:11:53.530 --> 01:11:55.630
coach didn't say Idol he's like the

01:11:55.630 --> 01:11:57.010
disrespect is insane

01:11:57.010 --> 01:11:58.510
so that was refuel the dunk from the

01:11:58.510 --> 01:12:00.780
foul line Asim be like [ __ ] and

01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:03.160
literally his entire career was fueled

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:09.040

like wood they were just

01:13:02.710 --> 01:13:04.750
ultra-competitive his brothers were like

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:06.639
psychos competitive and his dad would be

01:13:06.639 --> 01:13:08.230
like out working on a car or something

01:13:08.230 --> 01:13:11.080
and Michael like he wouldn't be able to

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.480
get the correct tool he liked it and

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:15.340

[ __ ] foul and it's kind of nice to

01:13:32.619 --> 01:13:35.199
think about how years of compiled hatred

01:13:35.199 --> 01:13:37.270
just propelled his muscles to fly

01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:41.980
through the air dunk a ball from where

01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:44.560

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:49.260
one says that to me with the women

01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:53.800
constant minor slights led to just the

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.960
greatest athlete of all time and you

01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:57.869

sweatshops in it you just built 10

01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:18.880
daiquiris that's what I loved about the

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.650
movie vice that was my favorite part of

01:14:20.650 --> 01:14:22.330
the movie advice when Dick Cheney was

01:14:22.330 --> 01:14:25.389
like [ __ ] up on power lines in Wyoming

01:14:25.389 --> 01:14:27.070
like getting duis and being a loser

01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:30.070
his wife was like are you gonna become

01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:31.960
somebody good or am I gonna have to

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:34.840
[ __ ] leave you and he was like I'll

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.360
become pretty good he destroyed the

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:40.300
world instantly was like I'm gonna build

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:43.510
an empire it happened the guy we used to

01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:45.400
work I used to work for and my brother

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.260
and my cousin and my other brother we

01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:48.460
all like work for this guy at one point

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:50.080
he had a property management company in

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:50.500
Philly

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.030
he was a

01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:55.360
when he was I think like 30 he just was

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:56.619
like trying to buy houses and like every

01:14:56.619 --> 01:14:57.880
other [ __ ] be like I want to buy in

01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:01.480
flip houses and it wasn't going so well

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:04.090
his wife left him same thing his wife

01:15:04.090 --> 01:15:06.550
was like I'm ha balance on him and then

01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:08.320
he just secured that I think he got a

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:09.820
line of credit something happened where

01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:11.949
he secured the bag enough to buy like a

01:15:11.949 --> 01:15:13.780
couple houses and get it going now he

01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:16.690
owns I think like oh man it's something

01:15:16.690 --> 01:15:18.880
like 3,000 units in Philadelphia alone

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.289
oh he's a billionaire

01:15:20.289 --> 01:15:21.550
we used to shovel it was a guy I think I

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:22.480
talked about before we used to shovel

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:24.309
his driveway so he wouldn't let us use

01:15:24.309 --> 01:15:25.719
salt we would shovel all of his

01:15:25.719 --> 01:15:27.880
properties and then we'd he at the end

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:28.929
of the night or the beginning in the

01:15:28.929 --> 01:15:30.579
morning really they would drive us and

01:15:30.579 --> 01:15:32.110
pickup trucks to his house and like it

01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:34.059
would be like just a legion of dudes

01:15:34.059 --> 01:15:36.190
would just shovel his big winding

01:15:36.190 --> 01:15:37.929
driveway on Main Line we weren't allowed

01:15:37.929 --> 01:15:39.400
to use salt or anything on the driveways

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:43.539
anyone mess it up and then he he got his

01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:45.280
bay left him and he used that power to

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.469
succeed they succeed I mean he he became

01:15:47.469 --> 01:15:50.320
a billionaire and his son it was like

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:54.070
but at the time was like probably five

01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:56.500
five years old maybe five or six and he

01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:57.940
would just come on this site Nick I can

01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:01.150
fire you I can fire you ha ha ha it

01:16:01.150 --> 01:16:03.730

01:16:03.730 --> 01:16:06.159
sit he would sit on like my dad or my

01:16:06.159 --> 01:16:07.389
brothers laugh when they're doing the

01:16:07.389 --> 01:16:09.400
excavator and there was like I sit there

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:10.989

yes that is my uh I do I do tend to

01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:31.539
agree with that school of thought like I

01:16:31.539 --> 01:16:34.780
like I love when people use hate to fuel

01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:37.869
them to do really good things yeah I'm a

01:16:37.869 --> 01:16:39.639
big fan of that I think it's very funny

01:16:39.639 --> 01:16:41.980
it's good I was totally unhealthy it

01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:46.559
really results in nothing but disasters

01:16:46.559 --> 01:16:51.099
like an alcoholic gambler and also

01:16:51.099 --> 01:16:52.960
Michael Jordan's like the one example of

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:55.719
when it went well yeah and he's still

01:16:55.719 --> 01:16:57.280
kind of a piece of [ __ ] like he was like

01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:01.329
mean to everybody but the guys like like

01:17:01.329 --> 01:17:03.219
you know created great guys like Dick

01:17:03.219 --> 01:17:05.920
Cheney Michael Jordan yep I think

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:11.260
found out art school yes now this is

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:14.110
gonna happen oh god yeah there is

01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:15.969
something to be said for that people

01:17:15.969 --> 01:17:18.850
just being like [ __ ] this yeah people

01:17:18.850 --> 01:17:21.489
people responding to failure by being an

01:17:21.489 --> 01:17:25.300
absolute tyrant so [ __ ] he's apparently

01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:27.219
worse unless we just like have the

01:17:27.219 --> 01:17:29.350
blinders pull it off us a lot of the

01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:31.390
countries are falling under the rule of

01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:33.489
people who are like now getting around

01:17:33.489 --> 01:17:35.440
there

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.650
you know democratic time window of

01:17:37.650 --> 01:17:39.910
running like that whole four years thing

01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:41.350
is starting to fade that was an idea

01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:43.300

01:20:18.730 --> 01:20:22.120
President I'll be next I can call do

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:25.210
theirs so I do blankets right I read all

01:20:25.210 --> 01:20:26.920
the like blankie allows you to kind of

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:29.440
read or you do audiobooks it'll take it

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:30.790
audiobook and give it to you in 15

01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:32.410
minutes like the core thing distill down

01:20:32.410 --> 01:20:34.540
so every morning I wake I don't remember

01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:35.830
any of nice listening like little things

01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:38.080
stick with me but the one of the books

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:41.080
was talking about how it's called I

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:42.340
figured I think it's called like super

01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:44.020
mind again I don't know if I'd read it

01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:45.610
cuz it didn't it wasn't all that cool

01:20:45.610 --> 01:20:48.460
but yeah or super thinking or something

01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:50.260
but they were talking about how you

01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:51.520
should always inverse everything

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:52.660
everything you think and believe you

01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:54.430
always in you got to always be inverse

01:20:54.430 --> 01:20:56.650
in yourself so I started doing inverse

01:20:56.650 --> 01:20:58.390
thinking I've been reading The Economist

01:20:58.390 --> 01:21:00.730
or whatever and there they were talking

01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:02.620
about how so there's an article about

01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:04.960
how they're saying like our election

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.460
system is so up for like there's so many

01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:07.780
bugs and it's so many gaps for the

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:09.190
Russians of sneaking and they they

01:21:09.190 --> 01:21:12.310
claimed that the Russians thought

01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:14.080
Hillary was gonna win and then

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:16.300
infiltrated it to then so then provide

01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:18.520
the proof that the thing got rigged so

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:20.050
they were going to infiltrate the a like

01:21:20.050 --> 01:21:22.390
the election and then say like hey some

01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:24.400
the Americans rigged Hillary rigged eggs

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.050
they thought she was gonna win but then

01:21:26.050 --> 01:21:28.540
Trump won so and I was laughing so I'm

01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:30.520
doing you know I'm inversely I'm like

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:32.190
that would be so [ __ ] funny cuz

01:21:32.190 --> 01:21:33.690
I might do people [ __ ] hate Trump

01:21:33.690 --> 01:21:35.790
what's their problem with them if you

01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:38.760
look at it from their side it's like he

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:41.370
got elected and then the like the

01:21:41.370 --> 01:21:42.810
Russians metal or whatever and then

01:21:42.810 --> 01:21:44.160
they're people like hey we had this out

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:45.450
the Russians from meddling they're like

01:21:45.450 --> 01:21:47.270
destroy our democracy and he's like no

01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:51.600
[ __ ] fake face election it is funny

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:53.100
the thing about yeah like no he's

01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:55.040
literally destroying our democracy

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:57.570
[ __ ] fake they just and they can't

01:21:57.570 --> 01:22:00.960

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:04.170
winning no he was doing really well I

01:22:04.170 --> 01:22:06.540

01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:12.120
just in versing the real political

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:14.100
position that I think he's funny

01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:16.230
of course that's the only people there's

01:22:16.230 --> 01:22:19.050
only one little logical way to look at

01:22:19.050 --> 01:22:20.160
anything right now and it's just like

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.030

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:32.739
that Navy SEALs snuck into a guy's house

01:28:32.739 --> 01:28:34.450
at night and shot him in the head for

01:28:34.450 --> 01:28:35.890
sure my favorite things that we've done

01:28:35.890 --> 01:28:39.430
but they should make a movie about hey

01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:41.170
he had a wild he had a wild time too

01:28:41.170 --> 01:28:44.110
yeah he's living in caves eluding

01:28:44.110 --> 01:28:47.680
capture trail from a merely if I was not

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:52.780
American I could see I could see being

01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:54.790
like I don't know both suicides did a

01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:57.160
lot of fucked-up things and he was kind

01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:02.110
of the underdog he's not real if I lived

01:29:02.110 --> 01:29:03.730
in any country besides America and some

01:29:03.730 --> 01:29:04.870

01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:15.190
imagine if bin Laden was attacking China

01:29:15.190 --> 01:29:17.080
if he was blowing up buildings in China

01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:19.270

kind of rules huh yeah big time

01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:24.280

like people shoulder-to-shoulder it's

01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.910
like people just get launched into the

01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:55.210
air it's like it's not stick imagine

01:33:55.210 --> 01:33:56.410
back in the day when they were having a

01:33:56.410 --> 01:33:57.040
rough time

01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:58.840
that's a real rough time imagine what

01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:01.090
having a rough time imagine before they

01:34:01.090 --> 01:34:02.770
had cable news and you know I guess now

01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:04.360
they have their version of like cable TV

01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:06.430
and stuff or like the new yeah back then

01:34:06.430 --> 01:34:07.870
like you just lived on a farm and some

01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:09.280
guy could just bend your ear and be like

01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:11.020
yo bro you want to go to heaven that's

01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:13.840
what you got to do and you're like yeah

01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:15.520
it's better than the farm farm sucks

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:17.770
okay I don't know if you knew you never

01:34:17.770 --> 01:34:19.270
had a book you never had all your

01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:21.070
knowledge relies on people being like yo

01:34:21.070 --> 01:34:22.210
guess what kid who are older than you

01:34:22.210 --> 01:34:24.070

doing they were doing that I mean they

01:34:31.630 --> 01:34:34.390
still are to some extent using children

01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:36.520
for their suicide bomb so using like 12

01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:38.590
year old orphans yeah so they're usually

01:34:38.590 --> 01:34:40.090
they pick up like a 10 year older than

01:34:40.090 --> 01:34:42.490
your like the explosion goes outwards

01:34:42.490 --> 01:34:44.320
that's what the best is for it blows out

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:48.100
