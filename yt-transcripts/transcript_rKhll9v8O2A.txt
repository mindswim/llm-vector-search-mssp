your brother's like wives

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.920
true that would be a good backstab and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.840
you would abandon your family as well oh

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.439
with double backstabs yes you'd be the

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.200
ultimate that's a triple cross

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.720

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.680
like dump your boyfriend's wife or your

friend's wife yeah and then win your

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.079
wife back and then kill myself and then

i don't understand what's what's uh what

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.800
is the potential pushback against trying

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.040
to maintain the bod trying to maintain

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.640
nothing at all other than people

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.720
drinking people laughing at me for

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.959

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.399
on my instagram i shared a story some

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:14.160
guy just sent me a picture of himself

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.480
flexing his back it was ripped people

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.760

off i'm like dude it's excellent well

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.800
this guy's [ __ ] sure if you're taking

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.920
a picture of yourself with your shirt

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.680
off and posting it online that is it but

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.600
it was a classic back post dude it was

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.440
[ __ ] yeah i mean it's very funny if

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.120
he does it jokingly he said it was for

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.560
though it was for chat nation all right

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.000
well that's the best yes that's very

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.680
people people got pissed i was like dude

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.360
this is excellent i like that has to be

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.440
celebrated i really like i i admire

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.160
men's bodies now more than i do women

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.080
i would say yeah i've shifted and i

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.000
think that's fine yeah girls bodies are

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.200
gross dude well you think about them

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.360
it's just you you kind of you get that

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.839
your taste improves for sure you know

00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:53.920
you just get gay

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.640
yeah

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.760
that's your theory dude it's not like

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.680
i'm gonna act on it men become women

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.120
with time and women

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.120
i think that it takes a lot more work to

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.519
have a super ripped back

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:06.000
than to be in a bikini with nice boobs

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
true here's my problem with dudes that

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.279
are jacked that do nothing else

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:12.640
that's it yeah

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.440
that's like sick dude just do something

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.200
stop going to the [ __ ] gym

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.399
yeah but then you gotta do something

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:20.800
then you find the occasional guy who you

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.519
know is super jacked and he's

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:24.959
doing he's doing other stuff i like what

00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:26.240
you do is that what you're trying to get

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.040
no

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.279

lean i like to exercise but it's all be

00:10:32.959 --> 00:10:35.440
to keep my sanity yeah if i go like two

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.880
or three days without exercising i'm

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.200
starting to envision bro

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.720

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.800
my body has made

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.640
space for this my body's thirsting for

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.160
you yeah what do you think the over

under on

00:11:07.839 --> 00:11:09.920

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.200
with it you think i'll stick with it i

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.720
think it'll get easier yeah i think

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.240
you'll stick with it dude i mean it's

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.680

like look if you work out you're gay i

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.279
still maintain that

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:22.959
but i needed to get gay in order to

00:11:22.959 --> 00:11:23.920
survive

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.120
exactly if i would have kept at this

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.800
rate i would have probably passed away

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.760
soon

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.800
yeah it would have been 50s for sure 50s

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.760
i will pass away you think 50s 50s 60s

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.040

guarantee you're 71. late 60s yeah no

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.800
that's not going to think about how much

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.320
gayer you'll get

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.480
as you get older you'll get even gayer

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.839
as you get older and you'll be in you'll

00:11:49.839 --> 00:11:51.360

yeah well sorry dude my dad used to eat

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.480
four soft pretzels every single day and

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.079
if you were to be like yo how about you

00:11:58.079 --> 00:11:59.200
mix in some vegetables you would be like

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.800
the [ __ ] what are you trying to do

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.399
and he like went plant-based when he was

00:12:02.399 --> 00:12:04.639
like 60. yeah for just for like a couple

00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:06.480
months but that would have like he would

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.760
have genuinely been pissed off if

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.440
someone was like yo don't eat meat like

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.680
10 years ago what the [ __ ] yeah so

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.279
you'll get you'll get we're all just

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:15.200
getting gayer and gay yeah but if i get

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.959
gay or bitter there's one thing yeah it

00:12:16.959 --> 00:12:19.360
is gay or better gay or bitter i'm i'm

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.440
pretty bitter but

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.680
i've improved on that front

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.360
now i am becoming gay i've switched

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.440
gears from bitter to gay

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.639
and it could you know it could be

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:29.920
beneficial

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.680
this is a really interesting there's

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.360
there's really just a fork in the road i

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.200
didn't know it was two options gay or

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.560
bitter dude

man that guy

00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:48.240

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.040
die a fat king people do celebrate they

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.279

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.440
years in him it was nice to see the fat

getting ripped would you stop i would

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.000
have to stop yeah although at that point

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
i'm sure it would be too powerful if you

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.720
bulked if you bulked and just quiet

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.160

they dive back in

00:15:49.519 --> 00:15:50.880
and you gotta hum to them and let them

second night i was trying to go into it

00:16:42.079 --> 00:16:43.920
what happens a lot of the times is you

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.279
start hallucinating your immediate

00:16:45.279 --> 00:16:47.759
surroundings so i'm going like it's just

00:16:47.759 --> 00:16:49.920
nothing but demon faces and i'm like uh

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.680
like hang in there and i like finally i

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.800
thought i was getting out of it i was

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.079
like brit and then it's like i

00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:55.680
hallucinated my wife turning around

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.920

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.920
right out i got [ __ ] but dude it's

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.679
pretty sick so

00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:08.319
are you always trying to stay in longer

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:09.760
i try to go in as long as you're trying

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.520
to harness the beast i get too scared

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.439
you got to go in it's so cool it's

00:17:13.439 --> 00:17:16.000
pretty fun i i i'm alwa when i'm in it

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.640
it is always demons and sort of uh

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.199
really bad crazy because it doesn't i

00:17:21.199 --> 00:17:22.640
always i'm skeptical when i hear

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.240
everybody else's sleep paralysis because

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.000
it happened to me once

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.199
so every time someone's like i get it

00:17:27.199 --> 00:17:29.280
all the time i'm like yeah right

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.200
but then i looked it up and it only

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.280
happens to like ten percent exactly but

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.240
it happens a lot to podcast guests

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.000
i think a hundred percent of podcast

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.240
guests have it well i'm not lying i

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.840
don't think you are lying maybe maybe

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.559
it's because we were like creative guys

00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:46.400
that's very possible come on take that

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.600
back i don't maybe because we're

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.919
we're more of a left brain type more

00:17:51.919 --> 00:17:53.200
visionaries i would say we're more

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.840
visionaries very visionary type for sure

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.280
so guys

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.880

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.880

get

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.760
i agreed to work out every day i agree

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.400

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.440
in time doing a little iphone video

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.559

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.039
the skiing in maine is pretty easy right

00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:51.840
compared to like i mean it's it's not

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.200
steep or

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.679
huge the way the west is but it's icy as

00:19:55.679 --> 00:19:57.679
hell what about compared to the poconos

00:19:57.679 --> 00:19:59.679
yeah so i'm thinking that's my

00:19:59.679 --> 00:20:01.280
i think it's it's bigger

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.720
the sugarloaf is the biggest mountain in

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.320
the northeast but what about there's

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.760
something to be said about uh swimming

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.600
on artificial or skiing on artificial

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.480
snow

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.840

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.679

powder there's just so much wind and

00:20:22.159 --> 00:20:23.679

a good guy never really

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.120

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.400
anger

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.679
oh yeah and then they plow through women

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.320
of these characters and i remember i

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.600
forget what the [ __ ] it was there was

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.880
like a

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.159
early episode we were talking about

00:23:58.159 --> 00:23:59.600
there's just this guy in vegas i'll

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.279
never forget him it was on a reality

00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:03.520

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.760
on dates with girls on like tinder oh

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.919

were interested in me yeah and that's

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.440
obviously the stem of

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.840
who he became as a person right was i'm

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.039

yeah dude bo staff would be nasty man

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.000
you know what's hard just squats yeah

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.200
zero weight

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.279
well it's also hard spots are hard with

00:27:25.279 --> 00:27:27.440
some guys being like zero weight some

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.880
dudes like why your ankles turning out

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.919
like that it's like that's just with my

00:27:29.919 --> 00:27:32.080
nose he was very nice okay you weren't

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.039
he knew

00:27:33.039 --> 00:27:35.760
that this is a fragile endeavor

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.159
i can quit at any moment dude

00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:42.399
i'm very good at being like [ __ ] that

00:27:42.399 --> 00:27:44.320
it'll be good it'll be good one thing

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.840
i'm excited it should tone down the

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.360
drinking slightly

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.720
yeah because

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.919
you can't be hungover i can't be

00:27:49.919 --> 00:27:53.919
hungover for my stepping up on boxes

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.640
so you have to face the guy constantly

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.039
and have some dude being like oh boy

00:27:59.039 --> 00:28:00.080
yeah

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.640
the saddest part is is thinking

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.480
because i haven't worked out like hard

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.320
other than peloton which you've seen

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.919
you're a [ __ ] monster

00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:09.520
he's a monster on the peloton i know we

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.360
talk about it we'll get into the peloton

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.399
but

00:28:12.399 --> 00:28:14.399
it's not even like you know how in your

00:28:14.399 --> 00:28:15.679
head you're like oh i could probably do

00:28:15.679 --> 00:28:17.200
that like i've said about like when

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.520
dudes watch aren't like war movies or

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.120
like and they're like dude i could have

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.640
been special forces yeah it's like i

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.640
know i couldn't because i did one day of

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.520
boot camp and i found out quickly i have

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.120
no business near this

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.640
same thing like i've been sitting here

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.000
playing video games like i'm probably

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.919
still pretty strong

00:28:33.919 --> 00:28:35.679
and i could have kept that lie going

00:28:35.679 --> 00:28:38.000
dude it was like schroedinger's jacked i

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.919
i still think and then the second i

00:28:39.919 --> 00:28:41.600
walked into that thing i was like i'm

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.080
not even close to it's also so funny

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.000
maybe i was at they're just gaming being

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:46.880
like

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.480
take a break like i'm probably strong as

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.320
[ __ ] yeah i'm probably still

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.480
so [ __ ] strong but you but you

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.919
probably could

00:28:53.919 --> 00:28:55.840
still squat more than

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.679
no i couldn't my squats my knees are

00:28:57.679 --> 00:28:58.799
[ __ ] up

00:28:58.799 --> 00:29:00.240
yeah but if i were to burden you with a

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.159
load you'd be able to like you would you

00:29:02.159 --> 00:29:03.520
would [ __ ] up your kind of knees and

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.279
[ __ ] but you'd be able to go

00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:06.960
yeah i can probably still

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.200
but you saw we benched like five years

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.039
ago and that shit's gone too what what

00:29:11.039 --> 00:29:12.559
was your what was the thing you were

00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:14.880
best at doing today or like let's just

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.600
say

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.440
historically were you better at buying

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.159
benching bench bench so you could how

00:29:20.159 --> 00:29:22.799
many times could you put up 225 pounds

00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:24.799
right now right now

00:29:24.799 --> 00:29:26.240
you don't think you could do it one time

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.760
i bet i could not i think you probably

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.919
could double 45 i could not yeah yeah i

00:29:29.919 --> 00:29:31.279
bet you i could not that's the the

00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:33.760
combine now after a couple couple

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.360
sessions of stepping up and down on

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.960
boxing true

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.200
i might be back a couple stretches i

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.039
could be back

00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:41.840
uh

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.000
now today today was i threw a medicine

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.159
ball around that was pretty tight that

00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:47.919
made me feel like an athlete dude my

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:50.559
votes to become an absolute unit

00:29:50.559 --> 00:29:52.240
over time slowly but surely i'll see

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.039
what i can do it's uh guys this is week

00:29:55.039 --> 00:29:57.120
this is day one true this is such a what

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.880
a change of tone what do you mean

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.080
because i was saying i want to get

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.600
jacked and you're like you [ __ ]

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.200
insult first off

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.200
if i got jacked it'd be funny

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.200
i'm funny

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.399
you're not funny

00:30:10.399 --> 00:30:12.159
the reason you're funny

00:30:12.159 --> 00:30:14.399
is because of how i'm not funny yeah

00:30:14.399 --> 00:30:16.399
that's a fine with me i don't care shut

00:30:16.399 --> 00:30:17.919
up dude i don't care how

00:30:17.919 --> 00:30:19.360
this is all you got to do is just agree

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.799
with him and then he reneged on his feet

00:30:24.559 --> 00:30:26.320
it's under all that cholesterol so you

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.159

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:30.080

going to do to my kidneys that's the

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.240
thing

loading phase in the first week

just be like

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.919
yeah a little bit also when you take it

00:31:07.919 --> 00:31:10.240
it forces you to lift weights more

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.440
because you're like

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.640

maximum water content your body can

00:31:26.559 --> 00:31:28.159
handle and hit that

00:31:28.159 --> 00:31:30.240

this weekend

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.279
they had to they they hit the [ __ ] is

00:32:31.279 --> 00:32:32.799
anybody here a doctor over the

00:32:32.799 --> 00:32:35.039
loudspeaker and a lady had to rush back

00:32:35.039 --> 00:32:37.679
and help a woman who had a seizure whoa

00:32:37.679 --> 00:32:39.840
pretty rowdy stuff wow it'd be cool if

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.799
joe rogan was like

00:32:45.279 --> 00:32:49.200
uh what is the thing that they will land

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.159
the plane for for one person versus not

00:32:52.159 --> 00:32:53.679
they didn't land this one but we were

00:32:53.679 --> 00:32:55.519
like an hour and a half out so it was

00:32:55.519 --> 00:32:57.760
probably the closest anyway is it is a

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.080
heart attack they landed no matter what

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:02.559
he would think yeah probably

00:33:02.559 --> 00:33:04.559
i don't know though would be tough if a

00:33:04.559 --> 00:33:06.159
guy died like early do you think they'd

00:33:06.159 --> 00:33:07.360
be like you know what let's just ride

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.120

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.200
have been that i don't even know yeah i

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.600

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.000
though of all the people i know that

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.520

people would people would give me [ __ ]

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.839
for being a psycho for eating too much

00:35:35.839 --> 00:35:37.119
really and they would be like they're

00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:39.760
starving children in your basement

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.280
that's what they would say

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.359
which i thought was pretty funny

00:35:43.359 --> 00:35:44.720
so they would attack you because i

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.920
always get this i always get this

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.520
psychopath thing people think i'm a

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.320
psychologist i don't think you're a

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.800
psychopath because of uh american psycho

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.680
yeah why that's why why have you seen it

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.680
i've seen the movie yeah

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.960
what's why would you think people are

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.480
guarantee this guy wakes up and like

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.640
stretches naked in the morning no sure

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.000
what it what is like what looks in the

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.480
mirror like today is your day francis is

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.079

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.160
all right you guys could sit here and

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.839
laugh yeah what would your darkest like

00:36:15.839 --> 00:36:18.480
personal thought be that you could air

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.280
i have a oh

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.119
you know i

00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:24.079
i

00:36:24.079 --> 00:36:25.920
i have one person that i really don't

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.480
like nice um who

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.320
there's a guy who wrote an article about

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:34.320
me oh nice uh that went so beyond

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.079
where it needed to go

00:36:36.079 --> 00:36:38.560
wow you know it was so it was so beyond

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.760
the story and was simply meant to

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:44.320
make life harder for me for as long as

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.440
possible yeah i heard that yeah and i

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.480
have

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.160
dreams

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.200
often of finding a

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.880
i don't want to say like a hacker but

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.079
somebody who knows what they're doing

00:36:56.079 --> 00:36:57.359
with computers

00:36:57.359 --> 00:37:00.240
and just planting troves of child

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.839
pornography

00:37:01.839 --> 00:37:05.040
on his hard drive and then the fbi gets

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.960
an anonymous tip

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.440
and then they raid his place and find it

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.760
on his computer and he's toast that's

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.920
my fantasy that's the best revenge by

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.200
the way is that a good one and then you

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.880
know what you should do you should

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:20.000
commit a crime to get into that jail

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.599
and tell everyone be like that guy's

00:37:21.599 --> 00:37:24.160
here for [ __ ] child porn jail is not

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.560
good for people like him murder and have

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.640
sex with him yes

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.480
yeah that'd be the ultimate revenge you

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.720
throw your own life away to get to rape

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.320

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.680
a guy look a guy up in that jail

visiting him like yo i got well that

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.600

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.880
beater publicly you know who is this

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.400
fair point he knew who he was do you

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.760
think that people

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:26.160
come at nate diaz on the street simply

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:29.280
to test themselves definitely z i

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:32.400
can't imagine anyone being that dumb

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.599
that's like

00:41:33.599 --> 00:41:34.960
because dude did someone do the john

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.720
called van damme actually i think they

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.800
picked the [ __ ] out of john claudette

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.800
he's someone else beat the [ __ ] out of

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.480
john it's one of them either him or

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.319
steven seagal but they were like in

00:41:44.319 --> 00:41:45.920
their 50s someone beat the [ __ ] out of

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.560
him so man nate diaz is what he's a

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.480
light he's a welterweight

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.960
he's he fluctuates

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.359
lightweight

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.240
yeah yeah so it's like what 170. he got

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.839
robbed against mcgregor the second time

00:41:59.839 --> 00:42:01.359
so

00:42:01.359 --> 00:42:03.359
let me ask you this

00:42:03.359 --> 00:42:04.880
at what point

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.359
even though you know who he is but

00:42:07.359 --> 00:42:09.280
you're just like way bigger does it

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.839
matter or does he could he beat up a six

00:42:11.839 --> 00:42:13.599
foot five two hundred he would clear

00:42:13.599 --> 00:42:15.839
this room yeah he would clear out this

00:42:15.839 --> 00:42:17.760
room of us i would

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.480
all four yes you think of the four of us

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.240
yes jumped on well the problem is he

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.640
would hit one of us so [ __ ] hard we'd

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.480
all be like dude rogie's gonna clear

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.839
this room oh listen i'm

00:42:28.839 --> 00:42:31.200
not did you ever do jiu jitsu or any of

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.800
that stuff no dude i did jiu jitsu for

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.720
six months and there's dudes i'd be i

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.400
didn't know anything and i was like i'd

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.599
go to dudes like i can definitely beat

00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:40.560
this guy up and it's the most

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.000
disorienting thing because there's dudes

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.200
that are just like

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.040
so small so skinny and they just [ __ ]

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.280
you up and you're like dude i it's crazy

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.760
i got my ass sweet killer box steps

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.280
today

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:54.480
if if nadia's through a punch yeah i'm

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.000
laying down i'm not saying i'm not

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.520
saying us i'm just saying is if there's

00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:00.319
a you know some monster

00:43:00.319 --> 00:43:02.160
who does fight but obviously isn't in

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:03.839
the ufc or is true i think even the

00:43:03.839 --> 00:43:06.319
dudes in ufc don't [ __ ] with him really

00:43:06.319 --> 00:43:08.079
because number one because he's willing

00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:10.720
to fight on the spot yeah he's willing

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.880
to get a charge but aren't a lot of

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.079
those guys

00:43:14.079 --> 00:43:15.440
you ever watch

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.040
the ultimate fighter they fight in the

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.720
house all the time yeah but those guys

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:19.760
aren't

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:21.520
the real guys

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.520
like three of them ever now they are but

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.119
the old ones were like i'm a [ __ ]

00:43:25.119 --> 00:43:26.880
bartender from boston i'm trying to get

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.520
into the ufc

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.960
yeah i feel like if for a professional

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.800
fighter you'd probably need like if you

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.280
had maybe

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.960
five

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.119
five or six very dedicated dudes to like

00:43:39.119 --> 00:43:41.359
straight bum rush fearlessly at once you

00:43:41.359 --> 00:43:43.040
could probably like you know so you just

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.160
need one guy to kick him in the head

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.359
while he's even he's beating up two

00:43:45.359 --> 00:43:47.440
people one person just kicks him right

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:50.000
like the neck so five civilians versus

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.160
nate diaz i think if if they were

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.400
motivated in a cohesive group

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.839
i think yeah i think they could do

00:43:55.839 --> 00:43:57.599
something pretty bad to them interesting

00:43:57.599 --> 00:43:59.040
you had to sacrifice one or two of your

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.560
mates yeah one or two of your mates is

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:03.599
getting [ __ ] up dude yeah [ __ ] up i

00:44:03.599 --> 00:44:05.200
don't think we could

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.880
i'm not saying he would he he wouldn't

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.119
be doing like jiu jitsu to us

00:44:09.119 --> 00:44:10.800
because then then yes you could kick him

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.880
in the head yeah but it would just be

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.480
him standing and throwing punches yeah

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.920
but if you three if you did the 360

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.240
circle unless he last samurai dude and

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.680
just did full too many minds and was

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.319
like

00:44:22.319 --> 00:44:24.240
nate diaz doesn't roll alone dude he's

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.960
always got a squad

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.119
also let me attest to this the squadron

00:44:29.119 --> 00:44:31.520
does not stop grappling

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.680
the entire night

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.000
they are not he's got a foot different

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.720
dudes would start grappling and i would

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.560
stand there like please don't get me

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.440

00:44:45.839 --> 00:44:46.720
christ

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:48.960
yeah you ever have someone put their

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.960
hands around your neck

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.720
and they know what they're doing what

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.000
the hell

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.920
dude these guys and then it would get

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.280
serious they would start grappling and

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.880
start like rolling

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.560
now that i hang out now you'll see guys

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:03.280
once they start rolling

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:04.480
and then the dudes would be like all

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.880
right let them go and they would roll

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.359
and wrestle as hard as they could until

00:45:09.359 --> 00:45:10.960
finally they'd have to pull them off was

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:13.839

00:45:19.839 --> 00:45:21.839
time to get an uber back to nate's

00:46:57.839 --> 00:47:00.400
no room for cattiness either everyone's

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.160
everything settled immediately

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.079
like boom immediately dude and then

00:47:04.079 --> 00:47:05.440

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.359
like yeah get that [ __ ] boom

00:47:07.359 --> 00:47:09.520

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.119
lightly punching whoever was on the

00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:14.480
ground any sound effects yeah every time

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.000
he does sound

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.319
how does the wrestle and does someone

00:47:18.319 --> 00:47:19.359
tap

00:47:19.359 --> 00:47:21.359
the last wrestle i remember was a guy

00:47:21.359 --> 00:47:24.240
that was refusing to tap it was getting

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.000
choked out and they were like all right

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.280
that's enough

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.960
so someone does eventually they all were

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.480
like all right and eventually it was

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:31.920
like yeah that's enough and they know

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:33.359
the breaking point

00:47:33.359 --> 00:47:34.400
i mean the guy

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.480
there's they're all i would assume they

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.800
would all refuse to tap that's how the

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:41.040

to slowly walk towards someone

said i'm not gonna stand for this i

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.400
remember being like

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.240
i've never seen i've never seen that

00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:06.400

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.319
and it happened so fast

00:57:08.319 --> 00:57:10.880
that i was just like what what

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:12.400
and they

00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.559
immediately got out of the booth

00:57:14.559 --> 00:57:16.400
and they and then his buddies were like

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:19.200
all right it's going yeah and then the

00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:21.599
group of guys was like they were pushing

00:57:21.599 --> 00:57:24.000
and i'm like am i part of this

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.559
like i wasn't sure yeah you know because

00:57:26.559 --> 00:57:28.000
i was in the booth with them but they

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.760
weren't the guys that i was there with

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:31.520
and they weren't my friends yeah but i

00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:32.960
was like that was pretty i remember

00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:35.920
thinking like that was really unjust

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.839
and i was like i feel like i'm i'm

00:57:37.839 --> 00:57:39.200
supposed to

00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.440
do something here yeah but i didn't know

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:44.400
what and we we pushed towards the pizza

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:45.359
counter

00:57:45.359 --> 00:57:47.520
and then the guy apparently this happens

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.599
a lot at this pizza place bill's pizza i

00:57:49.599 --> 00:57:50.880
think it's gone out of business now but

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:52.160
there were fights there all the time

00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:53.200
because it was where everyone would

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:54.720
gather yeah when the bar is closed

00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:56.240
there's one pizza place

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.480
it was open late and the guy pulled the

00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:00.160
fire alarm instantly the guy who owned

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:03.040
the place nice which like summons

00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:04.960
the police or whatever yeah it's like

00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.559
pouring water on fighting cats though

00:58:06.559 --> 00:58:08.240
yeah

00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:09.200
and then

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:10.960
i was like all right this is getting bad

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:13.599
so i went outside thinking like i don't

00:58:13.599 --> 00:58:15.119
you know whatever that's when you met

00:58:15.119 --> 00:58:16.720
but the the guy

00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:19.119
who threw the first punch

00:58:19.119 --> 00:58:21.200
was already out there

00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:23.920
waiting and i come out it was a swinging

00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:26.319
door that had a bell over it i still i

00:58:26.319 --> 00:58:28.319
still can hear the bell like i'm

00:58:28.319 --> 00:58:30.720
signaling like ding ding there we go

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:33.760
and i walked out and he was squaring off

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:36.559
[ __ ] and i'm like oh okay

00:58:36.559 --> 00:58:38.559
i guess i'm supposed to fight this guy

00:58:38.559 --> 00:58:42.720
oh man and so i you know i i got into

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:44.319
what i thought was like a fighting

00:58:44.319 --> 00:58:47.119
stance but we were kind of like far we

00:58:47.119 --> 00:58:49.119
were like six or seven feet apart

00:58:49.119 --> 00:58:51.280
and then i think in the process of me

00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:53.599
closing the distance to him i just put

00:58:53.599 --> 00:58:56.160
my hands down and he he kicked me in the

00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:59.680
face oh and then [ __ ] he got on my back

00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:01.599
because i was on my hands and knees and

00:59:01.599 --> 00:59:03.599
he stepped over my back

00:59:03.599 --> 00:59:06.000
like he was saddling me

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.319
and then he grabbed the back of my coat

00:59:08.319 --> 00:59:11.200
collar hoisted me to a good height for

00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:14.000
him and started just teeing off like he

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000
was hitting a pinata my face

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.680
and he's swinging around my face because

00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:19.920
he's behind me okay he's like riding

00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:21.040
that it kind of helped i feel like

00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:23.119
though no

00:59:23.119 --> 00:59:24.720
not really i mean i couldn't put i

00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:26.559
couldn't put my hands up to i'm on my

00:59:26.559 --> 00:59:28.160
hands and knees i thought you said he

00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:30.559
hoisted you off the ground like no no

00:59:30.559 --> 00:59:32.960
he's i'm on my hands and knees and his

00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:35.599
his legs are over my back like he's

00:59:35.599 --> 00:59:38.240
straddling me and he's grabbed my collar

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:40.480
and he's just hitting me as i face the

00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:42.480
other direction okay on my knees

00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:44.400
and he got me like probably seven or

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:46.880
eight times jesus and then finally he

00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:49.280
stopped because i think he realized he

00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:50.960
was gonna kill me

00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:54.319
and then he helped me up

00:59:54.319 --> 00:59:57.760
and i looked around very like woozy he

00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:02.720

01:00:20.559 --> 01:00:21.839
great story

01:00:21.839 --> 01:00:25.200
i looked around every guy from our group

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.559
there's this group of right you know

01:00:26.559 --> 01:00:28.079

everyone had like tied

01:00:36.079 --> 01:00:37.520
they were all lying on the ground

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:40.079
groaning so there was no clear winners

01:00:40.079 --> 01:00:42.880
except that my guy was totally fine yeah

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:43.760
yeah

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.359

01:00:45.359 --> 01:00:47.119
he at this point

01:00:47.119 --> 01:00:49.119

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.280

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.440
they were because they were standing up

blows that you had to be the victim

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.720

you took like six seven punches like

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.920
that i might have been more i [ __ ] no

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.160
idea even still that's untouched the guy

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.480
was untouched

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:27.359
it's just ace after eight what a jury

01:05:27.359 --> 01:05:29.280
what a jerk after the perfect game after

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:31.760
the kick i mean i'd still to this day

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.079
give him credit for relenting

01:05:34.079 --> 01:05:36.240
he he relented showed mercy he's like a

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.599
hockey player also there might have been

01:05:37.599 --> 01:05:38.960
one it might have been his girlfriend

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.559
who was fighting one of those girls yeah

01:05:40.559 --> 01:05:41.839
that somebody was that's that'll put you

01:05:41.839 --> 01:05:43.280
in the biggest rage too you know what

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.359
you know what else this is a funny story

01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:48.240
speaking of hockey you see pk subban's

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.960
brother got heckled with a racist taunt

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:52.960
by a player

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:56.000
no no pj subban's brother is in

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.520
like the southeastern league or some

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.280
[ __ ] like that he's not in the nhl but

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.359
he was playing

01:06:01.359 --> 01:06:02.480
and

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.319
an opposing player who has since been

01:06:04.319 --> 01:06:06.319
cut from the team due to this

01:06:06.319 --> 01:06:08.319
i guess acted like he made like monkey

01:06:08.319 --> 01:06:10.240
gestures

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.240
which is terrible but then i read the

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:14.240
story and it was pk subman's brother was

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.640
trying to punch him in the face

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.400
you know

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.079
which is funny

01:06:20.079 --> 01:06:21.920
like if somebody because it's hockey

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:24.079
rules you're allowed to fight yeah so

01:06:24.079 --> 01:06:26.160
you're not allowed to be racist

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:27.920
but it's funny that in any other

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.280
situation

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.119
if a dude tried to attack you and you

01:06:31.119 --> 01:06:32.880
just went like

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.760
like yeah

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.680
you're in there you're you're allowed he

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:37.200
just tried to beat your ass it's mortal

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.839
kombat but in in hockey like then you

01:06:39.839 --> 01:06:41.119
read the story and he's like yeah i was

01:06:41.119 --> 01:06:42.640
trying to [ __ ] punch him in the face

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:45.359
i can't believe he was racist

01:06:45.359 --> 01:06:47.599
well i can it is a weird clash yeah it's

01:06:47.599 --> 01:06:49.200
a weird thing that's the time to be

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.319
racist

01:06:50.319 --> 01:06:51.760
yeah if someone is going if somebody's

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:54.319
trying to punch you in the face

01:06:54.319 --> 01:06:55.920
self it's safe to that self-defense that

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.200
was self-defense i was telling you you

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:58.160
can claim

01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.839
i'm only raises when my back's against

01:06:59.839 --> 01:07:00.799
the wall

01:07:00.799 --> 01:07:03.039
you can shoot somebody in your house

01:07:03.039 --> 01:07:04.160
yes

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:07.359
you get out of here you're pollock

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:09.760
i don't know just made me laugh that

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.119
that's the rules yeah that's kind of

01:07:11.119 --> 01:07:12.720
like they were like well yeah you're

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:14.240
perfectly in your right to punch that

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:17.119
man in his face yeah but his words

01:07:17.119 --> 01:07:18.559
he's out of the league

01:07:18.559 --> 01:07:20.559
sticks and stones sticks and sons bro

01:07:20.559 --> 01:07:22.400
does not apply yeah now i'm not

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:24.160
condoning what that man did of course i

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.000
would never it is weird it's a weird

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.240
arena but it is funny to be like he was

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:31.119
great he said something mean to me

01:07:31.119 --> 01:07:33.359
what if he was trying to attack him

01:07:33.359 --> 01:07:34.720
he's like i fight monkey style dude he

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:35.920
might have been like

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:37.359
champion [ __ ] you can't make the

01:07:37.359 --> 01:07:39.119
sound effects though even if that's i'm

01:07:39.119 --> 01:07:40.720
not sure that he gets you i'm not sure

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.640
that he did but either way you can't you

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.240
can't do any monkey related you can't

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.880
there's no monkey business true

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:47.839
that's true

01:07:47.839 --> 01:07:50.400
no monkey business good rule of thumb

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.920
yeah yeah and the next time though at

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.160
least he knows if he plays again if he's

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:54.960
like

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.319
let me just act yeah let me fight this

01:07:56.319 --> 01:07:57.440
man i don't want to

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.280
yeah just a regular fist fight i don't

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.720

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:39.679
going on and i was just like

01:09:40.319 --> 01:09:42.000
my brother killed me with that one time

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.759

01:09:43.759 --> 01:09:45.120

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.400
that's understandable though that's

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.000
fully understandable i know it was just

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.239
a reflex wave but then i and i was

01:09:56.239 --> 01:09:58.080
smiling waving back eating chicken

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.320
fingers in the front hunched over in my

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.920
chair because there was nowhere to put

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:04.080
the attendees i was holding a tray and i

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:04.350
went

01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:06.080
[Music]

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.000
from me to you i waved to somebody from

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.679
this distance oh and it's that close i

01:10:09.679 --> 01:10:12.719

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.600
what i did she literally acted like it

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.199
didn't happen

01:10:21.199 --> 01:10:23.760
she was like

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:27.760
okay who the [ __ ] is this guy

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.800
and then she offered tandy

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.719
[Laughter]

01:10:32.719 --> 01:10:34.800

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.280
by every second they're pretty oh my god

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.120
they're pretty girls and everybody has

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.400
to pretend they're not staring at their

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.880
asses they're perfect asses

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.320
every single person that i was with was

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.120
like

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.880
i would notice it every day every round

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:50.080
they would walk by and everyone was like

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:51.840
i was

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:54.400
you're greedy

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:57.040
tap the guy next to me like

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.560
you know a ring girl caught me a couple

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.239
times really because they would round

01:11:00.239 --> 01:11:01.600
the bench isn't that the point they

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.880
would round to the bend and i'd be

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.440
sitting there going

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:09.600
it was the same three girls all night

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.360
it's the same three so every time they'd

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.330
walk by i'd be like

01:11:12.330 --> 01:11:15.600
[Laughter]

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.760
but if you're sitting that close don't

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:21.440
they assume that you're somebody

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.520
and i know i make this joke a lot they

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.880
they could have thought i was like a

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.640
special guy

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.040

they sat down do you see this guy

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:53.199

sleepovers at my place and

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:29.280
we had a little

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.280
you know point and shoot digital camera

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.719
that could shoot like

01:15:32.719 --> 01:15:35.920
30 to 60 second clips at most perfect

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:37.600
it's all you need and we would we would

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.560
strap on like bike helmets and then get

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.360
this single mattress and then go out to

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:44.880
the ravine

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:47.840
uh which you know was really steep and

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:50.320
we would ride ride the mattress down the

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:52.719
ravine like toboggan and we would always

01:15:52.719 --> 01:15:55.440
the best part was always doing the intro

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:57.920

what is the what's the ravine

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:08.159
technically i think it's a just a steep

01:16:08.159 --> 01:16:10.400
embankment that typically has you know

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.640
some sort of water running down the

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:14.640
bottom of it but it might not it's just

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.239
a very steep bank so you guys would go

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:17.760
down into that would you guys have you'd

01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:19.440

i mean my brain you're not taking it far

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:54.080
enough you want global warming to

01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:55.760
increase such that the water

01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:57.960
temperatures rise and become

01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:00.560
unhospitable to lobster such and they

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:02.159

01:21:02.159 --> 01:21:05.199
already happening and he's out of work

01:21:05.199 --> 01:21:06.880

01:21:18.239 --> 01:21:20.080
elites would sacrifice the global

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.600

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.280

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:25.199

01:21:25.199 --> 01:21:27.360
