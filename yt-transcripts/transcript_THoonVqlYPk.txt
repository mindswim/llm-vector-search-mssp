00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.589
what up everybody this is a special

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.570
edition of the dog files I've been

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.160

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.230
it been like three or four months now

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.330
yeah at least it's been a while

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.090
shoutouts to the big homie Rob dude

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.799
which is so [ __ ] sick

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.699
what's up dude now watch managed to

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.470
finally be here I know give the people a

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.900
sense of who you are

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.900
well I've kind of got contradicting

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.539
personalities going on sure I currently

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.420
work at a prison yeah I have actually

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.369
I've some decent responsibilities at

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.809
that prison I've been there for a long

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:34.320
time

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.290
but I'm also big time into psychedelics

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.270
that's what's up oh yeah what's that

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.620
like to start it from there what's it

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.390
like to do that to be in that

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.280
environment especially having I mean

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.989
it's one thing if you're like a you know

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.969
like a union [ __ ] carpenter mentality

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:48.960
it's being in there but well the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.370
shouldn't [ __ ] dude and just you know

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.140
like rattle on the cage and stuff you

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.940
know talking about how is it - because

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.469
if you're like tripping and stuff then

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.940
you're going into jail look you I feel

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.320
like you could slip you into that kind

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.359
of nowadays so a very it's still very

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.030
similar mentality like you get in there

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.580
and it's it's very like we're a team

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.159
okay yeah and it's like but it's a real

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.500
us versus them type world and it's

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.850
different than I think a lot of people

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.580
would imagine that it is because it's

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.770
not like when you're right when you're

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.880
in the prison system

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.430
it's basically at least from my side

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.220
it's officers inmates like nobody really

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.200
cares like you know we hear about like

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.090
prison guards at races there's all this

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.270
[ __ ] from what I've seen in damn near 20

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.930
years it's not like it's inmates

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.700
officers if you're respectful as an

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.710
inmate officers give you respect

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.079
yeah they'll leave you alone if you're a

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.780
[ __ ] chicking turn ugly fast

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.990
what kind of stuff have you seen yeah

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.090
over the years was like the grimy is

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.939
thing you've ever seen from either side

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.899
well all the inmates I there's

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.430
definitely some grimy [ __ ] and a lot of

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.439
its inmate on inmate mm-hmm like I just

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.200
even recently we've had a guy like two

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.149
weeks ago got he had snitched awesome

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.600
drugs that were out on a compound and

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.280
they left whoever he had snitched to

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.020
which was the internal investigations

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.250
division whatever

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.890
they left him out there on the compound

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.990
the other inmates found out stomped his

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.240
head in the next day dan he didn't die

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.190
but he got airlifted out and spent like

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.260
five days in intensive care

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.230
[ __ ] yeah so she can go it can get ugly

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.090
quick so you've seen a lot of fucked-up

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.940
stuff basically well yeah now as far as

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.440
that goes

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.430
yeah there's matter is like you don't

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.380
some of it there's not as much I think

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.910
like if you're watching like TV series

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.830
and [ __ ] mmm there's no I don't think

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.560
there's as much like real rape as is

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.840
portrayed in the media yeah I've been

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.010
here I've heard that before I don't

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.050
think I've heard there's not either no

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.280
there's there's really at least there's

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.350
not because it's so open these days like

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.540
if an inmate comes to any staff member

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.800
and this is almost nationwide he's a

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.170
federal program and says I was raped

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.200
that this guy did it they have to the

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.460
whole the whole thing shuts down they

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.690
pull that m8 out they pull the other

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.040
inmate out they're separated they're

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.020
never together again they come in and

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.550
you'll rape can't investigate the entire

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.280
situation like isn't there an act like

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.500
the no prisoner and prison rape Act

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.570
yeah the prison prea prison rape

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.830
elimination and prison rape elimination

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.560
act yeah and there's posters all over

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.510
saying like if you're touched pal like

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.700
yeah it's crazy oh really it's all about

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.040
federal dollars but that's pretty crazy

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.360
this has got to happen right around the

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.830
same time as like that became aware

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.270
other people came aware of that on like

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.100
the college campuses they're like they

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.560
was sign and it was on it well I don't

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.209
know about that this was all under Bush

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.400
it was right as Bush was going toward

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.400
Jail rape yeah campy that was Bush it

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.170
was the prison rape elimination as was

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.610
talked about to say but as basically

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.350
excited stuff through federal dollars

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.900
and even though most states I think

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.140
followed that protocol already now they

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.550
have audit teams that come through every

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.350
other year and they'll randomly ask

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.940
questions the people like what would you

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.260
do if an inmate came and said this to

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.959
you or if inmate comes and tells you his

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.010
bunk he touched him

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.300
or he just stuck a finger up his ass

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.430
like we know well what's your next step

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.410
putting so it's not about rape how much

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.120
like sexual assault do you think happens

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.550
not like penetrative rape but like I

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.500
think there's a lot about fingerings

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.540
occur oh I think it happens a quite a

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.269
bottom bunk to top bunk fingerings

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.260
fingering is not as much it happens a

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.500
lot where do my you know ask ask his

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.720
monkey like hey you up for this I think

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.640
happens a lot really but that breaks in

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.770
fights it does it really oh [ __ ] yeah

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.970
that's right you got to be pretty horny

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.320
than to ask because that's like a risky

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.910
proposition oh yeah like I think

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.070
majority of them you know it's time it's

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.740
on if your monkey asks you yeah we are

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.300
you down - suck my dick you got two

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.620
choices you suck ass dick you beat his

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.720
ass that's that's it that's fair you

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.860
can't just plate Lee declined

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.950
I don't think believes no no no thank

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.840
you I'd rather not right now yeah there

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.320
you go

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.540
damn so that's that's how it goes it's

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.370
like you asked for head I mean are they

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.630
asking because they know that they say

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.860
no they're gonna fight so what if you

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.920
ask her head fight and then win just

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.720
depends how much bigger you are I'm sure

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.630
you might get it that day but people

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.580
everyone's a tough but everyone they

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.960
still tell so you're saying that the

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.400
fights in jail are like Ultimate

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.930
Surrender style know constantly sexually

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.820
I would say two-thirds of the fights in

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.220
jail or straight [ __ ] fights where the

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.890
whole point is to separate so though

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.840
wait until they're in front of officers

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.570
okay to fight cuz they know what's gonna

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.880
get broken up right away yeah yeah oh

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.590
yeah cuz they know instantly they're

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.200
gonna go call an emergency and everyone

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.540
rushes their fights done a real fight

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.790
isn't a cell you have to bunkies it

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.500
where it's like fighting to one dudes

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.310
unconscious yeah they happen but most of

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.050
them are just like straight-up [ __ ]

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.000
[ __ ] yeah I mean that's most fights out

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.919
in the outside world no doubt you guys

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:48.240
there's a lot of people like waiting

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.440
till the guys around there are doing

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.440
yeah just like I think the biggest fight

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.330
I ever gotten to in school was at an

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.700
assembly mm-hmm like it lasted all of 15

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.490
seconds before teachers came and pulled

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.669
us apart that's just how it goes I

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:04.860
didn't start it though well I kind of

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.979
did but how how so explain that I was

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:09.390
being a [ __ ]

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.700
I like threw a rock at a kid and he came

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.479
over and [ __ ] saw me he started it

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.770
literally threw the first stone yeah but

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.090
I didn't think he was coming back with a

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.490
[ __ ] fist I mean dude he had no

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.770
choice yeah boy I backed him into a

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.600
corner I don't blame him looking back on

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.919
it he did the right thing why did you

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:28.410
throw a rock at him I don't remember

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.840
just saw him and said [ __ ] this guy no I

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.729
was somebody we knew he's chucked a rock

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:34.530
yeah I just thought we just there was me

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:35.960
and my friends I thought it was funny

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.070
why else you throw rocks

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.300
because your friends like you should hit

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.440
that key with a rock and you're like

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.880
[ __ ] you I'm a rock that's true so see

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.740
boy she gave us a nice little a glimpse

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:47.760
of what it's like in there so there's

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.690
people are fighting a little bit it's

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.940
not as bad as people think what is like

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.470
kind of like more like a hospital than

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.900
anything you know there's a lot of

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.090
therapy programs these days and they do

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.730
try they do focus on rehabilitation yeah

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.070
you have to want it like anything else

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.600
if you have somebody that really wants

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.790
to be rehabilitated and like that's

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.440
their whole goal being in there they can

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.940
go through all these programs they can

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.500
go to a halfway house they can get a job

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.680
job placement they can do it but you

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.850
know if you're just doing your time and

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.980
rolling out you can do that too so there

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.630
is there actually is things for these

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.040
there's like well thought-out programs

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.810
for these guys there yet there's entire

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.780
departments for rehabilitation I'm not

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.070
saying it's the most effective thing in

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.340
the world but like states try yeah yeah

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.840
they definitely try like they get a bad

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.450
rap but you know it's hard to put a dent

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.220
in but they make an effort so what do

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.290
you think in terms of age groups like

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.240
hoody thinks the hardest to rehabilitate

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.750
like like 19 to 24 I would say from yeah

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.820
from the door yeah like real young guys

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.530
cuz I got to prove themselves like if

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:51.240
you're 17 18 19 it's your first bid you

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.100
have never been in jail before you were

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.630
trying to establish who you are as a man

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.400
wouldn't you get in there so it's a

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.020
different story yeah you get a guide

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.450
it's like in his 30s by that point he's

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.610
settled down yeah he's already made his

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.050
name and he's just like I got it I'm

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.460
gonna do my [ __ ] I'm gonna get out and

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.890
I'm gonna fix my life you should get a

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:09.330
lot more - how do you think you're bid

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.310
we go if you ever had to do a bid oh my

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.370
did you bid it will be ugly why cuz I've

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:16.980
been in a system for way too long so

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.110
they know you well yeah I get sent to a

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.430
[ __ ] up jail because they know me but

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.860
- yeah I just wouldn't cooperate I would

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.350
go mental health RAL you hit you hit the

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.320
blood oh I would go a hardcore mental

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.150
health and just being like special needs

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.450
units oh yeah it's the sweetest spot Oh

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.919
like yeah I'd get in a fight smear [ __ ]

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.390
all over my face so that'd be like

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.330
pedophile velour like no no not

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.099
pedophiles pedophiles are at least where

00:08:41.099 --> 00:08:42.390
I'm at pedophiles are a whole separate

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:45.000
area guys but there's there are there is

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.940
a spot just for mental health issues

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.410
okay so guys that just aren't stable you

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.030
but they're not crazy enough to go into

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.250
like a state psychiatric hospital do not

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.660
stable enough for general population

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.390
that if you go in if you go in there and

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:00.680
act crazy if you do like the Joker

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.180
laughs the big I do get the [ __ ] out

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.980
here no you gotta do some crazy [ __ ] do

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.840
you really oh yeah like you if you could

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.970
go in say you're gonna kill yourself or

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.650
whatever and then just start eating your

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:10.670
own [ __ ] in front of them

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.860
that that would get you in you've got to

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.180
eat is there anything else you can do

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.220
besides eat your own dump if you could

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.420
convince like you got to convince a

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.860
psychic could you crawl X crawl like

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.750
algebra all over your wall now because

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.310
like the psychs and know the [ __ ]

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.920
yeah so you have to jump you have to

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.750
make a stand and got a chocolate or you

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.820
got to do some real [ __ ] damn yeah I

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.800
would definitely it'd be the easiest way

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.660
in it's just a munch on a turd

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.910
oh so that's the price to pay to get

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.010
like the cushy jail sentence mm-hmm one

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.590
turd and then you're never responsible

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.480
for anything you do yeah anything you do

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.890
mental health is like he can't help

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.350
himself really yeah you get in fights

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.180
you do whatever I've thought about that

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.470
I've thought of going to like a

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.290
psychiatrist now just in the event that

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.550
I ever get in trouble for anything and

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.140
like convincing a psychiatrist I have

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.240
schizophrenia just so if I do get in

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.530
trouble for anything they big yeah he's

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.060
got Stefania and then they're down I

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.170
think I could pull it off I'm also

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.040
curious to see if I could actually

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.870
convince a psychiatrist I've

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.940
schizophrenic I could honestly I think

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.020
you would just have to take up and

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.000
decent though some mushrooms before you

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.980
want it and then just tell them the

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.050
truth this wear sunglasses is rolling

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:13.490
that's actually good idea just tell them

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.200
what you're thinking you might very well

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.840
be schizophrenic probably you know so

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.580
when you say so you're interested in

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.410
psychedelics mm-hmm what's that look

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:22.970
like and terminally explained like

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.740
exactly what do you how interested are

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.170
you / what do you do well I've done a

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.540
lot of psychedelics mainly the strange

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.610
thing is never when I was younger like I

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.080
don't think I really got into

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.170
psychedelics I was my 30s mm-hmm and

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.270
then after that it had to be things that

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.310
I could come up with myself it's like I

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.260
don't want to buy anything gotcha so

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.820
mushrooms I could grow

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.510
yeah like DMT I can extract yeah so

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.160
those those were the main is the main

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.370
areas so you tried them once then there

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:53.300
was like [ __ ] I'm gonna make these

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.170
things with with mushrooms yeah

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.100
mushrooms were mainly listening to

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:58.850
Terence Mckenna

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:00.830
yeah I know he got yeah that that's what

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.710
got me hooked Wow for me it was even

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:04.660
before then I mean

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.160
I was a teenager listening to coast to

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.920
coast am with that with art bell and

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.199
here in Terence Mckenna on there yeah

00:11:11.199 --> 00:11:13.209
and I thought he Terence Mckenna was

00:11:13.209 --> 00:11:16.120
amazing and then he died and then you

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.170
didn't you know I don't hear anything

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:18.970
about him for ten years and then

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.649
suddenly you know YouTube comes about

00:11:20.649 --> 00:11:22.839
and everything and they there he is yeah

00:11:22.839 --> 00:11:24.220
it's the same thing I'm listening to all

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.959
these Terence Mckenna interviews and I'm

00:11:25.959 --> 00:11:28.149
like I didn't forget the [ __ ] into this

00:11:28.149 --> 00:11:29.290
like this is amazing

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:30.759
it's pretty hard not to do it's hard to

00:11:30.759 --> 00:11:32.290
listen it's hard to listen to his stuff

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:33.970
and not want to do mushrooms really

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.339
badly I've noticed I've definitely like

00:11:36.339 --> 00:11:37.660
listen to a bunch of [ __ ] I'm like I got

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.839
a guy I definitely knew you were into

00:11:40.839 --> 00:11:42.399
his [ __ ] mmm even though I don't think

00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:43.720
I've heard you talk about it not

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.519
everybody about him I heard you use the

00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:49.060
term glossolalia yeah so I definitely

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.269
knew you were into mechana busted dude

00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:53.920
that is where I took that term as

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.250
exactly where I stole that I love their

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.610
own that around so what uh yeah so

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:01.870
explain it you're saying grow mushrooms

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.639
and how do you go what's the easiest way

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:05.829
to go about doing that for me the most

00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:08.230
the most cost-effective way like I'll

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.480
buy a simple mushroom grow kit and it's

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.750
good for any kind of mushroom yeah and

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.519
with a mushroom grow kit and then you

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:18.130
can buy spore syringes and they're so

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.480
you can buy their spores they're legal

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.279
and I think everywhere but California

00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:23.800
and Georgia sports fringes are legal

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.630
weird they're not legal in California

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.089
even though psychedelics now are yeah

00:12:28.089 --> 00:12:30.189
it's a old law I think okay but you

00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:32.680
can't buy you know it's like psilocybin

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.870
mushroom spores in those states but you

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.819
know Pennsylvania and New York you can

00:12:36.819 --> 00:12:39.160
you order them offline yeah so you order

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.029
more through the internet that come

00:12:40.029 --> 00:12:41.439
right to your house you get the regular

00:12:41.439 --> 00:12:44.910
mushroom grow kit and for basically a

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.949
hundred dollars I could grow ten ounces

00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:50.470
worth of magic mushrooms Sam it's crazy

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.240
yeah I've always been curious what the

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.889
[ __ ] they did if they seen you growing

00:12:53.889 --> 00:12:55.829
your own mushrooms this is just like I

00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:58.180
don't take him like hey yeah give me

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.790
that I don't I've never sold them so

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.100
sadly ever grown them like I've I've

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.899
given away a ton of them but I'd never

00:13:04.899 --> 00:13:06.490
grow I never so I would never sell up

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.410
god that's always my Matt's my line like

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.990
same thing with DMT with mushrooms like

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.490
if you're a friend and you want some

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.589
like I'm happy to help you on that

00:13:14.589 --> 00:13:14.949
journey

00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:17.410
sure but yet not selling you anything

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:18.430
yeah

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:19.660
that seems to be what they're after

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.580
their commercializing if you like sell

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.140
it and make money yeah I think so

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.790
because you can really can't get busted

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:26.740
on the hookup now I'm gonna get bust it

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.870
with like DMT and be like I got the plug

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:30.670
I'm over here I don't think it already

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:34.089
plugs there's not no I couldn't even

00:13:34.089 --> 00:13:36.550
find a mushroom plug back in the day

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.709
like that I remember before I tried to

00:13:38.709 --> 00:13:40.420
grow on my head had a couple buddies I

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.890
knew could get [ __ ] I asked and they're

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.839
like man I wouldn't know when we know

00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:45.220
house mushrooms well the problem too

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.410
with that cuz it's like I spent a long

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.529
time of my I would say early to mid-20s

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:52.270
plugged into like an evil hippie circuit

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:55.089
yeah but it's like you get these guys

00:13:55.089 --> 00:13:57.190
you know that you have like access to

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:58.390
all this stuff but you got to deal with

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.279
like kind of heroin addicted hippie

00:14:00.279 --> 00:14:02.200
figures who are like the most to me the

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.870
most like dastardly because like they

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.730
act like they're all like yeah man like

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:08.020
whatever and they're like constantly

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.940
ripping each other off like the ones

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.470
were making all like the fake with fake

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:13.060
weed cartridges or again everybody's

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.770
sick like that's like walked out evil

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.810
hippies out in California yeah no doubt

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:18.610
just putting together all kinds of weird

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:20.260
crazy chemicals and sending them out and

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.100
then being like you know this is like

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.190
some organic but I got it's like stuff

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.440
like it smells like pine-sol bro yeah I

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.209
was like [ __ ] cleaner I know they're

00:14:28.209 --> 00:14:29.410
out there I don't never really been

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.240
plugged into them like most of hippies

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.920
I've organically met have been pretty

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.839
awesome so yeah well it's when they get

00:14:34.839 --> 00:14:37.540
there when you enter the like hardcore

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.690
another hardcore like the commercialized

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:43.690
like hallucinogenic trade the evil

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.279
hippies have like a Lynch grip have a

00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:47.380
good vice grip on that train it's like

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.910
they're [ __ ] nasty a lot of them are

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:49.390
nasty

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:52.029
I've been severely disappointed I don't

00:14:52.029 --> 00:14:53.230
think you're personally I've been

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:54.880
severely disappointed I want my hippies

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.550
to be just [ __ ] happy and like you

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.589
know just just to share maybe make your

00:14:59.589 --> 00:15:00.940
money back but that's what I thought I

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.500
was meeting him all excited when I was

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.640
younger thing like oh these guys will be

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.990
cool when I was watching them like rip

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:06.880
each other off for 50 bucks here and it

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.040
was [ __ ] crazy yeah I have heard

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.230
about people charging crazy money for

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.959
like ayahuasca ceremonies and yeah you

00:15:13.959 --> 00:15:16.420
know mushroom ceremonies and well yeah a

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:17.860
lot of time you get these guys who would

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.420
like you know they'll follow fish or

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.029
whatever band around for like all year

00:15:22.029 --> 00:15:23.829
and then come back in two months and try

00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:25.420
to make enough money so they can go just

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.680
[ __ ] off for another like ten months

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.420
that's where you get a lot of like the

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.250
trickery okay and it's like you know

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:31.450
when you take a hippy like that of

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:32.350
course there's like you know

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:33.880
sharing everything everything's cool but

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.230
you know when you hit them with some

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.180
actual money I think it bugs them out

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.770
it's getting like that weird evil

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:42.010
sorcery complex yeah makes sense but

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:43.390
either way everyone thought about from

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:45.760
that aspect I make decent money now so

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.530
yeah they've never been worried about

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.210
giving away the psychedelics that seems

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:50.620
kind of the way to do it honestly I've

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.300
just kind of like make them for yourself

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.340
hook up your boys teach other people how

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.750
to make them that way you can kind of

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.820
cut out all the [ __ ] yeah no doubt

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.630
about like the black market the dark web

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:05.200
yeah like it yeah yeah I think I think

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.330
ultimately that's where I would like to

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:10.390
go more towards like helping people with

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:12.640
mushrooms like down the road yeah I'm

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.550
not there yet but yeah yeah I've still

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:17.110
got still got a while at my current any

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:18.580
current job but mm-hmm

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.320
not that long so really so you're

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.700
waiting till you're done with that and

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.770
then a few years yeah really so you're

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.500
gearing up to get out of the you getting

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.060
out of the hole P I see yeah prison

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.370
industry I'd be nice nice yeah I'm

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.740
thinking like maybe not quite like what

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.060
you were talking I'm thinking like I

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.010
mean I want to move back to the west

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:36.880
coast eventually

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.120
okay maybe do some like extended guided

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.390
hikes with mushrooms you can tell me

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.970
also who'll do them out there no I think

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:47.200
I would just want to do like guided

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.210
hikes to begin with yeah and then just

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:51.280
kind of feel out who will be down yeah

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.630
especially it was like two or three days

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.940
like you'll know after a day if who's

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.270
with you would be down or not oh sure

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:00.250
and just a legitimate regular old guy at

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.200
hike yeah then slowly start bumping

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.230
elbows with people yeah sure most people

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.760
doing a guided hike will gobble up some

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.960
mushrooms yeah I'm thinking like down a

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.970
run guided hike so that would be tell

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:11.590
you yeah I want to run the guided hikes

00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:13.810
and then just feel out feel out the

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:15.700
customers and you know I just make the

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.110
mushrooms part of the experience for the

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:19.090
ones who would like it gotcha

00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:22.120
yeah just like you could actually plant

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.430
like a bag of them around a bandage like

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.490
whoa look what I found

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:29.950
might be the way just the I would align

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:31.420
them I always would love for someone to

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.720
around here just plant like thousands of

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.790
weed plants in same way just walk away

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.170
from them it's like you get in trouble

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:39.910
from trying to like take ownership of

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:41.470
them mm-hmm so if you just planted

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:42.760
thousands of them and like walked away

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.740
that is just free weed for everybody

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.060
else enough people did that

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.340
yeah you'd be like you you know there's

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.870
an epidemic of wheat plants around up

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:50.860
everywhere like I don't know how they

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.120
got in my yard and they're down

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.710
they must have blown over here basically

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.030
I remember enough we did that in high

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:55.480
school

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.570
not with found plants but me and my

00:17:58.570 --> 00:17:59.650
cousin and my buddies were out in the

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:02.800
woods behind my house yeah and I was in

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.950
a pretty rural area and we found a trash

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:08.860
bag full of weed drying out hanging from

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.780
a tree that's a fantasy of mine but go

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.690
ahead it lasted it's like the entire

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.720
summer like five of us damn I was crazy

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.970
so some guy was was he curing it in a

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:21.370
trash bag outside we never knew never

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:22.840
found out whose weed it was someone

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.240
probably ditched it then it was tied up

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.020
like ten feet up in a tree no idea

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.770
sounds like they're like the beginning

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:35.310
of mud we just forget movie boy so

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:38.080
alright so in terms of synthesis so the

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.610
mushrooms are easy you said you just you

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.860
buy a kit by the spores what's the net

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.780
what is like the actual steps to make

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.750
them once you have the kit in the spores

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.340
it usually comes with bags of like the

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.880
ones I get have these bags of grain

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:56.140
mm-hmm that are they're a sterilized

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.120
grain yeah but it's sealed in a bag and

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.250
it has an injection port so you take the

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.350
syringe you shake it up and you just

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.870
inoculate each bag and then you let them

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.620
sit in like a dark place that's just

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.300
house temperature like 70 degrees is

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.040
fine okay they sit for two or three

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.890
weeks and the mycelium grows over all

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:17.200
the grain in the bag mm-hmm and then

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.330
once that's done it's passed like that

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.760
real bad infection stage yeah you just

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.130
take that you mix it with your like

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:27.610
manure substrate same thing in bags and

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:30.490
just put it out let it you let that sit

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.170
in the dark for another week or so until

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.060
then I assume goes over the top just put

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.130
it out in like windows in your house

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:38.890
like once a day you give it a mist with

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:40.840
a fan or you give it a mist with a water

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.540
bottle you fan it after like another

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.370
week the mushrooms start coming really

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:48.250
need to start fruiting so you know you

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.290
inject it inject the rice or grain

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.510
whatever you have mycelium grows over

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:54.340
that and you put in one or over that you

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.290
said it's some kind of manure substrate

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:57.610
I've got a few other things in it but

00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:59.080
and I get it all comes for with one of

00:19:59.080 --> 00:19:59.430
those

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.140
from croquettes oh so usually have like

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.270
an organic fertilizer yeah that's all

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:05.130
and then you spray just you just mix it

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:06.780
all together you break you break the

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.790
grain up inside that see I thought it

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.760
had no it just regrows like the mycelium

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.740
goes out and reconnects to itself that's

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.450
weird because I thought it had to be

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.610
like completely some airtight [ __ ]

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.670
box only in the beginning okay I think

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:22.140
only what they get that original

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:25.080
mycelium once the mycelium is on there

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.580
that stage where you have to worry about

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.280
infection is passed and then you're

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.800
pretty much good and then once you have

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.450
the mycelium can you just keep doing it

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:35.400
over and over and over already if that

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.220
throw it out no it's good for about five

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.500
to six flushes so like the mushrooms

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.240
grow up you cut them all down and then

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.640
they'll grow again did you break it back

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.900
up and throw it and it just kind of read

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:46.890
something now you don't have to do that

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:48.270
you just take you just pick everything

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.910
okay maybe after two or three times out

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:52.440
you take the cake and dunk it in water

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.780
for an hour mhm put it back in yeah it

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.400
just keeps going that's crazy yeah

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.230
they're simple they're super easy so how

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:00.140
about making DMT how do you do that

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.250
DMT you need to get a hold of the right

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:05.010
plant to start with okay so it's in

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:07.320
almost everything mm-hmm but the easiest

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.690
ways for that is either like mimosa

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:14.100
hostilius remark or like a case your

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.290
root bark okay which a case is a little

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:18.030
trickier but you think the most hostile

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:20.160
us you basically you it's a chemical

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.890
extraction yeah so you just grind it up

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:23.520
into a powder

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.990
mm-hm and then I'll mix it with like

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:30.510
like white vinegar let it sit for a few

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.730
hours that way that's it that's your

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:37.800
solvent um no the yeah using that the

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.320
acid to break it down okay you know the

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.760
salt yeah that that's your acid base

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.870
okay and then you use um what does it

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:50.250
sodium hydroxide what's that it's like

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:53.610
why okay yeah you just use the Y and the

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:56.490
Y is what breaks it up and then you use

00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:00.450
in it was trying to think then it yeah

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.810
that's what turns it you know the acid

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.210
the base is the Y mm-hmm and then you

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:10.590
use the other thing what's it called

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:11.790
it's almost like lighter flow but it's

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:12.750
not

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:16.770
butanes that's similar chemical but it's

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.300
you can get it anywhere Lowe's or Home

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.760
Depot okay and yeah you use that as your

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.310
is your solvent and then it pulls it out

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:28.470
is in methanol so no it's simple one

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:29.850
though I'm trying to Chris Kota it's a

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:32.780
beauty

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:35.760
yeah I'm trying to think it's just been

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.470
a while since I actually looked at him I

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:39.810
said I'm in something you can grab from

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.240
like a Home Depot my question things

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.100
Home Depot chemicals how do you know

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:48.090
that all that's off you smell it oh so

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.800
you know and you do you could do a test

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.110
first mm-hmm so you take some of it of

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.300
your solvent and like put it out on a

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.210
dish yeah and throw a fan on it and see

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:59.520
if it evaporates clean if it doesn't

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.930
evaporate clean it leaves a line around

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:03.180
everywhere where it where it was if it

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.010
evaporates clean it's gone you can't

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:06.210
smell it anymore huh

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:09.300
yeah that was my always with ever with

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.700
anything that chemically intensive I'm

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.140
always a member people used to make like

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.760
hash oil with the attain and I'm looking

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.200
at like a bubbling goop and I'm like

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.300
dude like what the [ __ ] is that I'm I

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.460
looks disgusting yeah now I would that

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.140
would the yeah with the DMT is just a

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.390
powder when you're done yeah say all the

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.130
liquids gone that makes sense yeah

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:28.260
that's how you know it's all it's all

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.280
off I guess it would be kind of like

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.170
taste horrible how's it you would smell

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:32.370
it how's it taste

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:34.260
not good if you have it born its own

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.480
yeah once you melt it it's fine really

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.230
you have to you got a ass like melt and

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.630
you just do the fumes off of that gotcha

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.270
oh you can't burn it gotcha see if you

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:46.590
want to vaporize it yeah you got to

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:48.570
vaporize it and then how much do you

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:52.110
need to do just well just like this just

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:53.970
the classic like the three big hits

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:56.130
works the best yeah at least for me so

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.800
like three little pinches and a thing

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.940
yeah it kind of I don't think you could

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.980
put too much in with the pipe mm-hmm

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.210
because you're not you're not gonna get

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:05.220
too much it's basically three long fools

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.920
so so what would you say

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.780
have you had have you seen people had

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.090
like really bad experiences on whatever

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:13.650
your experience has been watching people

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:16.170
do it and doing it yourself I've never

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:18.150
seen anyone have a really bad experience

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:20.280
I mean I've read about them online I've

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.740
never seen a really bad one I mean I've

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.660
had a couple kind of scary ones but no

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:28.450
like horrific yeah what was scary about

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:33.220
it it's just like you'll see me and I've

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.030
never I've seen entities and like I've

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:38.380
kind of heard entities I've never had

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.000
like I've done it a bunch of times that

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.090
I've never gotten like the super intense

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:44.710
like contact people talk about yeah

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:45.850
where you're talking to these entities

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:47.620
and think they can't take [ __ ] ignore

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:47.980
me

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.350
really yeah you get shunned in the DMT

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:52.450
I've got get shunned like what the [ __ ]

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:55.060
I feel like that the empty like it feels

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.250
familiar like if you ever went really

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:59.800
deep in all mushrooms and gotten to a

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:00.940
place where you're kind of falling in

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.340
that of consciousness mm-hm and it feels

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:06.130
like it's somewhere you've been and it's

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.650
like I've had it to where you it feels

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:10.800
like you're in that space where you go

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.620
between lives okay that's kind of what

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.120
the DMT thing feels like it feels like

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.220
you're going back there and then there's

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.130
other realms off of that but I generally

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:22.930
get back there to that space where it

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:26.440
feels like I go when I die like I I feel

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.880
like I'm in the same place my soul was

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.580
that when he got spit out here so it's

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.280
not intensely visual they have I have no

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.110
if two types of DMT and one's more

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:36.580
intensely visual and the other ones not

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.800
no that's that's what the regular would

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.810
like the and then DMT that's supposed to

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:42.130
be that is visual gotcha

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:43.690
so you do see lots of patterns and

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:45.580
colors and I I'll see like this doom

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:48.970
space sometimes mm-hmm and I have seen

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:50.140
there's crazy things but it's like a

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:52.210
dream or like it fades yeah so you

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:54.100
remember the highlights but the details

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.930
are gone fast at least to me

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.520
yeah that's why sometimes when I really

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.830
I've read like these crazy in-depth trip

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:01.870
reports where people are talking about

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:03.430
things that were said and it's all this

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:05.680
detail I'm like either you're way better

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.940
at this and mayor you're full of [ __ ]

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.310
yeah because I get all these glimpse and

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:10.810
pieces I remember it for like a minute

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:12.880
and a half and then I'm like [ __ ] it's

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:13.150
gone

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:15.340
is it a dream yeah so what would you say

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.610
the benefits to it are I don't know if

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:20.380
it's quite the same as mushrooms I think

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.660
to me the big benefit with that one was

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.450
it just a gave me this sense that there

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.250
really is more to this whole thing like

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:29.740
this is like there's a place that we go

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.280
and like I really to me I guess it could

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.750
be [ __ ] but it feels like that's the

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.780
place yeah like that spot where I can

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.340
reach with with that the

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.169
teacher it feels like the spa I'm gonna

00:26:41.169 --> 00:26:44.080
go when I'm not here like I don't know

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.789
what happens there mm-hmm but I keep

00:26:45.789 --> 00:26:47.710
touch that spot a bunch of times and it

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:50.649
feels like it's so familiar it's crazy

00:26:50.649 --> 00:26:52.539
yeah and that's coming from somebody who

00:26:52.539 --> 00:26:55.389
you know went to 13 years of Christian

00:26:55.389 --> 00:26:59.019
school yeah so like I came up heavy you

00:26:59.019 --> 00:27:01.389
know Christian mmm and then I hit this

00:27:01.389 --> 00:27:03.730
and I'm like oh maybe this is where this

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:06.070
all came from yeah it was a whole

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:07.809
[ __ ] and people were just taking

00:27:07.809 --> 00:27:09.909
mushrooms okay or her smoke at the Mt

00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:12.100
and came up with this yeah cuz that

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.720
seems like the closest thing to a real

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.909
religious experience that I've had and

00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:18.460
that's like said after years of being

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.440
sitting in church yeah Kona Christian

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.019
school but like I said you take enough

00:27:23.019 --> 00:27:24.909
mushrooms you go out in your yard and

00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:26.919
just like look at the trees blow in the

00:27:26.919 --> 00:27:29.190
wind look at the grass and it's like

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.269
[ __ ] like we're all part of the same

00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:34.029
[ __ ] thing yeah like like this is it

00:27:34.029 --> 00:27:36.249
yeah that is that is weird how there are

00:27:36.249 --> 00:27:37.869
like a class of plants who have a pretty

00:27:37.869 --> 00:27:39.850
reliable affect on like a vid like they

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:42.249
inspire a reliable thought pattern which

00:27:42.249 --> 00:27:44.379
is that to me it's kind of bizarre oh no

00:27:44.379 --> 00:27:46.090
doubt and it's a pretty good one if you

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.279
think about it like it's not like like

00:27:48.279 --> 00:27:49.389
if you thought about like the thought

00:27:49.389 --> 00:27:51.039
pattern of methamphetamine thought

00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:52.869
pattern of alcohol then the thought

00:27:52.869 --> 00:27:55.179
pattern of like mushrooms all pretty

00:27:55.179 --> 00:27:57.909
different so it is weird how they can

00:27:57.909 --> 00:28:00.460
have almost the drug slash compound

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:03.730
slash plants have you know a personality

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:05.289
so to speak once they cross your

00:28:05.289 --> 00:28:07.240
blood-brain barrier and then inspire a

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.710
line of thought within people it's kind

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:10.210
of [ __ ] this makes you kind of like

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:12.309
makes me kind of bug out if I drink

00:28:12.309 --> 00:28:13.779
coffee I'm like a [ __ ] like banana

00:28:13.779 --> 00:28:17.919
republic dictator it definitely makes

00:28:17.919 --> 00:28:21.789
sense you said it's I think there's a

00:28:21.789 --> 00:28:23.649
couple it depends how long you stick

00:28:23.649 --> 00:28:25.149
with it I think with mushrooms there's a

00:28:25.149 --> 00:28:27.429
few roads you go down I think you have

00:28:27.429 --> 00:28:29.679
like your classic or I guess with us the

00:28:29.679 --> 00:28:30.730
same thing but like you're like you're

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:32.519
timothy leary road where people are out

00:28:32.519 --> 00:28:35.350
just you know preaching on the rooftops

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:36.999
like this is the [ __ ] everyone needs to

00:28:36.999 --> 00:28:39.519
do yeah and to me like you don't need to

00:28:39.519 --> 00:28:42.669
do that yeah like I'd I agree that a lot

00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:44.470
of people could benefit from it not

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:46.029
everybody should take it you have to

00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:47.559
have the right mindset to begin with

00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:50.470
sure but bringing too much attention not

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:52.419
always a good thing yeah that's that's

00:28:52.419 --> 00:28:53.140
always what I'm

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:56.260
kind of wonder about like it was like

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:59.740
DMT like who would it be for who did not

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.180
before do you think and how do you think

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:02.620
he would tell like who would be like

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:03.910
yeah you know what this isn't for you

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:05.650
I think if you've done well with

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:07.150
mushrooms and gotten like the right

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:09.070
things out of it like some people I

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:10.660
think say you took mushrooms and you're

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:12.400
like yeah that was a good time we had a

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.890
good laugh but like yeah that's it yeah

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:17.260
you might not be interested like the DMT

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:18.790
might not you might just try and be like

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:20.500
yeah that was that was dumb like I don't

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.330
even know what just happened yeah but if

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:24.610
you took mushrooms and you're you felt

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:26.190
like you saw the world differently

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:29.110
mm-hmm like you went out because

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:30.460
thinking it's like to me when you take

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.440
mushrooms it's like it pulls back the

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.080
filters and your expectations of what

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.790
you see so you might look at the same

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:39.370
tree you looked at every day yeah but

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:40.630
now you see a hundred things about this

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:42.490
tree you've never seen before yeah and

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:43.780
you might not make it any further than

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.340
that your entire trip you want to stand

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.560
there and stare at that tree completely

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.720
amazed yeah and feel like that trees

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.000
your brother like yeah yeah like if

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.770
that's your experience of mushrooms I

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:56.560
think the MT can do is for you gotcha if

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.000
you take it you're just like things look

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.920
weird I want this to stop yeah and

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.130
probably don't probably not gotcha

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:04.810
because I always had a problem my took

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:06.820
mushrooms when I was really young a

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:10.540
decent amount twice and it was like the

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:11.890
first times like a blast second time I

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:14.940
had like I think it was literally like

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.440
6.8 cramps something like a lot yes a

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.480
lot and I bugged that second time i

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.490
bugged the [ __ ] out mmm then eventually

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:22.960
it turned out to be okay so I've been

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.750
trying to kind of piece at the others

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:27.250
I've had smaller amounts here and there

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:29.230
like after since then and it's like I've

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:31.210
been trying to figure out a way to just

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:32.830
like introduce people to like small

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:34.930
small amounts and slowly let them expand

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:37.570
the way they're comfortable with over

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:39.340
time yeah I think that's definitely a

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:41.260
good way to start I don't think you need

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.670
to jump in with both feet

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:44.680
yeah that's what I don't want people

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.210
thinking like oh yeah I'm gonna it's

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:47.830
like just especially when people are

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:49.960
like have like already distorted thought

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.850
patterns already have like a ton of

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:53.290
problems that are going on they haven't

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:54.430
explored and they're like oh I'm gonna

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:55.900
take mushrooms and cure myself it's like

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:59.140
dude probably not most likely gonna have

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.660
a horrible time yeah I mean you might it

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.010
might actually if it's like I'm tonight

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:04.930
if it's like a like a escape make it I

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:05.980
just

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.510
and I think what you need you would need

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:09.340
the right setting like you need you need

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.870
someone that you need to be in a safe

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:12.580
place with someone that knows what the

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.080
[ __ ] going on like you know one thing

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.549
about yourself if you're in that

00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:17.290
scenario yeah that's what normally I'll

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:19.750
tell people like like one and a half

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.720
grams sure like for your first time like

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.520
take one and a half grams see how you

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.530
feel see what you think like if you want

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:28.120
to go deeper I'll give you more of a

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.250
good deeper yeah but yeah that's a good

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:31.630
starting point is I think anything below

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:34.240
like in my experience anything below

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.250
like two two and a half you're normally

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:38.679
fine sure yeah it's not a bad experience

00:31:38.679 --> 00:31:41.890
especially if you just stay home yeah -

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:43.780
two and a half you're good once you get

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:45.900
up into like the four or five plus range

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.520
that's when [ __ ] turns dark and like

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.410
your pets are trying to kill you yeah

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:53.020
you know it's a whole [ __ ] yeah

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.669
so how has it been for you have you like

00:31:54.669 --> 00:31:56.140
lead people through any kind of

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.850
experiences like that like how's that

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:00.280
been I've had some good experiences with

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:04.990
that and bad really yeah well good with

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:08.290
most people like say especially if I'm

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:09.669
just setting you up with it and saying

00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:11.049
you notice what you need and giving you

00:32:11.049 --> 00:32:13.540
all the instructions and good like as

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:14.890
far as people that have taken it when

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:17.770
I'm they're usually fine actually the

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:20.020
worst experience was with uh I had my

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:20.650
wife there

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:23.230
mm-hm and she known she smoked a lot of

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:24.940
weed but she never done mushrooms she

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:27.100
wanted to try it and I set her up with

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.650
like two grams mhm and she goes on to

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:31.690
tell me about how she could murder me

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:34.240
and like ruin my life and like all kinds

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.179
of crazy [ __ ] whoa yeah and like how she

00:32:37.179 --> 00:32:38.440
could get away with it and she's just

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.850
chuckling to herself oh it was

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:41.410
ridiculous it's terrifying I took like

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:43.450
one gram so I was tripping but not hard

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:45.850
just enough that I'm like it's gonna be

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:47.950
okay and she's just laughing and smiling

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:50.140
to herself she's like I could end you I

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:52.720
mean that's pretty funny she came to

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.740
grips with the fact that she could

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.660
easily kill you and get away with it oh

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:56.919
yeah that was what she got out of the

00:32:56.919 --> 00:33:00.610
trip so that's [ __ ] bizarre how was

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:02.200
it after that be like what the [ __ ] and

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.850
how we just laughed about it that's so

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:05.679
[ __ ] funny yeah we were good well I

00:33:05.679 --> 00:33:07.210
feel like yeah anything like a gram and

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:09.940
a half to two ish it's like kind of like

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.370
being really really really really stoned

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:15.610
mm-hmm and you just kind of get giggly

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:17.860
and laughing [ __ ] yeah under glass well

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:18.970
the winner before last

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:22.120
I went up was I ski a lot - yeah went up

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.650
it was like Vermont in the winter by

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:24.130
myself

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:27.550
mm-hmm and skied all morning then I set

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:29.860
up in my car where I I blacked out like

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.030
all the windows he couldn't see in

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:34.090
mm-hmm I left some notes for myself like

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:35.440
to just remind me like everything was

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.490
gonna it was fine

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:38.920
don't panic hold up so you drove your

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.750
car blacked out you made yourself a

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:42.400
little cave yeah in my car then left

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.320
yourself notes like chill out yeah

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.170
What's in Vermont yeah what was that

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:50.050
like I took well I took it wasn't a ton

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:51.580
it was like bow like yours it was like

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.060
six grams dried so I I was a lot I guess

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:56.380
there's people out here taking like 20

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.760
grams like it's nothing I think that's a

00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.050
tolerance thing I think those people

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:01.120
take it a lot yeah makes sense actually

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.190
because I was like falling in that a

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:05.470
consciousness I didn't know my name for

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:08.290
a while yeah like I've read in the notes

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:10.180
and I'm like yeah everything's fine like

00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:13.120
yeah I guess everything's fine the notes

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.340
help yes everything's fine that's

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:16.930
actually like I know I mean I know this

00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:19.690
car is mine yeah like this is my car

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:21.580
everything's fine I don't know what the

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:23.290
[ __ ] going on I don't even know I

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:25.060
couldn't have told you who I was where I

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.370
worked I forgot that I had kids I had

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:30.400
nothing damn but it slowly it all came

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.500
back it is yet it's kind of nice when I

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.900
slowly [ __ ] do it was slowly just but

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.160
that was part of the past life thing

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:38.620
where I really felt like past lives

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:41.050
aren't [ __ ] yeah because I'm seeing

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:44.470
all these glimpses of myself like and it

00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:46.540
wasn't all like super far in the past I

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.340
was never anybody [ __ ] famous I'm

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:49.630
just like seeing like these Old West

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:51.880
like images yeah and like these images

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.380
of me running through the woods with

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:56.020
people I don't know and I'm like I think

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:57.220
this or glimpse was the [ __ ] other

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.930
why it's like this [ __ ] was while your

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.490
mom is laying in the car with your eyes

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:00.970
closed

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:02.530
I was just falling out of consciousness

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:04.360
yeah I would come to you and be like oh

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.490
[ __ ] like you know you know we're like

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:08.170
you look at the clock and it says like

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:11.620
4:30 and you kind of fall out and then

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:13.300
you come to you and you're like there's

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.070
it's and that was very dreamlike and you

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:16.600
come to and you're like oh [ __ ] what

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.000
time is it it's like oh it's 4:30 like I

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.470
see two hours ago

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:25.640
yeah let's see when I did like six or so

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.430
grams that was when like I was like

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:30.289
trying to kind of hang in my normal like

00:35:30.289 --> 00:35:32.059
everyday kind of consciousness I'm like

00:35:32.059 --> 00:35:33.619
I'm watching Wayne's World I'm with my

00:35:33.619 --> 00:35:35.720
friend then I felt myself being like

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.970
sucked into like the couch and was like

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:40.039
I gotta get out of here right I didn't

00:35:40.039 --> 00:35:41.569
have the mental tools to be like hey man

00:35:41.569 --> 00:35:43.910
like go sit down and breathe somewhere

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:45.410
and just focus on your breath before it

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:47.329
was like I was trying to maintain my

00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:48.920
like grip on reality being like no no I

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.390
can turn this around and it's just like

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:52.220
it's just for me it's the worst way to

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:54.170
approach it we had to just lay down and

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:55.549
close your eyes and be like [ __ ] man

00:35:55.549 --> 00:35:58.099
I know if I exhale my heart slows down

00:35:58.099 --> 00:36:00.500
and he'll slowly my nervous system will

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.029
kick in but that was the level where I

00:36:02.029 --> 00:36:03.349
couldn't tell the difference between

00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:05.269
night and day I was now tonight looking

00:36:05.269 --> 00:36:07.009
outside and it would happen to be like 4

00:36:07.009 --> 00:36:08.630
o'clock in the morning so like that came

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:10.250
the perfect like sky to look at when I

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:11.869
was like I was stuck on it like a

00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:13.279
different planet I was like oh [ __ ]

00:36:13.279 --> 00:36:16.640
yeah makes sense I think you said it's

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:17.660
one of those things especially when

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:20.029
you're falling into it yeah I think with

00:36:20.029 --> 00:36:21.589
sometimes with what with psychedelics in

00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:24.109
general you have to almost approach it

00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:26.420
where instead of you falling in it's

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:27.500
almost like something's pulling you

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.390
towards it but you don't the [ __ ] it is

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:31.250
but there's like there's something

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:34.220
pulling you yeah alien want to are you

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:36.109
taking off you can't stop it oh yeah

00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:37.430
it's like a train well it's almost

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:38.720
that's that's almost something to be

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.490
said for taking a ton because you don't

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:43.039
even have that like battle where you're

00:36:43.039 --> 00:36:44.960
kind of half aware of what's going on if

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.220
you take enough where just blast you out

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:47.539
you're just like all right what are we

00:36:47.539 --> 00:36:52.069
doing is it cool yeah we float which

00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:54.950
that sounds like always want to try yeah

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:56.839
I just with the combination I've done

00:36:56.839 --> 00:36:58.579
the flirting but I've never done the

00:36:58.579 --> 00:37:00.079
flirting with mushrooms it's pretty

00:37:00.079 --> 00:37:01.910
tight I've done it with smaller doses of

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:03.890
mushrooms know what's in [ __ ]

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:05.569
terrifying is eating a weed edible and

00:37:05.569 --> 00:37:07.339
floating in it to flow tank oh yeah

00:37:07.339 --> 00:37:09.740
that's for me that was like I ate some

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:11.269
mushrooms in the tank and I was like all

00:37:11.269 --> 00:37:12.529
right this is cool having fun

00:37:12.529 --> 00:37:14.480
hey what was I guess weed has more of

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.250
like a physiological for me you'll have

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:17.630
more of kind of like like my heart rate

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.099
will pick up a little bit I notice I'm

00:37:19.099 --> 00:37:21.289
in the tank when your heart rates fast

00:37:21.289 --> 00:37:23.349
and a sensory tank all you hear is

00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:27.319
moving yours in there so the weed for me

00:37:27.319 --> 00:37:28.819
I mean I'm I'm more prone to bugging out

00:37:28.819 --> 00:37:32.150
though so what are you like kind of do

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.740
you bug out of you some people aren't

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:34.960
prone to anxiety like

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.720
not normally like why have they once

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.300
normally no normally I'm fine yeah the

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:42.810
only time I really came close was with

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:45.880
more wrinkled receipts damn dude

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.470
I took a shitload of morning glory seeds

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:49.450
this is a while back

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:51.430
oh I've heard nothing but bad things I

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:54.010
was bad I and that they were fresh ones

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:55.660
I didn't have like the weed killer on

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.490
home okay like I made sure I got it they

00:37:57.490 --> 00:37:58.930
were good they were legit they were

00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:01.750
organic yeah nice I ground up 800 of

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:04.119
them and made a smoothie Jesus man and I

00:38:04.119 --> 00:38:07.060
downed them and I spent the better part

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:09.970
of three hours completely convinced I

00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:11.619
was gonna have a stroke any second oh

00:38:11.619 --> 00:38:14.230
like [ __ ] man like you could because you

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:15.790
could feel like all your veins and [ __ ]

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:18.190
like sega's vascular construction yeah

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:19.660

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:21.880
veins and I'm like wow it's like I guess

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.230
I'm you know like I've lived the good

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:25.270
life like I kind of accepted it I'm like

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:27.940
like I'm happy with what I've done

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:30.099
like I'm really [ __ ] my kids over

00:38:30.099 --> 00:38:33.609
here the kids they're really they could

00:38:33.609 --> 00:38:35.170
still use me for at least a few more

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:36.609
years they find this smoothie and

00:38:36.609 --> 00:38:37.570
they're like [ __ ]

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:39.580
yeah datura smooth well nobody was gonna

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:41.470
know how I went out I decided I'm just

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:44.530
going out and then yeah it was like good

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:46.510
three hours I was convinced I was dead

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:49.839
and then I threw up and as soon as I

00:38:49.839 --> 00:38:51.640
threw up I knew I was fine that's what's

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.349
up like everything went away like these

00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:55.150
crazy visuals came in and I'm like ah

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:56.109
[ __ ] I'm fine

00:38:56.109 --> 00:38:58.990
so yeah but it was a good three hours I

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:00.130
did learn one thing that trip though

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:02.619
well besides being convinced I was gonna

00:39:02.619 --> 00:39:04.440
die I walked around the house afterwards

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.880
and I'm looking at everything like the

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.500
dogs cast in these shadows where it's

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.869
got like these like dimensional images

00:39:10.869 --> 00:39:13.780
all around it mm-hmm until I get I go

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.220
downstairs there's the cat the cat

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:16.990
sitting there it's like in this little

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:19.089
[ __ ] bubble of protection the cat's

00:39:19.089 --> 00:39:22.599
not throwing any shadows not nothing

00:39:22.599 --> 00:39:24.040
everything else in the house is throwing

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.599
these [ __ ] like multi-dimensional

00:39:25.599 --> 00:39:27.250
shadows but yeah it's all like

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:29.740
tri-colored and sha Chi cat nothing I

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:32.550
looked down at the cat and the cats like

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:35.589
it's like I have this pride me but his

00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:37.030
voice in my head is just like what the

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:38.589
[ __ ] are you doing like you're supposed

00:39:38.589 --> 00:39:40.300
to be taking care of me and I'm just

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:41.880
like I'm gonna go lay down

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.910
Pat the cat I'm like yo money road you

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:47.080
learned that you can't depend on your

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:47.330
cat

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:49.160
emotionally that the cat [ __ ] knows

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.130
what I'm up to really that's what I

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:53.120
learned is he gotta watch that

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:56.660
[ __ ] dude that's editorial I've

00:39:56.660 --> 00:40:00.200
never never had the wander desire to eat

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.970
datura any kind of like the weirder

00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:03.530
things I don't really hear much about

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:07.010
yeah that was the visuals are real

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:10.220
similar to LSD okay but just a painful

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.410
way to get there yeah yeah I would never

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:15.500
do that again oh god no it's not like I

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:16.700
read some [ __ ] online that sounded like

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:19.340
a good idea I've rolled the dice you

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:22.190
know what it is 800 though well he said

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:23.900
active dose was like four hundred to a

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:27.760
thousand Jesus yeah see I'm all about

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.050
tipping the water a little bit and being

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:31.340
like right what does this feel if I take

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:32.390
a little bit of these and I feel

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:34.490
horrible well I tried a hundred the day

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:36.110
before it I didn't feel nothing happened

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:37.490
nothing that make sense that's why I

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:39.140
just went with the 8 it's gonna fade

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:42.650
fold yeah everyone's gonna kill me what

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:44.750
you gonna do so how about the in terms

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:47.780
of uh this is what I want so badly to be

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:49.400
here or you know anywhere else really I

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.620
don't care but just a place where you

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:54.050
can go that people can go do them and

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:56.480
set up so it would be like a just a

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.490
shared kind of studio space like you

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:00.560
like an art studio for what 500 bucks a

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:08.750
month kind like a crack house would be

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:09.830
nice to have a place where people get

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:11.330
his block off schedules and have like a

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:13.340
mindfulness relaxation space and it's

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.170
have it on the slide that like oh and

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:16.910
you can you know bring a friend and yeah

00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:18.740
and not have to cost you a fortune like

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:20.570
a safe trip space basically yeah and

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:22.130
then you can kind of slowly find the

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:23.750
experts in the field who's there are

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:25.070
like meetups and all the stuff online

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:26.690
you could try to find people to come in

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:29.030
okay try to bring some if they were

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:30.200
gonna place to go where a doctor could

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.400
just hook you up take your vitals make

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:31.910
you're good to go

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:33.590
that'd be the best they'll be [ __ ]

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.210
all I don't understand we have like the

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:37.400
apparently John Hopkins these days John

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.920
Hopkins uh yeah John Hopkins is doing it

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.870
and I think there's a lot of places in

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:43.340
Philly now that are like a lot of

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:44.540
hospitals that are starting to grow we

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:45.770
eat and start doing it starting to do

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:48.730
research good dude we have the medical

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:51.440
prowess so I hope people up scan them

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.120
properly and then we can do these things

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:56.150
in like wild doses and then again if it

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:57.500
starts going off the rails BAM here's a

00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.660
sedative like cool it out so we could do

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.750
this I think like flaw

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:03.520
oh yeah they can just give you a benzo

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.660
to it completely just bring it right

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:06.700
down exactly or like even said like let

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:08.230
people kind of you know let them go and

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:09.520
you know like you can say before like

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.710
hey like I want to go a little harder so

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:13.900
let me let me be then if it gets like

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:15.400
the point we're thrashing and convulsing

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.930
it's like BAM benzo you know I think

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:19.000
normally as long as you're you know as

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.010
long as you're not physically in danger

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:23.020
you're gonna come back you're gonna come

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.670
down yeah unless you said you're that

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:27.280
rare schizophrenic case but exactly most

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.540
of that most of those go in their

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.010
twenties though don't they yeah pretty

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:31.990
much what's gonna happen if it's gonna

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:34.510
have it all some people kind of some

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:36.070
people there's there can be people who

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:38.590
kind of like have such a stressful event

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:41.170
that it can kind of like okay get some

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:43.060
out a little bit but yeah typically when

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.470
you're schizophrenic it pops out like

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:46.300
your early 20s yes I don't have any

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.830
never had like a family history with

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:49.600
that or anything yeah but I definitely

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.880
felt with mushrooms before even would

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.800
like the micro dosing because I always

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.270
felt like I was kind of sensitive to it

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:56.680
with the micro nursing like I would take

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:58.030
half a gram and I would definitely feel

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:01.840
it yeah and there were times when I kind

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.790
of step back cuz everything starts to

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:06.010
get slippery yeah like you really start

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:07.420
being like alright I think I might be

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.220
[ __ ] losing my grip on reality like

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:10.450
I'm gonna need to step back for a little

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:12.790
while yeah let everything Risa Lydda fie

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.470
and then you know they maybe will try

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:16.990
again that was my experience with him we

00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:18.490
did like two solid months of micro

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:20.050
dosing yeah I need a bunch of my dogs

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:23.140
and it was like three personally it was

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:26.230
like it's cool for I only need to do it

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:27.310
that's everyone's so different was I

00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:29.410
only need to do that like once or twice

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:30.940
a month I don't even need to do it once

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.430
or twice a month but my max is like once

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:34.840
or twice a month when I was doing that

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:36.340
like every three days by the end of the

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:37.300
month like it's like you're saying

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:39.730
things start getting like real slippery

00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:41.410
like the laying awake before bedtime

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:43.420
those thoughts become real bizarre and

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.250
erratic for me you can just close your

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:48.280
eyes and see the colors and kind of like

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.750
it is it is like you're saying it's a

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:51.190
smaller dose ours were like I think like

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:54.520
0.25 or 0.3 and still for me it's I

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:55.690
think it's just about your neuro

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:57.070
chemistry some people you didn't be like

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:59.500
I went took a nap right away I eat it

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.810
and I'm like I'm buzzing man my thoughts

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:03.220
are moving I think it depends on just

00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:04.270
kind of like how are your thoughts oh

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:06.190
you can't even sleep for hours that's

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:07.660
how I am doing I take a cup of coffee

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:08.590
for me mm-hmm

00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:11.170
so yeah I'm the same way like so I have

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:12.670
seen that though or someone will take

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:15.160
half a gram and they can apply

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.529
yeah but makes everybody's different

00:44:17.529 --> 00:44:19.420
it's weird mm-hmm I wish I wasn't as

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:21.309
sensitive I like I'm already kind of

00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:23.170
spun out my baseline is like kind of

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:25.089
spun out anyway mm-hmm so when anything

00:44:25.089 --> 00:44:27.130
hits me like that it's just like it's

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:29.079
one of the Lu typically I've been pretty

00:44:29.079 --> 00:44:30.489
good with like cooling myself out

00:44:30.489 --> 00:44:32.529
because I never had any sort of like

00:44:32.529 --> 00:44:33.759
weird anxiety around that when I was

00:44:33.759 --> 00:44:36.069
younger and then I had again I had that

00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:38.289
like just ultra-mega you know for me the

00:44:38.289 --> 00:44:39.849
mega dose of like almost seven grams

00:44:39.849 --> 00:44:42.279
yeah and just completely didn't know

00:44:42.279 --> 00:44:44.109
anything about it didn't know any sort

00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:46.689
of like mindfulness technique I was

00:44:46.689 --> 00:44:48.880
convinced that I had done it I did

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:52.269
myself in and I swear that like and

00:44:52.269 --> 00:44:53.499
there's also a lot of like anxiety

00:44:53.499 --> 00:44:56.259
genetic and like my family at least I'd

00:44:56.259 --> 00:44:58.689
say my mom's side so it's like I think I

00:44:58.689 --> 00:45:00.519
definitely kind of like pull the curtain

00:45:00.519 --> 00:45:02.259
off of that it was like oh okay this is

00:45:02.259 --> 00:45:03.789
what it is so I did have anxiety pretty

00:45:03.789 --> 00:45:06.219
bad for like my early 20s and like kind

00:45:06.219 --> 00:45:07.539
of turned the ship on that which was a

00:45:07.539 --> 00:45:09.459
pretty sick process honestly to go

00:45:09.459 --> 00:45:11.109
through because if you think about it

00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:13.989
it's like so I you know if I somehow

00:45:13.989 --> 00:45:16.989
activated you know an anxiety response

00:45:16.989 --> 00:45:19.479
younger I was able then at a younger age

00:45:19.479 --> 00:45:21.939
to like Trek kind of slog through that

00:45:21.939 --> 00:45:23.380
and spin that around where there's like

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:25.239
if that [ __ ] it's kind of late in and

00:45:25.239 --> 00:45:27.009
comes out I know people in their 40s and

00:45:27.009 --> 00:45:28.599
50s you start getting anxiety attacks

00:45:28.599 --> 00:45:30.880
and that's been [ __ ] hellish you've

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.039
never experienced exactly already 40 you

00:45:33.039 --> 00:45:34.539
have all this responsibility like I was

00:45:34.539 --> 00:45:36.160
able to kind of slog around in my 20s

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:38.319
and like put those pieces ago that's the

00:45:38.319 --> 00:45:39.789
only way I can describe it you have like

00:45:39.789 --> 00:45:42.729
bad panic attacks regularly you can

00:45:42.729 --> 00:45:46.059
either medicate or just do like

00:45:46.059 --> 00:45:48.640
existential self questioning and

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:50.619
exploration and get yourself out of that

00:45:50.619 --> 00:45:51.999
but it's it sounds when you explain it

00:45:51.999 --> 00:45:52.900
to people they're like yeah dude

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:54.809
whatever it sounds crazy but it's like

00:45:54.809 --> 00:45:57.519
no it's kind of it yeah exactly and I

00:45:57.519 --> 00:46:00.609
think the like the ability to take

00:46:00.609 --> 00:46:02.410
mushrooms and or anything like that and

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:03.849
be in that spot we're like I'm gonna bug

00:46:03.849 --> 00:46:05.979
I'm gonna bug and be like no dude you're

00:46:05.979 --> 00:46:07.539
not gonna and be the authority on your

00:46:07.539 --> 00:46:09.339
own emotional state dude it it's

00:46:09.339 --> 00:46:11.319
profound but it's such a silly easy

00:46:11.319 --> 00:46:12.640
thing to say like no you just tell

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:14.619
yourself you're gonna be fine people are

00:46:14.619 --> 00:46:16.449
gonna obviously and it's like well yeah

00:46:16.449 --> 00:46:17.949
so you get there yeah exactly it's like

00:46:17.949 --> 00:46:20.619
I can miss myself the one time I think a

00:46:20.619 --> 00:46:21.579
lot of times with mushrooms like

00:46:21.579 --> 00:46:22.749
especially when it makes you question

00:46:22.749 --> 00:46:25.089
like everything you've done yeah I

00:46:25.089 --> 00:46:27.519
generally think I'm a piece of [ __ ] most

00:46:27.519 --> 00:46:28.240
days

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.550
I'm already there like I said in bed and

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:31.930
I'll be like oh what the [ __ ] is wrong

00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:32.380
with me

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:34.330
yeah and like for no good reason like I

00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:36.460
have a good life I have a good family I

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.290
have a decent job but still you sit in

00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:40.180
bed and you're like I know like I'm just

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.520
a [ __ ] like it is how this is how life

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:45.520
is yeah and but I think if you push that

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.050
far now if you take the mushrooms and

00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:48.040
like yeah I already know I'm a [ __ ]

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.240
like what else you got

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.520
yeah yeah no that's fair yeah show me

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.720
some good [ __ ] I can also have the

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:54.010
opposite effect cuz then you take them

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:55.420
and you're like you get detached from

00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:56.800
your normal reality and when you when

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.180
you come back to it you're like oh my

00:46:58.180 --> 00:46:59.859
god I love my normal reality think of an

00:46:59.859 --> 00:47:01.720
or yeah it's so easy here I think it's

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.460
like kind of you know I've done it

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:04.900
before I'm like super spun out and I

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:06.490
come back into the normal realm and I'm

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:09.130
this like is the best I can take a bath

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:11.410
right now yes alright yeah everything

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:13.119
just looks amazing especially if you had

00:47:13.119 --> 00:47:14.980
a hard time I think if it's been a rough

00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:16.570
no I wouldn't say badger but oh just a

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:18.339
rough trip and like it's yeah went

00:47:18.339 --> 00:47:20.619
through a lot yes for sure the next day

00:47:20.619 --> 00:47:23.050
you're just smiling ear-to-ear like in

00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:24.520
you'll see one of the ventually but like

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:25.960
with me like with the kids I'm just like

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.390
you guys are amazing guys the best like

00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:29.710
I hated you guys yesterday but yeah

00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:31.570
today like luckiest [ __ ] in the

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:33.099
world that's what I really think would

00:47:33.099 --> 00:47:34.630
be really good for that for parenting

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:37.030
especially like cuz I I fit in like it's

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:39.190
a big reset yeah cuz I feel that again I

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:41.020
don't I don't have kids yet but I feel

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.030
like you could get into the realm of

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:44.830
being like you [ __ ] again like

00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:46.480
oh my god and then like you know it's

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.190
like it's like watching the movie hook

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:49.630
and you're like oh yeah I should throw

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:51.400
my cellphone into the river like rat and

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.630
this I've been paying attention that a

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:53.890
lot of time I feel like a lot of movies

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:56.410
are kind of pushing that same message

00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:58.450
like over and over be like be nice to

00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:00.670
people don't take things too seriously

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:03.339
like I just watched elf same thing don't

00:48:03.339 --> 00:48:04.930
take things too seriously like look for

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:07.780
the magic just watch The Grinch today be

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:08.740
nice to everybody

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.690
don't get too into get like all these

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:11.980
movies think about it's almost the same

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:13.540
message you're over and over it for the

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:15.580
most part it's a good message it is I

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:16.930
think most of people making those movies

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:18.820
take themselves incredibly seriously all

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:21.070
the time I know which is odd but it's

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:22.930
weird that's the storyline that keeps

00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:24.640
being pushed over and over and over like

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:25.990
hook like here's a dad he's not thinking

00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:27.339
about his kids he throws a cellphone in

00:48:27.339 --> 00:48:28.930
the river everybody's happy and they hug

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:31.540
at the end and you feel like yes he

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:33.339
didn't he pulled he threw his cell phone

00:48:33.339 --> 00:48:36.700
his shitty big bulky cell phone so I

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:38.200
think you can rather than watching hook

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.210
you can just [ __ ] in just a mushrooms

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:41.119
exactly

00:48:41.119 --> 00:48:42.740
there you go or excited you could just

00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:44.869
smoked DMT be done a 15 minutes instead

00:48:44.869 --> 00:48:46.519
of five hours yeah when I was curious

00:48:46.519 --> 00:48:48.170
about that so after what's the like

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:50.150
you're done in 15 minutes but like I

00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:52.039
guess can you hop in a car and rip away

00:48:52.039 --> 00:48:54.109
or like what's like the lag time no I

00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:56.180
would say 15 minutes generally is the

00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:58.099
total time like within 15 minutes you

00:48:58.099 --> 00:49:01.430
are back to baseline like the actual

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:03.319
super [ __ ] up you think you're in

00:49:03.319 --> 00:49:05.240
another dimension part of mushroom or of

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:09.680
DMT is roughly five minutes tops at

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:12.109
least in my experience and I've smoked

00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:14.720
as much as I can get in in three hits to

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.430
the point where I forgot I had a body

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:20.180
she maxed out for me five minutes your

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:21.859
bat you're starting to come back 15

00:49:21.859 --> 00:49:23.599
minutes you feel completely normal it's

00:49:23.599 --> 00:49:26.690
crazy that's bizarre oh it's it's just

00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:29.900
insane it can feel like a lot longer but

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.970
maybe I said I've been I've had I don't

00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:33.650
know some crazy experiences with it just

00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:34.880
not the level of what I've heard other

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:37.220
people talk about I like those blinding

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.799
so have you tried different like did you

00:49:39.799 --> 00:49:41.180
extract from both plants

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:43.880
I've tried those two plants yeah gotcha

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.319
yeah the ones just trickier because it

00:49:45.319 --> 00:49:47.180
has like plant fat and it takes extra

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:48.289
steps to clean it out

00:49:48.289 --> 00:49:51.200
God your extra cleanup steps but so what

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.299
percentage if you had to estimate DMT

00:49:53.299 --> 00:49:54.890
would that be it would that be like an

00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:57.950
isolate or is that like I'm sure there's

00:49:57.950 --> 00:50:00.410
a percentage of plant material in it

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:02.329
sure but not much so that would be like

00:50:02.329 --> 00:50:04.400
a DMT isolate then yeah it's close yeah

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.589
there's probably I think something like

00:50:06.589 --> 00:50:09.769
that is probably around 90% viewers in

00:50:09.769 --> 00:50:11.480
that range got you through that through

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:12.680
that process is what they claimed

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.239
obviously I've never seen it tested but

00:50:14.239 --> 00:50:16.819
sure and if you wash it out again then

00:50:16.819 --> 00:50:19.400
it gets a little bit clearer but like

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:20.869
the yellowish tint that it sometimes has

00:50:20.869 --> 00:50:23.539
is usually plant back gotcha yeah okay

00:50:23.539 --> 00:50:26.299
that's what's up mm-hmm and it's like

00:50:26.299 --> 00:50:27.980
said it's always I've never had any

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:30.589
issues with it it's just I think if you

00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:33.559
go in too often DMT can be ugly really

00:50:33.559 --> 00:50:35.089
DMT is one word yeah you just want to

00:50:35.089 --> 00:50:36.380
take it easy like people that start

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:37.880
doing it two three times a day for like

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:38.299
a month

00:50:38.299 --> 00:50:40.700
people do that yeah if you go on the

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.589
forums and stuff people get crazy yeah

00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:44.119
why why why do people just they have a

00:50:44.119 --> 00:50:45.319
good experience and they just want to

00:50:45.319 --> 00:50:46.549
keep going back and they wanna go back

00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:48.289
and back and then eventually that's when

00:50:48.289 --> 00:50:49.789
you have that like hell nightmare

00:50:49.789 --> 00:50:51.440
experience where you're like I'm never

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:52.720
listen to [ __ ] for the rest of my life

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:54.360
Wow

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:56.640
yes I think if you tell if you just do

00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.920
it occasionally like every couple months

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:01.140
like go for a visit you're fine yeah at

00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:03.120
least from my experience every is a

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.340
little bit and go yeah that's what I

00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:07.200
usually do is like if it's been a while

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.940
you know I mean let me dip my toe back

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:09.870
in mm-hmm

00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:12.330
and I said I can I I can get the

00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:13.500
breakthrough I can get enough to get to

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:15.750
that space I've seen that I've heard the

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:17.970
entities but the [ __ ] ignore me like

00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:20.310
maybe eventually they won't maybe

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:21.990
they'll start talking to me but so what

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:23.340
you Lotus be like you're just like kind

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:24.710
of eavesdropping you know and like a

00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:26.670
conversation kind of I'm just kind of

00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:27.630
standing there and they're just like

00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:28.530
there's like all this [ __ ] happening

00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:30.660
around me but I'm not a part of it weird

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:36.150
yeah that means I have more more lives

00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:38.130
to live or something I'm not closing I'm

00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:41.220
not close enough to leveling up that

00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:43.220
they gave him care to didn't notice me

00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:45.330
I've kind of hurt my feelings either

00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:47.120
come down revealing what the [ __ ] guys

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:49.110
then again it's probably better than

00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:50.730
having I've heard that too I've heard

00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:52.170
people get greedy with it and kind of

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:54.090
like have like a horrible time which I'm

00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:57.090
yeah oh my gig like a chemical Stan I

00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:59.220
wonder what if people would reduce it to

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:00.900
being like it's just you know chemicals

00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:02.610
in your brain I mean I'm doing it too

00:52:02.610 --> 00:52:04.980
many why would it be then interpreted by

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:06.270
your brain it's like like all right give

00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:07.770
them like a hellish experience now and

00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:10.710
it's like your heart yeah where they

00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:12.150
tell you they're gonna kill you and then

00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:13.440
eventually throw you out kind of thing

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.570
like yeah you read crazy [ __ ] that

00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:17.400
happens to people that's why I said I've

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.320
never tried to do with that maaan

00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:21.720
something I don't want that yeah okay

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.280
I'm good I'll just take my occasional

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.410
nice experience with it it's hanging out

00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:27.690
yeah medium mushroom doses like where I

00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:29.130
feel like I learned something yeah

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:30.870
that's that's me still thinking of you

00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:34.320
go to the DMT realm they hey guys talk

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:38.460
about what kind of stuff have you heard

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:40.440
entities talk about or is just like

00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:43.380
garbles of noise no it's more just like

00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:45.120
I don't even remember at this point yes

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.490
more yet I may have for a minute when I

00:52:47.490 --> 00:52:48.840
came out of it but it was nothing like

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.030
new life-changing revelations gotcha

00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:54.000
yeah it's just like I knew it was going

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.530
on around me and I wasn't the part of it

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:56.550
that's interesting

00:52:56.550 --> 00:52:58.770
mm-hmm that's what's up dude thanks for

00:52:58.770 --> 00:53:00.960
sharing the knowledge and uh teaching

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.880
people how to make all that stuff is

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.320
that that'll be that'll be tight man

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.180
people start making this stuff it's not

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:07.920
hard and if they look online

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.630
there's tons of instructions how to do

00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:11.369
everything yeah yeah there's like the

00:53:11.369 --> 00:53:13.680
dmt nexus it has instructions for

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:15.569
extracting DMT we're actually told you

00:53:15.569 --> 00:53:16.950
had you know all the ratios and how to

00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:19.530
do it properly and the methods work

00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:22.049
they're simple and yeah there's same

00:53:22.049 --> 00:53:23.640
thing with the mushroom sites

00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:25.290
what kind of ventilation do you kind of

00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:28.859
suggest when doing the DMT stuff as far

00:53:28.859 --> 00:53:31.680
as like like the solvents evaporated is

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.809
that just like go evaporated normally

00:53:33.809 --> 00:53:36.480
well we're not not all of it because

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.220
you'll I'll pour off everything I have

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:40.890
and I'm not put in the freezer Danny

00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:42.809
it's like solvent he stay yeah well the

00:53:42.809 --> 00:53:44.430
solvent stays in that state put in the

00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:46.500
freezer the DMT drops out and it falls

00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:48.150
to the bottom and crystallizes on the

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:50.490
bottom of the dish and then I did I pour

00:53:50.490 --> 00:53:53.010
the solvent back into the container and

00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:55.410
then just what's left on there is what I

00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:58.410
hit hit put a fan over and let sure that

00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:00.119
makes sense no way you're not wasting it

00:54:00.119 --> 00:54:02.880
yes you're not evaporating big fat like

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.819
pools of burbling like bubbling [ __ ]

00:54:05.819 --> 00:54:08.099
chemicals off yeah so it's not as methyl

00:54:08.099 --> 00:54:11.849
ABI as one might think no no the worst

00:54:11.849 --> 00:54:13.650
smells from the whole thing is pride

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:15.690
vinegar if you're using white vinegar

00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:18.660
yeah the vinegar stinks it does stink

00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:20.910
but it doesn't smell as bad as whatever

00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:25.920
the other one you said was yeah yeah no

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:27.630
it's like said yeah it's also for it's

00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:30.089
all you can do all that right at Lowe's

00:54:30.089 --> 00:54:33.780
or Home Depot nice go to my general

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:35.549
practitioner indeed hooked me up I'm

00:54:35.549 --> 00:54:38.700
going in yeah I think he was safe I said

00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:39.630
you don't have to deal with scumbags

00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:42.510
that way so exactly yeah oh sure the

00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:45.150
beauty of that the homebrew shaman it is

00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:46.710
dude like I said it's just nice like I

00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:48.059
hear people will say it all the time

00:54:48.059 --> 00:54:49.680
like I don't want to go like meet up

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.270
with some dude and you're in some weird

00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:53.730
apartment just [ __ ] you don't want

00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:55.559
that you nerd out step if you're

00:54:55.559 --> 00:54:57.180
listening to step up for one of your all

00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:59.609
your boys start [ __ ] making this [ __ ]

00:54:59.609 --> 00:55:02.490
yeah just exactly supply your local

00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:05.460
community exactly and you know don't go

00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:06.630
crazy don't just hand them out like

00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:08.730
candy just make sure people are of a

00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:11.010
sound state yeah my general rule is if

00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:12.869
I'm talking to somebody like you can

00:55:12.869 --> 00:55:14.490
kind of feel somebody out and we'll talk

00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:15.839
about like I might throw it out there

00:55:15.839 --> 00:55:17.430
we'll talk about it a little bit and if

00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:19.680
they start asking like you know how you

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:21.540
get them yeah maybe then I'll come

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:22.170
across

00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:23.820
yeah and I'm not just randomly be like

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:25.230
hey you want some mushrooms yeah

00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:26.250
yeah what percentage would you say

00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:27.870
people in your line of work [ __ ] with

00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:32.160
psychedelics roughly not high one higher

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.770
than before I started like it's went up

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:36.390
where I work since I started yeah

00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:38.880
because I I probably shared with a dozen

00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.590
different people there got you they'd

00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:42.810
have done mushroom since then so what is

00:55:42.810 --> 00:55:44.340
that like when they come back to that

00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:48.090
setting most of them I think most of you

00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:49.290
just have like the good time with it

00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:50.850
gosh I got a lot of missed the big

00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:53.070
picture not all of them it's a good time

00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:54.300
Charlie come back is a good time

00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:56.370
Charlie's yeah but honestly like there

00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:57.810
is another dude there that went the

00:55:57.810 --> 00:55:58.410
other way

00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:00.810
like he went full [ __ ] Ram Dass on his

00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:02.670
[ __ ] did he really yeah like now he

00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:04.410
won't touch any psychedelics and it's

00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:05.880
all about like this spiritual path

00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:07.950
that's what's up yeah he went hard I

00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:09.660
think that's kind of the point of them

00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:11.280
though I think that really is I think if

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:12.840
you can do enough of them to where you

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:14.610
can Rahm das out it's like dude you win

00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:16.710
Congrats maybe I still like to make in a

00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:18.180
road I'm gonna take the middle I mean

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:19.950
there tell ya where I keep checking back

00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:21.510

00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:22.950
in I know it's there I can check back in

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:24.420
that's pretty tight no dude nothing

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:26.250
wrong with that either yeah I think

00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:27.530
