math lois if you're gonna insist on

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:49.040
somehow finding my leg no matter what

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.640
position i put it in to get it away from

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.760
you

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.519
so you can shake it with your crazy

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:55.279
twitchy legs

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:56.880
i mean you're gonna have to pick one or

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.880
the other you can't search for my leg

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.720
yeah jay at a certain point i'm sitting

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.120
with my foot out like a weirdo

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.560
if anyone sees stepping under this thing

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.160
it doesn't it looks wrong the way i'm

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.720
sitting i'm doing that simply it really

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.200
does jay can i be honest with you yeah

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.760
you are expecting um different results

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.680
when we come in there's a saying there

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.120
you know something yeah i i know what

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.040
you're going for people go for it doing

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.240
something and expecting something

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.519
different it was this guy called the

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:25.120
sanity when you do the same thing and

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.200
expect different results you're insane

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.399
oh

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:29.760
you're insane

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.360
because you sit here every week and i

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.120
shake my leg every single week for you

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.720
know at least a year now can we switch

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.680
spots

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.839
no why that's where you said that's

00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:39.839
where i sit yeah but i'm as good as i

00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:42.480
mix things up a little bit louis the leg

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.320
things the whole ordeal maybe dave's

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.680
legs would be great to shake now why

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.760
would why would you two switching seats

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.000
change the leg dynamic at all because it

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.360
seems to be like i'm shaking this leg

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.880
right now you got a lot of room over

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.720
here though yeah come on water's nice

00:11:58.079 --> 00:11:59.360

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.600
from you how about that [ __ ] face i hope

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.000
let's see yeah

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.680
man it felt great now he's shaking his

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.519
leg and he's driving out of my mind

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:08.320
yeah

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.320
it's a nightmare is that how it feels

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.680
how could you possibly be funny with

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.519
that because when you do it you're

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:14.880
definitely like you just it's like

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.639
hooking my leg and now we're both you

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:17.839
know what i'm doing legs you know what

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:19.760
i'm doing to you no i'm actually making

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.079
you funnier can i tell you how

00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:24.959
how because i'm creating this you're my

00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:26.959
motivation isn't it i'm my motivation

00:12:26.959 --> 00:12:27.760
now

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.160
i am your motivation your muse but

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.519
that's not the point that i'm making i

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:32.480
can't

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.040
i can't argue you might be my muse

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.279
hold on i'm going to tear them out so

00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:39.360
what happens is i'm giving this giving

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.200
you this variable similarly to how when

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.800
people train for mma they will put on

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.839
like uh masks that the the training so

00:12:45.839 --> 00:12:47.440
much restrict your oxygen like a high

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.519
altitude fight yes jay has to be funny

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:51.600
with his thigh being shaking exactly so

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.720
you're even though you're being annoyed

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.800
and distracted i'm still making you so

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.079
when you come out of this you're waiting

00:12:56.079 --> 00:12:58.079
the bat down i have to be honest dude

00:12:58.079 --> 00:13:00.160
you know what's weird i now that i think

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.480
about it i can't remember a time you

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.399
were funny when lewis wasn't shaking

00:13:04.399 --> 00:13:05.839
your leg uh

00:13:05.839 --> 00:13:07.600
so it's to see if i could be funny in

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.360
what most would call intolerable

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.920

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.519

okay you play more of it

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.680
isabella's six feet tall i feel like she

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.120
would take the rig on the shoulder like

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.040
the human uh [ __ ] the rock person

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.720
from fantastic four

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.320
just turn into it and punch the front of

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.240
it into the game

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.320
it was a myth

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.160
kids used to dare each other to go into

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.510
the woods at night

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.920
[Music]

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.440
it's just not herman munson munster the

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.399
power of that place

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.560
also children are always terrifying

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:51.360
children and body masks those woods

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.959
belong to something else

00:15:54.959 --> 00:15:56.639
i still feel like with evil children i

00:15:56.639 --> 00:15:58.800
run towards the problem

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.079
these folks are punching them yeah

00:16:02.079 --> 00:16:03.440
i mean if they're phantoms when it goes

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.440
right go go back for a second

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.600
right every time look at the cat they

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.279
cast it for this like that is just a

00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:11.040
normal cat it's not actually a dead cat

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.399
like what do they do to that cat to make

00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:14.720
it look that way

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.759
they really

00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:18.480
rolled it around in [ __ ] feces and

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:22.480
it was in the makeup chair since 5 a.m

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.240
he's going to die it's a big day of cats

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.440
the ground

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.160
is bad

00:16:34.839 --> 00:16:38.639
maybe there's some crazy folktale

00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:42.320
but there is something up in those woods

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.720
it looks pretty good you can't deny it

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.480

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.800

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.320
there's a protest outside of barnes and

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.480
nobles which one is this good god

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.280
probably one by me

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.080
is it what is it

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.760
that might be upper east side there's a

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.600
protest outside the bed bath and beyond

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.520
we are yeah this is the protest

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.720
and it's like all covered they're

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.640
protesting the kumi endorsed new neck

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.799
pillow at bed bath and beyond

00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:23.840
they're

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.600
so first of all the fact that harry

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.679
turjanian is going to protest anthony

00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:29.440
comey

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.559
that was good for anybody that knows

00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:31.600
harry potter

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.440
was not bad at all i got it

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.760
zac amico i can't say

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.679
even if he's not calling himself a crowd

00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:40.799
is two people a protest

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.039
these are a few so now you can be one

00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:45.600
degree removed from the proud boys you

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.120
know a guy who knows a guy will get a

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.880
protest going

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.320
initially

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.760
can we see what these signs say whether

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.760
or not it would only help to draw

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.160
attention towards towards his book

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.200
signing

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.520
um but

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.919
you know the necessity outweigh

00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:03.280
somebody because you watched literally

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.120
in this room pause it for a second if

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.200
you watch this for a sec like there's

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.120
been a hundred people that have walked

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.840
by and nobody gives a [ __ ]

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.360
they're just walking by

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.880
they don't really give a [ __ ] it's it's

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.000
you're like trying to drum up this

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.159
interest but like you have to have

00:20:18.159 --> 00:20:20.480
so little going on in your life

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.440
to protest ant's book signing at barnes

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.799
and nobles most of people are just like

00:20:24.799 --> 00:20:26.159
dude i'm going to pick up my kid and

00:20:26.159 --> 00:20:26.960
they're like but there's a white

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.200
supremacist at barnes and nobles like

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.400
like barnes and noble's still around i

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.360
thought they closed isn't it just

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.600
bizarre i get my books on amazon isn't

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.159
it just bizarre like the freedom she has

00:20:36.159 --> 00:20:38.240
to like protest like that

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.080
is like the [ __ ] uh

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.760
the same reason why you have to go like

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.679
well place i guess they want to let what

00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:45.280
you deem to be a white supremacist to a

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.559
book signing

00:20:46.559 --> 00:20:48.240
you know what i mean like yeah the same

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.840
thing like applies for both like that

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.280
she's allowed the reason she's able to

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.000
do that is the same reason like a place

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.919
can let if you see freedom of speech

00:20:55.919 --> 00:20:57.120
yeah i'm saying it's like a weird thing

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.480
that's like protesting is just a bizarre

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.159
concept but no one gets what are you

00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:01.840
going to accomplish i mean i guess you

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.960
you're trying to stop somebody from

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.840
doing something you know what i mean

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.360
like something you believe is trying to

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.120
stop somebody else is that the news that

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.320
covered that

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.840
[ __ ] small

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.919
is that sam roberts

00:22:57.919 --> 00:23:00.080

like 20 or 30 minutes they shut down the

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.000
book signing because the place was

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.760
getting calls and so he was escorted out

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.280

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.240

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.919
of that had to do with the um

00:24:07.919 --> 00:24:10.240

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.600
for all i want to go back what was the

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.919

so jay you sent me something that i

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.159
thought was pretty funny i didn't watch

any of it yet but it's a band that you

00:25:30.799 --> 00:25:33.520
said up and comers i believe is what you

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.000
told me yeah yeah they're up-and-comers

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.960
i think they've been around since the

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.200
70s but i i thought i never heard of

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.039
them before i think somebody sent to me

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:42.320
on social media i'm sorry if i'm

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.240
forgetting uh who it is

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.600
but it was a

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.919
band called the mentors

00:25:47.919 --> 00:25:49.520
and i didn't know who they were but it's

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.080
they're the self-proclaimed

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:56.159
rape rock band whoa louis there you go

00:25:56.159 --> 00:25:57.360
so louis

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.200
you do have a genre

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.240
um

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.159
now you can finally find a pandora

00:26:02.159 --> 00:26:04.000
playlist that suits your tastes yeah

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.919
rape rock maybe did you think they it

00:26:05.919 --> 00:26:07.360
was a typo and they meant to write rap

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.240
rock

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.600
they're like you know what that's better

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.120
no dude it's

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.919
it is in fact uh rape rock but one the

00:26:13.919 --> 00:26:16.080
guy i think the singer of this band

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.000
that's why i want to look this up

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.919
i was involved somehow one of those kurt

00:26:19.919 --> 00:26:22.240
and courtney documentaries as a person

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.799
they were saying they think i think oh

00:26:24.799 --> 00:26:26.480
you know what it is

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.559
now i think i remember it better i think

00:26:28.559 --> 00:26:30.880
he says that courtney love offered him

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.640
money to kill

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.559
kirk cobain says he didn't take it and

00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:36.000
judging by his music he should have

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.360
taken that he's

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.559
if she would have offered me money to

00:26:38.559 --> 00:26:40.799
rape him i would have done it he's like

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:42.880
now i wasn't going to take it although i

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.159
did need money for a synthesizer

00:26:46.159 --> 00:26:47.679
we're really trying to tighten up the

00:26:47.679 --> 00:26:50.400
sound of the rape rock so it's a bit of

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.159
a it's a bit of a dirty subject matter

00:26:52.159 --> 00:26:53.679
so we try to tighten up the engine where

00:26:53.679 --> 00:26:54.880
did you hear that they were rape rock

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.240
though where did you get this concept

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.240
from i think it was a headline that says

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.640
rape rock band uh

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.600
the the mentors something about just

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.440
like where

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.320
i i think somebody said rape rock weekly

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.480
rape

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.559
oh you guys don't get it

00:27:12.559 --> 00:27:14.480
it's a trade paper i think you have to

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.559
be

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.279
oh there's a bunch of rape rock bands

00:27:19.279 --> 00:27:20.720

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.200

the harmony dave are you not

00:31:26.799 --> 00:31:28.480

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.559
having a moment he uh stole the lyrics

00:31:30.559 --> 00:31:33.440
from my wedding vows yeah so i just

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.640

she had every opportunity to say no she

00:31:45.279 --> 00:31:47.039
was so far she could have said no during

00:31:47.039 --> 00:31:50.159
the finding her it's at least the field

00:31:50.159 --> 00:31:51.519
feelings where you really want to take

00:31:51.519 --> 00:31:53.039
off i feel like that's the spot that's

00:31:53.039 --> 00:31:54.720
where i know should come in right right

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.880
there [ __ ] but if you get the [ __ ]

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.000

and say he doesn't he has to remember

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.360
you yeah and it seems like her problem

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.960
was really when he forgot her and it's

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.320
like i'm sorry he never said this was

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.159
serious yeah now she might maybe do a

00:32:06.159 --> 00:32:07.919
false rape shopping a false rape charge

00:32:07.919 --> 00:32:10.000
which is like likely to happen

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.600
sort of a false bill of goods this guy's

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.200
the victim in this story this is duke

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.720
lacrosse all over again that's what i'm

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.600
saying dude i said she raped him

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.440
let's see if the fourth verse changes

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.360
anything up by the way we're not saying

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.799
we're offended by this you call this

00:32:22.799 --> 00:32:24.640
rape rock this ain't rape

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:25.679
by the way we're gonna write our own

00:32:25.679 --> 00:32:29.200
rape rock strong hold on

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.720
if you are a band and you can send us

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.320

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.840
i swear to god we will write awesome

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.600

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.039
show we could do better rape rock than

00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:41.519
that we could [ __ ] cross the stinks

00:32:41.519 --> 00:32:44.240
they rapist justin used to be a rapper

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.480
you gotta use your flow i will i used to

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.240
be a raper so

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.840
if we combine

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.519
the pieces are all there now we just put

00:32:51.519 --> 00:32:53.120
the puzzle together

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.360
beatles had more rapey songs it's true

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.720
they really did they really did you

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.559
think that [ __ ] wanted to hold his hand

00:32:58.559 --> 00:33:00.720
she was just 17. you know what i mean

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.159
that's right that's more rape than this

00:33:02.159 --> 00:33:03.679
this guy's just having a nice time wait

00:33:03.679 --> 00:33:06.000
that wasn't the beatles was it

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.360

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.279

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.240

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.870

00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:30.000

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.240
actually one line where it says she

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.240

and that's how we know you wanted it is

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.040

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.000
got about three back from the 70s it

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000

yeah we'll give you a half more all

00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:34.160

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.599
great job so they've been doing rape

00:35:35.599 --> 00:35:38.160
songs since the 70s you're saying

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.520
yeah i mean they have names of their

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:40.640
songs that were ridiculous we were

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.760
looking at out there they went through

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.599
like a lot of phases like a hair rape

00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:45.839
phase

00:35:45.839 --> 00:35:48.160
band glam rape clam rape that was

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.520
probably the best that's the best one

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:50.640
they did a weird

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:51.520
rape

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.280
they did a disco rape thing in the 70s

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.240
but then they went back to their

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.320
originals like billy joel

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.760
album yeah

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.960

oh they did

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:59.440
change the lyrics yeah

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:03.560

that chick's head she was just drunk

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.960
that wasn't rape if that video was

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.400

be payoff

00:56:20.559 --> 00:56:21.760
by the way

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:23.200
louis likes the fact that you try to

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.720
hype the crowd up lewis loves the fact

00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:26.400
that you spilled fluids on the table

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.640

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.480

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.680
this room you're gonna be his [ __ ]

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.200
best friend i know i have to for the

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.280
peer pressure and the funniest thing is

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:38.000
the actual joke me my manager all women

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.920
or [ __ ] is a watered down the actual

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:41.920
bit is all women are child rapists

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:43.920
that's real and i go on 10 minutes of it

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:45.599
that's that's not so much funny as it is

00:56:45.599 --> 00:56:47.119
true exactly

00:56:47.119 --> 00:56:48.960
i'm just trying to spread the message so

00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:50.319
mark all right tell us what happened

00:56:50.319 --> 00:56:51.119
here

00:56:51.119 --> 00:56:53.760
we mark random mark brandon is your last

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:54.880
name yeah

00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.559
what what happened here because we we

00:56:56.559 --> 00:56:57.920
watched the video and i feel like we

00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:59.200
were

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.640
we were

00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.640
you know we were pretty critical of you

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.400
yeah and pretty critical of of the

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:06.319
situation because i think the point that

00:57:06.319 --> 00:57:07.920
we had made was it didn't seem like

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:10.559
you're prepared to handle hecklers being

00:57:10.559 --> 00:57:12.799
shitty and i agree people shouldn't be

00:57:12.799 --> 00:57:16.160
able to heckle that's [ __ ] wrong but

00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:17.359
i think the point that we had made on

00:57:17.359 --> 00:57:19.359
the show was like you

00:57:19.359 --> 00:57:20.480
you sort of

00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.240
yeah no i got it you didn't execute what

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.079
you were going for oh hell yeah like

00:57:24.079 --> 00:57:25.680
here's the thing that happened is after

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:27.760
that we all [ __ ] up it is what it is or

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:29.839
maybe i'm the only one who [ __ ] up but

00:57:29.839 --> 00:57:31.920
afterwards i tried to contact the woman

00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:33.280
privately and said hey like we didn't

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:35.119
handle that professionally

00:57:35.119 --> 00:57:36.880
the host yeah the woman i tried to

00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:38.720
contact her and then she just posts this

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:41.280
thing on facebook saying he assaults a

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.040
audience member and he just screamed at

00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:45.200
women that he wants them all raped and i

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:46.960
was like whoa [ __ ] and then all these

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:49.280
people started getting them

00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:51.040
that must have calmed her down

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:53.200
whoa why didn't you [ __ ] hole with no

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:55.040

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:07.680
where she behaved perfectly and then

00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:09.680

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:38.480

00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:43.920
tournament

00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:45.839
you should probably let random be in the

00:59:45.839 --> 00:59:46.640
industry

00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:48.319
i'm straight up on disability for being

00:59:48.319 --> 00:59:50.000
schizophrenic and post-traumatic stress

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.160

00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:58.400
project

00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.319
it's they pay me to be [ __ ] up it's

01:00:00.319 --> 01:00:01.599
like why do you have post-traumatic

01:00:01.599 --> 01:00:02.799
stress what happened

01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:04.880
since the show all women are rapists

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.480
it's there's a little truth there but

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.480
it's not just were you raped by women i

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.079
will not say whether i am or not just

01:00:10.079 --> 01:00:11.920
some [ __ ] up [ __ ] oh don't be a queer

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:15.040
just saying by the

01:00:17.119 --> 01:00:18.880
no one ever answers were you raped by

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.720
women i don't want to get into it unless

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.480
they were raped by women

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:25.200
yeah um no it's just an incident that i

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.520
can't quite clarify as all people do and

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.119
it's just like were you afraid to lose

01:00:29.119 --> 01:00:32.000
that government check yeah

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
those ebt stamps you know how they go

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.599
when you bring it out in front of women

01:00:35.599 --> 01:00:36.880
hold on all right why didn't he go down

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.319
so much don't listen to justin justin's

01:00:38.319 --> 01:00:39.839
not your producer you're the producer i

01:00:39.839 --> 01:00:41.280
asked him to turn my [ __ ] headphones

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.559
i don't know what happened but then his

01:00:42.559 --> 01:00:45.359
his volume went down in my ears

01:00:45.359 --> 01:00:46.960
i'm sorry he's a little bit of a psycho

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:50.000
i get it yeah a little he's diagnosed

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.240
clinically psycho you are actually uh

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.000
three letters

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.559
this the you know

01:00:56.559 --> 01:00:58.400
i could have done better you could have

01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.440
you could have done better with it

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.720
because i haven't been doing comedy for

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:03.200
what oh like four months yeah yeah it's

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.400
like that's the situation you're not

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.359
going to be able to figure out how to

01:01:05.359 --> 01:01:06.640
handle when that's a problem with cell

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.400
phones now and people being on camp

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.960
because the problem is we've you know

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.079
i haven't freaked out like that but

01:01:12.079 --> 01:01:13.359
everyone's had like moments where you

01:01:13.359 --> 01:01:15.359
just don't want to have on camera where

01:01:15.359 --> 01:01:16.720
it's about like with people i do like

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.119
kill tony i always like to it's like i i

01:01:19.119 --> 01:01:20.319
commend them because i'm like dude

01:01:20.319 --> 01:01:21.680
you're probably not gonna want your

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:22.960
shitty jokes from when you were six

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:25.200
months in comedy but you keep going with

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.880
it eventually you'll be dating louis j

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.960
gomez

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.079
just

01:01:30.079 --> 01:01:33.359
if you do a really good job

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.760
but one thing that i want to say and i

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.520
feel like established comedians and

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.040
legendary comedians don't quite

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:40.319
understand that

01:01:40.319 --> 01:01:43.280
no no no no no no no no no please please

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.280
let me say the state please let me say

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:46.640
the statement

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.000
can you say it on your knees in front of

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.920
lewis though he gets shot he gets shot

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:52.319
in the open mic world it really is now

01:01:52.319 --> 01:01:54.160
run by this pc culture of

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.240
microaggression and we are attacking you

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.160
and we are banning you and no one is

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.720
good so it's like i knew i was already

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.079
[ __ ] that they were feminists and this

01:02:02.079 --> 01:02:03.680
was going to be a horrible situation and

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.039
i'm the type of like it's already

01:02:05.039 --> 01:02:06.799
self-destructed there's no saving this

01:02:06.799 --> 01:02:08.240

that a lot from a lot of people that

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.119
it's

01:02:13.119 --> 01:02:14.960
like it does seem like if there's one

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.440
area in the universe where you should be

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.960
able to say what you want to say and not

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.319
heard from a lot of people that that's

01:02:38.319 --> 01:02:40.240
very like the dominant culture and open

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.000
mics now is like if someone says

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.760

guest we've had recently uh that's true

01:07:24.319 --> 01:07:26.000
here's the thing where's brenda justice

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.440
when you need her to obviously have a

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.760
conversation with this weirdo i am can

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.599
somebody please find me brenda justice i

01:07:31.599 --> 01:07:34.079
will give him a podcast right now

01:07:34.079 --> 01:07:35.760
them two together did brenda justice in

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.520
this weirdo podcast you better carve out

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.440
seven and a half hours no but it's that

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:40.799
so the fbi

01:07:40.799 --> 01:07:42.400
put them on overnights i don't even know

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.680
what the [ __ ] happening right now i'm

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:44.960
tripping out on a lucid nightmare

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.640
snorting blue chews i'm getting [ __ ]

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.720
weird are you on drugs right now um yeah

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.640
that was the shaking in the video unless

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.160
the fbi is watching this again then i

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.839
just have social anxiety but i was

01:07:53.839 --> 01:07:55.520
[ __ ] up but that's also genuinely

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.280
nerves i mean like go back to why the

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.599
fbi's profiling okay so i was make but

01:07:59.599 --> 01:08:01.280
here's the thing is i have a suspicion

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.880
that it was just people who were upset

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:04.319
because that's the comedy world we live

01:08:04.319 --> 01:08:06.559
in is people don't just say hey you suck

01:08:06.559 --> 01:08:08.400
as a community they want to ban you they

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.079
want to censor you they want you [ __ ]

01:08:10.079 --> 01:08:12.079
in prison that's this whole like weird

01:08:12.079 --> 01:08:14.160
social justice antifa world that we live

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.560
in so it's proven that

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:17.920
this is turning into a white power

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:19.120
speech well i don't think they want i

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.560
don't think they want it uh it's going

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.319
but i mean like good no what i was

01:08:22.319 --> 01:08:24.640
saying is it's like that so we have the

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.159
assumption that someone who just didn't

01:08:26.159 --> 01:08:27.920
like my jokes called the fbi and they're

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.359
like because a hundred people said we

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:30.880
need to ban him from a club so if i'm

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.640
making jokes that are offending people

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:34.239
of course they're gonna call the fbi and

01:08:34.239 --> 01:08:35.600
he needs to be in jail and he's [ __ ]

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.839
wait they call the fbi okay so let me

01:08:37.839 --> 01:08:39.279
audience members let me just uh that's

01:08:39.279 --> 01:08:39.920
one

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.239
how do you actually know that the fbi

01:08:42.239 --> 01:08:43.920
because they came to my apartment what

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.520

01:08:50.319 --> 01:08:52.719
i said who tipped you off i don't want

01:08:52.719 --> 01:08:54.000
to say their names

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:54.799

01:08:54.799 --> 01:08:55.839

and dr phil i thought we were going to

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.880
[ __ ] around but what i'm saying is there

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:38.960
is a huge stigma on mental illness of

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:40.800

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.159

it like

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.840

01:35:34.159 --> 01:35:37.119
super cool she moved in recently yeah um

01:35:37.119 --> 01:35:39.760
but what i've noticed is

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:41.600
she got very comfortable lately with

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:43.280
we'll be like playing video games yeah

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:44.960
she'll get upset she'll hit me she

01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:47.119
actually strikes me yeah i have the same

01:35:47.119 --> 01:35:48.719
issue so what are you doing that's when

01:35:48.719 --> 01:35:50.080
your girlfriend has a problem even if

01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:51.520
it's a playful thing

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:53.119
lewis has found his mentor oh here's

01:35:53.119 --> 01:35:55.620
what they do no here's what it is

01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:57.199
[Applause]

01:35:57.199 --> 01:35:59.119
when i feel the force of being strong in

01:35:59.119 --> 01:36:01.840
a woman here's the thing what do i do is

01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:03.760
she knows that whatever the issue was

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:05.440
she did something wrong or she's upset

01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:06.880
about something that's not real so she's

01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:08.719
used her manipulation tactic she's tried

01:36:08.719 --> 01:36:10.639
to divert and you have been staying on

01:36:10.639 --> 01:36:12.239
subject she tried to bring up something

01:36:12.239 --> 01:36:13.600
from the past and it didn't emotionally

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:15.040
bother you now she's trying to get an

01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:16.639
emotional reaction out of you so when

01:36:16.639 --> 01:36:18.480
you explode she could go see look i'm

01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:20.239
with a crazy person and you believe it

01:36:20.239 --> 01:36:21.600
because you love herself oh [ __ ]

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:23.679
random's making a lot of sense right now

01:36:23.679 --> 01:36:25.840
really this is making me i told you she

01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:27.760
wasn't [ __ ] from the day one that same

01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:29.840
exact thing you don't listen to me

01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:31.520
and then now you're the crazy person

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:33.440
going i'm sorry i got mad when she was

01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:35.199
the one who pushed me i swear to god

01:36:35.199 --> 01:36:38.800
women need to do that

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:41.119
but when you make a lot of sense like

01:36:41.119 --> 01:36:42.880
that it makes me feel like i'm the crazy

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:44.880
one because he actually just broke down

01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:46.719
exactly why women hit you so what do i

01:36:46.719 --> 01:36:49.199
do that was perfect you have to either

01:36:49.199 --> 01:36:50.960
walk away or not engage because then

01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:52.400
they just cool crap i mean dishes are

01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:53.679
going to get broken things are going to

01:36:53.679 --> 01:36:57.119
get slammed but you have to walk away

01:36:57.119 --> 01:36:58.800
doorways are going to be broken like the

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:01.840
the the inside piece so random patrice

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:03.440
used to always say these jokes no matter

01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:05.199
how crazy they get you have to stay

01:37:05.199 --> 01:37:06.800
completely cool exactly because they're

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:08.080
trying to get that right but then you

01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:10.239
have to put ultimatums in place of like

01:37:10.239 --> 01:37:11.679

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:28.080
chick did just say she was going to

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:30.560

01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:33.560
everyone

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.679
taking her out walking dead style put

01:37:35.679 --> 01:37:36.960
one right through the brain stem so she

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:38.719
doesn't come back be careful jay they're

01:37:38.719 --> 01:37:40.800
evolving

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:42.639
anybody watch the last random show

01:37:42.639 --> 01:37:45.040
together and that's why it's the end all

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:47.119
right so what what's what's

01:37:47.119 --> 01:37:48.320
what's the end result there how many

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:49.119
videos

01:37:49.119 --> 01:37:50.560
we're all going to stand in a circle

01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:52.159
with domestic with this [ __ ] place is

01:37:52.159 --> 01:37:54.400
happening

01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:57.280
listen how many because [ __ ] don't

01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:59.119
stop with your taking me horse [ __ ]

01:37:59.119 --> 01:38:00.880
relax no i just want you guys to love

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:02.719
each other in commitment is

01:38:02.719 --> 01:38:04.400
understanding i'm trying to help you

01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:06.400
both people have issues that they bring

01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:08.239
to the relationship and when you commit

01:38:08.239 --> 01:38:10.159
you have to keep each other in check to

01:38:10.159 --> 01:38:12.080
better themselves a lot of times and i

01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:13.760
say this in my joke i'm more misandrous

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:15.679
than i am misogynist because men are

01:38:15.679 --> 01:38:17.280
just [ __ ] and just let women have

01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:19.119
their way oh you're right no it's

01:38:19.119 --> 01:38:20.480
marriage is an institute or

01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:22.000
relationships are an institution where

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.840
you both have to help each other grow

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:25.520
because none of us are perfect so you

01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:26.960
either have to grow together or you're

01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:28.800
going to be in the same toxic cycle for

01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:30.639
years of just the same old fights and

01:38:30.639 --> 01:38:32.239
that's what it is a lot of relationships

01:38:32.239 --> 01:38:33.520
i've seen they've been having the same

01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:35.040
fight for years and years where can i

01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:36.800
buy your book um

01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:38.480
i don't [ __ ] know

[ __ ] amazon you're going to finish the

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:42.159
book called you'll be allowed in barnes

01:38:42.159 --> 01:38:45.440
and noble but anthony cooper won't

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:47.440
i did publish a book called

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:49.520
uh of heaven and hell gods and devils

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.960
because i really thought my life was

01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:52.639
over at that point and it is have some

01:38:52.639 --> 01:38:53.840
of these philosophies in it but it's

01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:54.960
more just how many times have you

01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:56.560
attempted suicide because i see i see

01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:58.080
all the cuts in your arms yeah i

01:38:58.080 --> 01:38:59.520
honestly tried to kill myself once when

01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:01.040
i was 14 because i was terrified of the

01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:03.360
world and then last year i was on

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:05.119
seroquel and a different medication and

01:39:05.119 --> 01:39:06.480
things were mixing up so i tried to do

01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:08.159
the belt in the [ __ ] closet and did

01:39:08.159 --> 01:39:11.719
you come um

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:16.960

but the thing is i do try to be nice to

01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:21.760
people and love because like i am you've

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:25.199

01:39:25.199 --> 01:39:26.480
i mean your girlfriend might not think

01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:30.560
so but what girl wow

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:31.440

01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:33.040
know she could be broken up with tonight

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.719
and have her [ __ ] on the porch i thought

01:39:34.719 --> 01:39:36.320
i had you figured out by the first half

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:37.679
of your appearance on this show and the

01:39:37.679 --> 01:39:38.840
second half is

01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:40.320
genuinely making me want to listen is

01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:43.199
she wacky bro is she normal

01:39:43.199 --> 01:39:44.880

01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:47.280
her

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:48.480
so that isn't

01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:50.080

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:52.560
normal he's being sarcastic his sarcasm

01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:54.400

01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:00.960

oh man oh man it's happening

01:41:29.199 --> 01:41:30.960
i just secretly feel the interaction

01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:32.560
because i want proof

01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:34.239
will you be mad if she's actually trying

01:41:34.239 --> 01:41:35.679
to [ __ ] it's just sad because i

01:41:35.679 --> 01:41:37.440
thought she was better than that so i'm

01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:39.760
gonna leave her you did say very quickly

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:42.320
you have a lot of girlfriends [ __ ] her

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:43.920
she knows that though to two different

01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:45.520
stephanies you're coming home baby we

01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:47.440
have an agreement we have a very strict

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:48.800
agreement because she was doing this

01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:50.400
[ __ ] last year i was committed to her

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:51.520
and she was [ __ ] around with a bunch

01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:52.800
of other people and then she came

01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:55.199
crawling back with a black guy

01:41:55.199 --> 01:41:56.400
that was just one so what's the

01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:58.320
agreement now the agreement is i'm

01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:00.080
allowed to do outside of the

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:01.600
relationship but she's not because she

01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:03.119
can't handle that [ __ ]

01:42:03.119 --> 01:42:06.480
this guy is unreal

01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:10.080
[Applause]

01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:13.520
it's the random system

01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:15.280
so she's breaking the agreement right

01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:17.760
now and the relationship is broken up

01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:19.199
but i don't give a [ __ ] because here's

01:42:19.199 --> 01:42:20.560
the thing she goes into the bathroom

01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:21.760
with parenting while you're talking

01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:24.560
would be the funniest thing in the

01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:29.520
is she going to world us

01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:31.280
david she's standing right at us so much

01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:32.880
i'm pretty sure the comedians because i

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:34.800
keep getting in fights with comedians is

01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:36.480
stop supporting these comedians like

01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:38.800
hannah gadsby who support breaking down

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:40.639
