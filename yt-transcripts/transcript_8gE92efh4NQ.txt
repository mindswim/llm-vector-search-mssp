00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.479
and i was like uh can we do another one

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:29.759
and before we even do the first podcast

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.200
you're like hey guys you know we don't

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.960
we don't have a video set up so you know

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.360
it can be audio only and i'm like i mean

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.640
guys

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.479
video cameras are really easy to come by

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.840
these days like you have on your cell

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.439
phone you can buy one probably like 80

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.479
bucks that it works a little webcam

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.159
you know yeah i think they're still

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.240
shell shocked from video

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.320
video no not traditionally worked out

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.280
well

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.720
so is that what no hell no we're just

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.360
[ __ ] lazy but i actually yeah we're

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.200
setting up some video it's kind of

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.799
stupid though it's so dumb i don't know

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.240
i don't get why anyone would want to

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.320
stare at a man speaking

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.240
i think it is well it's also it i think

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.759
it enhances to be able to see people's

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.200
facial expressions you know you get the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.440
full 3d experience yeah i guess so say

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.640
if someone's just saying something but

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.000
their face looks weird you get to read

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.360
the body language

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.640
yeah also half of shane's act is him

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.400
doing this with his eyes you say raising

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.720
his eyebrows as you it is if you don't

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.560
see that i mean for the audio listener

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.680
they don't even understand half of how

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.200
funny there's a lot of stuff yeah

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.560
there's a lot of stuff that gets lost in

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.000
translation if you don't get to see him

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
on camera when he raises his eyes

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.239
or like says something off camera

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.760
he's constantly whispering things off

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.640
he said it a few times into his mic

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.000
i don't want to say their name

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.720

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.199
dmt watch list it's just like rogan and

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.400
[ __ ]

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.600
funny they can only arrest people in

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.919
laser tag

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.400
is [ __ ] wild yeah you guys are

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.560
[ __ ] insane i can't do that [ __ ] i

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.320
can't just i

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.600
i can't what's scary about it is like

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.680
it's so hard and it comes on so fast and

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.479
so strong that it's like

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.720
losing control that way immediately i

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.800
get panicked and you can't be panicked

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.160
when you're tripping if you're in a

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.440
panic when you're tripping it's gonna be

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.639
[ __ ] up it's gonna [ __ ] up your whole

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:49.520
thing

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.520
but i think she's inherently by just the

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.240
the how fast you [ __ ] blast off it

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.080
sends it gives me mass anxiety and then

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.639
it do one time i took the mt

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.000
it was like i took like

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
four or five big hits off a vape pen it

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.080
felt like the room flipped upside down

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.360
and then when i looked to my left the

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.880
devil was sitting there

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.039
holding my head and pushing me down into

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:10.000
the bed

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.840
and that lasted for eight minutes and it

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.759
was [ __ ] horrifying

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:17.440
yeah it's not fun it's horrible dude

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.479
you're the only person who's all the

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:21.680
devil everyone else sees beauty

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.880
everyone else sees like love and

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.479
happiness like i saw the devil he looked

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:25.680
at me right in the face he was like yes

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.680
i'm real i think if you you if you smoke

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.680
dmt out of a vape pen your chances of

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.880
seeing the devil are like a hundred

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.600
percent higher yeah

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.680
yeah if you like smoke via dmt out of

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.240
like a like a weird vape cartridge yeah

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.520
good your good chance of seeing the

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.280
devil i i think yeah

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.479
it's supposed to be done out of like a

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:44.400
[ __ ] you know a crack pipe or

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.759
something yeah that's what it looks like

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:47.840
i guess it's like the virginia slim of

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.720

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:05.280
remember when he was like sleeping naked

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.800
in his parents face and he [ __ ] had

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.560
sleep houses you're talking about the

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.000
shadowy figures you said the old house

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.440
when we watched that documentary yeah

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.919
yeah it turns out it's like the majority

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:15.759
of cases with uh sleep paralysis

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:17.440
everyone sees the same person it's

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.599
[ __ ] up it's like this tall figure

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:21.680
comes into your room or wherever you're

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.680
at and you're stuck because sleep houses

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.880
you're like in between sleep and

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.039
consciousness so you can't [ __ ] move

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:28.639
my mom described this to me when she was

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:31.039
a kid it's i've never had i literally i

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:32.160
just chucked after her being a heroine

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.080
out it was like all right lady

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.080
you saw a figure right

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.919
dude i get a sleep paralysis every now

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:39.440
and again i've had i used to get like

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.919
double two figures so i'd wake up and it

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:43.599
would just be like i'm gonna i'd wake up

00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:44.960
and there'd just be like

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.879
two big shadowy figures kind of moving

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:48.000
towards my bed and you kind of like

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.199
started fighting them

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:50.800
off yeah yeah

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.680
we needed video because the way matt

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.360
tried to pantomime fighting was

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.879
literally jerking off two guys under his

00:07:56.879 --> 00:07:58.960
face

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.039
that is true that's a that's a good way

00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:02.960
to get two guys off a double girl punch

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.360
to the side of my hand get off

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.120
yeah that [ __ ] documentary is wild

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.319
though like sleeping stories that

00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:10.560
recount the sleep paralysis thing yeah

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.560
my mom's story was she was laying there

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.240
and uh but it was even more my mom used

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.759
to think that she'd see like aliens and

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:17.680
ghosts and [ __ ] um my mom was pretty

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.639
[ __ ] up and i guess she um

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:22.879
we're pretty red yeah sounds like alien

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:25.520
[ __ ] parties exactly dude she was

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.240
actually probably one of the most

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.599
important people on earth aliens were

00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:29.759
coming to her trying to get information

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:32.080
it means she ruled so she made contact

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.479
go on

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.360
okay

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.839
what did they learn from

00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:41.680
her no she said she'd go grab the remote

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.519
and she tried to turn the tv on this

00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:44.800
figure was standing above her and the tv

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.120
wouldn't go on right and then uh she

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.279
lifted off her bed and started spinning

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:51.519
around like it like almost like exorcist

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:52.959
style like she's floating and spinning

00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:54.640
like hugh hafner's bed

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.240
uh with a little spinner on yeah

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.160
spinnerbait yeah he has spinnerbait

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.320
[ __ ] right like shaq yeah it was like

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.160
a big circle like tommy lee's drum set

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.720
pretty much that's what yeah

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.880
yeah [ __ ] girls you have you have to

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:13.120
also why does he need to be spinning

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.519
while he has sex i have no idea hey he

00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:17.040
bothered you after bothers the [ __ ] out

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.560
of me dude

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.440
yeah but still god right yeah does he

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.279
have a big dick there's no information

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:24.880
on hugh hefner's dick

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.279
i'm sure he's got a piece i think it was

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:28.560
probably average because you've never

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.160
heard anything about it he's bedded like

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.440
thousands of women that's what i'm

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.720
saying it's probably as average as it

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.839
comes

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:35.200
i mean how do we not know as i'm saying

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.560

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.000
not been like oh here's here's what he's

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.360
saying i bet you right now if we had

capability to google in the studio we

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.760

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.880
secondary producer to google

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.240
we would know exactly because i

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.399
guarantee people have talked about it

00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:52.000
i bet you people have talked about the

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.080
size of hefner's dick

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.519
he strikes me as somebody that makes the

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:58.399
girl sign a contract like an nda yeah

00:09:58.399 --> 00:09:59.360

mansion and swim in a grotto with

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:09.760
[ __ ] playboy stars versus coming to

where it happens dude

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.480
you know the k the video capabilities at

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.000

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.959
through the roof oh i guarantee it

00:11:20.959 --> 00:11:22.240
somebody's gonna watch those [ __ ]

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.160
peacocks true whatever they did with all

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.360
the animals

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.880
who lives there now i think michael

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.240
jackson bought all of his stuff the

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.160
michael jackson estate bought all of his

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.200
stuff

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.800
seriously yeah they probably still have

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.000
to take care of all those animals in the

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.360
michael jackson that states i'm talking

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.800
about hafner

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.640
it looks like michael jackson well

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.160
that's that's where all the animals went

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.839
hugh hefner's animals went too [ __ ]

00:11:41.839 --> 00:11:43.920
i'm never pretty sure yeah

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.320
i'm just making that up but

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.959
for a split second i was like

00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:50.880
because mccusker has just spun off this

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.560
earth in the last two years so it's like

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.560
when you start spitting facts i'm like i

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.079
think he's right about this i think

00:11:56.079 --> 00:11:58.160
cheetah got in a little peacock's pretty

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.320
early i could probably see

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.880
it sounded very real yeah tito auctioned

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.200
them off

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.800
that's good they're actually uh did you

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.240
see their [ __ ] protester michael

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.519
jackson's supposed to be doing something

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:15.839
on it's not broadway but at like the met

00:12:15.839 --> 00:12:18.000
or something and it's like a um

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.800
live version of like his uh videos over

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.760
the years like played out

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.320

a hologram it's like people acting out

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.680
it's like a play but

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.000
each [ __ ] part of it is

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.800
you know uh like [ __ ] bad or [ __ ]

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.040
thriller songs that would be awesome if

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.720
they actually protested his hologram

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.639
performance and the hologram artist just

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:45.920
like made him walk through the crowd

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.760

so they're doing like uh like the same

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.320
thing with the way they did it with

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.399

going to see the origin story of

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.160

he's the best idea for a web series

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.799
it's me trying to get joe rogan to admit

00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:14.959
he's my dad

00:17:14.959 --> 00:17:16.880

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.039
i'll be hilary oh [ __ ] i'm just at the

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:21.600
front gate of his mansion

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.839

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:26.240
[ __ ] uh compound bow on me

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.319

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:31.679
[ __ ] you up in that bathroom dude

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.200
[Laughter]

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.080
so

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.760
we got off on a tangent your mom was

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.240
like spinning around in the air yeah

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.120
just spinning dude and then uh she came

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.200
back down and she was really scared and

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.160
then she grabbed the road again and

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.600
turned the tv on

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.480
and um my sis she my sister shared a

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.520
room with her at this time because we

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.360
were just [ __ ] poor trash and my

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.919
sister is a little inside of my sister's

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:06.720
mind

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.640
she had uh barbies hanging from the

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.080
ceiling like by their neck like they're

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.240
dead

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.080
and my mom said the barbies were all

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.200
spinning

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.440
after she turned the tv on

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.360
yeah like the wind from her body but

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.720
then i called her on actually i was like

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.400
mom if your body was spinning and

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.760
creating like a fan

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.760
the barbies wouldn't just like spin they

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.120
would sort of get all intertwined with

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.480
each other yeah you know what i'm saying

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.080
so it didn't make any sense true let's

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.520
tell you it's funny you guys are arguing

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.679
about like hung barbies you guys are

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:36.720
actually mom tell your truth

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:39.200
i refute your theory about them spinning

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.200
yeah how much when is she generating how

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.799
fast is she spinning i don't know dude

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:44.880
speed of [ __ ] gravitron bro

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.080
aliens spin you at the speed of the

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.240
gravity dude

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.600
dude we don't actually have any sort of

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.600
measurement on this uh

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.520
planet to figure out usually i put that

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.760
up on the screen

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.160
she's so pretty but not exactly what i

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.200
would have thought like she was supposed

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.799
to get another young hot chick it's a

00:19:06.799 --> 00:19:08.240
different she looks like a woman she's

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.760
like someone who stars on an hbo show

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.039

it's just begun and it's like that

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.840
moment it's so there's this moment of it

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.520
being very real when they hand you the

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.880
baby and they push you out of the

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.520
you should call it drunk history that's

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.560
a topic the origin of hogging just hogs

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:56.000
with like [ __ ] blindfolds walking

00:47:00.079 --> 00:47:02.000
but that's what uh that would be a good

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.400
category of porn not like actual like

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:06.079
it would be more about like

just finding some [ __ ] sad chick

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.160

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.599
the hot guy

00:47:11.599 --> 00:47:13.119

00:47:13.119 --> 00:47:15.839
a body positivity thing today's day and

from your perspective now matt mccosker

00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:31.359

00:58:31.359 --> 00:58:33.119
brian sex yes

00:58:33.119 --> 00:58:36.240
brian six has a immune system that

00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:38.240

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:40.079
world he barely sleeps his diet is

00:58:40.079 --> 00:58:42.720
absolutely horrible and he just [ __ ]

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:44.160
dude every day pops up early in the

00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:46.160
morning he's got like grandpa resilience

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:48.960

wow

00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:53.520
seriously

00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:55.440
i don't i should be dead

00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:57.200
what time do you wake up every day

00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:59.920
7 30 i'm the same exact way

00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:03.200
seven yeah it's like 16 7 37 but usually

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.960
i had it i have a child so that's the

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.400
other thing is like you wake up every

00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.000
single day really early you sort of

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.599
train your body

00:59:09.599 --> 00:59:12.000
that's in that kind of sucks as well

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.359
but it's not that bad it's fine so you

00:59:13.359 --> 00:59:14.640
so you're up every single day and you

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:15.920
just you you don't work out you don't do

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:18.319
anything to keep yourself healthy no no

00:59:18.319 --> 00:59:20.640
i walk to thirty street

00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:22.559
don't say no i do all the time that's a

00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:24.000
good thing that's you have to do that

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.319
walking is nice i could take a lift

00:59:26.319 --> 00:59:29.040
walking is not exercise yes it is i was

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.559
not walking this exercise for like

00:59:30.559 --> 00:59:32.319
literally people who are dying i'm like

00:59:32.319 --> 00:59:34.799
a divorce say woman

00:59:34.799 --> 00:59:37.119
exercise you have two steps

00:59:37.119 --> 00:59:38.720
i did forty thousand steps that's like

00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:40.640
how many pound weights

00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:42.480
i mean i'm saying like

00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:44.240
for me even a scientific standpoint it's

00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:46.240
not actually exercising unless you're

00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:47.839
from cardiovascular standpoint you have

00:59:47.839 --> 00:59:50.319
to elevate your heart rate to 70 or 80

00:59:50.319 --> 00:59:51.680
max for an extended amount of time in

00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:53.839
order to get the cardiovascular results

00:59:53.839 --> 00:59:55.359
or you have to tear muscle fibers down

00:59:55.359 --> 00:59:56.880
and break muscle fibers down in order

00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:58.720
for them to grow back stronger those are

00:59:58.720 --> 00:59:59.760
the types of exercises is there any

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.680
other type of exercise

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.880
no you're building muscle or

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.760
cardiovascular joking or shocking when
