like alright I'm not with these people

00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:15.220
that dislikes her because I'm some

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.879
[ __ ] staunch Republican she's like a

00:09:17.879 --> 00:09:20.019
Democratic Socialist or whatever she is

00:09:20.019 --> 00:09:23.350
I just hate that she's doing she's like

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.389
the Gillette commercial as a person yeah

00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:27.609
it's like oh you do it your social

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:30.730
justice to gain power yeah for sure man

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:31.959
dude I watched her give a speech at the

00:09:31.959 --> 00:09:34.689
Women's much that was like we're picking

00:09:34.689 --> 00:09:36.669
up with the the civil rights movement

00:09:36.669 --> 00:09:38.709
left off like she's there basically

00:09:38.709 --> 00:09:41.619
saying like this is the same civil

00:09:41.619 --> 00:09:42.399
rights movement

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:45.160
that's a fine in situ your congresswoman

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.069
yeah in [ __ ] fire hoses and dogs yeah

00:09:48.069 --> 00:09:50.290
like let's not [ __ ] get on a podium

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.519
and compare yourself to Martin Luther

00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:53.199
King oh it's crazy dude she didn't

00:09:53.199 --> 00:09:54.879
directly do that but I've heard I've

00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:56.769
heard that comparison made it's like

00:09:56.769 --> 00:09:58.600
well you know let's like I know all of

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.129
our oppression isn't the same but like

00:10:00.129 --> 00:10:02.529
if we just unite goals and do it it's

00:10:02.529 --> 00:10:04.720
[ __ ] crazy I ain't trying to hear

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.249
that she yeah it's and the Gillette

00:10:06.249 --> 00:10:07.809
commercial is like I almost tweeted

00:10:07.809 --> 00:10:09.309
about it yesterday really cuz

00:10:09.309 --> 00:10:11.110
everybody's like oh sorry you're

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.489
offended by the Gillette commercial

00:10:12.489 --> 00:10:14.049
what's wrong with you like how [ __ ]

00:10:14.049 --> 00:10:14.799
dumb are you

00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:16.239
it's like maybe they're not offended

00:10:16.239 --> 00:10:18.579
because it's maybe they're not defending

00:10:18.579 --> 00:10:21.249
toxic masculinity or maybe they're like

00:10:21.249 --> 00:10:23.350
oh this is a corporation monetizing

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.999
social justice yeah for sure and it's

00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:26.799
corny as [ __ ] maybe that's why they hate

00:10:26.799 --> 00:10:28.600
the ad T not because they want to be

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.669
like I should be able to bully and grab

00:10:30.669 --> 00:10:33.639
[ __ ] adorable people I'm a man it's

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:34.809
like no maybe that maybe they're just

00:10:34.809 --> 00:10:36.579
like oh this is phony as [ __ ] yeah they

00:10:36.579 --> 00:10:37.629
see through it's like the Pepsi

00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:38.980
commercial it's a better version of that

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.230
it was it's crazy dude that that was

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.139
like apparently malette there was like

00:10:44.139 --> 00:10:45.369
marketers trying to figure out how to

00:10:45.369 --> 00:10:46.720
market to Millennials and they never

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.919
they couldn't figure it out and I'm

00:10:47.919 --> 00:10:49.569
telling you the way to do it is making

00:10:49.569 --> 00:10:50.799
them think they're part of like some

00:10:50.799 --> 00:10:52.839
sort of change so if you can be like you

00:10:52.839 --> 00:10:54.549
guys are changing the world that's then

00:10:54.549 --> 00:10:55.959
they figured that out they started

00:10:55.959 --> 00:10:57.189
running with that and then they started

00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:58.899
seeing like the fallout and then all the

00:10:58.899 --> 00:11:00.639
how many of those things get retweet

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:01.450
different people be like what

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:02.920
[ __ ] is this [ __ ] yeah dude

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.230
meanwhile Gillette's just like yeah but

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:06.850
it's weird that Obama [ __ ]

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:08.830
game-playing hope and change

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.450
sure yeah true let's unite the masses

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:11.920
and hope and change and it's like I'm

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.410
gonna deport more people than anyone

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.680
ever more [ __ ] I wonder if Gillette

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.000
was trying to like feeling some flak

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.060
from the Dollar Shave Club Dollar Shave

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.590
Club is probably raking the bin right

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.300
now too if you're it was [ __ ] good

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.460
old boys it's just hilarious it's like

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.080
the [ __ ] mistake of the alright

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.550
starts comes like no no no I wonder how

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.530
late like political ideology has nothing

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:37.360
to do with the Fraser purchase no of

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.680
course so it's like I don't know I just

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.480
like when I can do better

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.110
yeah sure yeah it was just [ __ ] weird

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.900
to me man I don't think it's possibly

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.000
the guys when it gets to that level like

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.620
a publicly traded company like July it's

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.570
probably part of some other conglomerate

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.610
car doctor and gamble Proctor and Gamble

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.680
I think these are dudes just sitting

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.690
there these are like Warren Buffett

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.430
looking dude it's just like holding a

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:01.860
sheet of paper and it's going like

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.610
alright looks good and then there's

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.240
these companies they hire to do like the

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.960
advertising there's always people like

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.340
wouldn't it be and they pitched this

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.500
thing none of it means anything and this

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.520
guy sitting there and after that

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.780
commercial happen they like check the

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.240
numbers and like okay yeah see how that

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.220
one saying we go do it again or not they

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.810
get extra dividends are like nice like

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.400
it literally does nothing I mean it's

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.190
also the same the the billionaire CEOs

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:25.810
that are running this and agree with us

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:27.610
they were the same guys that when they

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.010
were 50 because now they're like [ __ ]

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:33.970
80 yeah we're we're the problem oh these

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.310
are the problem these guys are the whole

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:37.870
thing that this movement is like these

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.580

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.050
to help you right in yeah I didn't want

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:19.310

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:20.540
this podcast and dude I don't wanna get

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.240

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.040
was soda and Jay so doing that yeah

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.330
without having you there that would be

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.220
difficult and stuff when you're sitting

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.990
there it's it's easier to do because I'd

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:34.610
do it with you a lot but yeah walking in

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:35.840
on that solo that would have been

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.520
[ __ ] a little daunting and soda is

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.650
really good at just shifting into

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:41.120
whatever though he is actually he's

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.270

he is like an elite guitars just

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.510

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.450
like there's this test and it's a really

00:34:10.450 --> 00:34:12.369
hard test and they have to prove that

00:34:12.369 --> 00:34:14.530

test and have to like figure out what

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.679

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:26.710
hardest a test maybe a sitting there

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:28.569

to listen to like that's what I love

00:34:52.450 --> 00:34:53.409
about history it's like

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:55.659
a study of like you know and they just

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:57.210
kept going back and forth with like

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:59.140
jerking each other off with their

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.480
intellect and I was just like you guys I

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.450
basically tapped into my ancient warrior

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:08.980
[ __ ] I was like these guys are gay she

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.490
said like me

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.480
good that's when I went bought books did

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.160
you really saw this [ __ ] - hitting it

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.690
off I think I should read yeah dude that

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:24.080
was my that was my [ __ ] that's been my

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.390
[ __ ] I'm own yeah let's go jump running

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:28.460
my demons dude um cuz I've read this

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:31.100
thing about a guy they say it was like

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.150
an interview with the student you were

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:33.530
saying ancient shamans and something was

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:34.820
wrong with them they would think that

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.700
like some sort of entity came and took a

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.680
piece of your soul and it was up to the

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.270
SH I'm gonna go find that for the person

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.130
so the shaman we're just like ducks

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:44.630
themselves to oblivion and going to the

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:48.980
underworld that was my that was my nice

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.720
that was my logic was that you have to

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.360
go shaman me I'll be shaman you you have

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.920
to face your demons in your steers dude

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.420
this is my thought I had today before I

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:58.340
forget yeah go ahead

00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:02.120
I'll [ __ ] oh I will [ __ ] do hard

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:39.770
drugs with you yeah [ __ ] but yeah that

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:43.400
was my whole idea that like you're you

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.750
have to go and face your demons and

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:46.700
you're when people say like the soul

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.140
it's just your idealized version of

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:50.360
yourself in order to find your idealized

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.310
version you have to [ __ ] thin the fog

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:54.290
of all your [ __ ] and your neurosis

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:55.970
and once you do that you just [ __ ]

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:58.310
full synthesis with your own self your

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:00.560
true self dude your capital s self oh

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.780

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:06.680

basement was in the basement so you had

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:50.930
to turn the lights off and it would be

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:52.430
pitch black and then go up the steps and

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:53.990

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:11.330
scary I'm trying to step it up I'm gonna

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:12.890
take a little dark walk in the woods

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:15.680
I'll be my next step you're gonna

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.690

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:19.490
startling the woods is scary hell no I'm

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:21.950
gonna bring a [ __ ] Rambo knife I did

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:23.450
it one time you'd kill someone I hope

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:25.310
you murder someone that'd be sick I did

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:26.690
it one time there's a dog park in New

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:28.340
Jersey that's like seven acres all

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:30.110
fenced in yeah I brought my dogs aren't

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:31.490
I cuz they couldn't this is like my old

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:33.320
dogs they couldn't get along with anyone

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.730
else so I started bringing them out at

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:36.290
midnight dude and I'd [ __ ] proud of

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:38.330
its like dogs incidentally I walk around

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:40.280
these woods at midnight with my dogs and

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.020
we were just [ __ ] run through the

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:43.880
woods it was awesome Wow cuz it's a path

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.470
but it's like it's in the woods though

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:47.780
so like you walk back there turn the

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:49.160
phone off you're letting your dogs out

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.270
and running through the woods at

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:51.680
midnight that's [ __ ] awesome that

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.360
sounds great but that also sounds

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.980
someone brought their somebody

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.290
terrifying if somebody brought his dog

00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:59.960
in he was on the same tip as me and I

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.310

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:08.330
then the cops [ __ ] came and I you

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:09.980
know they're [ __ ] like you stay poor

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:12.860

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:17.810
parks levy police for a reason that's

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:20.120
bull a sneeze of some [ __ ] mental

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.580
patient with dangerous dogs running

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.530
around in the woods at midnight that

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:27.380
stuff of legend dude kids are gonna know

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:29.210
about you like it was the [ __ ] movies

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:30.290
the movie that was luckily there's like

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:31.820
a full moon and I just kind of see a

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.560
little bit dude just [ __ ] that's great

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.520
was it warm out yeah there's a summer

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:38.010
you know [ __ ] awesome damn no sick

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:39.510
that's Austin I was a little dude

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:40.770
thought my thing is it's one thing I can

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:42.570
do if my dogs no problem if I ran around

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:44.790
the woods by myself at nighttime I'd be

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:45.990
get especially that would be a perp

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:47.310
that's a perfect arena for it because

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:49.860
it's fenced in that would be a spooky

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:51.390
spooky endeavor that would be very

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:52.740
spooky that's the thing about the fear

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.150
of the dark is you have to be alone if

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:55.440
you have even even it's like someone's

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.910
in there with you it's like you're not

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:58.920
scared walking by yourself that would be

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.930
the [ __ ] dark walk I'm afraid of most

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:02.190
do mushrooms and walking the woods at

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:02.550
nighttime

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:03.870
yeah that could be our shaman a damn

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:05.250
they'll be awesome yeah I'll do that

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:08.960
perfect we'll figure it out I'll Drive

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:19.740
I'm afraid of deep water oh yeah [ __ ]

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.930
deep water scares the [ __ ] out of me in

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:23.190
like the ocean you're talking about you

philosophy oh yeah that's a pretty that

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.510
makes sense to like fear of the dark

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:13.620
that makes sense of where that comes

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.200

warriors as a little kid was like these

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:57.980
guys yeah I luckily I can say this I

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:01.170
definitely I was such a ruthless bully

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:03.839

00:47:03.839 --> 00:47:07.290
life hell he's gay I never [ __ ] with

00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:07.680

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.990
like boy football team know I bullied

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:15.690

00:47:17.609 --> 00:47:20.010
our group of friends somebody if I could

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:22.950
tell someone was like a loner for the

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:24.930
most part I was not a [ __ ] to them

00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:26.130
see I from the beginning when I was

00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:27.720
younger I was like I was just bullying

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.910
anyone who I could bully yeah and that's

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:31.050
probably how I started and there was a

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:33.990
kid it was like homeschooled weirdo I

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:36.210
got I think I was scored number four and

00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:37.440
he wrote a hit list and brought it to

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.839
school I got a [ __ ] score before he

00:47:39.839 --> 00:47:41.010
was home-schooled his whole life I went

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:43.490
his mom's mom sent him to eighth grade

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:47.339
and he came to dominate he came in and

00:47:47.339 --> 00:47:48.630
it was just like when people watch like

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:51.109
lockdown

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.960
dude he was on her baseball team and he

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.249
end up quitting and then like they found

00:47:56.249 --> 00:47:58.229
a hit like a hit list and is literally

00:47:58.229 --> 00:48:00.599
and I hit number three I was three

00:48:00.599 --> 00:48:03.269
we were strong ranking the guy bought a

00:48:03.269 --> 00:48:05.579
body or body or batting cage

00:48:05.579 --> 00:48:08.009
Stella Huey in there maybe the balls we

00:48:08.009 --> 00:48:13.499
flying at obviously but I stopped the

00:48:13.499 --> 00:48:14.819
one thing there's this kid he was

00:48:14.819 --> 00:48:16.619
definitely gay in my high school ID for

00:48:16.619 --> 00:48:18.390
some reason I got punched in the face by

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:20.220
a nerd and I stopped bullying nerds at

00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:22.140
that point and I started as bullying

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:26.970
weird kids idea I remember that very

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:29.729

I went into the bathroom and there was a

00:48:36.869 --> 00:48:38.489
dork there was a guy who I knew was a

00:48:38.489 --> 00:48:41.339

was like what's up dude

00:48:45.989 --> 00:48:48.089
and he just instantly was a [ __ ]

00:48:48.089 --> 00:48:49.829
[ __ ] because he had been bullied so

00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:53.339

military the militaries were a lot

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:27.730
smaller back then yeah at least in

01:11:27.730 --> 01:11:30.310
Western Europe mmm and like it was like

01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:33.610
you basically just served the king mmm

01:11:33.610 --> 01:11:35.020
that was it so you were like a mercenary

01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:37.659
yeah there wasn't a theme so mostly

01:11:37.659 --> 01:11:39.610
there was a lot of armies were compiled

01:11:39.610 --> 01:11:41.349
of dudes from other countries yes I'm

01:11:41.349 --> 01:11:42.580
saying so it was mercenaries

01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:45.730
thieves soldiers sailors yeah it was it

01:11:45.730 --> 01:11:47.139
was just a job there wasn't this like

01:11:47.139 --> 01:11:49.000
this is my country I'll die for it

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.550
how do they make everyone money they

01:11:51.550 --> 01:11:53.199
were just pay dudes there was their

01:11:53.199 --> 01:11:55.360
generals that were generals for like six

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:57.040
different countries I'm saying how did

01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:00.110
they trick everyone now to be like

01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:01.639
humans with this books about it's about

01:12:01.639 --> 01:12:04.190
total war once about amassing the entire

01:12:04.190 --> 01:12:06.469
country as a weapon and these

01:12:06.469 --> 01:12:08.719
apocalyptic wars that were like this is

01:12:08.719 --> 01:12:10.969
the war to end all wars instead of back

01:12:10.969 --> 01:12:12.679
in the day when it would be like this is

01:12:12.679 --> 01:12:14.840
a war for this small territory these two

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:15.830
kings want it

01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:18.560

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.270
was part of life know the Boers were

01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:22.369
considered just like a natural part of

01:12:22.369 --> 01:12:25.610
life yeah like we fight gallantly like

01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:27.860
all this [ __ ] and now it's like we

01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:31.429

01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:43.010
board and all that's for - they're like

01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:47.510
finally peace and then wow yeah yeah the

01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:48.739
book I'm reading right now I think you'd

01:12:48.739 --> 01:12:50.540
like it's called end zone by Don DeLillo

01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:53.179
and it's about it's basically about

01:12:53.179 --> 01:12:55.790
nuclear warfare but also it's the whole

01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:58.400
plot is through a college football team

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.230
so it's about this college football team

01:13:00.230 --> 01:13:01.369
and then they're like the one guy gets

01:13:01.369 --> 01:13:02.929
obsessed with nuclear warfare and like

01:13:02.929 --> 01:13:04.369
talks to all his teachers about it and

01:13:04.369 --> 01:13:06.619
do they like talk about like decimation

01:13:06.619 --> 01:13:08.030
of populous really it's like a weird

01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:09.619
book it's really funny but they have a

01:13:09.619 --> 01:13:11.030
whole thing about that is how like our

01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:13.400

found God and started focusing on that

01:16:25.679 --> 01:16:26.969
and the dad went back to France and just

01:16:26.969 --> 01:16:28.140
[ __ ]

01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:30.670
yeah but he was a lady raised Napoleon

01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:32.890
yeah and the dad who was like a war hero

01:16:32.890 --> 01:16:34.600
or he was just like he was [ __ ]

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:36.370
everybody he's also like a war hero he

01:16:36.370 --> 01:16:38.110

the military's like the officers because

01:17:11.950 --> 01:17:13.210
