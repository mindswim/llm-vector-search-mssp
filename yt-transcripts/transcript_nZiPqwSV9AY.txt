00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.360
to a high standard i mean new york is

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.880
just like you can take a cab and hang

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.880

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.799
sets in a night yeah and and there's

00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:16.320
something about new york where if you

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.919
get too happy with yourself or it

00:19:17.919 --> 00:19:20.080

get called on the mat so i don't know if

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.600
it's still that way it is but there is

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.679
still that sort of there's a purity

00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:27.440
there there's a there's a standard there

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.480

noodle every night you know what i'm

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.960
saying yeah that's i think that's the

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.799
100 yeah that was like the hold up with

00:19:36.799 --> 00:19:39.360

and then the new york guys were like

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.960
[ __ ] that yeah yeah yeah it's like it's

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.520
always been that way

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.840
yeah builds a resentment you kind of

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.600
want to hold on to some of that like i

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.640
always feel like because new york

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.799
there's a reason well it's not just grit

00:19:56.799 --> 00:19:57.679

comedy cellar or wherever you go yeah it

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.360
you know you got colin quinn you got

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.760
louis ck you got all the old dudes

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.760
who've been doing it forever and and a

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.960
lot of guys who haven't heard of that

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.120
are murderers like grier barnes is a

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.360
[ __ ] murderer and all those guys so

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.080
what happens is like they'll kind of let

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.520
you know oh they'll let you know you

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.559
know what i mean they'll let you know if

00:20:20.559 --> 00:20:21.760
you start getting

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.200
i don't know

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.200
yeah and also just a little too

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.240
um

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.840
it's almost like a like like so so

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.960
you'll see some people who can write a

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.400
really good song and there are tricks

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.760
and hooks and rhymes to it and it's real

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.520
commercial

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.559
then you see somebody who's doing

00:20:34.559 --> 00:20:35.840
something different with music you know

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.360
and that's that

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.200
you're always expected to keep

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.440
it that way sure i guess but but i think

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.679
there's something to it because

00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:45.120
like you because you can be a grinder

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.200
you can be that kind of comic and then

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.520
still also update with the time because

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.280
then you get a guy like kevin hart sure

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.280
andrew schultz yeah i'm saying

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.280
you need both yeah you have to yeah you

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.480
absolutely otherwise you are that's

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.919
exactly right well you should be playing

00:20:57.919 --> 00:20:59.280
you know yeah you're going to crush it

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.280
at the you know the seller or the store

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.120
but all right not pay your rent yeah

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.000
yeah

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.520
you get respect from everybody but it's

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.600
like i think that the one thing that

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.840
that i've always struggled with as you

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.600
know is just the fact that a huge part

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.440
of your job is figuring out how to

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.640
promote how to be relevant yeah

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.000
yeah and i

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.120
have trouble with yeah yeah i have

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.960
trouble with that i hate it i do too and

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.280
you got to do it you have to do it

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.720
but i feel like you yeah i feel like you

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.720
do pretty good i try not to do it yeah

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.679
which is the worst but it's like

00:21:27.679 --> 00:21:30.000
authentic to you it's like it's shane

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.159
that's the way shane would promote yeah

00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:34.000
it's because now it's a youtube special

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.760

actually what's the answer it's all

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.880
that's a good question

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.080
it's got to be the octagon that's going

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.440
to be the scariest thing in the [ __ ]

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:35.520
world they're both scary man yeah i mean

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.159
dude it's brutal yeah

00:22:38.159 --> 00:22:39.440
it's terrifying the one thing about him

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.000
is i remember i never i i felt bad i did

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.440
it we were in seattle and it was like

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.000
1800 people in a in a theater and we

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.200
were doing uh

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.559
we were doing i don't know what it was

00:22:48.559 --> 00:22:51.120
we were doing a live podcast

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.240
and brandon had

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.000
zero experience in front of people like

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.400
zero and but he was like let's do live

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.600
podcast so

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.240
so i i remember i kind of was like

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.760
you're gonna go out i'm gonna be i'm

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.360
gonna pretend to be late you're gonna go

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.200
out and tell a story

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.280
and you're gonna be alone on stage and i

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.440
kind of just pushed him out there yeah

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.520
and he was like and and he did like you

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.120
did a couple breathing exercises i think

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.559
you learned from navy seals yeah you

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:16.000
must

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.400
and you just go out there and did really

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.559
well and then i remember i was like i

00:23:20.559 --> 00:23:21.679
shouldn't have done that to you you know

00:23:21.679 --> 00:23:23.280
i shouldn't have that's a [ __ ] big

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.799
thing because if you've never done that

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:26.960
yeah that's that's a disas that's

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.000
terrifying so he did great

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.960
and

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.320
and then later on we were talking you're

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.159
like i've been getting out there in my

00:23:34.159 --> 00:23:36.720
underwear against monsters and they lock

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.159
a cage

00:23:38.159 --> 00:23:39.120
and

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.679
you got to come out and you could die

00:23:41.679 --> 00:23:43.440
and i think once you face that it's a

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.880
it's you know i don't know it's just

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.720

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:06.080
when you can't say that it was very

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.279

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.799
uh

00:28:12.799 --> 00:28:13.520
he

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.880
every story i ever heard of my grandpa

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.880
was him like fighting people

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.679
all he did was attack people and then

00:28:19.679 --> 00:28:21.279
like every story like he'd be punching

00:28:21.279 --> 00:28:22.159
cars

00:28:22.159 --> 00:28:23.679
he was an animal and he was like six

00:28:23.679 --> 00:28:26.480
five he was huge and uh

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.640
when he died he had a heart attack and

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.760
then

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.520
he woke up on the operating table out of

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.440
the anesthesia and tried to fight like

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.520
the nurses his heart exploded

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.679
and then uh so nobody in my family ever

00:28:41.679 --> 00:28:43.039
put it together and then they showed me

00:28:43.039 --> 00:28:44.399
this newspaper clipping from like the

00:28:44.399 --> 00:28:46.640
20s when he was playing that he was held

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.520
out of

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.880
against purdue he couldn't play because

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.640
of a head injury and if you have a head

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.120
injury in the 20s

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.960
through your [ __ ] head like you like

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.720
practice well when you have a brain my

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.240
friend had a traumatic brain injury fell

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.000
out of a van and hit the back of his

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.720
head and they had to strap him down when

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.080
i went to see him in the hospital he was

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.159
strapped to the gurney i was like why is

00:29:06.159 --> 00:29:07.600
he strapped to the ground they go well

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.520
when he comes too he'll come too

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.760
periodically when he wakes up he tries

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.840
to fight us because he brews the front

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.760
of his brain oh no and so there's two

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.720
things that happen when you get

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.840
concussed like it's it it is what it is

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.840
it just i don't know i'm sure maybe it's

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.120
genetic or something but when you get

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.480
concussed either you get really

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.000
aggressive and you want to fight like

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.840
your grandpa is trying to kill everybody

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.240
or you get really emotional i cry yeah

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.000
the times i've been knocked out

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:32.799
yeah

00:29:32.799 --> 00:29:35.279
you have any crazy injuries uh no i tore

00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:36.000
my

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.399
mcl and lcu did you did you nothing with

00:29:38.399 --> 00:29:39.919
the head did you get many concussions

00:29:39.919 --> 00:29:41.919
playing football i played o-line so it

00:29:41.919 --> 00:29:43.520
was like they say that's the worst yeah

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.080
it's just slow and gradual yeah but it

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.360
was you never got like your bell right

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.039
you know yeah yeah yeah how old are you

00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:51.679
i'm 33. so i mean similar but growing up

00:29:51.679 --> 00:29:53.520
like playing pop one or yeah when you

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.960
get to you're like oh you got his bell

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.799
rung like get back in there yeah like

00:29:56.799 --> 00:29:58.080
now you're thinking about like hey hey

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.000
dumbass yeah bellrung means i shouldn't

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.679
be practicing yeah how often would you

00:30:01.679 --> 00:30:03.200
get your bell wrong because you're big

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.880
in college was tough playing playing

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.039
fullback dude that must have my friend

00:30:07.039 --> 00:30:08.080

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.520
like seven concussions in like one

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.440

just crashing fullback for big 12x crazy

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.880
the big 12. that's the that's the

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.880
because that's the position like

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.799
just middle linebackers and fullbacks

00:30:22.799 --> 00:30:24.320
over and over so i was full back in the

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.159
big 12 and then i was the wedge breaker

00:30:26.159 --> 00:30:29.279
on special oh my god and i was the wedge

00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:30.960

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.279
ufc then what they used to do during

00:30:39.279 --> 00:30:40.960

00:30:45.679 --> 00:30:47.440
on mondays after the game they'd have

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.279

00:30:49.279 --> 00:30:51.039

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.039
man i'm like yeah no doubt yeah what

00:30:57.039 --> 00:30:59.120
does this wedge breaker mean again so i

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.720
explained it take off they got rid of

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.320
this they got ready they don't even have

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.000
it in football it's so dangerous it was

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.440
the most dangerous that's how dangerous

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.960
it is yeah they don't have it there's

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.799
rules

00:31:08.799 --> 00:31:11.039
yeah yeah so hold on so you know so

00:31:11.039 --> 00:31:13.039
let's say the start of the game there's

00:31:13.039 --> 00:31:14.720
a team that the kickoff team kicks the

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.120
ball yep so there's the return man yeah

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.600
from the return man is a wedge of human

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.559
beings

00:31:20.559 --> 00:31:23.600
that that go like try to block so he can

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.960
score a touchdown okay yeah but then

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.760
there's a guy who's a kamikaze guy that

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.600
runs to break that wedge so those guys

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.519
can't block yeah his job is literally to

00:31:31.519 --> 00:31:33.760
dive straight into that wall and it's

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.880
sprinting

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.760
50 yards into each other i mean it's

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.120
it's yeah they got rid of and you're

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.120

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.519
he cuts over from alabama two here one

00:33:13.519 --> 00:33:15.200
that doesn't blind sideways yeah there's

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.279
a dude who runs to the left right to

00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:18.080
left

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.480
and that's clearly boom oh my god back

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.679
up the field

00:33:21.679 --> 00:33:23.200
um what you're going to see at the plus

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.080
45 two players come together damn

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.640
shoulder to shoulder uh to block for the

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.279
ball carrier and so that is a foul as

00:33:31.279 --> 00:33:33.600
well why is that actually two

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.880
why is that a foul

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.080
when it was a longer one you were the

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.039
middle

00:33:37.039 --> 00:33:39.279
yeah and you just wait for the guy to

00:33:39.279 --> 00:33:41.200
like blow you up but i was the guy that

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.880
would blow it up too yeah so i got him

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.320
both you're just spending a lot of time

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.840
[ __ ] helmet on helmet with other

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.000
dudes yeah yeah those guys are yeah that

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.440
was like the scariest guy on the team

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.279
though yeah i hated blocking those dudes

00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:52.640
the worst there was like there were

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:53.760
middle linebackers that were like that

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.279
that would like lead with their helmet

00:33:55.279 --> 00:33:57.360
yeah and i played offensive line so like

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.039
you're kind of like we played zone

00:33:59.039 --> 00:34:01.200
blocking so i was always kind of upright

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.120
not really firing hell and dudes would

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.640
just dive straight into your [ __ ]

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.640
head it's nuts it was terrible and you

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.720
can't leave with the helmet anymore

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.800
this is what they say right

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.320
as an offensive lineman you kind of can

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.000
be that's not how nobody blocks that way

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.560
yeah you block with your hands yeah oh

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.119
so was your dream to go the nfl

00:34:19.119 --> 00:34:21.440
uh are you that guy

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.399
you knew

00:34:22.399 --> 00:34:23.760
i knew you got the army did you know it

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.359
in high school did you in high school i

00:34:25.359 --> 00:34:26.879
knew i was not going oh good for you

00:34:26.879 --> 00:34:28.800
yeah most guys i ran like a five seven

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.800
forty i was like

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:35.480
i'm not going anywhere this is

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.159
what's average for someone in that

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:39.119
position

00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:41.280
now they run like four nines yeah oh

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.960
it's terrible like it used to be it used

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.760
to be like a freak if you're like 349.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.839
now there's four lines every year and

00:34:47.839 --> 00:34:49.599
there's three hundred people no one's

00:34:49.599 --> 00:34:51.679
running a [ __ ] five that's yeah they

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:53.359
no they are they are it's stupid they

00:34:53.359 --> 00:34:55.440
even make them run 40 yards but there's

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.359
there's a lot of your lateral motion too

00:34:57.359 --> 00:34:58.960
the side to side motion that they do for

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.839
o lineman yeah the 510

00:35:00.839 --> 00:35:03.599
five yeah the

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:05.680
i ran like i went to this combine at

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.040
west virginia

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.119
and ran easily the slowest 40 in the

00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:11.760
entire combine and i was just like it's

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.119
so embarrassing

00:35:13.119 --> 00:35:14.560
because you run they're all it's so

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:15.760
important because everyone knows there's

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.599
a whole group and they're like five

00:35:17.599 --> 00:35:20.720
seven seven you're like

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.839
there was a slow twitch muscle over here

00:35:23.839 --> 00:35:25.680
it was so slow dude you have to do the

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.640
uh

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.240
225 yeah

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.400
225 that's stupid for linemen too yeah

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.560
they should be doing 315. yeah would you

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.520
you get a lot i did i forget

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.119
you you know you really can't work on

00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:38.240
speed though it's one of those things

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.760
you either have or you don't you can get

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.119
better you know there's techniques

00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:44.920
there's techniques but yeah

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.720
buddy there was a there was a kid from

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.079
there was a west virginia player because

00:36:04.079 --> 00:36:05.599
they had the players from west virginia

00:36:05.599 --> 00:36:06.880
were like helping i think it was like

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.599
scout.com or something and

00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:12.720
the dude who timed me was like damn like

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.000
i heard him time it was like damn

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.839
like

00:36:17.839 --> 00:36:20.560
those times

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.119
between us

00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:25.040
like chappelle was like i ran a 4-3 in

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.760
high school

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.200
anybody i've been around the game i go

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.200
chapelle your coach told you that yeah

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.480
and i don't think you're a liar but i

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.599
promise you you did yeah because that

00:36:33.599 --> 00:36:34.960
was because everybody gets hand-timed

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.480
and they're like oh i ran a five five or

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.839
four or five in high school it's like

00:36:37.839 --> 00:36:38.960
you're in a fourth generation i promise

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.119
you didn't you but i love you the coach

00:36:41.119 --> 00:36:42.640
who told you that doesn't know what he's

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.320
doing and lied to you but in your head

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.119
you thought you were running for well

00:36:45.119 --> 00:36:47.200
because it was like an affordable right

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.119
it was like the talk of the time jump

00:36:49.119 --> 00:36:53.040
talking to town or whatever it was crazy

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.880
dude i might have set records at this

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.119
camp it's the worst fight of all time

00:36:57.119 --> 00:36:58.800
dude when you have children you you hope

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.160
it is hope that maybe your kids are

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.079
going to be i don't know something

00:37:02.079 --> 00:37:04.640
physically special right yeah now i'm me

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:08.079

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.839
medal swimmer sprinter i can't remember

00:37:13.839 --> 00:37:15.760
her name she's pretty well known

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.599
she's a swimmer and she does uh

00:37:17.599 --> 00:37:19.839
a lot of the uh announcing don't do that

00:37:19.839 --> 00:37:23.000
i know

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.680
downhill skier right

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.280
both of them are just a couple of like

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.560
you see them and you go well you look

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.880
different right yeah yeah so my kids

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.200
i was it but they're skiers i would yeah

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.599
but they're but he's a great he's a

00:37:41.599 --> 00:37:43.520
little guy he's a little gay hold on

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:44.640
gold medalist

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.720
that downhill skiing is a real sport

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.720

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.640
to be special i mean he's still i looked

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.000
at his body and i remember he's an

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.079
outlier skier for sure yeah but it's

00:38:04.079 --> 00:38:06.079
just all legs and ass and just muscular

00:38:06.079 --> 00:38:08.240

certain like single leg and grip and

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.920
stuff with like and i don't give him too

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.359
much when i'm like dude when he comes at

00:39:19.359 --> 00:39:21.200
you grab the leg run through and you

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:22.960
know i just kind of barely coach him on

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.280
it and then last week was the first time

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.520
real life takedowns and dude i don't

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.119
know if it's something in his dna or

00:39:29.119 --> 00:39:31.200
just because it was in my dna oh yeah

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.720
the double leg that i did was my

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.720
signature double leg he takes this

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.040
[ __ ] eight-year-old and single legs

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.560

christ and they looked at me like dude

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.040
yeah i was like yeah i did not show him

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:46.000
that much what's your chance that's

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.119
interesting

00:39:47.119 --> 00:39:48.800
i don't know if it's just his neck is he

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.200
just downloaded the data the kid looks

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.960
like he does neck exercises like he's

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.599
got high calves he's got a neck when he

00:39:55.599 --> 00:39:56.560
was four years he's built like a

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.320
stingray when he was four years we used

00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.760
to we used to go to this ma our friend

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.280
owns a uh uh parkour parkour gym

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.839
so tiger would be four years old and

00:40:05.839 --> 00:40:07.280
you'd watch this kid

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.640
you'd watch him run he would never get

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.040
tired and he would just run

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.079
no it stinks

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.200
backflips and all that [ __ ] those

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.359
parkour guys are nuts i'm like how do

00:40:19.359 --> 00:40:20.960

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.359
differences but i'm not drawing sides

00:47:49.359 --> 00:47:51.040
like i'm trying to show the folly on

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:53.440
both sides but whenever i whenever i

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.440
like i notice in my crowds when i make

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.359
fun of like the liberals

00:47:57.359 --> 00:47:58.400
and then then i'm going to make fun of

00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.440
the conservatives but they don't know

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:00.319
you

00:48:00.319 --> 00:48:02.480
yeah yeah that's kind of crazy yeah our

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.960
boy uh david lucas who goes on before

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:07.040
chappelle with me he literally comes out

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:08.480
goes hey am i the only one that misses

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.960
trump here yeah anywhere we go yeah

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.640
anywhere crazy

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.160
certain markets go crazy in certain

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.160
markets i'm a youth but a rough night

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:18.000
yeah who who got weird about it where

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:18.839
were we

00:48:18.839 --> 00:48:22.240
at uh oklahoma oklahoma yeah so which is

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.240
weird oklahoma yes yeah start talking

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:26.160
some of those states like i did uh

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.240
richmond virginia and you would think

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:29.920
like all right these but there's there's

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:31.839
like little pockets in

00:48:31.839 --> 00:48:34.559
red states that are very liberal

00:48:34.559 --> 00:48:35.520
you know what i mean i didn't think you

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:37.599
know they're surrounded by it so they're

00:48:37.599 --> 00:48:39.440
like ultra liberal

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:40.800
yeah you know what i mean yeah depends

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.160
on where you go that's what's surprising

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.880
if it's more combative yeah it's it they

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.319
get defensive you know that actually

00:48:46.319 --> 00:48:48.079
makes sense but like even he did in

00:48:48.079 --> 00:48:50.000
austin and because you think texas you

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.839
think red technology

00:48:51.839 --> 00:48:54.640
but in austin's austin little l.a yeah

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:57.119
watson's purple more blue you guys when

00:48:57.119 --> 00:48:58.960
he did it there it was like they're like

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.480
it's the same in arizona there's like

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.319
small like liberal pockets in like

00:49:02.319 --> 00:49:04.960
arizona's [ __ ] red but there's has

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.800
its small pockets of you know well

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:09.119
there's also like uh in schools all

00:49:09.119 --> 00:49:12.240
these kids are being challenged with new

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.480
narratives it's not how we grew up where

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.559
you learn u.s history it's really tricky

00:49:16.559 --> 00:49:18.240
now for them to teach because what

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.319
happens is as a teacher i just got into

00:49:20.319 --> 00:49:22.079
this yesterday as a teacher you're

00:49:22.079 --> 00:49:23.599
teaching elementary school if you're

00:49:23.599 --> 00:49:25.920
going to teach us history you got the

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:27.760
question becomes if you start teaching

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:29.680
from 1776

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:33.200
and not 1619 you will have stu you'll

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.800
have parents

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:35.680
who go

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.680
wait you know they and they can be white

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.040
or whatever they have their liberal

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.559
point of view and it becomes a debate

00:49:40.559 --> 00:49:42.000
it's really tricky for the teacher to

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.599
have to deal with so now the teacher

00:49:43.599 --> 00:49:44.960
teaches if you teach about being a

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:47.839
global citizen and being ra racism

00:49:47.839 --> 00:49:50.000
if you bring up the term anti-racist

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.880
it's supercharged versus not racist and

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.720
these are that in elementary school bro

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:56.000
i just was

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:56.880
yeah

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.640
i'm dealing with that in in my

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.880
elementary school so it it becomes a

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.559
whole [ __ ] thing and it's a balancing

00:50:02.559 --> 00:50:04.640
act so what's going on in fifth grade

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:07.119
yeah so young people now yeah he's

00:50:07.119 --> 00:50:08.720
actually i'm sorry he's in fourth young

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.119
people now are are i mean are being

00:50:11.119 --> 00:50:13.440
educated it's just different and social

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:15.599
media is setting a different standard

00:50:15.599 --> 00:50:18.160
they're just public shaming is a real

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:18.960
thing

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.920
and it's keeping people there's people

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.359
yeah

00:50:23.359 --> 00:50:26.640
far away far away stare

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.400
it's a very powerful thing because with

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.160
young people now there's call out

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.440
culture

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.680
and call in culture which is the idea of

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:35.440
i'll call you out in front of everybody

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.440
or i might call you in first is it for a

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:39.599
private this is happening in schools so

00:50:39.599 --> 00:50:41.280
now some student says you didn't

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.040
recognize my identity or whatever it

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.520
might be and you're being called in so

00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:47.760
now that kid calls you in

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.119
with the teacher

00:50:49.119 --> 00:50:50.640
and you've been called in now the next

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.319
step is to be called out in front of

00:50:52.319 --> 00:50:54.160
everybody oh man so what happens is with

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.160
people what's the fight it's a lot to

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.079
deal with i'm like yeah you call me in

00:50:58.079 --> 00:51:00.000
we're gonna fight correct correct that's

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.160
what we're gonna do now if you do no now

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.599
now you can't you're out of school

00:51:03.599 --> 00:51:05.359
you're out of school but also it's a lot

00:51:05.359 --> 00:51:07.440
it's a lot to deal with man because like

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.520
how do you how do you navigate that so

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.040
what happens when it's on the page kids

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:13.520
are becoming there's a puritanical

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:15.920
there's there is a new puritanism in a

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:19.040
way because everybody is afraid everyone

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.720
i i got into it a little bit yesterday

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.480
with this teacher the way she was

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.559
teaching she was teaching she was

00:51:24.559 --> 00:51:26.720
teaching white teacher yes and she was

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:29.160
teaching she had a book on anti-racism

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:31.920
anti-racism versus not being racist very

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:32.800
strong

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.880
yes it's a very strong political point

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.400
of view it's insane and what was

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.440
interesting was i was the only one to

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.520
voice it and i could tell some parents

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.760
were buttholes got tight into it other

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.760
parents got super tight obviously nobody

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.359
wants to say that to be if if they did

00:51:45.359 --> 00:51:47.359
that when me and my friends were in

00:51:47.359 --> 00:51:49.839
fourth grade it'd be so long it'd be so

00:51:49.839 --> 00:51:51.920
of course i mean i remember like we had

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.680
teachers like telling us about gay

00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:54.800
people

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.920
and we were delighted

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.079
it was so fun to say gay yeah we'd be

00:52:00.079 --> 00:52:00.960
like

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:04.240
what is gay

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:06.800
i mean if we had a racism class yeah oh

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.760
dude well that's cool wait can i say

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:11.119
what are some words i'm not allowed

00:52:11.119 --> 00:52:12.480
that's kind of what's i have a word i

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.240
want to know if it's racist that's

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:15.839
what's happening

00:52:15.839 --> 00:52:17.599
with gender now you're talking about now

00:52:17.599 --> 00:52:19.359
now you're you're describing somebody as

00:52:19.359 --> 00:52:22.960
being a straight white cisgender male 1

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:25.200
you have to they have yeah explain it

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.760
but this is in your fourth grade bro

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:29.200
i don't want to get into this but too

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:33.000
much oh my god

00:52:38.319 --> 00:52:39.920
well there are two things that can

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:41.440
happen one is

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.440
it becomes it's hard for on the teacher

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.720
it's hard on the teacher because they

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:45.920
they're being pushed they're being

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:47.359
pulled on one and everybody's having an

00:52:47.359 --> 00:52:49.440
argument so now how do we teach right

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:51.040
how do we teach what is the standard

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:52.800
what's the truth i'm all first teaching

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.480
true american history okay not

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.720
whitewashed but these are kids i don't

00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.480
know how to do it but what also happens

00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:59.839
is exactly what you're saying dude like

00:52:59.839 --> 00:53:02.880
my friend's kid my my my he goes it's a

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.960
nice butterfly and he goes he goes look

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.079
at him look at him look at him sitting

00:53:06.079 --> 00:53:08.000
there on that pedal and his friend goes

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.520
his son goes dead

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:12.400
joking around goes how dare you

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.000
gender that butterflies excuse them

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.200
fourth grade but they're all [ __ ]

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:16.640
around now they're making fun of it oh

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:18.319
yeah oh yeah you start doing if you

00:53:18.319 --> 00:53:20.559
start making it hush hush oh kids are

00:53:20.559 --> 00:53:22.640
going to run bro yeah and also the kids

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.480
aren't dumb like my niece

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:25.839
like i was talking to her about it and

00:53:25.839 --> 00:53:27.280
that she's in like seventh or eighth

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:28.400
grade and she's like

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:31.359

you just don't have friends

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.040
this is a move

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:57.640
back in my day you're called goth yeah

00:54:09.119 --> 00:54:11.119

it's just a lot man it's a lot

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:15.760
there is something about

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:18.000
there is a lot of talk in a lot of

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.119
schools

00:54:19.119 --> 00:54:21.280
about capitalism

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:23.920
being essentially inherently racist

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:26.079
that's insane and you hear this all the

00:54:26.079 --> 00:54:28.400
time that is the narrative on that side

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.319
of the equation so

00:54:30.319 --> 00:54:32.800
you got to know when people like cloak

00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:34.400
something that they're teaching and

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.079
we're just trying to all get along and

00:54:36.079 --> 00:54:37.839
you go that's not what's going on yeah

00:54:37.839 --> 00:54:39.200
you're teaching a strong political

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.960
agenda here yeah you have a bias you got

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:42.079
a box yeah you got it you got it you

00:54:42.079 --> 00:54:43.520
can't have that you're trying to say

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:46.079
capitalism is racist it's a very common

00:54:46.079 --> 00:54:48.720
thing now in the anti-racist far-left

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.240
movement you know whatever it might be

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:52.880
that capitalism and the structures of

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:55.920
even the western institutions all of

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:58.000
them are inherently

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.760
biased towards one

00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.359
it's it's it's essentially a white

00:55:01.359 --> 00:55:04.880
supremacy construct therefore it favors

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:08.160
only whites and so that may there may be

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.680
a debate there may be a conversation to

00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:12.559
be had there hell yeah

00:55:13.119 --> 00:55:15.359

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.200
were like

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.640
they were playing

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.559
like a southern iowa

01:05:08.559 --> 01:05:10.079
some juco from iowa and they're like

01:05:10.079 --> 01:05:11.280
we're gonna [ __ ] kill these white

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.160
dudes

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.799
just 50 white dudes show up and just

01:05:14.799 --> 01:05:17.599
pound it down their throat

01:05:17.599 --> 01:05:19.200

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.240
helmets they're like [ __ ] this [ __ ] it

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.680
was just one even though

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:25.039
it's just white guys that white coach

01:05:25.039 --> 01:05:28.480
you let these white boys do this to you

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.200

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:36.960
disciplined i gotta i gotta watch this

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.480
one of the games it's like their second

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:48.480
uh yeah i think it's the second game of

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:50.319
the season they just straight up clear

01:05:50.319 --> 01:05:52.000
the bench in a fist fight yeah with the

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.440
other team and he gets suspended for

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.359
like four years that's why he missed the

01:05:55.359 --> 01:05:57.280
point

01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.799
yeah it's fantastic

01:05:58.799 --> 01:06:00.079
i got to watch this one dealing with

01:06:00.079 --> 01:06:01.359
self-destructive behavior like that

01:06:01.359 --> 01:06:05.160
that's like that's sabotage

01:06:05.839 --> 01:06:07.119
that's why the coaches are there yeah

01:06:07.119 --> 01:06:08.319
you realize that that's why it's great

01:06:08.319 --> 01:06:10.160
everybody hates themselves to a degree

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.240
that they're gonna [ __ ] it up

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:13.760
you realize that like jason brown any of

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.599
those guys there's so much self-loathing

01:06:15.599 --> 01:06:17.440
that you can get them right to the

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.960
[ __ ] edge and you go all you gotta do

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.559
is jump bro and just sprout wings just

01:06:20.559 --> 01:06:22.000

there's video on there i think that

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:52.400
probably might that's probably made up

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.000
she can't sit on their lap i'm telling

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.080

[Music]

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.960
i like your attitude i like what you're

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:12.480
saying but that's not true and that's

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:15.120
okay we'll see

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:27.440
uh

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.040
because the chance of any of them going

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.960
anywhere basketball yeah starting now

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:33.600
yeah yeah and the the poor coach man

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.440
he's like they're like

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.120
he has like six kids he's awesome he

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:39.840
does it like you know yeah he gets fired

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.520
up i watch that rinse around he doesn't

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:44.159
swear yeah he's the best of the coaches

01:10:44.159 --> 01:10:45.760
by far the best he's probably the best

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.120
and then there was a guy

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:49.040
a job with the uh with usc and the

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.800
lakers and turned it down really he said

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.080
i'm trying to give back to the kids yeah

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:54.159
that guy's awesome his wife's like [ __ ]

01:10:54.159 --> 01:10:55.040
yeah

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:58.000
bloody the big fat guy in season one

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
he's a dick

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.560
and then the guy from compton

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:05.120
those two are those ones dude they

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:08.400
if their team is losing they explode

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:09.679
they're down like seven nothing at the

01:11:09.679 --> 01:11:10.560
beginning of game and they'll be like

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:12.480
[ __ ] it get the [ __ ] out like just

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.159
spazzing on coordinators if someone

01:11:14.159 --> 01:11:15.920
throws the interception it's just like

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:18.560
game over here

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:19.920
even if they're up 14 they throw

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.760
interceptions and it's like they have no

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.199
momentum and all these players don't

01:11:23.199 --> 01:11:24.080
want to be there because they're all

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.760
just trying to go d1 yeah but they're

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:26.800
all just like it's in the middle of

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.520
cambodia they're just like a nightmare

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.040
and some kids like there was a big shot

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.640
that was that florida state like a

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.400
five-star recruit yeah it didn't work

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.480
out for you sock the lady in the face

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:39.600
what yeah they're wild i will say this

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.480
yeah i'm not going to defend him but

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:45.600
watch the tape yeah

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.120
every story has two sides that's all i'm

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.800
going to say she did wait there's a tape

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:51.280
of it out there yeah oh yeah

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.560
what did she do

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.560
it looked to me like she did try to hit

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.960
him or swung at him yeah they're like

01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:58.400
i'm not saying he should punch a lady in

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.000
the face yeah that's [ __ ] outrageous

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.600
this is at florida state yeah i got

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.280
kicked out and had to go to independence

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:05.440
yeah he had to go okay wait did she did

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:07.679
he fought did she follow him no they

01:12:07.679 --> 01:12:09.199
they're at a bar

01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:10.719
they're at a bar he's like a freshman

01:12:10.719 --> 01:12:12.560
yeah they bump into each other at the

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:15.120
bar right and she like nudges him out of

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.640
the way to get in the spot of the bar

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:18.480
and he's like what are you doing and i

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:20.400
think she kind of swings at him and then

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:21.360
he just

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:24.400
oh holy [ __ ] he's not good he reacted

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.239

floor stays like you can't have it man

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.840

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.360
the with the compton coach yeah and then

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.120

01:12:44.159 --> 01:12:45.040
out

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.320

did you get passed on the first try

01:36:49.679 --> 01:36:51.760
first uh i had a weird

01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:53.600
way of getting past because i auditioned

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:56.639
like kind of before covet and then covet

01:36:56.639 --> 01:36:59.199
happened so i actually auditioned like

01:36:59.199 --> 01:37:01.679
before snl a little bit and then i got

01:37:01.679 --> 01:37:03.040
canceled

01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:04.000
and they're like

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.920
and then i got and then covet happened

01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:07.440
so there was like really no window for

01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:10.159
me to even audition and then uh they

01:37:10.159 --> 01:37:12.000
just called and were like send us your

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.520
veils

01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:14.560
out of nowhere you've probably talked

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:16.000
about this before who called you to tell

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.239
you you weren't on snl uh

01:37:18.239 --> 01:37:20.400
lauren and like a man like a lady and

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:22.080
then lauren

01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:23.920
like a lady that represents like any

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:25.040
time you talk to lauren somebody would

01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:26.719
call him be like michael's on the line

01:37:26.719 --> 01:37:28.800
was he cool i like i like learn a lot

01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:30.960
yeah i still do was it your i'm sure

01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:32.159
again i'm sure you've talked about this

01:37:32.159 --> 01:37:33.440
that's fine

01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:35.119
was it your dream to do saturday live

01:37:35.119 --> 01:37:36.960
like was that maybe in like seventh

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:38.639
grade when it was but then once i

01:37:38.639 --> 01:37:40.159
started doing stand-up i was like this

01:37:40.159 --> 01:37:41.280
is

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:44.159
yeah i knew i i figured i would never be

01:37:44.159 --> 01:37:45.520
on snl

01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:48.000
like ever because i've seen it yeah yeah

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.480
lately and i know what i do yeah you

01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:51.600
know

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:52.960
yeah it's fair you think it's a blessing

01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:54.960
in disguise that all this happens sure

01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:56.320
you guys here's what i said what else

01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:57.280
you gonna do though you know what i'm

01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:59.119
saying like you yeah

01:37:59.119 --> 01:38:00.880
you could sulk on it and of course

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:02.639
that's yeah what could you do should i

01:38:02.639 --> 01:38:04.560
quit but but i i gotta be honest it's

01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:06.239
one of the reasons i think

01:38:06.239 --> 01:38:07.679
a lot of people rallied around because

01:38:07.679 --> 01:38:08.800
everyone's like definitely the [ __ ]

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:11.520
we've all said stupid [ __ ] yeah you know

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:13.280
but there's also like uh

01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:14.880
like there's i think if i would have got

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:16.480
snl i think i could have done very well

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:18.080
on it i agree you had a good career that

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:21.040
way 100 and now that i got cancelled

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:22.480
from it or however you want to say it

01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:24.000
yeah uh

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.760
i think that i that is also a good

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:28.480
opportunity so i would say

01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:30.719
i would rather it have happened

01:38:30.719 --> 01:38:32.639
than not at all you know what i mean

01:38:32.639 --> 01:38:34.800
yeah you know like if i just never got

01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:36.719
snl and never got either way i think

01:38:36.719 --> 01:38:38.800
it's put you on them yeah yeah for sure

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:40.719
yeah and i think

01:38:40.719 --> 01:38:41.679
uh

01:38:41.679 --> 01:38:43.600
yeah i'm alright i'm comfortable having

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:44.960
eyes on

01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:45.840
me

01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:48.400
with my what i'm creating well you're

01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:50.480
creating you're like i'm not afraid to

01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:52.800
i'm not worried about a spotlight on

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:54.239
what i make

01:38:54.239 --> 01:38:56.239
no but that makes sense no it makes

01:38:56.239 --> 01:38:58.000
sense if i sock thing got canceled that

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.320
would be a tough huge problem well you

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:01.760
want to have a career yeah that would be

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:03.760
a major issue but i i think too it's

01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:05.600
like you know the fans that rallied

01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:06.880
around you and then

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:08.880
they brought all this attention to you

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:10.400
those are the people that [ __ ] with you

01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:12.400
like those are your actual fans

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:14.159
instead of like life they're not all

01:39:14.159 --> 01:39:15.840
shane gillis fans sure now you're

01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:17.600
building a real fan base there's a

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:18.560
downside

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:19.920
there's a doubt but you're also playing

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:21.440
like when you're on the road now you're

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:23.119
playing home games sure you get your

01:39:23.119 --> 01:39:25.360
fans you can [ __ ] around like you're

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:26.400
special

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:28.400
you know if you're just a life fan you

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:29.760
turn into let's say you're on there and

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:30.960
you turn and you're stressed like jesus

01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:32.719
christ shane went hard in the pain yeah

01:39:32.719 --> 01:39:34.639
your fans are like [ __ ] yeah that would

01:39:34.639 --> 01:39:35.600
have been a pain you know what i'm

01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:37.520
saying but it was all it's also there is

01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:39.040
downside that like immediately when you

01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:40.880
get canceled there are a lot of people

01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:43.600
that you don't want as a fan yeah

01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:44.960
oh yeah i gotta have guys coming up to

01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:47.440
me after shows and like screaming slurs

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:49.119
yeah i'd be like hell yeah be like i

01:39:49.119 --> 01:39:52.080
don't think you get it yeah

01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:52.840
thank

01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:54.480
you that shirt off yeah i think if

01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:56.000
you're gonna do that

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.280
yeah i think people rallied around you

01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:58.480
because

01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:00.320
most people are not comfortable and

01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:02.560
shouldn't be with the idea that you said

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:04.639
something in passing

01:40:04.639 --> 01:40:06.560
in a certain context

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:08.639
like in a conversation

01:40:08.639 --> 01:40:11.600
and your whole life should not be

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.840
erased for that sure your opportunity

01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:16.080
which is a huge one in snl which very

01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:18.080
few people get shouldn't be taken away

01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:20.000
yeah and that is the world yeah and i

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.280
think everyone would agree including

01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:23.040
myself that it wasn't great

01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:25.360
yeah my what i said yeah yeah but uh

01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:26.880
yeah i think the punishment didn't

01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:28.560
really match the crime right i agree and

01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:29.760
that's where everyone was like all right

01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:31.280
maybe chill

01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:33.280
but and i also think the other yeah i

01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:34.960
think that's the counter to council

01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:36.560
culture it's like all right he said

01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:37.920
something should have said

01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:40.639
he lost his job and i think most humans

01:40:40.639 --> 01:40:41.920
are like nah that ain't right man well

01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:43.600
because you know they're tuned in right

01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:44.639
and the other thing that's really

01:40:44.639 --> 01:40:46.480
important to realize that when you do

01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:47.920
cancel somebody like when they do that

01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:48.719
to you

01:40:48.719 --> 01:40:50.000
you're not making the world more

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.600
equitable you're actually not doing

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:53.119
anything you it's not as though now

01:40:53.119 --> 01:40:54.960
you're making the world

01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:57.840
more fair and more equal you're just

01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:59.199
you're just kind of you're suppressing

01:40:59.199 --> 01:41:00.159
it form of destruction you're

01:41:00.159 --> 01:41:02.400
suppressing it making it worse yeah

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:06.080
i think the only real way to beat

01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:07.679
whatever this is the cancel culture

01:41:07.679 --> 01:41:09.760
thing is to just keep going yeah like

01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:11.840
don't let it consume you like if i if i

01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:13.360
got cancer and then spent the next two

01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:16.159
years being like [ __ ] cancel culture

01:41:16.159 --> 01:41:17.679
[ __ ] this i'm gonna stop riding then i'm

01:41:17.679 --> 01:41:19.440
not doing it then i'm not doing that's

01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:21.040
how that that's how you go downhill

01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:22.320
that's how you get cancer yeah i agree

01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:23.760
you let that keep moving you keep

01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:25.360
running i think you releasing the

01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:26.719
special was kind of like yeah definitely

01:41:26.719 --> 01:41:30.080
not canceled you know what you're saying

01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:31.440
although anybody could have put a

01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:34.080
youtube special out there

01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:35.360
but that's right

01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:36.719
that's right anybody can put it and have

01:41:36.719 --> 01:41:38.960
it do a good job being good and other

01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:40.719
people co-sign it and be like hey watch

01:41:40.719 --> 01:41:42.400
this [ __ ] special man that's the

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:43.760
difference yeah

01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:44.960
and i think

01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:46.880
you put on youtube and then

01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:49.040

like he'd have to follow seinfeld and

01:57:57.040 --> 01:57:58.639
then he would go on stage

01:57:58.639 --> 01:57:59.920
how am i going to follow seinfeld and

01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:01.679

01:58:03.119 --> 01:58:04.400
i wish somebody never mentioned it i

wish somebody gave this guy i wish i had

01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:07.280
that note because i remember

01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:09.440
like four years ago i had to follow neil

01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:11.520
brennan is when his special came out and

01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:14.639
he did some crazy bit was like you know

01:58:14.639 --> 01:58:17.119
just the the his vocabulary he's like so

01:58:17.119 --> 01:58:18.480
much better than mine he's such smart

01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:20.159
dude he wrote chappelle and he like

01:58:20.159 --> 01:58:22.000
brought the house down and i

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.920
acknowledged it i want to say i

01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:26.400
acknowledged it and it i ate [ __ ] yeah i

01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:28.560
thought why would i do that that was

01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:30.719
incredible right not do that yeah it was

01:58:30.719 --> 01:58:32.320
i would have never thought he gave me

01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:33.840
that no yeah but

01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:35.520
in my mind i was like i'll address it

01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:37.199
because they know i'm not neil brennan

01:58:37.199 --> 01:58:38.960
so i'm going to address it just so the

01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:40.560
elephant's out of the room but they're

01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:42.320

thought about it but

01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:54.080

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.239
why'd you get into comedy yeah

02:02:14.239 --> 02:02:15.520
like what made you want to be i had a

02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:17.119
producer come to me and go i have an

02:02:17.119 --> 02:02:19.679
amazing idea for you i was like alright

02:02:19.679 --> 02:02:21.599
you're going to teach an online stand-up

02:02:21.599 --> 02:02:22.480
class

02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:23.920
how many people would tune in to hear

02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:25.840
you talk about comedy you've had all

02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:27.679
this experience and i was like

02:02:27.679 --> 02:02:30.159
i there is not a thing i could teach

02:02:30.159 --> 02:02:32.480
anyone about you know what it is uh

02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:34.639
write and do it yeah intentions get on

02:02:34.639 --> 02:02:35.679
stage

02:02:35.679 --> 02:02:37.360
get up get up what do you mean what am i

02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:38.960
gonna tell you get up

02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:40.560
it's like what can you tell me about

02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:41.679
playing guitar i don't know you gotta

02:02:41.679 --> 02:02:43.920
play it for a while but it's also like i

02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:45.199
was telling chappelle this yesterday we

02:02:45.199 --> 02:02:46.719
were talking about this comic

02:02:46.719 --> 02:02:48.000
who i was like he's never going to make

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.599
it dude he's our friend i was like he's

02:02:49.599 --> 02:02:51.119
never going to make it yeah because he's

02:02:51.119 --> 02:02:53.520
lazy he doesn't write and i was like and

02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:55.199
he's busy chasing girls and i told

02:02:55.199 --> 02:02:56.159
chappelle i'm like he's never going to

02:02:56.159 --> 02:02:58.400
make it because if you think about like

02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:00.400
if because they're like say something

02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:03.040
like if if i have to say hey dude make

02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:04.320
sure you're getting up doing sets make

02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:06.400
sure you're doing this you're already at

02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:07.760
such a disadvantage you're never going

02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:09.280
to make it because i know other comics

02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:11.440
who are hustling their ass off who are

02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:13.199
funnier yeah and nobody has to tell them

02:03:13.199 --> 02:03:14.560
to do that well yeah it's because you

02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:16.560
want to do it yeah you do it because you

02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:17.760
you

02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:19.199
have to want it more than anything like

02:03:19.199 --> 02:03:21.520
like i was telling like i i made this

02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:24.560
comparison like when i was uh in the ufc

02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:26.560
and i i was like ranked number 10 in the

02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:28.239

lot of them are they're missing practice

02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:40.560

just [ __ ] super talented mm-hmm

02:10:12.079 --> 02:10:15.840
pretty much alrighty

02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:16.800
thank you

02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:18.400
appreciate it how's your neck

02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:19.920
it's kind of the same

02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:21.520
just never getting better not getting

02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:22.639
better we're staring at the sun and

02:10:22.639 --> 02:10:24.480
tweaked his neck no

02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:27.800
something happened

02:10:28.079 --> 02:10:29.199
i can't be the wrestling because it

02:10:29.199 --> 02:10:30.560
happened like a week later two weeks

02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:31.599
later that's

02:10:31.599 --> 02:10:33.520
that wrestling helped it they put me on

02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:35.119
another thing i had like a video visit

02:10:35.119 --> 02:10:37.360
with a doctor or a nurse and then you'll

02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:39.440
visit because i i'm trying everything to

02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:42.000
get to get a freaking mri but then what

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:43.920
i could do is do a video visit so then

02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:45.360
she go she put me on some sort of

02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:47.440
quarter quote steroid did it help i'm

02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:48.960
just it's a six day process so i'm on

02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:50.400
the second day right now so hopefully

02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:51.840
it'll get better so the reason he [ __ ]

02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:53.440
his neck up is we call these two the

02:10:53.440 --> 02:10:56.880
short kings and we

02:10:59.119 --> 02:11:01.760
we had a thing where uh brian chappelle

02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:03.440
played bouncers to see if they kicked me

02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:05.599
out of the bar and the studios the bar

02:11:05.599 --> 02:11:06.880
so neither one of these two could kick

02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:08.800
me out i wasn't no it was brian chen oh

02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:10.400
that's right so brian and chen tried to

02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:12.560
kick me out obviously didn't happen yeah

02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:14.880
and then uh we wanted to see if the

02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:17.119
short kings could kick out chen

02:11:17.119 --> 02:11:18.560
and apparently chin [ __ ] up probably

02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:19.920

there's something like you started

02:18:11.599 --> 02:18:12.960
asking you start asking them where they

02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:14.639

02:18:14.639 --> 02:18:16.319
and yeah but that's not what he's doing

02:18:16.319 --> 02:18:18.240
he was just you know it's probably yeah

02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:19.519

it's like this isn't that original the

02:20:32.960 --> 02:20:35.120
idea in the comic con level he knows

02:20:35.120 --> 02:20:37.520
let's say he did do that he hey he

02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:40.000
wouldn't get to the level he's at by

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.319
stealing stupid [ __ ] like this no yeah

02:20:42.319 --> 02:20:46.319

anyway yeah yeah i'll show you his part

02:20:50.319 --> 02:20:54.000

02:20:54.640 --> 02:20:57.200
your freaking son stole my freaking

02:20:57.200 --> 02:20:59.840

where it's in his diaper my son ain't no

02:21:02.479 --> 02:21:05.040
damn feet

02:21:07.439 --> 02:21:10.240
well his sketch is way better yeah i got

02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:13.240
this

02:21:14.399 --> 02:21:17.280
oh what

02:21:22.479 --> 02:21:25.040
i'm really sorry about everything

02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:26.399
thanks home girl

02:21:26.399 --> 02:21:27.439
oh come on

02:21:27.439 --> 02:21:28.319
what

02:21:28.319 --> 02:21:30.000
is the only thing

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:31.760
that's the only thing

02:21:31.760 --> 02:21:33.680
that girl on tick tock doing this now

02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:35.439
we're aware of it right yeah that's it

02:21:35.439 --> 02:21:37.040
she's not going to win she's not going

02:21:37.040 --> 02:21:38.479
to escape but also the only reason they

02:21:38.479 --> 02:21:40.160
used homegirl on chez show is because

02:21:40.160 --> 02:21:41.840
they couldn't say lesbian that's the

02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:43.439
joke

02:21:43.439 --> 02:21:45.439
the joke is you want to call a lesbian

02:21:45.439 --> 02:21:47.040
to beat up a lady

02:21:47.040 --> 02:21:48.560
that's the joke yeah

02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:50.560
but they couldn't do that well it's very

02:21:50.560 --> 02:21:51.520
interesting

02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:52.800
how do you call it very different than

02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:55.600
that this is way better yeah say so yes

02:21:55.600 --> 02:21:58.240
because you're dealing with a real comic

02:21:58.240 --> 02:22:00.319
but she's getting pr out of it now yeah

02:22:00.319 --> 02:22:01.680
so she's more popular now it's going to

02:22:01.680 --> 02:22:03.359
work what will happen is she's not going

02:22:03.359 --> 02:22:05.120
to win no she'll the judge would watch

02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:06.319
this like oh well he should just keep

02:22:06.319 --> 02:22:08.040
doing it because it's funny in your sock

02:22:08.040 --> 02:22:10.560
[Laughter]

02:22:10.560 --> 02:22:12.319

02:22:16.319 --> 02:22:18.160
she felt like her skin was being like

02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:19.840
ripped apart because escalators have

02:22:19.840 --> 02:22:22.399
