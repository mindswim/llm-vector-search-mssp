00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.560

stay on zoom for about 40 minutes or so

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.439

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.840
to end it before it got just as it was

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.599
getting good i thought

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.119
so i didn't want to end it with just

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.640
that for the week so

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.800
shane gillis was nice enough

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.160
to zoom me

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.320
and uh so it's two parts there's one

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.160
discussion with shane gillis who's a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.399
hilarious dude and then uh also with

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.520
this journalist alec bostwick

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.040

metzger this is uh

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.280
we might i guess we'll show this part

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.000
first i basically this is going to be

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.479
a two-part episode because my other guy

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.680
i talked to uh alec boswick who's a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.360
journalist in uh

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.560
new york

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.640
he didn't he had to go like kind of soon

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.560
and he left before we really got like

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.680
we're starting to get into some cool

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.880
[ __ ]

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.960
so i didn't want to release that one on

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.159
its own because it feels like we just

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.479
got somewhere with it

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.040

i because you've got about 45 minutes

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.000
too so i figured between the two of you

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.159
i have made a whole episode for the

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.360
listeners

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.799
i guess that's my opening apology i

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.079
haven't done the apology part of this

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:56.880
show

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.719
in so long

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.320
i've just been expecting other people to

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.759
apologize to me but i'm supposed to

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.719
apologize at the top of every show

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.719
what are you saying sorry for now

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.160
i mean what are you typically

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.000
apologizing for

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.879
usually it's a joke

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.239
i mean

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.480
i it was like i wanted a conceit of the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.840
show it's called can't get right and i

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.120
don't like

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.200
the idea being like people say never

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.120
apologize i'm like no i apologize ahead

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.160
of time

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.280
and often

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.560
you see uh

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.000
you see uh

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.560
do you see stanhope special

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.239
is it news he just has a new one that

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.120
came out and he opens

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.800
it's it amazon how new is it

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.120
just released it during the quarantine

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.040
oh [ __ ] at least like probably a month

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.920
ago

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.239
oh no way how is it it's great he it's

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.680
great he walks i mean the first thing he

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.480
does is read a statement apologizing

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.959
oh awesome pretty pretty wonderful

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.280
yeah he's got some great [ __ ] hours

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.959
man um

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.040
anyway i got uh yeah this guy i was

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.040
talking to alex boswick

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.480
basically the point we got on the other

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.000
one which i think i'm going to play

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.680
after this one

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.959
is uh

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.080
what's wrong with all these journalists

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.440
now because he gives a lot of inside

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.720
information he's got a channel called

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.000
bostwiki

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.159
and he explains to you how they work

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.680
and it's a bunch of like underpaid

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.159
losers a lot of them and a lot of them

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:19.440
are are the kind of people who could

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.319
afford to be interns for a long time

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.480
yeah these positions through internships

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.720
you've got to be a certain social class

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.120
to be able to not get paid yes and do

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.720
that and it got abused over the years

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.480
right so there's all these people that

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.400
don't get paid very much and they're not

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.840
real journalists like they didn't study

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.599
journalism they studied like some other

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.920
[ __ ] or their failed comics or never

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.080
never tried i guess in the case that i

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.400
said simon

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.000
he's not a failed comic he's never even

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.879
tried it i think he did try it i think

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.080
i don't know i

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.799
never

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.480
stand up but maybe i don't know the

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.319
legend of him is that he did try briefly

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.560
to do stand-up i think

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.480
but there's no way he tried it anywhere

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.439
that would

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.519
be that mean to him that he would be

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:04.959
that against trying to hold down

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.560
community like i don't believe he ever

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.280
got anywhere where he experienced a real

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.959
hard time with the crowd i think he just

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.680
the anticipation of it was like no yeah

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.120
probably i think he got into yeah i

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.040
think he like read he was reading like

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.199
poetry in brooklyn

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:20.160
like fun

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.639
fun poetry why did comedy when i was

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.320
like

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.720
like 19 to 20 before you say i did

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.080
poetry readings because i didn't know

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.680
where to find

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.199
so i would do like

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.880
i mean it was like funny i was trying to

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.600
be funny yeah yeah yeah so and it was

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.880
like i don't remember you remember there

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.600
was this group called king missile

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.479
no in the 90s later in new york the the

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.479
guy's brother ran an open mic and this

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:45.759
guy from king this had a song called

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.360
detachable penis that was pretty funny

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.160
and it

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.120
uh

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.240
it was this guy talking about how he

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.919
woke up and his penis was missing and he

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.240
like his but it was like spoken word but

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.600
they had like kind of music behind it

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.600
was good so i used to go to places and

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.400

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.960
sinister behind his eyes like he's like

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.479

like the rage and anger in that bird

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.479

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.720
yeah except

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.800
because i was talking to bostwick about

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.319
because he's a journalist about the

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:14.080
deleah thing which is creepy to me how

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.080
that work like you see like the new [ __ ]

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.440
came out which

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.199
as i figured he wasn't talking to

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:20.800
[ __ ] they're calling him a pedophile

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.759
he wasn't talking to a girl he was just

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:24.880
talking about people 19 and 20 so what

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.880
people were quick to smash that

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.319
pedophile button on him and uh dude it's

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:32.720
like dude and and yeah and you couldn't

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.280
like of course i made it is it's a it's

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.360
such a crazy accusation that it is kind

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.720
of funny to be like holy [ __ ] that guy

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.800
is [ __ ] but like

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.639
at the core of it you need to remember

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:44.000
like you're literally i mean you're

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.240
you're killing a guy kind of

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.360
before um it's just naming him bottom

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.720
line all these people think it can't

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.400
happen to them where somebody lies about

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.199
you

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:55.039
they all think it can happen to them and

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.360
what people don't get is like and you

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.080
know

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.800
before i ever had a media thing

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.560
i knew that they lied but i didn't

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.199
understand how it works fully

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:08.000
and it's dude it's like

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.440
i wouldn't believe anything about

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.919
anybody from a headline until i

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:13.759
i mean i wouldn't believe anything

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:15.599
without like a tape recording and some

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:17.360
other [ __ ] and then i got to see the

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.440
context it was in yeah because you can't

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.840
trust a single [ __ ]

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.759
especially a story of like so and so

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:25.520
said this or that or

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.280
uh you know

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.960
now that the thing i told that was like

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.280
this goal post move from okay so he's

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.720
not pedophile but he's abusing his power

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.560
by trying to get laid off his dm's like

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.560
shut the [ __ ] up yeah is it

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.520
the point isn't that the point of power

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.599
um yeah sorry

00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:45.440
it's but no that that's crazy because

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.879
that's

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:47.840
you know

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.240
i never [ __ ] uh

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.000
you know dalia got a lot of ass i never

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.479
got it like that like so

00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:55.280
i

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.039
i'm like it's funny because the way i

00:07:57.039 --> 00:07:59.120
would be around checks is timid more

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.160
than

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.879
like i wouldn't be a seth simon like sex

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:03.759
pad

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:05.440
i'm not you're not gonna pass anybody

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.879
but i'm just have such a churchy

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:09.039
background that i'm not like

00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:11.599
aggressive like i just not and i think

00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:13.199
now that's the only way you're allowed

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:14.479
to be

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:16.240
yeah that's for sure the irony is like

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.599
you could only i always thought i was

00:08:17.599 --> 00:08:19.120
like a little bit too timid and it's

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.560
funny that's the only way you're allowed

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.639
to be to get uh

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:24.560
for sure you you

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.160
dude you're not grooming that's what

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.840
there's oh he's grooming his fans that

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.360
have psych like are you [ __ ] kidding

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.440
me

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.279
um but said simon

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:34.800
yeah whatever i'm not gonna

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.399
i don't know

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:39.519
against seth simon as i said simons

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.200
so it was good it was good this is a fun

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.360
day i woke up to this

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.640
uh

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.440
a person of color mind you uh sent me a

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.560
dm

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.399
so that's important this was a this

00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:52.839
snitch was in fact a person of

00:08:52.839 --> 00:08:54.320
color really

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.200
yeah yeah

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.839
girl no no no but it was no it was just

00:08:57.839 --> 00:09:00.080
some black dude sent me a tw tweet some

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.279
maniac sent uh

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:05.120
i guess a girl accused him of being a

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.839
sex pest

00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:08.720
which

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.399
yeah there it is

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:11.839
lots of comedy creeps out there but

00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:13.920
don't forget a very woke comedy blog is

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.600
a full on sex pest to my friend and

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.680
others who corroborated stories and my

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.920
dm's over the years but always doing the

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.000
most to seem like a feminist remarkable

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.160
cognitive dissonance men are meant oh

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.880
wow he's getting a genuine

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.519
yeah that's a genuine canceling from a

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:30.560
[ __ ]

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.480
with the real deal of his own kind of

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.080
people

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.279
yes yes it's sith

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:39.200
look at what she did she put

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.200
she asterisked the

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.120
yeah they do that so you can't find it

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.880
you can't search it

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.760
you can't search your name on twitter

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.760
which is ironic because she's like i'll

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.200
name him

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.399

i've tweeted this several times before

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.120
and hiding names is for losers who want

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.320
to protect bad men happy tuesday

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.880
who is liz r curie do we have any idea

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.720
i think she's gone after you as one

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.760
thing i heard

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.959
for what though i've known i've never

00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:16.720
met her i don't know i just saw i was

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.800
looking at reddit which made me laugh

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.839
um

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:21.839
so you know that's the thing is

00:10:21.839 --> 00:10:23.839
people i never heard of that like um of

00:10:23.839 --> 00:10:24.800
course

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.640
i'm coming for you

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.279
and

00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:30.079
dude i i've never like i never like

00:10:30.079 --> 00:10:32.079
really i never tweeted about seth simons

00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:34.000
or wrote anything about him you got on

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.839
snl dude and that's probably his dream

00:10:35.839 --> 00:10:37.920
job and the bottom line is no i mean

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.839
since since then like i've never i've

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:41.440
never like i haven't had a hard-on for

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.640
this kid like i haven't been trying to

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.120
[ __ ] with this kid at all but when you

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.800
see something like that pop up it's like

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.320
dude i'm obviously gonna

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.279
you know what i mean like i'm not

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:50.959
digging through his past to try to get

00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:53.760
him in trouble it's just oh dude i just

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.360
would not give these the time of day

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.959
typically but when it's this blatantly

00:10:56.959 --> 00:10:59.519
hypocritical you have to point it out

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:01.360
and uh what's funny is let's say he

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.120
didn't do [ __ ] i mean i don't know what

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.720
that means but he didn't do [ __ ] but

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.000
look how quick it turns on you

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
[ __ ] that's it that's it because

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.680
i don't know i'm not a [ __ ] and i

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.680
would never put this accusation out on

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.399
anybody that

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.320
is there a definition who know what what

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.920
the [ __ ] is a sex pest is there any

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.600
definition

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.680
i guess i have an idea from the context

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.360
of it what it is but do do we know what

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.600
that is

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.839
oh yeah cool yeah because i'm curious

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:36.079
like the technical i'm sure it's morphed

00:11:36.079 --> 00:11:38.720
into something

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.200
sexpest i love these [ __ ] xbox is

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.079
just the best like i would i was it was

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:45.760
delighted to see that that was what his

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.600
moniker would be

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.639
uh a person wait it's a person who

00:11:50.639 --> 00:11:53.360
sexually harasses or assaults

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.880
another person

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.680
is

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.120
translation word origin

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.079
from pulling women's thongs it's british

00:12:02.079 --> 00:12:04.160
that's a sex pest is pulling down

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.519
someone's [ __ ]

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:08.160
what bit of a [ __ ] sex person like a

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.639
wedgie have you [ __ ] sex pests give

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:13.440
wedgies to women

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.560
wait this is just like a horny bully

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.399
it's a horny

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:20.720
yeah dude

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.560
um okay wait wait a man who gives women

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.360
unwanted sexual attention okay so

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.360
that's a tough for instance for instance

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.360
pulling women's thongs this is the urban

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.480
dictionary

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.560
staring down their tops or telling them

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.320
lewd jokes

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.320
uh that mike is such a sex pest he was

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.680
over there the other week peeping at the

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.240
neighbors getting changed

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.839
sex past um

00:12:41.839 --> 00:12:44.560
seems to encompass a wide array yeah

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.680
yeah

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.839
my guess is unwanted attention if i had

00:12:47.839 --> 00:12:48.959
to guess

00:12:48.959 --> 00:12:51.440
yeah it sounds like it sounds like he

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.040
was probably and then somebody tried to

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.880
defend him and be like look this guy's

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.639
not the sexual predator you wanted to be

00:12:56.639 --> 00:12:59.519

quarterback at these girls high school

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.680
is what you've seen

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.959
even they weren't even in high school

00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:21.040

goes he's he knew i was a senior okay

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.480
then you find out a little bit later

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.320
she's a senior in college yeah i

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.839
remember that i remember seeing that

00:15:29.839 --> 00:15:32.240
senior college senior in college is like

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.720
you could marry a senior in college

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.519
and people would be like oh nice

00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:39.360
it wouldn't be i don't know i don't know

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.040
dude it sounds yeah that's when people

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.560
do get married tradition like a lot of

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.240
people get married see you coming out of

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.800
college but uh

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.880
that doesn't even sound as bad any of

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.759
the show is like sex pest is like a more

00:15:51.759 --> 00:15:55.600
serious accusation than anything else

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.440
than anything that dalia actually did

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.360
yeah which is kind of

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.839
kind of the overall point of this

00:16:01.839 --> 00:16:03.920
uh not that i expect any of these people

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.240
to see the error in their ways and you

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.320
know even think about this people are

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.839
being they won't think about it for a

00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:12.399
second but it's fun to like any time you

00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:14.560
weaponize these types of allegations

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.399
against the woke crowd

00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:18.639
they're the first ones to claim due

00:16:18.639 --> 00:16:20.639
process they'll instantly

00:16:20.639 --> 00:16:23.279
[ __ ] discredit any accuser you'll do

00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:25.759

00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:27.360
yeah what we saw with tara reid what

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.800
they did

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.560
yeah i mean it's the exact same

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.320

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.600
gonna bet

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.200
now now it could be very well because

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.720
it's such a nebulous thing it could be

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.919
he just like

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.600

it could just be that but

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.760

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.000
drunk and something uh

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.799

podcast somebody will bring him up and

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.600
i'll be like a kid's a [ __ ]

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.520
but i've never been mad at him

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.520
which is weird i've i've got to work on

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.400
that

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.240
it was weird not to be mad at him but i

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.960
just wasn't i never gave a [ __ ]

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.120
it would be like a black hole like uh

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.880
yeah

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.559
somebody like that i mean although this

00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:16.559
is hilarious i love talking about this

00:22:16.559 --> 00:22:18.080
but somebody like that generally this

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.840
this is just so hilarious that i can't

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.760
not talk about it of course i would

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.400
normally be like sex best sex best you

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.880
have to disguise sorry he's just i'm

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.760
like

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.360
way back when when the article came out

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.799
that was like he tried to lump all these

00:22:30.799 --> 00:22:32.559
comics together as like all and it was

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:33.679
like people that don't have any

00:22:33.679 --> 00:22:36.240
political [ __ ] like sebastian manisculco

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.520
he wrote

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.919
but that's a typical alt-right tactic to

00:22:39.919 --> 00:22:42.799
not be political

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.080
it's insane dude i think it's suspicious

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.000
what he doesn't say as much as what he

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.360
does say

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.559
that's the

00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:51.360
so

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.120
he got greedy he tried to cram

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.400
everything and i remember reading the

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.320
article and i was like i was actually

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.600
going to be offended if he didn't name

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.600
me at least because yeah it was like

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.840
everybody i'm like oh man am i even like

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.720
that past day i don't make a [ __ ]

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.600
this

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.120
sex pest list yeah

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.320
but i was on it thank god

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.440
and i'm just not laughing because i'm

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.760
like this dude [ __ ] uh he he took too

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.760
big of a bite basically the gist from

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.919
what i could tell was all these guys are

00:23:19.919 --> 00:23:22.000
making podcasts or whatever it's fine

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.799
just keep away like he was he was saying

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:26.159
it's fine for them to do what they want

00:23:26.159 --> 00:23:28.960
just keep them away from snl and the

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.400
yeah yeah yeah can't we can't be

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.120
mainstream that's a yeah that's a flag

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.960
he planted like the flag of like the

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.520
official big [ __ ] that and he's talking

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.000
about sebastian maniscalco

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.799
who's selling like he's crazy theaters

00:23:42.799 --> 00:23:44.799
don't let him be mainstream dude i

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:46.000
honestly didn't want to listen to him

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.279
talking to gnome because that was going

00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:49.360
to make me annoyed it's hilarious you

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.520
should listen but do you remember what

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.200
what did he uh in particular do you

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.840
remember what just what his gist of his

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.919
uh thing was

00:23:57.919 --> 00:23:59.279
um

00:23:59.279 --> 00:24:01.279
well he wrote an article that just said

00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:02.240
gnome

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.640
is dumb

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.640
he just wrote an article calling gnome

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.400
from the seller an idiot

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.240
and the whole thing was about because he

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.279
listened to gnome's podcast

00:24:13.279 --> 00:24:14.640
that's what he listens to podcasts and

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.000
reports on so he listened to gnome and

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.320
then he i think it was a critique of the

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.440
seller not being diverse enough or

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.799
welcoming to the lgbt seller not being

00:24:24.799 --> 00:24:26.960
diverse or welcoming to lg that is so

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.039
unbelievable it's crazy it's crazy that

00:24:29.039 --> 00:24:30.720
is so unbelievable that they don't

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.240
realize the seller's biggest problem is

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.200
it's too diverse

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.960
well no the problem is uh

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.200
in nyu like that used to be a cool crowd

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.039
the nyu crowd and i imagine now they're

00:24:43.039 --> 00:24:45.840
getting worse but the seller does have

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.360
like a loyal people who've been going

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.000
there for years of comedy fans

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.080
but um

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:52.960
that

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.880
dude that's why like i heard him say

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.080
something like

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.279
about well i'm worried about the

00:24:57.279 --> 00:25:00.320
undiscovered trans comic out there oh

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.880
yeah he was all over that guy braunham

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.880
did the same thing to know he goes it's

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.960
your responsibility to go out and find

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.279
them it is

00:25:09.279 --> 00:25:10.720
no one's supposed to go on a hunt for

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.039
the trans comics of tomorrow they're not

00:25:13.039 --> 00:25:14.240
supposed they don't even have to show up

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.400
like i have to show up and hang out and

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.720
and get passed and they don't we need to

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.200
go out and seek them out [ __ ] it like

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.960
yeah you have to go hang out and sit

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.640
there and it's uncomfortable and you get

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.159
looked at by all the other comics that

00:25:26.159 --> 00:25:27.760
are already passed you feel like a [ __ ]

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.520
you just sit there for

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.960
five months

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.120
well sometimes some people get right

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.480
dude if sure right but the point is

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.159
the nerve

00:25:38.159 --> 00:25:40.880
to act oppressed when you walk and by

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.400
the way i didn't hear trans comics

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.159
saying this again

00:25:44.159 --> 00:25:46.720

compared to him

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.400
compared to a complete angel compared to

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.919

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.200

00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:44.240
uh

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.760
desperately trying to get on any

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.679
festival possible and i was like man i

00:27:47.679 --> 00:27:48.799
hope i can get in this one and then i

00:27:48.799 --> 00:27:50.799
saw that stipulation and i was like

00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:52.159
who the [ __ ]

00:27:52.159 --> 00:27:53.600
what i liked was the debate about that

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.880
where i'm like how the [ __ ] are you

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.960
charging me to play your festival how

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.440
like yeah [ __ ] is gonna pay money

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.919
there's no legitimate festival where you

00:28:01.919 --> 00:28:03.679
pay them to be in the festival that's

00:28:03.679 --> 00:28:04.880
not a thing

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.559
a legitimate festival they have sponsors

00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:08.480
they have other things so that

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.159
you know at the at the very least you

00:28:10.159 --> 00:28:13.200
get a hotel room but they don't pay

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.320
like that's how it's just a scam for

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.720
younger comics that like you know you

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.000
want to get your break or you want to

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.159
get in anything i think i paid for like

00:28:22.159 --> 00:28:24.320
laughing skull or some [ __ ] you pay for

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.520
submissions um and then yeah i could see

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.840
that more than cinder block because

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.120
laughing so

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.720
some people i might want to see have

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.159
come through there i don't know who

00:28:34.159 --> 00:28:36.399
plays cinder block but it's a big parade

00:28:36.399 --> 00:28:37.690
of i don't give a [ __ ]

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:39.600
[Laughter]

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.679
okay i promise it's like i don't care

00:28:41.679 --> 00:28:44.799
about a single name on there i'm michael

00:28:44.799 --> 00:28:48.000
damn let's talk seth let's talk sex pest

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.080
yeah what do you think the past is up to

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.159
he i do know this i know he's in boise

00:28:52.159 --> 00:28:53.360
right now

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.440
yeah he got out of the city i saw that

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.799
he was in boise

00:28:56.799 --> 00:28:58.399
he

00:28:58.399 --> 00:29:00.320
this is very interesting he went dark on

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.600
twitter a day or two ago

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.520
uh roughly two hours after that girl

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.880
exactly accusatory tweet came out oh so

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.279
this this pesting accusation may have

00:29:11.279 --> 00:29:13.679
legs oh my

00:29:13.679 --> 00:29:16.080
normally this kid lives on twitter

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.080
but one pest accusation and he's

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.720
scurried under the fridge

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.799
where he's back

00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:25.279
yeah well he knows to stay offline uh

00:29:25.279 --> 00:29:27.600
part of this is is uh

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.480
uh we call it

00:29:32.159 --> 00:29:35.600
i'm trying to think it's like um

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.480
uh uh uh

00:29:38.559 --> 00:29:39.760
[ __ ] blake i forgot i was going to

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.559
say

00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:41.360
this

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.399
talking to you

00:29:42.399 --> 00:29:44.640
um

00:29:45.039 --> 00:29:46.640
what is he thinking like this is what i

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.720
want to know is when you so vote so

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.399
vocal in that because these people that

00:29:50.399 --> 00:29:53.600
are such vocal proponents of canceling

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.440
yeah when it happens to them like i said

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.279
the best case study which i got to get

00:29:57.279 --> 00:29:58.960
him on i haven't talked about was jamie

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.480
jamie uh killstein wilson was the most

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.000
of someone who i saw to go through the

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.600
process of getting

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.000
turned into that or turning himself and

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
then getting booted out of it

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.520
and um

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.279
he has lots of insights about why

00:30:13.279 --> 00:30:14.960
someone's like that so there's already a

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.960
model for the seth simons

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.520
like something with sesame is profoundly

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.279
[ __ ] wrong

00:30:21.279 --> 00:30:23.360
yeah found the uh

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.960
low self-esteem

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.480
and like i want to get because jamie

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.919
used to say i wanted to get back at

00:30:27.919 --> 00:30:29.600
comedy because i felt like it rejected

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.640
me

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.880
yeah comedy itself

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.320
so the people that are the you have to

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.279
go up to the most are the ones that are

00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:36.640
the most funny and the ones that are

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.080
like not

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.600
it's it's

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.279
kind of close to the people that are

00:30:41.279 --> 00:30:42.960
like um

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.080
you know swearing well i don't curse

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.000
so i'm better you know

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.440
by the way people are just always clean

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.440
and funny i'm i find them present but

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.880
you know that kind of thing of where

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.640
someone's not that good and they're like

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.000
but i make up for it by never swearing

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
yeah i can do corporate gigs it's like

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.640
oh all right well i can do corporations

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.159
i wish i could do corporate so i could

00:31:04.159 --> 00:31:06.000
use that money but yeah

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.159
people like that like and it's

00:31:08.159 --> 00:31:09.360
but they're not

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.559
something like that it's not nearly as

00:31:10.559 --> 00:31:12.640
bad as this which is like i know i could

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.200
be wrong i think guys like the sex pest

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.200
don't think it'll happen to them

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.840
because i don't think they think

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.600
i think he believes it i think he

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.360
believes it i don't think he's got i

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.720
think he's in on this i think he's

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.320
genuinely like a

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.399
you know race theory

00:31:28.399 --> 00:31:31.039
gender studies kid that's like what's

00:31:31.039 --> 00:31:32.960
win what do you think the motivating

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.279
thing is that's behind i bet he

00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:37.679
thinks i think he thinks

00:31:37.679 --> 00:31:39.760
that the people he's criticizing are

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.120
actually bad

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.519
and so his behavior of let's say oh i

00:31:43.519 --> 00:31:45.039
got drunk and talked to some girls at

00:31:45.039 --> 00:31:46.960
the bar they're not going to tweet that

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.120
i was pesting right

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.880
well because he doesn't realize the one

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.399
of the good ones once once they did it

00:31:52.399 --> 00:31:54.399
without having principles like that that

00:31:54.399 --> 00:31:56.159
section of society they don't believe

00:31:56.159 --> 00:31:57.679
they believe in their team winning they

00:31:57.679 --> 00:31:59.919
believe in principles so yeah anything's

00:31:59.919 --> 00:32:01.600
fair game to do to someone if you

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.720
suspect

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.480
that's part of his uncle too he suspects

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.960
that all these people have a right wing

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.039
like big j has is not a conservative

00:32:09.039 --> 00:32:11.279
trust me on that no

00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:12.880
so

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.320
but that's a thing of like we must

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.320
destroy our enemies and and he's part of

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.880
a larger thing right which is like yes

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.640
he's resisting in his own way and i'm

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.720
handling the comedy front

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.720
and now he can work out his grudges that

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.480
he's always had like somebody who gets

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.559
work as a prison guard or

00:32:28.559 --> 00:32:30.080
who's the guy uh

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.080
painting the death of moreau

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.679
in the french revolution yeah yeah yeah

00:32:33.679 --> 00:32:34.960
yeah there's a painting of a guy in a

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.679
bathtub like

00:32:37.679 --> 00:32:40.320
um he's i also hey wait bobby we put

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.320
that painting to death of maro mara it's

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.799
spelled marat

00:32:44.799 --> 00:32:46.240
but let me show you this because this is

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.000
why i imagine with says simons because

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.279
this guy

00:32:49.279 --> 00:32:51.200
moreau was uh

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.760
like i think a sickly looking albino guy

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.279
with a skit he had to be in a bathtub to

00:32:55.279 --> 00:32:56.799
keep his skin moist

00:32:56.799 --> 00:32:58.159
oh nice

00:32:58.159 --> 00:32:59.600
yeah so he had some person he had all

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.960
these afflictions and he would write

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.279
these like screeds of

00:33:03.279 --> 00:33:05.519
uh we need to we need to per yeah oh

00:33:05.519 --> 00:33:08.399
yeah so this guy he was in the tub

00:33:08.399 --> 00:33:10.320
writing a list of people to pert now by

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.519
the way the person that painted this i

00:33:11.519 --> 00:33:14.240
believe was a fan of the guy

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.799
this is like even as easy as lays dying

00:33:16.799 --> 00:33:18.480
he was trying to cancel people still

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.720
like yeah yeah they just get people's

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.159
head cut off

00:33:22.159 --> 00:33:24.240
yeah even as he lay dying he was doing

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.919
his duty so he's in that tub he's all

00:33:25.919 --> 00:33:27.200
wrapped because he has some skin problem

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.720
and the person who killed him was some

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.600
woman

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.200
basically he put out so much [ __ ] to

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.640
like destroy people and have their heads

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.760
cut off

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.120
he's like like it's never enough blood

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.240
for this guy

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.720
and um some woman

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.120
just went and stabbed him and i think he

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.159
was in the tub i think that's what

00:33:42.159 --> 00:33:44.080
they're reenacting it but she stabbed

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.360
him and she did it because she wanted

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.039
this madness to end

00:33:47.039 --> 00:33:49.039
and she thought it would help if the his

00:33:49.039 --> 00:33:50.840
if his [ __ ]

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.559
pests

00:33:52.559 --> 00:33:54.320
yeah and um

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.840
they made him that but they made him

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.360
they idolized it more like he became a

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.279
martyr ah

00:33:59.279 --> 00:34:00.559
but that's because she killed him like

00:34:00.559 --> 00:34:02.159
now if she had if she had decided to

00:34:02.159 --> 00:34:04.080
frame him from me too

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.360
that would have been a more effective

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.079
way but it is you know revolutionary

00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:10.720
fans anyway yeah he's that guy like

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.079
somebody's going to stab him is going to

00:34:12.079 --> 00:34:13.520
be a woman

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.280
because that's who who has to put a stop

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.480
to that guy ultimately there's no what

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.679
can you do

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:19.440
as a man about that guy nothing there's

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.480
no it's going to be women that that

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.839
by the way every time you see these

00:34:23.839 --> 00:34:25.200
things

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.879
uh

00:34:26.879 --> 00:34:28.639
that's what i want to see is the [ __ ]

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:30.560
uh some

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.240
like the female accomplices of all these

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.440
people that do this because they who

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.280
have they always have a network of

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.679
ambitious women helping them always

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:39.119
every single one of them has a network

00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:40.320
of that

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.919
and and like somebody's you know

00:34:41.919 --> 00:34:43.359
somebody's got to hold the bathroom door

00:34:43.359 --> 00:34:44.879
shut for weinstein when he's in there

00:34:44.879 --> 00:34:46.560
with a [ __ ]

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.359
yeah you want to see the pest jizz lane

00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:50.800
yeah

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.079
who was the best co-host

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:58.240
i mean is this now is this

00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.839
would this be considered out of line to

00:34:59.839 --> 00:35:01.280
say about gizlane maxwell she looked

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.119
like she had a nice rack

00:35:03.119 --> 00:35:04.560
considering that's great you're allowed

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.920
to say that

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.240
but is that

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.680
you know is that out of light or the

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.640
fact that she participated in the

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.839
under raping of underage

00:35:14.839 --> 00:35:17.520
girls does that mean talking about iraq

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.040
that's the kind of discussions we need

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.960
to have that the sex past doesn't want

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.839
us to have the sex press would never he

00:35:23.839 --> 00:35:25.200
he doesn't have the strength to get to

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.280
that point where you can openly discuss

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.200
and debate things like that so he's

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.960
single that guy i i don't know why of

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.440
course of course because i might have

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.520
been reading a different seth simons it

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.040
must have been a different set of simon

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.720
because you guys told me yeah

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.480
having a wife and a kid i'm like this

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:45.359
guy no no no no this kid no and he also

00:35:45.359 --> 00:35:47.280
in my theory on why i was trying to

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.200
figure out like how you become what he

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.079
is

00:35:50.079 --> 00:35:52.160
yeah but i guess you know you you get

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.000
into these open mic scenes

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.920
he's all any open mic scene but

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.400
particularly now he's in an alt scene

00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.599
it's very

00:35:59.599 --> 00:36:02.720
it's woke there's cool kids he can't pro

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.560
he's not good

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.000
but it's you know it's a social club so

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.920
you're hanging out and how do you gain

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.760
importance without actually having

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.599
talent you just become like some weird

00:36:11.599 --> 00:36:13.520
political moderator

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.280
and people think this is better than

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.480
having to suck joey diaz's dick

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.119
true real like i'm not talented i want

00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:22.160
to get on

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.839
there's the straightforward blowjoey

00:36:23.839 --> 00:36:26.160
diaz way and then there's the [ __ ] yeah

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.160
who do you respect more

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.320

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.400
the lady who was willing

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.839
yes the lady who was like you know what

00:36:33.839 --> 00:36:35.280
i really want to get on this stage

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.960
tonight

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.960
i'll do it because i care about the art

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:41.680
oh

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.079
it boils my blood your don't protect

00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:45.440
your pet

sex but you know truthfully i did i did

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.119
uh

00:36:49.119 --> 00:36:50.880
feel like i mean it was funny it's fun

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.720
to watch but here's the thing even

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.960
getting involved in this type of thing

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.800
this [ __ ] sex pest

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.960
all this [ __ ] it's just gonna come

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.640
back it'll come back hard somebody will

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.640
i'll get hit with the sex pass charge

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.520
shortly listen it'll all come back

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.280
people [ __ ]

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.359
the point is here's the reason to lay on

00:37:09.359 --> 00:37:12.160
it in this particular case is yeah

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.359
these people got to get through their

00:37:13.359 --> 00:37:15.520
heads that this nonsense can be turned

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.839
on you at any [ __ ] time and also

00:37:17.839 --> 00:37:20.160
a lot of them are [ __ ] guilty besides

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.920
that the people that i think that i

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.320
suspect of doing [ __ ] okay are the

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.800
people that that parrot

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.560
all that like believe her and all that

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.960
[ __ ] yeah they never said believe all

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.880
women it was believe women but just as

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.359
nonsensical like what yeah well i mean

00:37:35.359 --> 00:37:37.200
they and then they yeah they need to

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.280
start believing all the karen's you know

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.800
all the ladies that are calling

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.640
the cops on black women or black people

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.680
at parks

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.599
they start believing those women too

00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:48.400
cognitive dissonance bro

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.400
because i promise you all those cairns

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.160
that everybody hates

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.000
as if as if the karen's of color are

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.119
better than that all these karen's

00:37:57.119 --> 00:37:58.800
they're empowered by feminism to be that

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.359
way i promise you yeah other ones i'm

00:38:01.359 --> 00:38:03.760
calling police they hold very deeply

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.000
feminist [ __ ] beliefs i promise you

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.240
they were told and they're not they're

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.920
and here's why they're not racist

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.520
they're like oh it's a man saying

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.880
something to me

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.400
i i see this all the time with people

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.280
like

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.040
i know a million [ __ ] hipster chicks

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.480
that would get like street harassed by

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.000
black guys and be mad but they wouldn't

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.680
say it was the guy's black

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.599
do you right now for sure for sure men

00:38:23.599 --> 00:38:26.320
are bad so yeah it was during the whole

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.920
uh the whole uh

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.240
[ __ ] cat calling phase

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.320
that's such that was like a crime it was

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.000
everyone was like yeah men are bad it

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:34.960
was like

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.960
are we are we all

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.440
it's such a it's such a local like you

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.480
someone

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.079
it's such a i'm a white girl that just

00:38:42.079 --> 00:38:45.280
moved to new york problem

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.960
because in the suburbs like if there was

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.240
an epidemic of cat calling in the

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.240
suburbs that would be insane

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.000
you know it would be amazing

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.640
it's you need foot traffic for catcalls

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.880
yes it would be amazing that's such a

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.640
new yorky kind of part or a city with a

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.240
lot of foot traffic problem and not a

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:01.680
driving

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.240
rarely a thing of driving cars like nice

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.320
tents you bet yeah but that's a bunch of

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.480
people that are like in the other part

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.079
of this where i'm talking to uh this

00:39:10.079 --> 00:39:11.359
this reporter guys like all these

00:39:11.359 --> 00:39:13.280
reporters are like they're they're in

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.480
there 20

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.240
26 to 30.

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.680
so you know the new york times they had

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.760
that revolt where like all the woke

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:22.240
people like demanded did some guy get

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.440
fired for publishing an editorial

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.960
somebody i don't know or somebody said

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:30.079
all lives matter like a magic

00:39:30.079 --> 00:39:31.520
but do you think maybe there's an issue

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.680
with your choice of a title if you keep

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.200
getting into an argument about which

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.400
lives matter this is what i'm gonna say

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.320
totally totally good with the aims of

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:43.040
the police not murdering people yeah

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.720
especially black people that they murder

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.800
extra totally on board

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.480
don't you think maybe you're there's a

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.800
flaw in your slogan if you keep hitting

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.920
this wall

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.440
where people are like why are you

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.920
specifying just like nope it's your it's

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.520
always people's fault it's not your

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.880
shitty marketing

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.119
because people i bet you who say all

00:40:01.119 --> 00:40:03.359
lives matter agree with the cop thing

00:40:03.359 --> 00:40:04.000
and

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.160
marketed to them that way they'd

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.079
probably be on board but it almost was

00:40:08.079 --> 00:40:09.680
on purpose not

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.760
like it was to have a it's like a little

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.599
barrier to you like just so you know if

00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:15.599
you're coming in you're coming in

00:40:15.599 --> 00:40:17.680
like ducking under this [ __ ] thing

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.920
yeah yeah yeah so show it's like a first

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.599
act of obedience to before you're

00:40:21.599 --> 00:40:23.040
allowed to be that's what's built into

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.240
it that's what some people have a

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.640
problem with i think yeah i think so and

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:29.280
i think i mean also if you look at who's

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.640
i don't know i don't i don't know enough

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.319
to even really talk too much [ __ ] on

00:40:32.319 --> 00:40:33.520
this but like

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.200
i think the people behind a lot of it

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.520
are it's like a lot of like

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.359
like the people hijacking black lives

00:40:39.359 --> 00:40:42.000
matter and using it for just like it

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.400
seems to me like a communist agenda

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.839
this weird like

00:40:45.839 --> 00:40:47.520
we're setting up these autonomous zones

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.440
it's just like white kids like

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.599
i don't know i don't know [ __ ] listen

00:40:51.599 --> 00:40:52.480
here

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.560
i mean that's just how history works is

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.640
um this is the issue with there's always

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:57.920
talking about the activist journalist

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.000
[ __ ] because simon thinks that he's

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.200
doing good

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.119
yeah i know he does i believe he thinks

00:41:03.119 --> 00:41:05.920
he's good because what is by the way

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.160
that's what being like pc is about it's

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.160
about not being honest

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.119
okay

00:41:11.119 --> 00:41:13.040
so it's about ignoring a thing in front

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.079
of you

00:41:14.079 --> 00:41:15.440
maybe you could be wrong with somebody

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:17.520
just ignoring it because that makes you

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.599
bad to just see a thing in front of your

00:41:19.599 --> 00:41:20.800
[ __ ] face

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.319
that's how you learn to lie to yourself

00:41:22.319 --> 00:41:25.200
i've been through this in a goddamn

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:28.000
[ __ ] doomsday cult i already know the

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.040
thing so

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.480
it's not a thing of being smart it's

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.400
just i've encountered the way this works

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.720
before where someone's a zealot and they

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.599
think that you know i have the the truth

00:41:37.599 --> 00:41:39.520
and you don't

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.599
and and it's not it is it is yeah it's

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:43.440
very religious the whole thing right now

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.680
it's it's very

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.640
religious

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.560
i would say i just had uh jimmy dore on

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.880
this show who's like pretty lefty

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.240
but

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.160
there's a thing the the shittiest thing

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.240
like what seth's a part of beyond when

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.920
he's like capitalist system he's trying

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.040
to get by as a capitalist shitslinger

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.560
for in a clickbait thing that's what

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.079
he's trying to make a living as and it

00:42:04.079 --> 00:42:05.280
makes they don't get paid a lot it makes

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.280
them mad and these are all the sons and

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.440
daughters of upper class people

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.440
that came out and with so what they

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.440
learned in liberal arts college now

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:14.960
they've been only all the [ __ ] we used

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.720
to laugh about like those stupid college

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.400
kids and their [ __ ] parents were like

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.720
we were radical too at that age and we

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.640
became yeah yeah where you became they

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.800
were a liberal fighter

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.119
yeah yeah we're cool we liked obama and

00:42:27.119 --> 00:42:28.800
whatever the kids are just angry because

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:31.280
the world they're fighting a good fight

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.960
they don't understand how much they're

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.599
hated by

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.720
of lefties and then people that are like

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.160
honestly i don't even give a [ __ ] if

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.640
you're you could be a communist honestly

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.240
as long as you have a principle i'll

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.760
i'll hear you out and i'll you know what

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:49.680
i mean like i i can't [ __ ] stand

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.400
the team this is like a team tactic and

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.079
i can't stand tactics

00:42:54.079 --> 00:42:55.200
because

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.640
certain parts of your life are not

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.359
supposed to be you're you're in the war

00:42:59.359 --> 00:43:00.720
of werewolves and vampires all the

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.400
goddamn time you have to be running yeah

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.520
yeah yeah

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:04.800
um

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.319
you know i said to the other guy too

00:43:06.319 --> 00:43:07.760
it's like it's not i don't like politics

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:10.160
and stuff i don't want the war part like

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.720
and like the war is the issue politics

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:15.680
is is a discussion that's fine yeah this

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:18.319
is to end discussions it's not politics

00:43:18.319 --> 00:43:20.160
so so

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:22.560
it's just [ __ ] uh

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.160
there's a mindset and it's in people

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.520
call themselves socialists a lot

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.200
especially young ones

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.839
and especially brooklyn area

00:43:29.839 --> 00:43:31.200
kind of people where they're like yeah

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.960
no you just bulldoze your way through

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.720
because that's it's sons and daughters

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.319
of people with money

00:43:36.319 --> 00:43:38.400
for the most part they always end up

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.480
being like like loaded and also the

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.359
entire

00:43:41.359 --> 00:43:42.800
if you read the psychology of like

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.000
cancel [ __ ]

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.079
the people that do it they tend to have

00:43:46.079 --> 00:43:47.520
come from

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:50.160
uh families with status social status

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.200
and wealth

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.200
overwhelmingly the people who think it's

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.400
good come from those

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.560
and they see it as a means of attaining

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:58.400
more social status

00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.839
they're already keyed into things as

00:43:59.839 --> 00:44:02.319
social status so seth simons for example

00:44:02.319 --> 00:44:04.480
with his snl thing

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:09.119
snl is my the status of snl that's

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.920
is america going to apologize to shane

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.839
[Laughter]

00:44:19.839 --> 00:44:22.880
yeah man i was i was a little quiet on

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.839
that one

00:44:23.839 --> 00:44:25.440
because i was just looking around like

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.200
people were like getting mad at asians

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.720
and i was just sitting there like yo i

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.480
was kidding yeah

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.040
well the thing was so obviously not that

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:35.040
is so obviously yeah

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.119
of out of monty python

00:44:37.119 --> 00:44:39.440
you know like he said jehovah stone it's

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.839
just like it's that yeah um

00:44:41.839 --> 00:44:42.640
but

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.319
like this kid seth this is a social

00:44:44.319 --> 00:44:46.400
status like him

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.240
he gets whatever piddly money he gets if

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.680
he gets a lot of traffic so he probably

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.280
did very well with the [ __ ] with you

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.640
that probably probably he probably made

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.800
some money i bet but still how much do

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:55.920
you think he made

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.400
not enough that's mostly

00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:59.920
a thousand dollars money's not as

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.839
important to them the people like that

00:45:01.839 --> 00:45:02.960
yeah because they're like forever

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.480
interns and they're that's why like

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.160
improv always had that

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.839
ridiculous fee

00:45:07.839 --> 00:45:10.079
and [ __ ] you know it was just ripping

00:45:10.079 --> 00:45:12.160
off dork's parents

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.359
yeah so

00:45:13.359 --> 00:45:16.800
that's why [ __ ] yeah right rip it off

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.960
that's what improv is dude

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.040
[ __ ] sex pest dude i've never looked

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.560
at twitter like this i'm so happy to

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.000

00:45:27.119 --> 00:45:28.960
everybody getting on calling him a sex

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.720
pest

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.800
it's good because like

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.400
what's that

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:36.400
i was gonna say he's been uh deleting

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.200
tweets as well they caught him

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.319
yeah

00:45:40.319 --> 00:45:41.359
exactly

00:45:41.359 --> 00:45:43.280
is that the craziness

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.800
did you think that would ever be a thing

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:45.920
where everybody's like i've got to

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:47.920
delete my tweets

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:49.599
and it's like a formal you know how

00:45:49.599 --> 00:45:51.119
gross that is that that's why he's

00:45:51.119 --> 00:45:52.960
deleting tweets today

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.960
this sex best

what do you think is

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.240
what do you think let's guess about what

00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:00.240
says simon's deleted tweets where were

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.079
they it was definitely accusatory of

00:46:02.079 --> 00:46:04.240
other people i think one of the tweets i

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.280
saw he used the word sex pest

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:08.240
oh

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.480
it was incredible he's got to know now

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.560
that it's [ __ ] up

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.240
there's no way he can't there's no way

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.400
he knows dude there's no way he knows he

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.760
thinks this is

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.280
he doesn't understand that what he's

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:21.119
done and what he's perpetuated are

00:46:21.119 --> 00:46:23.520
actual our smear campaigns so he just

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.200
only sees that happening to him and he's

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:25.920
like

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.839
they're just doing this because uh they

00:46:27.839 --> 00:46:29.119
hate me

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:30.880
well he probably thinks it's a not out

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.800
of like hey look at your dumb [ __ ]

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.400
hypocrisy dude

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.319
well if it's not coming from like mike

00:46:36.319 --> 00:46:38.160
cernovich or something you know it's

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.560
coming from some girl who clearly

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:43.440
is deep in the [ __ ] in that it's

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.200
impossible to live in their world the

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.680
world that he wants to

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.839
raise his social status in

00:46:49.839 --> 00:46:51.119
it's like

00:46:51.119 --> 00:46:52.720
why would you ever try to become the top

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:54.079
of the heap of that

00:46:54.079 --> 00:46:56.160
no wouldn't you just like get good at

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.920
comedy or something

00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:59.520
wouldn't you rather just like bomb a

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:02.000
little bit and then get better but then

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
to have this like life of being kind of

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
i think i think to be in their world to

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.520
be the best you have to be like a you

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.680
could be like a flamboyantly gay man or

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.839
like

00:47:11.839 --> 00:47:13.920
you lose that status listen if you're

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.400
not on board with everything gay being a

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.960
gay man that's still cis yeah yeah yeah

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.040
no i'm i'm still you'll lose your skate

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.200
like that's that's done yeah true

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.520
that dude the the thing of tramping down

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:27.839
on people's stupid [ __ ] privilege

00:47:27.839 --> 00:47:29.680
gay guys are getting it they're getting

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.599
that because they're not trans like the

00:47:31.599 --> 00:47:33.520
shine of being gay back when it was cool

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.400
madonna's friend

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:38.960
now it's like you got a [ __ ]

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:41.359
there's no unique identity anymore and

00:47:41.359 --> 00:47:42.400
really

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.760
uh uh

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:44.480
it's

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.160
that's the that's the irony of is like

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:46.880
there's

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:48.400
there's so many like people who've been

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.880
sent to kramer island in their world

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:52.480
it's multicultural there's a

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.880
multicultural group of people

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:55.680
yeah

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:59.119
labeled white supremacists by people

00:47:59.119 --> 00:48:00.559
i still think

00:48:00.559 --> 00:48:02.960
that's what hurt me exactly

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.920
yeah yeah i fit the bill i fit the bill

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.920
though that hurts of looking exactly

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.480
like one of these white supremacists

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:11.520
um

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.200
so when they get there because you got a

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.280
small mouth dude the problem is yeah i

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:17.280
do i got a small mouth i got it got a

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.559
small

00:48:18.559 --> 00:48:20.880
mouth

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:23.680
[Laughter]

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.119
you think you [ __ ] think you didn't

00:48:25.119 --> 00:48:26.559
get something because a black guy took

00:48:26.559 --> 00:48:28.160
it from you

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:30.480
which which early in comedy i did think

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:31.839
that i've never seen someone more

00:48:31.839 --> 00:48:36.160
profiled racially in my life and shame

00:48:37.119 --> 00:48:39.359
he's like just look at this cracker he

00:48:39.359 --> 00:48:42.720
said something in his past

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:45.839
sex best son i'm gonna look [ __ ] past

00:48:45.839 --> 00:48:48.400
suit dude yeah i wonder if he will get

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.839
in he probably has to shut up right now

00:48:49.839 --> 00:48:51.599
that's the other reason i'm even openly

00:48:51.599 --> 00:48:53.200
talking about it because i'm like does

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.839
he have time to obsessively search about

00:48:55.839 --> 00:48:59.280
what i'm saying about sex past simon

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.599
yeah but who cares there's nothing he

00:49:01.599 --> 00:49:04.319
now hopefully dude if that dude

00:49:04.319 --> 00:49:05.680
listen if he

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.599
like because i talked to jamie when

00:49:07.599 --> 00:49:09.920
jamie got and jamie got

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:13.200
run out of his own little click appeal

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.880
under the most preposterous and like

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.640
when he was explaining to me he got hit

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.640
with the past charge too so jamie's like

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.040
an ex-scientology person

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.480
he comes off like a person from

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:25.520
scientology like like the [ __ ] that

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:28.240
he went that he also had to be in denial

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.480
about all the time

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:32.079
like he's reached out to me a couple

00:49:32.079 --> 00:49:33.520
times yeah

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:34.800
he's a good story

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.240
well it's just

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.960
i know a very long time but it's just so

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.960
interesting to have somebody who's at

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:44.240
the other side that explain the mindset

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:47.200
and it's somebody low self-esteem always

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.960
and they're they're like mad and they

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.640
want like revenge

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:52.559
on whatever it is they felt rejected

00:49:52.559 --> 00:49:54.480
from and so it's almost like being a

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.880
when they call them in-cells

00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:00.000
like this dude's like in cell but of

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000
like you know saturday i mean

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.839
i do believe he actually is also an

00:50:03.839 --> 00:50:06.160
incel so really you don't think he has

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.280
any uh

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:09.359
i don't i think he's very short as well

00:50:09.359 --> 00:50:10.880
i think he's like a little tiny like

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:12.640
little uh

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:14.880
little vicious little [ __ ]

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.319
i would love to know what he said that

00:50:16.319 --> 00:50:18.640
was sex best i'm so curious to know i

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:19.680
know

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.520
it's just he goes so hard trying to get

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.280
people that i assume the worst because

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.839
somebody like that is like the devil you

00:50:25.839 --> 00:50:27.599
know the devil and daniel what daniel

00:50:27.599 --> 00:50:29.280
webster

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.800
and the problem is

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:31.680
yeah

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:33.440
no matter what he said it's gonna be

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.440
hilarious like if if he was

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:38.000
because of how righteous he he acts how

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.400
how the level the standard he's set for

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.079
everybody else

00:50:42.079 --> 00:50:43.760
for him to even just being a girl that

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.520
come on baby that's like the way he

00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:47.680

brooklyn that's uh it's pretty great to

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:57.839
watch and also he's the type of guy

00:50:57.839 --> 00:50:59.119

i just if you just search seth simons

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:12.640

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.720
classics i feel like so we'll just watch

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.960

00:52:00.319 --> 00:52:01.599
dude he

00:52:01.599 --> 00:52:03.280
he comes off like dennis reynolds from

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:06.480
always sunny in philadelphia

00:52:06.559 --> 00:52:08.720
it comes like like the how they make

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:09.839
dennis

00:52:09.839 --> 00:52:11.520
yeah that's what that's what he comes

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.119
off like in those

00:52:13.119 --> 00:52:15.200
that's definitely how he was stiff and

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:19.200
like oh i like and so like

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:21.359
he just looks mad like

00:52:21.359 --> 00:52:22.720
like like

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:25.119
that guy like can't have his dignity

00:52:25.119 --> 00:52:26.240
[ __ ] with

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.839
which is why he's not cut out for comedy

00:52:27.839 --> 00:52:29.359
anybody you sometimes you'll see like

00:52:29.359 --> 00:52:30.800
really big dudes that are like kind of

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:31.839
tough and they're not good at comedy

00:52:31.839 --> 00:52:33.119
because they can't

00:52:33.119 --> 00:52:35.359
be like the clown vulnerable yeah yeah

00:52:35.359 --> 00:52:36.240
yeah

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.200
of course

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.880
but that also there's like people that

00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:40.319
are like pencil neck geeks that are the

00:52:40.319 --> 00:52:42.319
same creature

00:52:42.319 --> 00:52:43.839
basically like how cops you know they

00:52:43.839 --> 00:52:46.720
say cops are like always people that

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.400
were like bullies or they were bullied

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.520
in high school

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:50.240
yeah

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:51.839
i mean can that just be everybody it

00:52:51.839 --> 00:52:53.920
kind of encompasses most companies like

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.440
so they're just people is what you think

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:56.480
but yeah

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.160
that's what it is like that guy's gotta

00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:01.839
got the [ __ ] like you will pay

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.200
the unfairness

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.280
if the unfairness in this world

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.559
like

00:53:06.559 --> 00:53:09.040
to even worry about you getting

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.880
like that that he heard you were getting

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.359
an snl and he was like who is this that

00:53:13.359 --> 00:53:15.839
just didn't get run by so it's like dude

00:53:15.839 --> 00:53:18.240
i'm in comedy do you think i'm like a

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:20.720
[ __ ] i'm i'm under

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:24.000
40 and in comedy do you really think and

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.280
i live in new york city do you really

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.720
think i'm like an outward white

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:28.240
supremacist

00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:29.280
that was

00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:30.400
listening

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.319
it's not your intent intent doesn't

00:53:32.319 --> 00:53:34.720
matter your impact no of course but

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:37.200
exactly it's impact it's insane

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.280
it's not the intent that you had in

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:40.640
whatever you said

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:43.119
it's the impact i choose to make of it

00:53:43.119 --> 00:53:45.200
it's the impact that nobody would have

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.200
ever seen no asian kid would have ever

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:48.800
seen that headline

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:51.040
yeah whatever the most heroic part that

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:52.720
and and this is why i agree with seth is

00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:54.000
he doesn't get enough credit for being

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.559
the hero that spread it around so that

00:53:56.559 --> 00:53:58.559
everyone could hear

00:53:58.559 --> 00:54:01.119
no one was gonna see that notifies all

00:54:01.119 --> 00:54:02.880
the asians about did you hear what this

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.960
guy you never heard of said oh he's

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:08.480
gonna be on snl and he once used

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.720
i if somebody told me they've never used

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.480
now look if somebody goes i've never

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.240
called somebody a racial slur i believe

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.079
you a lot of people are nice and would

00:54:16.079 --> 00:54:17.440
never have done that somebody goes i've

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:20.000
never said a racial slur just

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.240
i don't believe you you're wrong

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:22.960
so

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:25.119
it's pretty shitty to pretend context

00:54:25.119 --> 00:54:26.720
isn't a thing

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:29.040
because it serves you but that this is a

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.960
new industry of

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.119
creating these problems and then now

00:54:33.119 --> 00:54:35.040
there's a new consulting industry to

00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:36.799
help you navigate

00:54:36.799 --> 00:54:38.319
yeah you know the only reason i made

00:54:38.319 --> 00:54:39.920
this thing can't get right the title was

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:41.839
like i'm not i don't have anyone i'm

00:54:41.839 --> 00:54:43.040
just it's going to be wrong up front

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:45.520
like just so you know this one yes

00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:48.000
i'm not

00:54:48.079 --> 00:54:49.599
it's not going to be good it's not going

00:54:49.599 --> 00:54:50.960
to be correct

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.480
yeah and so

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.680
i'm trying to do my best but i'm not a

00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:57.680
there's not a thing that that where i

00:54:57.680 --> 00:54:59.920
can guarantee you i won't say the wrong

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.319
thing ever i probably will i don't know

00:55:02.319 --> 00:55:03.920
why anybody would pretend that that's

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:05.599
possible

00:55:05.599 --> 00:55:07.200
and also if you are a person like that i

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.880
would never want to know you like if

00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:10.880
you're like i have never used any bad

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:12.480
language like that or any like i don't

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.000

saying some other thing that's like more

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:40.559
innocuous by the standards of

00:55:40.559 --> 00:55:42.400
today's language but it's the same

00:57:19.359 --> 00:57:20.720
you know if you're a guy who's 20

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:22.640
[ __ ] everybody nobody's like really

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:25.760
that mad or 30 but when you're doing it

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:28.240
you're considered like bad

00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:30.240
yeah people really hate that especially

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.839
especially even if you didn't like

00:57:31.839 --> 00:57:34.720
leonardo dicaprio just for example

00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.960
i think he only [ __ ] chicks under 25 by

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.400
the way

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.880
yeah and he's like too big it's not like

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:42.720
a crime or something but like you see

00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:44.720
the people like demanding just

00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:46.480
essentially like you need to marry one

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.400
of them or stop like why would he yeah

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:49.839
yeah yeah

00:57:49.839 --> 00:57:52.400
a graph was going around about his age

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:55.200
going up and his girlfriend's ages

00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:57.760
like in sections corresponding and they

00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:00.160
always stopped at 25. and people were

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.920
spreading that around and were like look

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.400
at this piece of [ __ ] it's like

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:06.559
what why like i don't even understand

00:58:06.559 --> 00:58:08.480
what people i assume somebody would get

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.400
mad she would get mad when she saw like

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.000
aviators not allowed to [ __ ] young

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.200
chicks is that what we're doing here

00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:14.319
because if that's the case i don't want

00:58:14.319 --> 00:58:16.240
to live here well

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:18.559
do the do those girls get to say what

00:58:18.559 --> 00:58:20.480
they want to do i understand like the

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:22.559
girls can't think girls are helpless

00:58:22.559 --> 00:58:24.559
retards and that's a society i mean

00:58:24.559 --> 00:58:26.400
everybody in society has agreed on that

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.559
let's say women since it's an adult age

00:58:28.559 --> 00:58:30.400
of 25 like

00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:31.760
by the way it does seem like a kid to me

00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:34.000
talk to a 25 year old 100 percent they

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.799
seem yeah uh

00:58:36.799 --> 00:58:39.359
however like it's you're a woman so like

00:58:39.359 --> 00:58:40.799
you don't you're not allowed to decide

00:58:40.799 --> 00:58:43.170
again who are you [ __ ] that's better

00:58:43.170 --> 00:58:44.240

00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:52.720
yeah

00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:53.520
but

00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:55.040
if it was legal it's none of my business

00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:56.400
if she's allowed to decide she wants to

00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:58.000
do that by law what i don't give a

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.240
[ __ ] [ __ ] who is she gonna [ __ ]

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:02.640
better than james franco just like what

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.160
here's the other thing

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.480
you can you could go and [ __ ] with a

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.640
permission slip marry your [ __ ] 14

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.640
year old daughter to somebody in new

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.280
york or and all over america

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.520
yeah or maybe 50 i'm sorry 15 in new

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.200
york a lot of places yeah it's it's a

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.839
lot of places very young very very 12

01:00:19.839 --> 01:00:20.960
oddly young

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.799
and they have and it's totally legal as

01:00:22.799 --> 01:00:24.400
long as a parent now new york it would

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.960
be a parent and then uh

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.799
they have to go to a

01:00:28.799 --> 01:00:30.160
judge or something there's like another

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.839
person that has to approve a judge has

01:00:31.839 --> 01:00:33.680
to talk to the parents there's a process

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:36.160
that has to be done but it can be done

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.599
okay so that means there's a

01:00:37.599 --> 01:00:38.799
circumstance they're like oh it's

01:00:38.799 --> 01:00:40.799
totally fine and that's marriage that's

01:00:40.799 --> 01:00:42.559
do you think like this rich girl that

01:00:42.559 --> 01:00:43.920
[ __ ] james franco one time when she's

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:46.000
17 do you think her life

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.839
has worse or better stories than the

01:00:47.839 --> 01:00:49.280
girl whose parents said you can get

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.960
married at 15

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:54.079
to the head of the church

01:00:54.079 --> 01:00:54.960
yeah

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:56.960
the real answer that is the girl the

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.359
girl who was the child bride definitely

01:00:59.359 --> 01:01:02.960
has better stories to listen to

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.359
who's happier

01:01:05.359 --> 01:01:06.880
is that what you're going for because

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.079
the child

01:01:08.079 --> 01:01:11.040
calls yourself stories to

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:25.359
life that's another saying

01:01:25.359 --> 01:01:26.960
the child bride probably had a worse

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.000
time

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
oh brian probably

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.079
yeah i've talked to people that are like

01:01:32.079 --> 01:01:33.839
cults that ring [ __ ] like that and it's

01:01:33.839 --> 01:01:35.280
crazy they should happen some but i'm

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.599
just saying

01:01:37.599 --> 01:01:38.960
that's even a bad way to put it who had

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:41.520
a better life it's just that of course i

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.799
hear you i hear you definitely

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:44.319
definitely the girl who [ __ ] james

01:01:44.319 --> 01:01:45.760
franco

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.960
um

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.640
because she'll never reach that high

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:51.640
again

01:01:52.799 --> 01:01:54.799
she will never swear that high again is

01:01:54.799 --> 01:01:57.760
[ __ ] james frank

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.200
here's why i bring it up i've always

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.039
wanted to [ __ ] james right now james

01:02:01.039 --> 01:02:02.880
franco is a handsome guy now the fact

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.039
that he [ __ ] a 17 year old and

01:02:05.039 --> 01:02:07.599
dalia's getting crucified is uh is funny

01:02:07.599 --> 01:02:09.039
to me

01:02:09.039 --> 01:02:12.240
well because dalia has messages

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.640
i don't know who's dms to anyone

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.720
that's why i would hesitate to send like

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.559
sexual things

01:15:20.719 --> 01:15:22.239
idea of asians

01:15:22.239 --> 01:15:24.719
being black people is so out of line

01:15:24.719 --> 01:15:26.239
it's it's ridiculous

01:15:26.239 --> 01:15:29.440
like in america you're white you've been

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.560
like

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.920
shut the [ __ ] up they don't they have to

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:34.000
like tamp down the numbers at harvard to

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.400
let other yes like to let black people

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.480
in they can't even let white people in

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:41.360
the levers of power anyway

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.120
i never was like i never looked at it

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:44.880
like why do asians get everybody's like

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.960
oh they study a lot this is what when i

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.480
grew up they got picked on here's what

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:50.480
most of them complained about

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:52.320
thing dude a lot of them got picked on

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:55.040
in school for being asian

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.800
yeah which i mean i don't remember that

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.400
at my school but i'm sure it happens and

01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:59.600
also

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.600
i would say the damaging

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.199
and is this is uh where i say is

01:16:03.199 --> 01:16:04.960
straight up racism is uh the penis

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:07.360
racism against asians

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:09.520
i would say the biggest burden of

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:11.920
if you're abc american born chinese as

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:12.960
they say

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.719
is dealing with

01:16:14.719 --> 01:16:17.120
asian dick rumors

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.640
the one that would be like

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.640
that'd be a tough one but look i'm as an

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:23.920
irish guy we i get that i get that often

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:25.600
i know irish people get that i know

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:26.640
asians

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:28.000
it's almost the first thing out of your

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.679
mouth when you say built a small dick

01:16:29.679 --> 01:16:31.679
coalition that could be really good

01:16:31.679 --> 01:16:34.239
asian and irish yeah well we did and the

01:16:34.239 --> 01:16:35.760
railroads came out of it that's what

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:38.800

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.960

you go to bars and drink and that's your

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:07.679

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:52.159
they take it pretty seriously

01:20:52.159 --> 01:20:53.280
um

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:55.280

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:10.880
to live

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.320
you might as well get it

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.800
if you're gonna get it and um

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.960
there's a uh

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:19.199
i i didn't you know when the there was a

01:21:19.199 --> 01:21:21.360
big march like uh uh

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.199
you know a couple weeks ago was like 50

01:21:23.199 --> 01:21:25.040
000 people through downtown i saw

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.239
pictures of it i didn't see it on the

01:21:26.239 --> 01:21:28.719
news i saw like pictures people tweeted

01:21:28.719 --> 01:21:31.360
right and uh so by my place

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.760
people came down hollywood boulevard

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.199
but it's a long boulevard there's a lot

01:21:35.199 --> 01:21:38.320
of so it wasn't by me so much

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:39.280
um

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:41.199
but like somebody stole our

01:21:41.199 --> 01:21:43.440
packages in like mail

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.400
like

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.080
so either someone did it like in the

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:48.320
building or someone randomly was like

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:49.520
i'm gonna do this right now while

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:51.280
there's this march like if you like

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.360
somebody peeled off i don't know it's

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.600
hard to know the scenario i only lost a

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:57.440
green screen so

01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:59.600
it wasn't

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:02.000
a green screen out of the box

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.840
and uh my mail didn't get stolen a bunch

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:05.840
of people had like their [ __ ] jimmy to

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.199
open

01:22:07.199 --> 01:22:08.400
damn

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:09.840
but that was it i mean i was at my

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:11.440
brother and then i wasn't i'm afraid of

01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:13.199
covid like i didn't know

01:22:13.199 --> 01:22:14.800
i saw a friend of mine posted a friend

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:16.480
of mine's mom passed away and she was

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:17.920
tweeting about it and she was like my

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:19.920
mom has coveted all you people that went

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.440
to the beach [ __ ] you or something i'm

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:22.480
like

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:23.520
i know she ain't mentioning the

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:24.880
protesters

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:26.000
right right

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.360
i bet that passed

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:29.199
about it

01:22:29.199 --> 01:22:30.719
the beach probably was better because of

01:22:30.719 --> 01:22:32.159
like sun and [ __ ]

01:22:32.159 --> 01:22:34.560
but um yeah yeah do you know now because

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:35.520
you're

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:37.280
where are you working at what who are

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:40.320
you uh reporting for yahoo yahoo yahoo

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:41.679
news verizon

01:22:41.679 --> 01:22:43.840
oh no [ __ ] and is uh oh that's right

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:45.360
verizon you told me last time how does

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.719
that work i meant to ask because i

01:22:46.719 --> 01:22:48.560
didn't really understand so do you write

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.960
a thing and it gets bought by another

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:52.880
outlet so

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.719
what happens

01:22:54.719 --> 01:22:56.320
right now is because verizon is kind of

01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.520
the corporate parent and they control

01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:59.440
like hubbard and post yahoo

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:00.800
a bunch of them

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:01.600
so

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:03.280
on the back end i'd be a verizon

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.560
employee and then they would distribute

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:06.159
it based on the kind of content that

01:23:06.159 --> 01:23:08.320
it's

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:11.280
wherever

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.760
correct

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:17.360
oh wow that's mainly video these days

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:18.880
but it depends

01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:21.520
so verizon and yahoo own which ones

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:24.239
verizon verizon

01:23:24.239 --> 01:23:27.040
huffington post and get auto blog a

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:30.000
whole bunch of us ancillary aol they own

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.440
and like and a bunch of like facebook

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.679
pages that are secretly controlled by

01:23:33.679 --> 01:23:35.520
secret by aol like in the know like

01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:37.199
these big facebook pages that are

01:23:37.199 --> 01:23:38.400
actually

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.320
owned by like what like what's a big

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.679
facebook page i will be i haven't gone

01:23:41.679 --> 01:23:43.840
on facebook in quite some time

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.360
it's not yeah it's not it's not worth

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:47.280
going on in the know it's probably the

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:48.560
biggest one that's very large on

01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:50.880
facebook that's actually owned by aol

01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:52.960

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:57.040
of those kind of 60 second video clips

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:58.800
for the time that gets

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.320
shared often

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:03.440
for the readers digest format has like

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:05.360
been very popular through the years like

a a little bit of a lot of stuff

01:24:07.199 --> 01:24:08.639
aggregated

01:24:08.639 --> 01:24:10.000
yeah i guess instagram was like that

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.199
right they were just taking a bunch of

01:24:11.199 --> 01:24:13.280
[ __ ] they found

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:15.520
at least yeah i mean the readers digest

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:17.760

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:50.000
still remember what a

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
[ __ ] twerpy looked like to it this

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.560
boston he had like a scarf

01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:55.920
and uh

01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:57.520
just thinking about like oh my god like

01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:59.440
what a complete [ __ ] i i had no idea

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:00.800
he would form

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:03.440
the biggest listicle and

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:05.920
trump tea party news site uh

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:08.000
of my lifetime

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.440
um yeah but his fees maybe not even like

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.560
maybe you don't want to say but i'm

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.719
trying like who the who who's like the

01:25:14.719 --> 01:25:16.800
lowering the tone of reporting the most

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:17.920
like

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:19.440
what's ruining it the most right now do

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:22.320
you think cause i i just wan

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.320
i just read uh new york times probably

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:25.600
at the moment i mean they're yeah new

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:27.199
york times

01:25:27.199 --> 01:25:29.440
i i want to ask about that too i i the

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:32.080
thing i just read was a vice article

01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:33.520

don't get me started on yeah joe wait

01:25:40.639 --> 01:25:42.000
who's taylor lorenz maybe i'm thinking

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.080
of a different person

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:46.880
she's she now works with the times as a

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:48.719
tech reporter as well

01:25:48.719 --> 01:25:51.840
right but she she used to write for

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:53.440
oh

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.639
she's

01:25:54.639 --> 01:25:56.880
like all of the new york media you know

01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:58.560
had eight different jobs at different

01:25:58.560 --> 01:25:59.840
outlets i think she was at the daily

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:02.080
piece for a while right

01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.040
anyway

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:05.199
and she uh quit when they ran that

01:26:05.199 --> 01:26:08.639
[ __ ] article about me she uh in fact

01:26:08.639 --> 01:26:10.400
this is wild dude i meant to tell you or

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:12.320
maybe i did text you about it but

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:14.080
whenever they were talking about obama

01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:15.440
gate or whatever thing they're putting

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:17.840
gate in front of the thing about obama

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.760
spying on trump or whatever story that

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:21.920
came out for a second right that trump

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.520
said

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:25.520
yeah and they're like right then and

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:27.520
then it became like no you're just being

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:29.440
uh what do they call it when the police

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:31.199
spy on you they just used a different

01:26:31.199 --> 01:26:34.159
word but he was tapped wiretapped or

01:26:34.159 --> 01:26:35.120
something

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:36.320
yeah no but they don't have to use

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.080
wiretaps they can just listen to

01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:39.679
everybody's phone in the building

01:26:39.679 --> 01:26:41.840
they're misnomers okay wiretapped but

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:42.880
yeah

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:45.520
without any of that but yeah i remember

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:47.360
this vividly like my friend she said the

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.840
news on her old podcast and she was a

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:51.520
reporter for a bunch of [ __ ] she doesn't

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:52.639
have journals anymore i don't think i

01:26:52.639 --> 01:26:54.400
think she's writing for something but

01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:55.520
she uh

01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:57.679
she goes yeah i got invited by obama to

01:26:57.679 --> 01:26:59.360
this thing like this journalist thing to

01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:00.560
meet with obama with a bunch of other

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.639
kind of and we were like oh cool this

01:27:02.639 --> 01:27:06.400
wasn't thinking this is anything weird

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:07.360
when

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.600
right when trump first got him

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.760
okay and um he had a private obama he

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:12.960
just expressed like you know he's

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:14.719
leaving he's concerned he has concerns

01:27:14.719 --> 01:27:16.400
you know for the country something

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.639
something russia i don't know if he said

01:27:18.639 --> 01:27:19.360
like

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:20.560
there's a russian thing i can't really

01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:21.920
tell you about but we're worried about i

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:23.280
just want to like it was just a thing

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:25.280
for him to do that which

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:27.520
i'm like holy [ __ ] he [ __ ] was

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:29.280
setting this [ __ ] up on the way like

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:31.120
it's not a bribery or something it was

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.280
nothing about it was untoward we were

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:35.679
like oh cool right obama meeting

01:27:35.679 --> 01:27:38.000
and then it's not like

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.159
the conspiracy of like hey journalists

01:27:40.159 --> 01:27:41.920
we're going to do this they're just star

01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:44.080
struck it's obama they're all exactly

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:47.040
precisely

01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:48.719
yeah and like oh the guy i like is

01:27:48.719 --> 01:27:50.719
concerned like don't worry obama we

01:27:50.719 --> 01:27:51.920
won't let you down

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.280
it's just like that easy they don't have

01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:55.840
to do bribes and [ __ ]

01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:57.920
like you can just hang out and feel like

01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:00.560
you're cool and that's payment enough

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:03.760
to do any kind of kind of slanted or

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:06.080
you know that russia in particular is

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:08.080
egregious which

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:10.239
i i don't know uh

01:28:10.239 --> 01:28:11.520
there's that new bounty did you see the

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:14.480
thing of the russians

01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:15.840
now what do you think

01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:18.000
how do you find that story to me

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.120
all right here's the two things i've

01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:21.440
heard it's like one down

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.360
well what's it will you say what the

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.679
story is if you know better than me how

01:28:25.679 --> 01:28:27.840
how it

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:29.760
new york times reported

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:30.800
that

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:32.320
they had

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.719
detained for lack of their words

01:28:34.719 --> 01:28:35.760
some

01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:38.480
i guess would you say taliban

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:41.280
paris people working for the taliban

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:43.199
that had large sums of u.s dollars on

01:28:43.199 --> 01:28:45.120
them and when they were questioned they

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:46.719
basically

01:28:46.719 --> 01:28:48.960
pointed back to well the

01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:51.440
middle man kind of drug war the drug

01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:52.960
lord had

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:54.840
through the russians had been paying

01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:58.239
them us dollar bounties to pick off

01:28:58.239 --> 01:28:59.679
coalition forces i don't think it was

01:28:59.679 --> 01:29:01.199
specifically just the u.s soldiers i

01:29:01.199 --> 01:29:02.880
think was british soldiers or any part

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:04.080
that were the kind of

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.840
peacekeeping force that are in

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.679
afghanistan at the moment and then the

01:29:07.679 --> 01:29:09.360
new york times reported that

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.760
trump had received a brief

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:13.199
about it

01:29:13.199 --> 01:29:14.960
that transputes

01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:16.239
i think

01:29:16.239 --> 01:29:17.600
they may get into the semantics of

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:20.000
briefing i think the reporting says that

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.040
he was briefed on paper in february

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.639
right and trump says i was never briefed

01:29:24.639 --> 01:29:26.080
that maybe because he never had any oral

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:27.760
meeting about it

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:29.440
i personally put some

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:30.960
responsibility on the national security

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.560
adviser which is like well if you if you

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:33.520
know your president's not reading the

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:35.120
briefs it's still your responsibility to

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:36.639
inform them of what's going on so pull

01:29:36.639 --> 01:29:38.000
them into a meeting until is that what

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.440
it is

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.280
is an argument over well we put it in

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:42.639
print if you didn't read it is that what

01:29:42.639 --> 01:29:43.679
it that was

01:29:43.679 --> 01:29:46.320
i believe that's what it's come down to

01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:47.520
because i think that i think they have

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:50.159
conclusively shown that it was put in

01:29:50.159 --> 01:29:51.840
print somewhere you know whether it's in

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:54.400
a stack of 50 pages who knows but

01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:56.320
dude if they blow this stitch it's it's

01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:57.920
really something like

01:29:57.920 --> 01:29:59.520
who's i don't know who i had on i can't

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:00.560
remember what guess what they said they

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:02.080
think the election is going to be

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:04.320
trump over biden but it's going to be 14

01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:06.400
to 7 like that's all the people coming

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:07.679
out to vote like

01:30:07.679 --> 01:30:09.040
we're keen

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:12.639
so [ __ ] pathetic this [ __ ] but anyway

01:30:12.639 --> 01:30:13.760
dude why

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.679
i don't know like you know

01:30:15.679 --> 01:30:17.199
i i know i

01:30:17.199 --> 01:30:20.400
what i've heard i was watching uh the

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:22.400
was it not the hill it's like with

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:24.159
crystal ball and that guy sega or

01:30:24.159 --> 01:30:25.600
something the indian guy they i think

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.280
that's the oh yeah they do it

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:28.719
they're for the hill right

01:30:28.719 --> 01:30:30.560
oh yeah i think they're talking about it

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:32.159
being like oh

01:30:32.159 --> 01:30:34.080
wait because it's the anonymous sources

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:36.000
like could this the nsa strongly

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.760
disagrees with the cia's conclusion

01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:39.920
basically is what he said

01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:41.600
okay which is a big deal to me because i

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:44.000
feel like the nsa has you know all the

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.199
watching all of us all the time

01:30:45.199 --> 01:30:47.360
information but right it has to do with

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:49.199
not leaving afghanistan like the afghani

01:30:49.199 --> 01:30:50.560
afghan governments

01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:52.560
it's afghan not afghani right afghan

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:54.800
government is wants us to uh

01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:55.840
not leave

01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:56.960
and we can sit there and fight the

01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:59.600
taliban for them and give them money and

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:00.960
then this is a way but i don't

01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:03.280
understand if that's what it is

01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:05.360
how does that keep us there if russia

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.120
was putting bounties

01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:08.639
like what's the what if what does putin

01:31:08.639 --> 01:31:11.360
get to put bounties on us

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:13.679
my perhaps my perhaps simplistic

01:31:13.679 --> 01:31:15.280
understanding of it

01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:17.040
was

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:19.520
it was just payback for what we did to

01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:21.280
the soviet union in the 80s when they

01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:23.360
were in afghanistan and we armed them

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.280
with bazookas

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:26.800
i mean i don't know

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:28.239
i mean who would have time for that that

01:31:28.239 --> 01:31:30.960
seems like crate like russia is not even

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:32.080
like uh

01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:33.520
i didn't realize how like low on the

01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:35.280
totem pole russia was for the country

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:37.280
their their their gdp is very low

01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:39.120
they're very dependent on oil sales oil

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:40.159
exporting

01:31:40.159 --> 01:31:41.760
yeah so

01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:42.560
um

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:44.480
i don't know if you caught who's the guy

01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:46.639
that spied on the nsa um

01:31:46.639 --> 01:31:49.360
no no snowden when he was rogan had him

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.880
on he interviewed him like via satellite

01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:52.480
i guess right

01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:54.239
that's very interesting

01:31:54.239 --> 01:31:56.719
and he was talking about how putin it

01:31:56.719 --> 01:31:58.880
helps putin immensely all this like oh

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.800
putin like making him into doctor doom

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:01.760
and [ __ ]

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:04.480
because he it it plays big with his

01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:05.440
people

01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:07.600
yeah yeah i imagine i imagine would yeah

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:09.040
you know

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:10.719
so

01:32:10.719 --> 01:32:12.239
i mean do what kind of stuff do you

01:32:12.239 --> 01:32:13.840
cover when you do your when you're

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:15.120
writing for yahoo and stuff is this the

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:16.639
[ __ ] what's your like

01:32:16.639 --> 01:32:18.400
i saw your video about the riots and

01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:19.760
[ __ ]

01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:22.320
yeah i mean it's been all kovitz thrown

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:23.600
everything off since it's all been like

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:25.280
remote working

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:27.679
basically been covered related i mean

01:32:27.679 --> 01:32:29.520
that's that's

01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:31.600
that's the bread and butter from most

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:33.760
news outlets at the moment

01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:35.520
is there anything

01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:37.520
is there anything that you've seen

01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:39.520
i just saw something but i didn't get to

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:42.320
read it about now on cnn about that

01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:44.320
chloroquine like now maybe it is a way

01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:46.080
to treat

01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:47.920
oh i don't know

01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:49.760
there's new studies that it has helped

01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:51.520
and i saw somebody talking about it that

01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:53.199
they were given that at the hospital

01:32:53.199 --> 01:32:54.880
right so i'm like is that a thing where

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:55.920
they didn't want people just getting it

01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:57.440
on their own and giving it to themselves

01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:59.280
and you know what i don't know what's

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:01.280
real like i can't tell

01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:02.639
i don't i don't think most people do i

01:33:02.639 --> 01:33:04.320
think it's i think what it really shows

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:05.600
you is that

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:07.360
people in positions of authorities and

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:09.440
quote unquote experts are equally as

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:11.199
human as the rest of us

01:33:11.199 --> 01:33:13.040
and often are figuring out things on the

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:16.719
fly i mean the hydroxychloroquine

01:33:16.719 --> 01:33:18.960
from my understanding again

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:21.040
prior to kovat 19

01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:22.960
separately it had some indication that

01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:26.080
it did affect viruses in general yeah

01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:28.000
and and so people thought oh this might

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:28.719
be

01:33:28.719 --> 01:33:30.400
some sort of prophylactic a good just

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:33.280
defensive drug to take who knows

01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:35.440
we got nothing else we'll try it

01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:37.199
and then it was inconclusive and then

01:33:37.199 --> 01:33:39.600
some countries like sweden the us tried

01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:42.320
to run some studies and it

01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:44.080
turned out not to work but

01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:45.600
you get into the weeds of like well do

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:47.679
you administer it while they're already

01:33:47.679 --> 01:33:50.159
sick prior to when they're sick my

01:33:50.159 --> 01:33:51.679
understanding

01:33:51.679 --> 01:33:54.159
was that it was not helpful in the end

01:33:54.159 --> 01:33:56.000
that's what i had last time i don't know

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.480
yeah yeah i heard that last then

01:33:58.480 --> 01:33:59.920
i'm talking about how they were treated

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:02.000
at the hospital

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
um it was a mixture of chloroquine and

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.159
something else and then i just now i

01:34:06.159 --> 01:34:07.120
haven't like i said i haven't looked in

01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:08.800
the story but it's a cnn report that

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:10.239
their new study says actually yeah no

01:34:10.239 --> 01:34:11.600
it's probably good

01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:13.679
but like i said i don't have the details

01:34:13.679 --> 01:34:15.600
that's just like the click bait headline

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:17.199
so

01:34:17.199 --> 01:34:18.880
it's a cnn clickbait headline so who

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:21.840
knows what that means

01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:24.080
i i've seen a bunch of [ __ ] that i

01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:25.440
you know i looked at i'm like this was

01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:27.280
not worth the uh

01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:30.239
the price the headline

01:34:30.239 --> 01:34:32.480
the payoff the investment of reading it

01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:33.679
yeah i mean i'm totally willing to

01:34:33.679 --> 01:34:36.639
believe that some people recovered while

01:34:36.639 --> 01:34:38.639
on hydroxychlorquin whether that was

01:34:38.639 --> 01:34:40.880
directly related to the clerquin whether

01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:42.800
it's related to something else that

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:44.880
happened in their treatment i just take

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:48.159
uh you know aquarium cleaner myself but

01:34:48.159 --> 01:34:50.239
right right into the veins yeah yeah i

01:34:50.239 --> 01:34:53.679
just shoot up aquarium scrubber um

01:34:53.679 --> 01:34:55.760
what like how do you like the kind of

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:57.600
stories that you're you have to file i

01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:59.440
know it's like a lot of kovich but is

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:01.040
there anything where you've you've put

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:02.719
it in recently and you're like i can't

01:35:02.719 --> 01:35:03.760
believe they because they put the

01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:04.800
headline right you don't put the

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:06.960
headline do you

01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:09.760
have you see it click bait it up

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:11.600
yeah well it doesn't have to be here it

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.520
could be in your time of doing it yeah

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:15.199
well so

01:35:15.199 --> 01:35:16.960
it's

01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:18.400
i mean there there are incent there are

01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:20.080
personal incentives often as a reporter

01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:22.000
anyway to clickbait it up regardless

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.239
because you want to deliver traffic i

01:35:24.239 --> 01:35:26.320
mean you have metrics yourself that you

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:27.920
wanna at least look good relative to

01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:30.080
your colleagues but yeah i mean even

01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:32.159
outside of there's two ways to skew the

01:35:32.159 --> 01:35:35.119
headline so let's say i file a story

01:35:35.119 --> 01:35:36.880
and i have

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:38.719
hydroxychloroquine

01:35:38.719 --> 01:35:41.040
may show tentative links to positive

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:42.960
outcomes and i could hand it to the

01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:44.400
editor and they could change the

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:45.520
headline

01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:47.600
on the website itself like on the owned

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:49.520
and operate platform but then that will

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:51.280
also go to what's kind of called a

01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:53.679
social media curator social media editor

01:35:53.679 --> 01:35:55.040
which is the person that controls the

01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:57.119
keys to the twitter the instagram the

01:35:57.119 --> 01:35:59.199
facebook for that platform and they too

01:35:59.199 --> 01:36:01.199
can manipulate the headline all over

01:36:01.199 --> 01:36:02.800
again outside of me and outside of the

01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.400
editor right and so they can i think

01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:05.760
people know that dude i don't think they

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:07.600
understand i didn't understand until i

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:09.760
met people that did it the amount of

01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:12.239
manipulations is put through before

01:36:12.239 --> 01:36:13.840
yeah so most things that you see on

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:15.679
twitter like some articles came out and

01:36:15.679 --> 01:36:17.760
that's the headline the the journalist

01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:19.119
the writer did not write that headline

01:36:19.119 --> 01:36:21.119
it was written by the social media

01:36:21.119 --> 01:36:24.239
curator that you never know exists right

01:36:24.239 --> 01:36:27.040
well somebody for [ __ ] vice wrote

01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:29.119
and there's like two stories on this i

01:36:29.119 --> 01:36:30.400
that popped up

01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:31.199
uh

01:36:31.199 --> 01:36:34.239
joe rogan has still not commented on his

01:36:34.239 --> 01:36:36.159
friend crystalia

01:36:36.159 --> 01:36:37.600
like you saw the crystalline as a

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:38.639
pedophile

01:36:38.639 --> 01:36:39.840
this whole episode i used to do mike

01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:41.920
sarnovich on who finds a lot of

01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:43.760
[ __ ] but he's a guy who got smeared it's

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:46.239
crazy how he got smeared but

01:36:46.239 --> 01:36:47.840
with dalia they were calling him a

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:49.440
[ __ ] pedophile

01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:50.159
okay

01:36:50.159 --> 01:36:52.159
they were going after him now evidence

01:36:52.159 --> 01:36:53.920
so then the evidence comes out he wasn't

01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:56.000
he didn't do anything illegal or ask

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.679
kids for their naked whatever the [ __ ]

01:36:57.679 --> 01:36:59.040
you're calling pedophile none of that's

01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:01.280
true no it looked like he wanted from my

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:02.880
understanding that from my evidence to

01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:05.440
gregory looked like he liked

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:07.679
young women but legal young women yeah

01:37:07.679 --> 01:37:11.360
so yeah like who gives a [ __ ] but so

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:13.119
then all of a sudden it became like a

01:37:13.119 --> 01:37:15.360
rock like the goal post changed

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:17.440
it wasn't the pedophile slash weapons of

01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:19.040
mass destruction now

01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:22.080
it's that he used his power

01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:25.440
okay right i swear to god groom to groom

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:27.440
his fans

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:30.159
like which i do people think that's re

01:37:30.159 --> 01:37:32.159
like a thing that's real like

01:37:32.159 --> 01:37:33.840
that's so mind blowing to me and i could

01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:35.360
just be an old man but

01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:37.679
literally from the whole time i've said

01:37:37.679 --> 01:37:39.199
the entire time i was alive that's why

01:37:39.199 --> 01:37:40.880
people were trying to be famous and do

01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:42.880
things was to

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:44.639
leverage their fame

01:37:44.639 --> 01:37:46.080
to get laid

01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:47.600
yes

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:48.719
even if they said it was for other

01:37:48.719 --> 01:37:51.280
reasons it it the initial kicker was

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:53.199
usually that you know eugene simmons of

01:37:53.199 --> 01:37:54.719
kiss

01:37:54.719 --> 01:37:56.960
right yeah i think 5 000.

01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:59.119
so

01:37:59.199 --> 01:38:00.080
like

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:01.520
i don't get that part like how are they

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:03.679
pushing through the

01:38:03.679 --> 01:38:05.280
is that like a rule like if that's a new

01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:07.440
rule like you can't [ __ ]

01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:09.360
you can't get laid off being famous like

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.440
i mean i don't give a [ __ ] it's fine but

01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:13.280
it seems crazy that i'm supposed to like

01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:14.719
go back in time and give a [ __ ] that

01:38:14.719 --> 01:38:16.080
someone did that while that was the

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:18.639
thing to do

01:38:18.639 --> 01:38:20.400
yeah i mean it's interesting because i

01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:21.360
mean

01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:22.719
you may know more than me but i think

01:38:22.719 --> 01:38:24.960
that was the issue around i guess

01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:27.119
louis ck's

01:38:27.119 --> 01:38:29.119
debacle is i know more about the louis

01:38:29.119 --> 01:38:30.800
ck thing that a lot the new york times

01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:32.560
has scum how they handle that but if you

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:34.480
just read the article

01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:37.199
right sometimes he did it's not what

01:38:37.199 --> 01:38:38.880
they were saying like if you just read

01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:40.719
it it's like wait a minute this doesn't

01:38:40.719 --> 01:38:41.679
add up

01:38:41.679 --> 01:38:43.360
there's like the the thing of like the

01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:46.080
two were terrified ask consent in a ho

01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:47.360
i've been to these festivals by the way

01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:49.600
dude okay in fact i [ __ ] booker

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:51.679
[ __ ] a booklet one of them

01:38:51.679 --> 01:38:53.679
uh not asked me at jfl

01:38:53.679 --> 01:38:56.159
uh who's had power over my career

01:38:56.159 --> 01:38:59.119
because she booked me she didn't rape me

01:38:59.119 --> 01:39:01.119
because i had a consensual sexual act

01:39:01.119 --> 01:39:02.239
with her

01:39:02.239 --> 01:39:04.480
so all these people the industry the

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:06.400
comedians are all drunk or whatever if

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:07.760
somebody

01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:09.280
you went up for a drink in their room at

01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:11.920
night and they asked you for a non-cons

01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:13.760
contact sexual act

01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:15.679
[ __ ] your entire story about yours [ __ ]

01:39:15.679 --> 01:39:17.280
you personally i know louis you weren't

01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:19.040
physically scared of them

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:20.560
maybe you were scared that if i don't

01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:22.480
sit here and watch this then i won't get

01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:24.560
favors later or something i'm trying to

01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:26.880
fathom right i think i would sit there

01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:28.480
and if that is the case like the

01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:30.080
argument they're making you made a

01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:32.239
choice you could let you could leave

01:39:32.239 --> 01:39:33.199
okay

01:39:33.199 --> 01:39:34.960
that i would never sit and watch a guy

01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:36.639
jerk off because i'm afraid i'm not

01:39:36.639 --> 01:39:38.639
gonna get favors in the business i'm a

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:41.040
goddamn comic so i'm like i'm funny i'm

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:43.199
going to be fine i'm not a person so

01:39:43.199 --> 01:39:44.639
there's this little mentality that

01:39:44.639 --> 01:39:46.159
people have of like

01:39:46.159 --> 01:39:47.119
oh well your career is the most

01:39:47.119 --> 01:39:48.719
important thing and i couldn't possibly

01:39:48.719 --> 01:39:50.080
risk my career for any reason even my

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:52.000
own body or dignity and that's why it's

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.280
wrong of you to ask me to do things

01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:54.800
because you know that i'm a such a

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:56.960
careerist coward that i will do

01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:58.639
literally anything if i think it helps

01:39:58.639 --> 01:40:00.719
my career that's that's what i see being

01:40:00.719 --> 01:40:02.800
pushed by that that's an interesting

01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:04.000
yeah that's an interesting way of

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.080
framing it you know a black girl i don't

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:07.360
know one black girl that would sit there

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:08.880
and i go hey honey can i jerk off in

01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:10.480
front of you who doesn't know if they

01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:12.000
want me to do that or not

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.400
i know that's a that's a solely white

01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:16.400
girl thing to do which is a lot

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:18.159
you know maybe raise the white woman age

01:40:18.159 --> 01:40:19.760
of consent to 30 or something maybe

01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:21.679
that's the answer but

01:40:21.679 --> 01:40:22.960
that that's that was all we were

01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:24.400
powering barrels

01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:26.320
but louie wasn't powerful like that at

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:28.480
that time he was a comic we all kind of

01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:30.560
knew he was maybe a little had more than

01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:32.880
me and fame at that time

01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:34.719
okay okay which i know is not a lot but

01:40:34.719 --> 01:40:37.119
bass you know from cable

01:40:37.119 --> 01:40:39.119
right before lucky louie as far as i

01:40:39.119 --> 01:40:40.239
know

01:40:40.239 --> 01:40:41.119
um

01:40:41.119 --> 01:40:42.880
but the thing is it started as a gawker

01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:44.080
blind item

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:45.440
right

01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:47.600
which said that he held the door

01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:49.840
and blocked them from coming out

01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:51.199
okay held the door and they couldn't

01:40:51.199 --> 01:40:52.960
leave until he did that all right it

01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:54.400
kind of blocked

01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:55.520
i don't know if you know the punk who

01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:56.880
used to do those but i can't i can't

01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:58.880
remember his name jordan something

01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:00.560
that little prick put that in there he

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:03.280
inserted that to make the rumor juicier

01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:06.239
so the louis story comes out you combine

01:41:06.239 --> 01:41:07.679
that story

01:41:07.679 --> 01:41:09.440
for the gawker blind item got combined

01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:11.440
and now he forced them to watch him jerk

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:14.080
off no he didn't that's all made up

01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:16.719
the the one of him uh with uh rebecca

01:41:16.719 --> 01:41:18.480
corey who then wrote two essays about

01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:19.760
like i can't believe i'm not flooded

01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:22.400
with work after this [ __ ] thing that

01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:24.280
story's um the real story behind that's

01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:27.520
unbelievable what a scumbag liar she is

01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:29.440
uh i'm not like i said louis could tell

01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:31.679
a story if he wants like all right he

01:41:31.679 --> 01:41:32.639
has to just

01:41:32.639 --> 01:41:34.239
not say anything more about it than he

01:41:34.239 --> 01:41:36.400
said is really the way so all the

01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:38.159
details and [ __ ]

01:41:38.159 --> 01:41:39.760
uh uh

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:41.440
you don't you know it doesn't do any

01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:42.639
good to tell them because you're [ __ ]

01:41:42.639 --> 01:41:44.800
in that situation so yeah let me i'm

01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:47.600
curious i'm with crystal leah

01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:50.159
crystalia

01:41:51.119 --> 01:41:52.239
it's interesting to me because i it

01:41:52.239 --> 01:41:53.520
didn't seem like there was a response

01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:55.280
right away and yeah i guess he was

01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:58.000
compiling some emails and some full

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
facebook messages like how does he feel

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.520
about the situation

01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:02.800
i'm not friends with him like i don't

01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:03.920
know okay

01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:04.960
so yeah

01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:06.239
i you know this is the other thing i've

01:42:06.239 --> 01:42:07.520
already been to this where people think

01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:09.199
if you don't join the mob that you're

01:42:09.199 --> 01:42:10.560
defending i've had this said about me

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:12.159
like kurt musk had offended his friend

01:42:12.159 --> 01:42:14.159
who's a rape i don't know these [ __ ]

01:42:14.159 --> 01:42:16.800
people right this is a disturbing thing

01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:17.840
to me

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:19.600
that we're just gonna have some click

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:21.840
baits and and then i'm supposed to like

01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:24.719
i said mingle his show character who was

01:42:24.719 --> 01:42:26.080
a pedophile

01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:27.679
with the real guy who's not doing

01:42:27.679 --> 01:42:29.600
anything illegal you could say it's

01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:31.520
immoral but what am i religious now i

01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:34.159
don't give a [ __ ] how he he philanders

01:42:34.159 --> 01:42:35.600
around that's none of my goddamn

01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:36.719
business

01:42:36.719 --> 01:42:38.320
so and also the people

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:40.800
saying the power differential thing

01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:42.719
they they hate the kind of girls that

01:42:42.719 --> 01:42:44.320
want to [ __ ] crystalia

01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:46.480
the [ __ ] hipster feminist types that

01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:49.280
are like his power

01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:51.199
you don't have any human emotion for the

01:42:51.199 --> 01:42:53.040
type of girls who are fans of crystalia

01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:54.239
and would have sex with them in fact you

01:42:54.239 --> 01:42:56.080
hate those girls so you could stop

01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:58.320
pretending that it's about some woman

01:42:58.320 --> 01:42:59.760
empowerment because you've never liked

01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:00.960
them okay

01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:02.239
it's funny that

01:43:02.239 --> 01:43:04.080
academic feminist jargon is trickling

01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:06.719
down to the dum-dum class i agree

01:43:06.719 --> 01:43:08.560
but you you're not on the side of women

01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:09.840
they just want him taken down because

01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:11.440
he's a guy who did it people said this

01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:13.520
flat out like well we don't like him

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:15.440
that's that's scary to me right okay so

01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:17.040
a little bit about my fans back to this

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:19.520
journalism man his stand up well a lot

01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:20.719
of them think that a lot of these

01:43:20.719 --> 01:43:23.199
journalists were open mikers that aren't

01:43:23.199 --> 01:43:25.040
getting spots there's a bunch of those

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:27.280
dude especially in the low end of

01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:29.119
huffpo style

01:43:29.119 --> 01:43:30.239
right

01:43:30.239 --> 01:43:33.199
where huffpost scrapes it's [ __ ]

01:43:33.199 --> 01:43:34.960
guess column is from but a lot of them

01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:37.440
run an open mic that's like low end or

01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:39.600
there so that's the

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:41.920
the particular vehemence of like getting

01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:44.719
comedians which is bizarre to me because

01:43:44.719 --> 01:43:47.119
honestly if i [ __ ] up at my job

01:43:47.119 --> 01:43:48.960
if on this podcast i say anything wrong

01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:51.040
or bad the consequences of that

01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:53.199
are literally not nothing to anyone

01:43:53.199 --> 01:43:54.719
except to me if someone wants to [ __ ]

01:43:54.719 --> 01:43:55.840
make it a thing

01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:56.960
but it right

01:43:56.960 --> 01:43:59.440
no one if i [ __ ] up as a comic it harm

01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:01.679
might if i tell the wrong joke

01:44:01.679 --> 01:44:04.320
the harm is solely really to me because

01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:07.040
people want to refund or something so so

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:08.800
it's being treated like worse than

01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:10.560
medical malpractice

01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:13.280
it's like i remember in like 2013

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:14.400
it was if you said their own thing is a

01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:16.239
comic that was like you left a sponge

01:44:16.239 --> 01:44:18.159
inside a patient as a surgeon level bad

01:44:18.159 --> 01:44:19.520
suddenly okay

01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:21.360
and now it's kicked up to full-blown war

01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:22.800
crime like

01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:25.520
a comedian is worse than george w bush

01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:26.960
in the eyes

01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:29.040
in terms of crimes against humanity in

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:30.960
the eyes of many of these people

01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:32.880
so like

01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:35.600
it's where that came from is a bunch of

01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:37.440
people that failed at comedy i wouldn't

01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:39.920
say failed at it uh this one guy i'll

01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:41.679
say his name this one time again but his

01:44:41.679 --> 01:44:44.000
name is seth simon who he walks to beat

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.400
of trying to rat out comedians for some

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:48.400
you know for hanging out with the wrong

01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:50.639
to other comedians he's a shitty failed

01:44:50.639 --> 01:44:52.960
comic like and and by fail i mean he

01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:54.800
didn't even try he did a couple of

01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:57.360
poetry open mics and then decided he'd

01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:59.199
never make it and he's mad

01:44:59.199 --> 01:45:01.119
so usually people fail at first before

01:45:01.119 --> 01:45:02.800
they want to cut cut comedy's pretty

01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:03.920
face

01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:06.480
like jamie kilstein the ex

01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:09.199
sjw uh radio guy

01:45:09.199 --> 01:45:11.679
he he was a guy who did comedy and he

01:45:11.679 --> 01:45:12.960
felt he didn't get what he wanted and he

01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:14.639
wanted to get back at it

01:45:14.639 --> 01:45:16.320
these people don't even have the guts to

01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:18.000
try at first they're already like oh it

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.239
wouldn't be for me and i want that party

01:45:20.239 --> 01:45:21.119
over

01:45:21.119 --> 01:45:22.480
and now for some reason there's a

01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:24.320
crossover in

01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:25.600
with journal i don't know you must know

01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:27.600
at least one person did an open mic in

01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:28.840
journalism

01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:33.199
circles or who does yeah i mean

01:45:34.719 --> 01:45:36.239
i think they're they're

01:45:36.239 --> 01:45:37.600
they're interesting because

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:40.000
the venn diagram of personalities are

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.199
somewhat similar they're people that

01:45:41.199 --> 01:45:42.880
like to tell stories that want to be

01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:45.440
heard that want to entertain

01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:46.719
they feel like they have a perspective

01:45:46.719 --> 01:45:48.400
and a point of view

01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:50.960
and then from there how that kind of

01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:52.639
career profession

01:45:52.639 --> 01:45:54.560
is different across that uh narcissist

01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:58.280
here's where the nurse is

01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:01.520
yeah i want attention and and that has

01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:03.760
become a kind of currency

01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:04.880
like i don't know i watch all this [ __ ]

01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:06.320
kind of go parallel so like when

01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:09.119
influencers the more that became a thing

01:46:09.119 --> 01:46:12.719
now it's just more and more morphs into

01:46:12.719 --> 01:46:14.400
uh

01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:16.960
a platform is a kind of cryptocurrency

01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:18.880
that you can

01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:20.400
i i first started thinking about it when

01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:21.440
you were saying

01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:24.000
about the redistribution of a

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.360
reputation

01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:26.719
yeah i mean

01:46:26.719 --> 01:46:28.960
the kids call it clout cloud like yeah

01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:30.880
oh it's cloud because people don't make

01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:33.520
real money they don't have real wages so

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:35.679
you get paid in clout and it's like

01:46:35.679 --> 01:46:38.560
cultural currency that you can spend to

01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:40.320
to crush somebody or elevate somebody up

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:42.159
if you have a lot of kind of cultural

01:46:42.159 --> 01:46:44.080
capital or cultural currency well when

01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:45.760
do the p i mean i guess you're only

01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:47.360
doing it for five years so

01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:49.199
i'd be curious in like 20 years right

01:46:49.199 --> 01:46:50.400
like

01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:52.560
when do you see the the reporters or the

01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:54.159
people like somebody at huffpo where

01:46:54.159 --> 01:46:55.600
they're like it dawns on them that

01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:56.960
they're getting shortchanged in this

01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:58.719
like click bait thing and then they're

01:46:58.719 --> 01:47:01.280
mad at journalism itself or they

01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:03.199
like i imagine often often a lot of

01:47:03.199 --> 01:47:04.480
journalists are very unhappy with their

01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:05.520
own industry and they feel like they're

01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:06.960
not paid enough and they're not

01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:08.639
respected enough and

01:47:08.639 --> 01:47:10.080
journalism is constantly at war with

01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:11.360
itself i mean just as much as

01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:13.119
journalists go after comedians

01:47:13.119 --> 01:47:15.440
journalists go after other german yeah

01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:16.639
there's not enough faith in the back

01:47:16.639 --> 01:47:19.679
room yes dude there's a big ponzi scary

01:47:19.679 --> 01:47:21.040
i've been saying this every episode but

01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:22.560
it's like it really is like america

01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:24.159
overall it's a big ponzi scheme and

01:47:24.159 --> 01:47:25.920
there's not enough uh

01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:27.520
it's built into you that it's your fault

01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:29.119
when when it doesn't work out and

01:47:29.119 --> 01:47:31.280
sometimes you know a lot of stuff maybe

01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:32.400
it is your [ __ ] fault you didn't have

01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:33.840
the talent for it but

01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:36.239
also there's a lot of like backstabbing

01:47:36.239 --> 01:47:38.239
political horseshit that goes on that

01:47:38.239 --> 01:47:40.719
has nothing to do with 100

01:47:40.719 --> 01:47:43.920
and uh 100 that's part of that

01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:45.840
yeah i think it's in a very specific

01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:48.239
kind of bourgeois class of people where

01:47:48.239 --> 01:47:50.239
it's the worst at the moment like too

01:47:50.239 --> 01:47:51.920
many people went to college and got a

01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:53.040
degree

01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:54.719
and there's not enough space for all of

01:47:54.719 --> 01:47:57.119
them do you know what i mean

01:47:57.119 --> 01:48:00.080
yes market is over saturated yeah right

01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:01.199
and um

01:48:01.199 --> 01:48:03.040
you know i saw what comedy was like my

01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:04.480
friend barry kearns used to say we had a

01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:06.880
syrian refugee crisis of comedians

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:08.320
because there's so many

01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:09.600
but i never bothered because i'm like if

01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:11.119
you think you should do it give it a try

01:48:11.119 --> 01:48:12.800
and you'll [ __ ] stop if it ain't for

01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:15.440
you right you kind of lost it there

01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:16.400
yeah like

01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:18.000
you might suck at it too but the people

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.760
that were going to do it and stay doing

01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:21.520
it that's how it was going to be

01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:23.440
like it's not like

01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:24.719
i don't believe you wanted enough you're

01:48:24.719 --> 01:48:25.920
going to get it yeah you're going to

01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:26.880
chase me

01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:29.920
it's not i'm not like a particularly uh

01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:30.719
like

01:48:30.719 --> 01:48:32.000
i got into it because i was lazy

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.400
[ __ ] but i i i'll write the material

01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:36.800
and [ __ ] right i'll do that you'll do

01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:39.440
the work when you need to yeah but but i

01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:40.960
just uh

01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:42.960
it's so funny watching that like so

01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:44.239
everything has this taint of like

01:48:44.239 --> 01:48:45.440
bitterness right through it and it's

01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:48.400
like desire to see someone ruined

01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:49.600
like when i saw the thing with louis i

01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:51.040
was like people i see people like i

01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:53.119
never thought he was good like do you

01:48:53.119 --> 01:48:55.199
feel proud saying that you faked liking

01:48:55.199 --> 01:48:57.440
something because you thought it was hip

01:48:57.440 --> 01:48:59.440
and now you feel permission to say you

01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:01.119
didn't like something like that's what i

01:49:01.119 --> 01:49:02.960
saw that across hipster

01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:05.199
you know i i came up to when when i got

01:49:05.199 --> 01:49:06.560
i don't know if hipster is still a thing

01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:08.639
even it seems even kind of old now

01:49:08.639 --> 01:49:09.520
but

01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:12.239
but that's the height of like

01:49:12.239 --> 01:49:13.920
it's like before mullany was big from

01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:15.520
dylan rafi

01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:17.599
right uh when i got there luna lounge

01:49:17.599 --> 01:49:20.320
was like the alt comedy

01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:22.400
center of comedy you know

01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:23.599
and um

01:49:23.599 --> 01:49:26.000
and i watched that [ __ ] uh hipster

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.679
thing go up and it was all like click

01:49:27.679 --> 01:49:29.920
[ __ ] it was all like these clicky

01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:32.480
[ __ ] by the way how chelsea was

01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:34.080
jonah's [ __ ]

01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:36.320
sister that one she's a comic right or a

01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:39.760
comic writer or she's a stan

01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:42.880
very funny comedic actress uh

01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:44.880
i don't i never stand up

01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:47.679
big what like just seems mean to me

01:49:47.679 --> 01:49:49.840
okay christina's a lot of like uh-huh

01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:51.760
you said the wrong thing and now i saw

01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:53.280
you say it and now i know that you said

01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:54.800
the wrong thing like it's like [ __ ] like

01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:57.119
that it's really similar to crystalia

01:49:57.119 --> 01:49:59.280
like a faux pas involving a cell phone

01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:00.960
and then you should feel bad about it

01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:03.199
you know right okay i've never i'm just

01:50:03.199 --> 01:50:04.800
glad i've never really watched or

01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:07.199
listened to any of delia's stand up so

01:50:07.199 --> 01:50:08.880
he was great on uh that episode of

01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:11.920
workaholics he's he's good as in as an

01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:13.280
actor in roles like some people are for

01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:14.800
that

01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:16.400
i'm just like i

01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:17.679
just because i don't give a [ __ ] about

01:50:17.679 --> 01:50:19.440
his stand up

01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:21.760
i would never be like oh good he was

01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:24.560
taken down by being called a pedophile

01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:27.440
like that blows me away

01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:29.599
how did they how did

01:50:29.599 --> 01:50:31.280
because he has i know he's on rogan

01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:32.400
sometimes

01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:35.040
i think he does a podcast himself right

01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:37.760
and he's got some friends

01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:39.280
how did everybody react within the

01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:41.840
community i expected

01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:43.360
or maybe i don't know it didn't seem

01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:44.639
like a lot of voices came out in defense

01:50:44.639 --> 01:50:46.080
of them and i was curious

01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:48.560
just because neil neil said something

01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:49.840
it's not a defense of him it's just a

01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:52.800
defense of the concept of defense

01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:54.880
right okay because i didn't see anything

01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:56.320
to be like oh i'm going to declare this

01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:57.679
person pedophile like are you people

01:50:57.679 --> 01:50:59.679
crazy like why would you say that about

01:50:59.679 --> 01:51:01.360
someone when that's not true that's such

01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:03.599
a horrible way now we're way beyond the

01:51:03.599 --> 01:51:04.639
[ __ ]

01:51:04.639 --> 01:51:06.880
kind of standard me too [ __ ] into he's a

01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:10.239
pedophile because this fake story that

01:51:10.239 --> 01:51:12.000
the girl was 16 which i wouldn't even

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.080
call him a pedophile then i honestly

01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:16.480
that's not anyway

01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:18.159
uh i mean i'd be like hey you're scumbag

01:51:18.159 --> 01:51:19.920
but this is like a serious thing that

01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:21.360
everybody's like no you can casually

01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:22.560
throw that around

01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:24.239
um the way people reacted depends on

01:51:24.239 --> 01:51:27.599
their level of of compromised in the

01:51:27.599 --> 01:51:29.040
industry with the projects they're

01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:31.119
working on so

01:51:31.119 --> 01:51:33.360
like uh you know

01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:34.639
uh uh

01:51:34.639 --> 01:51:36.159
who [ __ ] uh came out instead of

01:51:36.159 --> 01:51:37.520
saying um

01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:39.360
whitney whitney cummings who i by the

01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:40.800
way i thought they were friends i

01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:44.080
personally like her a lot okay okay yeah

01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:46.560
talk to me real talk [ __ ] huge

01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:48.400
disappointment that she made that she

01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:50.639
goes after digesting this information i

01:51:50.639 --> 01:51:52.320
have decided i'm ashamed whatever she

01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:53.440
denounced them

01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:55.520
okay now when she says after digesting

01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:57.679
the information that means i did not

01:51:57.679 --> 01:51:59.520
even look into the information or i

01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:02.000
don't want to know i had my pr person

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:03.760

she's got money like i'd be like a [ __ ]

01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:08.800
i don't need to be in another thing ever

01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:10.080

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.239
the club

01:52:14.239 --> 01:52:16.000
to the degree that they'll do any

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.679
they'll sell you out

01:52:17.679 --> 01:52:20.159

01:52:33.119 --> 01:52:34.560
a fake name

01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:37.040

robinson like ratted people out and it

01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:42.239
was all about who did like that's what

01:52:42.239 --> 01:52:43.760
this is or whatever i think they're

01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:45.199
combined

01:52:45.199 --> 01:52:47.520
trumbo was no defender of a other p he

01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:48.800
tried to suppress other people all the

01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:51.280
[ __ ] time for the record but

01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:53.040
that that principle of like your friends

01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:55.520
like you know hey don't risk your

01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:57.440
here's a low a low level example when

01:52:57.440 --> 01:53:00.159
ari shafir his storytelling show on uh

01:53:00.159 --> 01:53:02.159
comedy central ay shafir did a

01:53:02.159 --> 01:53:04.560
a special with netflix so comedy central

01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:06.560
was like you can't host your

01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:07.840
story thing we'll just take it because

01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:09.840
you didn't do your special with us so he

01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:11.440
goes okay fine have somebody else do it

01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:13.520
but he called me and goes hey listen

01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:15.760
um you're scheduled to do the my story

01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:17.920
show i'm not on it and it goes before

01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:19.440
you like say i'm not gonna do it if i is

01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:21.040
not there like it doesn't help me if you

01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:22.400
don't do it i would say just do it and

01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:24.320
get the money because i don't care you

01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:26.159
know he called me up because had had

01:53:26.159 --> 01:53:27.679
they just kicked tommy said i would have

01:53:27.679 --> 01:53:29.679
went with ari and [ __ ] on me central

01:53:29.679 --> 01:53:31.199
there's no way i would side with them

01:53:31.199 --> 01:53:33.360
over a [ __ ] comic right trying to

01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:35.760
pressure him and to put so

01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:38.239
he he you know so people give you you

01:53:38.239 --> 01:53:40.080
you know a few friends and [ __ ] they'll

01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:41.599
talk about it i don't know if whether

01:53:41.599 --> 01:53:43.599
she talked with chris or not about it

01:53:43.599 --> 01:53:45.040
yeah cause i was like was it her

01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:47.040
exposure to like other projects that she

01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:48.080
was doing in the industry that she

01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:50.239
didn't want to risk and therefore she

01:53:50.239 --> 01:53:52.080
well somebody came out yeah i mean she

01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:53.520
was did you see that a girl came out

01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:55.599
like you were there i came to dinner and

01:53:55.599 --> 01:53:57.360
you and brian cowan

01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:59.199
asked how old i was and i said and then

01:53:59.199 --> 01:54:00.560
you said they just get younger and

01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:02.960
younger and laughed that came out about

01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:04.560
right after she [ __ ] knuckled under

01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:05.599
like that

01:54:05.599 --> 01:54:07.840
and is that on twitter i imagine

01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:10.239
this yeah yeah so a lot of this is like

01:54:10.239 --> 01:54:12.960
people are a huge swath of all these

01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:14.960
things are people are covering up their

01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:17.119
own crimes generally

01:54:17.119 --> 01:54:18.719
there's different degrees of whatever it

01:54:18.719 --> 01:54:20.239
doesn't all have to be

01:54:20.239 --> 01:54:22.639
the world's most dramatic

01:54:22.639 --> 01:54:25.040
they're all i mean dude

01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:26.639
the amount of how this [ __ ] works here

01:54:26.639 --> 01:54:28.080
and how it has always worked and by the

01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:29.520
way will continue to work because it's

01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:32.159
the devil's [ __ ] industry

01:54:32.159 --> 01:54:32.960
uh

01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:34.639
it's it's unbelievable so anybody that

01:54:34.639 --> 01:54:36.159
falls for the [ __ ] statements and

01:54:36.159 --> 01:54:37.280
[ __ ] like i just don't even understand

01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:39.440
how people even

01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:40.960
think like that like they're like oh i

01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:43.440
thought chris deleo was a first of all

01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:44.800
crystalia seemed like a guy that [ __ ]

01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:46.800
a lot of girls that were in college

01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:48.960
that's what he seemed like to me he went

01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:52.560
around he did comedy that girls like

01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:55.360
and when girls i mean in the la sense of

01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:57.679
the word you know everyday [ __ ]

01:54:57.679 --> 01:54:59.679
chicks and and they're very specific

01:54:59.679 --> 01:55:00.880
thing

01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:01.920
and then they're different than east

01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:05.119
coast but there's plenty of ghosts

01:55:05.119 --> 01:55:06.239
and um

01:55:06.239 --> 01:55:08.639
they're like it's like high school

01:55:08.639 --> 01:55:10.719
[ __ ] popular girls that aren't

01:55:10.719 --> 01:55:12.639
massively intelligent that's the the

01:55:12.639 --> 01:55:14.960
demo okay

01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:16.239
or they just want to [ __ ] maybe they are

01:55:16.239 --> 01:55:17.280
smart and they just want to [ __ ]

01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:18.880
they're just attracted to his look but

01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:21.119
it's it's a pop star thing i mean i'm

01:55:21.119 --> 01:55:23.280
i'm yeah it's a celebrity thing yeah

01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:25.440
yeah it's like he does comedy for girls

01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:26.800
that's like whatever it's like you'd say

01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:28.639
about any uh so

01:55:28.639 --> 01:55:30.960
uh uh

01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:32.880
why don't i even get into this um

01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:34.960
i i can't believe people were like what

01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:36.159
do you think he doesn't [ __ ] a lot of

01:55:36.159 --> 01:55:38.239
girls like he just

01:55:38.239 --> 01:55:40.480
you know the the role he played on that

01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:42.320
show you

01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:43.199
right

01:55:43.199 --> 01:55:45.040
like i said it's very gross to be like

01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:46.639
oh my god look he played this and he's

01:55:46.639 --> 01:55:48.239
that in real life like not even by a

01:55:48.239 --> 01:55:50.320
long shot is he like that in real life

01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:51.920
he played a rapist

01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:54.000
criminal in this other show

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
and in this thing you're like whoa those

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.840
girls i don't even know why i'm supposed

01:55:57.840 --> 01:55:59.119
to give a [ __ ] if he [ __ ] a girl that's

01:55:59.119 --> 01:56:00.960
20 or 19. like i don't care why would i

01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:03.520
care about that

01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:06.719
like what do you am i like

01:56:06.719 --> 01:56:08.480
no i i

01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:10.159
there's a new thing about inappropriate

01:56:10.159 --> 01:56:13.280
where you go that's appropriate

01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:14.960
your stance seems very neutral and

01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:16.320
reasonable to me and that's why i was

01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:18.159
curious why

01:56:18.159 --> 01:56:19.119
like

01:56:19.119 --> 01:56:21.920
whitney and callan and schwab these

01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:23.840
these other comics

01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:25.199
okay she didn't seem to come out i

01:56:25.199 --> 01:56:28.480
showed the clip on the last step

01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:36.400
i think he's doing better but um

01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:37.840
thoughts and prayers

01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:40.000
brian brian is a player like he's [ __ ]

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.080
a million [ __ ] like i'm sure there's

01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:44.000
there's somebody that could frame and

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.159
i'm not saying he did anything but he's

01:56:46.159 --> 01:56:47.679
had enough sexual partners that one of

01:56:47.679 --> 01:56:48.880
them could be

01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:50.320
could frame anything any way they want

01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:52.880
and put it on twitter of that type

01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:54.400
because brian you know

01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:55.360
um

01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:56.639
and uh

01:56:56.639 --> 01:56:58.320
brian he said like i don't know i don't

01:56:58.320 --> 01:56:59.520
know if it's true i never saw anything

01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:00.880
like that they did like a statement on

01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:02.560
their show and then brandon was crying

01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:03.679
he was crying

01:57:03.679 --> 01:57:05.280
okay yeah he's like i'm mad i'm mad at

01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:41.199
people

01:57:41.199 --> 01:57:43.520

do you think

01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:53.920
oh i believe it but do you think part of

01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:56.400
the reason you feel able to

01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:00.239
speak more freely in your eyes

01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:01.760
you have personal experience and you

01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:03.520
realize how unfair it can be does that

01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:04.560
make sense whereas other people don't

01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:07.040
appreciate how quickly

01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:10.239
certainly i mean dude 100 that adds to

01:58:10.239 --> 01:58:12.560
it however i was like that before that

01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:13.920
happened to me

01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:15.599
i just didn't understand the

01:58:15.599 --> 01:58:17.520
i wasn't as afraid of it where i'm like

01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:19.119
or i didn't respect the amount of damage

01:58:19.119 --> 01:58:20.719
it could do because i was like right how

01:58:20.719 --> 01:58:22.560
traumatized

01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:24.719
i am any mistakes i made i don't give a

01:58:24.719 --> 01:58:25.679
[ __ ]

01:58:25.679 --> 01:58:27.280
anything in my personal life by the way

01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:28.239
this is the other thing i don't

01:58:28.239 --> 01:58:29.760
understand how people volunteer this

01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:31.599
like if somebody doesn't like how i

01:58:31.599 --> 01:58:33.440
conducted myself in my personal life

01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:35.520
relationships go [ __ ] yourself unless

01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:37.440
you're that person i was dealing with

01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:39.520
it's none of your goddamn business

01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:41.119
unless i committed a crime and then

01:58:41.119 --> 01:58:43.040
society has to try me in a court of law

01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:43.920
whatever

01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:46.080
i'm not obligated through a [ __ ] any

01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:49.119
kind of morals clause beyond not

01:58:49.119 --> 01:58:51.360
breaking the law right like like i have

01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:53.440
a contract with disney just in my life

01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:55.199
or something that's that's that's the

01:58:55.199 --> 01:58:58.000
new creeping this is what's so gross is

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.080
the corporate control [ __ ]

01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:01.360
i mean it's creepy when you're like i

01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:04.000
work for yahoo through verizon this

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.599
control thing is now extending to every

01:59:05.599 --> 01:59:06.880
part of your life

01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:07.840
well

01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:10.000
so i'm i'm curious how

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:11.840
given that you have kind of more

01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:14.080
visceral understanding i think than some

01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:15.360
people in your industry

01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:17.199
what do you think chris will will be

01:59:17.199 --> 01:59:18.800
like coming out of this on the other

01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:21.599
side do you think he'll be much more

01:59:21.599 --> 01:59:23.840
cynical about the press and the media

01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:25.520
and like who his friends are you know

01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:27.760
what i'm saying like by the way i i this

01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:29.280
is why i say with michael jackson is

01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:31.119
funny like the level of fame and how

01:59:31.119 --> 01:59:33.199
much it influence insulates you from

01:59:33.199 --> 01:59:34.480
reality because

01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:36.800
if i was crystalia after getting accused

01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:38.400
of something that heinous that i did not

01:59:38.400 --> 01:59:39.679
do

01:59:39.679 --> 01:59:41.760
i'd never be on tinder i'd never be

01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:42.639
[ __ ]

01:59:42.639 --> 01:59:45.119
dming any chick ever again right the

01:59:45.119 --> 01:59:47.199
walls go up girls send me [ __ ] all the

01:59:47.199 --> 01:59:49.040
time like like you don't have to be very

01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:50.960
famous for people to be sending you

01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:52.480
sexual [ __ ] and i'm like i don't know

01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:55.040
half i'm like is this a dude even if i

01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:57.119
i've had now

01:59:57.119 --> 01:59:58.639
i've had [ __ ] where

01:59:58.639 --> 02:00:00.880
i knew the girl was real and i think

02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:02.800
that was a while ago i think now there's

02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:04.480
much more chance that somebody's doing a

02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:06.960
fake thing catfish i just think yeah i

02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:08.239
think that way that someone's trying to

02:00:08.239 --> 02:00:09.520
pull a trap

02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:10.480
um

02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:12.159
so just as someone who's gone through

02:00:12.159 --> 02:00:14.560
like i've been very very slandered and

02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:16.480
[ __ ] like i don't

02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:18.320
i'm not as engaging with just like i

02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:20.000
used to engage with everybody

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.440
which i right now you're more careful

02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:22.800
more aware yeah

02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:23.520
so

02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:25.199
he's like he's engaging with his dick

02:00:25.199 --> 02:00:27.199
like that's like sexual that's like

02:00:27.199 --> 02:00:29.119
sexual addiction like i was never

02:00:29.119 --> 02:00:30.800
that wasn't my vice with sex addiction

02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:32.560
it was always like chemicals

02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:33.920
you know everybody right that's their

02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:36.000
thing so

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
if he's a true addict then i don't know

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.199
he'll be

02:00:39.199 --> 02:00:40.719
i mean he just had so much [ __ ] again

02:00:40.719 --> 02:00:42.239
throwing him the whole time i i was

02:00:42.239 --> 02:00:43.840
aware of him

02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:45.520
right well that's the one

02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:47.360
joke which is like you know you've never

02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:49.280
been in that position of celebrity or

02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:51.280
you don't understand the temptation that

02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:53.280
exists most people don't

02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:54.960
hear they don't and then here's what he

02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:56.880
doesn't understand all these guys

02:00:56.880 --> 02:00:59.199
as soon as you start to get to 40

02:00:59.199 --> 02:01:00.639
you suddenly

02:01:00.639 --> 02:01:02.320

02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:14.560
because you're not like

02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:15.920
it's really amazing watching it like

02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:17.920
people like so he didn't notice like how

02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:19.760
mel gibson didn't notice we talked about

02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:21.119
before but you know mel gibson had that

02:01:21.119 --> 02:01:23.679
stupid russian check that he left his

02:01:23.679 --> 02:01:26.560
wife of 30 years for right because he

02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:28.159
didn't feel a spiritual connection to

02:01:28.159 --> 02:01:30.480
his wife of his seven [ __ ] catholic

02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:32.480
[ __ ] kids

stupid fake tits and ugly fake lips and

02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:37.440
like

02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:39.599
clearly in fact

02:01:39.599 --> 02:01:40.639
uh

02:01:40.639 --> 02:01:42.880
the guy who was the producer of last

02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:45.920
comic standing who also produced

02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:47.440

he was like oh that i can see this check

02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:53.280
coming a mile away

02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:56.239
but mel gibson because you're vanity man

02:01:56.239 --> 02:01:57.840
you know like the

02:01:57.840 --> 02:01:59.199
people the kind of people that want to

02:01:59.199 --> 02:02:00.400
take something from you especially if

02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:02.159
you you don't have to be rich you have

02:02:02.159 --> 02:02:03.280
to get famous you just have to have

02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:05.440
something somebody covets that they're

02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:06.960
willing

02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:09.119
to to pull [ __ ] to take advantage of you

02:02:09.119 --> 02:02:10.719
like there's another side to people that

02:02:10.719 --> 02:02:12.719
have any kind of successful position

02:02:12.719 --> 02:02:14.320

02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:16.159
for like jackals at all times because

02:02:16.159 --> 02:02:17.760
people are jackals it's like you're in

02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:18.960
the mafia

02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:21.920

right you know what i mean like the

02:02:23.119 --> 02:02:25.199
things against rogan now those are very

02:02:25.199 --> 02:02:27.760
clearly being drummed up because he got

02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:29.760
that deal with spotify that's clearly

02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:32.000
why so like i don't worry about anything

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.360

least a hundred thousand downloads to

02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:43.520
get to where i'd worry that someone

02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:45.360
wants to take me down as soon as you

02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:47.840

02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:36.719
i could also just not have an opening

02:03:36.719 --> 02:03:38.719
spot for joey diaz that's ridiculous

02:03:38.719 --> 02:03:40.400
you're the type of person that does that

02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:42.159
if you say yes to that that's not being

02:03:42.159 --> 02:03:44.239
forced you're given a choice

02:03:44.239 --> 02:03:45.679
that girl who would do that chelsea

02:03:45.679 --> 02:03:47.119
would never care about that girl she

02:03:47.119 --> 02:03:48.719
would despise that girl

02:03:48.719 --> 02:03:50.560
you know that girl wouldn't be her sort

02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:52.239
wouldn't be in her clique

02:03:52.239 --> 02:03:53.440
it wouldn't be someone who broke you

02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:55.440
know you go around i could tell you hang

02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:56.480
around these kind of people because you

02:03:56.480 --> 02:03:57.920
had that horizontal striped shirt in

02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:00.079
your riot video like you're from sweden

02:04:00.079 --> 02:04:02.320
or something that's pure new york you

02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:04.880
know hipster people kind of wardrobe

02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:06.480
and that's the way they are they're not

02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:08.800
they're all about exclusion

02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:10.800
and it's not about ball busting like the

02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:12.960
blue collar end is where you just mock

02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:14.800
someone when i tell her where you say

02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:16.639
that yeah you're this that

02:04:16.639 --> 02:04:17.760
um

02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:19.119
i'm gonna take away from chelsea's funny

02:04:19.119 --> 02:04:20.960
she can be very funny but her her

02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:22.560
character she's like my blood's boiling

02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:24.960
listener

02:04:30.239 --> 02:04:32.480
what he did to america with buzzfeed and

02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:34.079
what he did to the world

02:04:34.079 --> 02:04:36.159
that's where your blood should boil your

02:04:36.159 --> 02:04:38.719
scumbag brother jonah who invented a pox

02:04:38.719 --> 02:04:39.760
on our

02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:40.880
national

02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:43.280
on our collective [ __ ] subconscious

02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:45.520
instead of being mad joey diaz got a

02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:47.920
[ __ ] from a [ __ ] back in the 80s who

02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:50.000
the [ __ ] so anyway joe rogan has to be

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.079
canceled because he's laughing at this

02:04:52.079 --> 02:04:53.760
this was done made nine years ago this

02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:55.040
podcast

02:04:55.040 --> 02:04:55.840
right

02:04:55.840 --> 02:04:58.560
he laughed at a story told by a fat guy

02:04:58.560 --> 02:05:00.560
about telling someone to blow them for

02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:02.960
get it to get stage time who i don't

02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:04.800
give a remote [ __ ] about one part of

02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:07.360
that story who dug that up who was like

02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:08.639
there's got to be something in the

02:05:08.639 --> 02:05:09.920
records

02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:11.199
this is what i want to know who dug that

02:05:11.199 --> 02:05:12.800
up because it wasn't chelsea she saw

02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:14.560
somebody else's tweet right yeah

02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:16.719
somebody i mean people get off on

02:05:16.719 --> 02:05:19.520
digging stuff up

02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:21.440
a crazy person went through everything

02:05:21.440 --> 02:05:23.679
that i ever my personal record or

02:05:23.679 --> 02:05:25.440
whatever because i didn't realize that's

02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:27.360
what you're doing putting things online

02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:28.960
every little comment

02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:31.040
anything to try and made a [ __ ]

02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:32.480
collage

02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:35.119
yeah

02:05:35.119 --> 02:05:37.199
just to see what would stick and purely

02:05:37.199 --> 02:05:38.800
out of and that's there's people that

02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:41.360
just spend their time doing that now

02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:43.520
because the the bottom line is

02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:44.639
everybody's like well how come you can't

02:05:44.639 --> 02:05:46.800
make a mistake and grow it's not about

02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:48.880
that they don't give a [ __ ] about

02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:49.840
whether you

02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:51.679
nobody who says that cares if you're a

02:05:51.679 --> 02:05:53.360
racist to sex they don't care about that

02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:55.520
what they care is you have something and

02:05:55.520 --> 02:05:57.280
they have an opportunity to make you

02:05:57.280 --> 02:05:58.560
lose

02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:00.800
okay and and we need any excuse to make

02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:01.840
that happen

02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:03.280
the way the way i've seen right terms

02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:05.119
like in the words of a person that is

02:06:05.119 --> 02:06:07.040
into this is

02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:08.719
like there's not enough spaces like we

02:06:08.719 --> 02:06:10.079
need we need to make room for

02:06:10.079 --> 02:06:12.320
celebrities who aren't who don't have

02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:14.480
racist pests

02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:16.960
so right so we need to make room it's

02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:18.719
too jammed up with fame and by the way a

02:06:18.719 --> 02:06:20.960
lot of shit's too jammed up with people

02:06:20.960 --> 02:06:22.639
but you can always go off on your own

02:06:22.639 --> 02:06:24.079
and do your own thing you have that like

02:06:24.079 --> 02:06:25.679
that's why rogan can't be canceled by

02:06:25.679 --> 02:06:27.040
these people because he made his own

02:06:27.040 --> 02:06:27.920
thing

02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:30.320
so there's no there's no corporate

02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:31.840
that's what we're talking about this is

02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:34.400
the corporate control aspect is oh yeah

02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:36.880
you have to obey our hr rules every

02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:39.040
aspect the second of your life

02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:41.760
right like okay so you write for uh

02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:44.079
whatever yahoo and verizon

02:06:44.079 --> 02:06:45.840
every day of your life you you need to

02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:48.159
reflect verizon's values wherever you

02:06:48.159 --> 02:06:49.920
are in south carolina right now

02:06:49.920 --> 02:06:51.599
don't [ __ ] up in a way that reflects

02:06:51.599 --> 02:06:54.000
poorly on the company of verizon which

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:55.679
[ __ ] owns you be the brand yeah

02:06:55.679 --> 02:06:58.079
because they'll just decap did you

02:06:58.079 --> 02:07:00.400
you're viewed as a proxy for there right

02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:01.199
and that's

02:07:01.199 --> 02:07:03.199
[ __ ] that's on my time what i do

02:07:03.199 --> 02:07:05.199
like after i punch out of whatever

02:07:05.199 --> 02:07:07.040
that's none of your [ __ ] business

02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:08.800
what i do

02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:10.800
i say including murder don't don't get

02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:13.119
in my business but it's

02:07:13.119 --> 02:07:14.480
it's not your place is what i'm saying

02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:16.320
as a company to do that it's just not i

02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:18.159
you know it's interesting because i

02:07:18.159 --> 02:07:20.639
i think most companies default position

02:07:20.639 --> 02:07:22.639
is to agree with that and not want to

02:07:22.639 --> 02:07:24.800
have to be responsible for it it's only

02:07:24.800 --> 02:07:26.639
when people get on twitter and and

02:07:26.639 --> 02:07:28.320
journalists and other people

02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:30.239
push the company into being responsible

02:07:30.239 --> 02:07:31.679
they accuse the company you know

02:07:31.679 --> 02:07:33.440
neglecting well this is you're employing

02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:34.320
them it's like well they were off the

02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:36.239
clock but right twitter users people

02:07:36.239 --> 02:07:37.520
don't think that's that's why we want

02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:39.199
them to you know i'm saying like they're

02:07:39.199 --> 02:07:41.760
getting the pressure too that's like see

02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:44.400
that's i think of that as like 2012 2013

02:07:44.400 --> 02:07:45.440
times

02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:48.000
now the industry has grown

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:49.599
there's a whole now it's going to be

02:07:49.599 --> 02:07:51.920
hard the shit's collapsing already the

02:07:51.920 --> 02:07:53.520
cancel because it's inflated the the

02:07:53.520 --> 02:07:55.760
currency of of

02:07:55.760 --> 02:07:57.199
wokistan

02:07:57.199 --> 02:07:59.520
is like zimbabwe a zimbabwe billion

02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:01.599
dollar bill it's [ __ ] worthless or

02:08:01.599 --> 02:08:03.360
trillion dollar bill because they're

02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:04.719
spending it

02:08:04.719 --> 02:08:05.920
they're trying to spend this [ __ ] and

02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:07.520
they're printing it up and spending it

02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:10.320
and who has the time to give a [ __ ] this

02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:11.840
joe rogan thing that we're talking about

02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:13.040
like

02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:15.360
a huge swaths of people were going to go

02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:17.199
what if you try to tell them

02:08:17.199 --> 02:08:18.880
people aren't careful that's right yeah

02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:22.400
there's now a business of helping you

02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:24.079
navigate

02:08:24.079 --> 02:08:26.239
this new disgusting world of corporate

02:08:26.239 --> 02:08:27.920
nonsense and so those people are going

02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:29.520
to keep prop trying to prop it up the

02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:31.840
people who want to be i had some i'll

02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:34.159
never forget it this check was like

02:08:34.159 --> 02:08:36.000
i did some girls podcast trying to be

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:37.520
like nice with some [ __ ] feminist

02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:40.239
chick in chicago and she

02:08:40.239 --> 02:08:42.400
after she gets done it was crazy how she

02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:44.239
talked to me on her thing it was i mean

02:08:44.239 --> 02:08:45.840
it was crazy i was dumb to think that i

02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:48.400
could engage with somebody and be normal

02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:49.679
but after she was oh maybe i could be a

02:08:49.679 --> 02:08:51.679
comedy consultant for you

02:08:51.679 --> 02:08:53.599
that's awesome she's a gender studies

02:08:53.599 --> 02:08:55.760
professor who works in a taco truck she

02:08:55.760 --> 02:08:56.960
goes i gotta get to work at the taco

02:08:56.960 --> 02:08:58.480
truck but maybe i could be your comedy

02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:00.800
con gender oh uh the just that's what

02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:02.320
i'd love while i when i do creative

02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:04.960
things is to have you a

02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:06.719
feminist gender studies professor who

02:09:06.719 --> 02:09:08.480
works in a taco truck

02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:09.760
let me take you away from all that give

02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:11.199
you notes

02:09:11.199 --> 02:09:13.040

02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:14.320
like i'd love to but who will watch the

02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:16.639
taco truck that's right that's what i'm

02:09:16.639 --> 02:09:18.400
afraid of who will serve the tacos you

02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:20.079
[ __ ] by the way

02:09:20.079 --> 02:09:22.719
no credit was given to me for not making

02:09:22.719 --> 02:09:24.639
20 obvious jokes about a feminist

02:09:24.639 --> 02:09:26.159
[ __ ] studies professor working in a

02:09:26.159 --> 02:09:28.960
taco truck i just left that one alone

02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:30.239
and i should have got at least a pat on

02:09:30.239 --> 02:09:32.800
the head for that uh

02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:34.159
the the [ __ ]

02:09:34.159 --> 02:09:35.280
i got

02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:36.800
girl i probably i gotta wrap it up in

02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:39.280
like 15 minutes just heads up

02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:42.159
um yeah i gotta get uh

02:09:42.159 --> 02:09:44.480
there's a business now that and i'm like

02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:46.000
i know everybody's in with kovid but do

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.360
you like

02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:48.400
because new york times didn't they have

02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:50.639
like a [ __ ] uprising of like the woke

02:09:50.639 --> 02:09:52.719
section versus the old school reporters

02:09:52.719 --> 02:09:54.639
yeah

02:09:54.639 --> 02:09:57.520
they seized the means of distribution

02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:00.159
they had a full-on internal debate they

02:10:00.159 --> 02:10:03.520
outed one of the the editors for hiring

02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:06.400
tom cotton to write that op-ed

02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:08.639
and then there's a debacle over the

02:10:08.639 --> 02:10:09.760
headline and yeah i mean it was

02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:11.520
basically a generational divide a

02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:12.400
younger

02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:14.079
these are people that are like 30 or so

02:10:14.079 --> 02:10:15.040
right

02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:16.560
yeah so the new york times i mean

02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:18.639
they're so large they just have so many

02:10:18.639 --> 02:10:20.239
journalists new york times dominant

02:10:20.239 --> 02:10:21.360
washington post and new york times

02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:22.320
control

02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:24.000
one out of every third journalist in the

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:25.440
united states are employed by those two

02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:26.880
alone

02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:29.760
but yeah most people in the 30s

02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:31.840
it's just two different world views

02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:33.360
they they want to be a little more

02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:34.560
activist

02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:36.400
journalist i would say do that how do

02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:38.320
you think that that's like

02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:40.320
the especially with the defund the

02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:43.360
police horseshit like

02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:45.280
defund new york time like that's the

02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:46.800
thing that's crazy is watching the i

02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:48.480
think you did you make up this term the

02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:50.000
thin blue check mark that's hilarious

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.920
yeah that's in blue check mark yeah

02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:53.199
that's what they [ __ ] think that they

02:10:53.199 --> 02:10:54.800
were the thin blue check mark where

02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:57.520
democracy dot [ __ ] jeff bezos's paper

02:10:57.520 --> 02:10:59.360
says that democracy actually died in

02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:01.920
darkness yeah really does it mr bezos

02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:03.599
you [ __ ] i thought it was just unions

02:11:03.599 --> 02:11:06.239
you [ __ ] bald brick

02:11:06.239 --> 02:11:07.360
like

02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:08.880
do you encounter those groups like how

02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:10.320
do these groups take over because a

02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:11.840
bunch of them get these factions get

02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:14.159
into all kinds of things movies

02:11:14.159 --> 02:11:15.520
it goes from like comic books to

02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:17.199
journalism to comedy

02:11:17.199 --> 02:11:20.159
to every every reach of society this

02:11:20.159 --> 02:11:21.520
these group of this like

02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:24.400
intersectionally trained people seems to

02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:25.920
and i don't think they're that organized

02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:27.520
i think they just all believe the same

02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:29.280
scientology things

02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:32.960
yeah i think it's it's uh one reinforced

02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:35.679
when you get into high mind mentality

02:11:35.679 --> 02:11:36.960
certainly if your friends think this way

02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:38.159
you're more inclined to think that way

02:11:38.159 --> 02:11:39.360
and it's just

02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:41.119
they went through a liberal arts college

02:11:41.119 --> 02:11:42.400
at a certain time in the united states

02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:44.239
that's what it means right and they come

02:11:44.239 --> 02:11:45.599
out thinking a certain way

02:11:45.599 --> 02:11:47.920
and their peers think a certain way

02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:49.280
and it seems like that's the way to get

02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:52.880
ahead is to conform to that that idea

02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:55.360
and i think there's a real concern

02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:56.079
that

02:11:56.079 --> 02:11:57.520
i think people want to feel like they're

02:11:57.520 --> 02:11:59.280
on the right side of history

02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:00.480
yes that's uh

02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:02.239
understanding what is the right or wrong

02:12:02.239 --> 02:12:04.880
side of history requires a real critical

02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:07.840
nuanced view

02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:11.199
often some rudimentary knowledge of

02:12:11.199 --> 02:12:13.520
history that could help this is

02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:17.280
this is this is a real i mean

02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:19.280
it's like on history oh yeah because you

02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:20.960
know anybody who study history will tell

02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:23.199
you that we always look back fondly on

02:12:23.199 --> 02:12:25.199
censorship movements those always come

02:12:25.199 --> 02:12:27.440
out great when you look back thank god

02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:29.199
yeah and group wanted to censor

02:12:29.199 --> 02:12:31.199
something they were heroes and they

02:12:31.199 --> 02:12:32.239
didn't know at the time they thought

02:12:32.239 --> 02:12:33.599
they were [ __ ] annoying but now we

02:12:33.599 --> 02:12:35.199
see it was great that censorship that's

02:12:35.199 --> 02:12:36.560
never happened

02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:38.719
somebody no neil the guy had last week

02:12:38.719 --> 02:12:39.920
because his smart dude he goes he goes

02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:41.280
yeah we don't know what would happen if

02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:42.560
everybody can just say what they want

02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:44.000
something we don't know i'm like we

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:45.199
don't know what happened if we stop

02:12:45.199 --> 02:12:46.960
people from saying

02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:48.320
it was like yeah we know exactly what

02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:50.639
happened we there's a history of that of

02:12:50.639 --> 02:12:52.079
stopping people from this and that and

02:12:52.079 --> 02:12:53.760
then it blows up in your [ __ ] face

02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:55.520
because that's not the way to do it

02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:57.840
right i just i think there's a big gap

02:12:57.840 --> 02:12:59.119
in

02:12:59.119 --> 02:13:00.719
in journalists that didn't study

02:13:00.719 --> 02:13:02.400
journalism quote unquote right so they

02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:04.159
don't have a deep history knowledge they

02:13:04.159 --> 02:13:05.599
don't have a knowledge the knowledge of

02:13:05.599 --> 02:13:07.440
biology they study to become journalists

02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:09.360
that's a great that's why journalism

02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:11.679
journalism school which teaches you

02:13:11.679 --> 02:13:12.719
the kind of

02:13:12.719 --> 02:13:15.360
history of journalism but modern

02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:18.159
journalism one is relatively new even

02:13:18.159 --> 02:13:19.599
this idea that journalists can be

02:13:19.599 --> 02:13:21.840
objective is a relatively new concept

02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:23.679
that's taught right i mean in the 1800s

02:13:23.679 --> 02:13:24.960
nobody thought journalists would be

02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:26.079
objective

02:13:26.079 --> 02:13:26.800
so

02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:28.239
and then

02:13:28.239 --> 02:13:30.800
you know what dude i don't need um

02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:32.800
especially people i i i think there's a

02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:35.199
huge problem with saying

02:13:35.199 --> 02:13:37.199
and everybody does this like like i see

02:13:37.199 --> 02:13:38.480
people express themselves wrong i don't

02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:40.000
mean you're doing that but

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.599
people go like i want my journals to be

02:13:41.599 --> 02:13:45.199
objective or i want uh no politics in my

02:13:45.199 --> 02:13:47.119
ex i don't want any political video

02:13:47.119 --> 02:13:49.040
games or gamergater i don't want

02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:50.639
politics and i think people just don't

02:13:50.639 --> 02:13:52.880
express what they mean because it's not

02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:53.679
like

02:13:53.679 --> 02:13:55.520
i don't mind politics anything i don't

02:13:55.520 --> 02:13:56.320
want

02:13:56.320 --> 02:13:58.159
a war all the goddamn time that's what

02:13:58.159 --> 02:14:01.199
it is there's politics now all this talk

02:14:01.199 --> 02:14:03.119
of ally ship and whatever that's war

02:14:03.119 --> 02:14:04.079
talk

02:14:04.079 --> 02:14:06.159
so i don't want the [ __ ] war that

02:14:06.159 --> 02:14:07.599
you're waging in your head against a

02:14:07.599 --> 02:14:09.679
voice always you know and then you'd

02:14:09.679 --> 02:14:11.280
have to be objective like

02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:12.639
there's plenty of people who i admire

02:14:12.639 --> 02:14:14.000
their [ __ ]

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:15.760
and they're not objective you have to

02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:17.199
have principle just have a principle

02:14:17.199 --> 02:14:18.960
though right or be honest about your

02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:21.280
subjectivity

02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:23.679
yeah like hey i'm a liberal but this is

02:14:23.679 --> 02:14:25.520
the truth like if i see something that

02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:27.199
goes against what i think

02:14:27.199 --> 02:14:28.480
if i'm a reporter i'm going to say that

02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:29.840
even though it doesn't look good for my

02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:31.920
side to win in the election

02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:33.920
right i you know

02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:34.960
yeah

02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:37.119
summer is just half the median she's

02:14:37.119 --> 02:14:38.639
very young at the moment you know they

02:14:38.639 --> 02:14:40.560
rose along with digital media so i think

02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:42.320
you have

02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:44.800
it skews a younger demographic of of

02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:46.719
reporters than

02:14:46.719 --> 02:14:48.639
1980s 1970s you know if you were to take

02:14:48.639 --> 02:14:50.719
the median age or reporter in 1970

02:14:50.719 --> 02:14:52.880
they'd probably be 45 the median age is

02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:55.360
probably 26.

02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:57.199
that's gross right when did reporters

02:14:57.199 --> 02:14:59.840
start going from being like some kind of

02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:01.920
almost like uh some like working-class

02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:03.760
guy like at some point reporters as a

02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:05.679
group went from being where it's some

02:15:05.679 --> 02:15:08.560
like muckraker blue-collar person

02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:09.440
up to

02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:11.119
this is the sons and daughters of the

02:15:11.119 --> 02:15:12.400
elites that are going to go to that

02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:13.599
press party

02:15:13.599 --> 02:15:15.119
right so i think what happened is the

02:15:15.119 --> 02:15:17.599
economics changed and because a lot of

02:15:17.599 --> 02:15:19.679
print subscription they were just flush

02:15:19.679 --> 02:15:21.360
with cash and they could afford to keep

02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:23.280
you know a father with family on the

02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:24.320
payroll

02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:26.159
when the economics change you want to

02:15:26.159 --> 02:15:27.599
hire people that are really cheap so

02:15:27.599 --> 02:15:29.040
they're young that you just get oh yeah

02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:30.880
you'll get experience or people that can

02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:32.639
afford to not get paid a lot which is

02:15:32.639 --> 02:15:34.840
the sons of politicians and daughters of

02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:36.159
lawyers do you know what i'm saying so

02:15:36.159 --> 02:15:38.079
it's become a privileged job that

02:15:38.079 --> 02:15:39.920
average people cannot get into because

02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:40.880
they can't

02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:42.560
bother taking three years of internships

02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:43.920
for fifteen dollars an hour in new york

02:15:43.920 --> 02:15:45.599
city oh dude right so they're gonna

02:15:45.599 --> 02:15:46.880
focus on

02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:48.000
and it's just

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.639
the the framework of

02:15:50.639 --> 02:15:53.360
of journalism has changed it's just

02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:55.679
it's crazy the people willing to be paid

02:15:55.679 --> 02:15:57.040
in

02:15:57.040 --> 02:15:59.520
it's like it's it's almost more

02:15:59.520 --> 02:16:01.199
in certain ways it's as or more

02:16:01.199 --> 02:16:02.960
degrading than like suck my dick to get

02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:05.119
ahead there's like

02:16:05.119 --> 02:16:06.320
there's like no i'm not going to pay you

02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:08.719
any money but people will know that you

02:16:08.719 --> 02:16:10.239
work for me

02:16:10.239 --> 02:16:12.320
right but it requires a certain level of

02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:14.000
life privilege

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:15.920
privilege to be in that position to

02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:19.199
begin with yeah right yeah i mean like

02:16:19.199 --> 02:16:20.719
somebody that's responsible for paying

02:16:20.719 --> 02:16:22.560
the bills right off the bat or can't

02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:24.239
barely afford college

02:16:24.239 --> 02:16:25.520
you're you know already in debt from a

02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:27.280
four-year degree they can't go take a

02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:28.800
ten dollar internship they got to get a

02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:30.079
real job

02:16:30.079 --> 02:16:31.920
right away and the internships really

02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:33.599
started as kind of like a good thing

02:16:33.599 --> 02:16:36.160
that just got slowly

02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:38.160
right well you know you do the math you

02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:40.240
think well i can yeah i can fire this

02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:43.200
person that and just hire five interns

02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:44.960
and they can crank out click bait

02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:46.880
content because that will generate the

02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:49.040
same amount of eyeballs yeah well that's

02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:50.559
the other thing to do and that kind of

02:16:50.559 --> 02:16:52.319
corporate structure that

02:16:52.319 --> 02:16:54.160
it really is like

02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:55.760
there's like a fear of innovation and

02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:58.559
[ __ ] it's [ __ ] wild how

02:16:58.559 --> 02:17:00.479
how much that regret the progress on

02:17:00.479 --> 02:17:02.559
that economic front where it regresses

02:17:02.559 --> 02:17:04.399
all the good things because

02:17:04.399 --> 02:17:05.920
now we don't want anything independent

02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:08.160
of the consensus i i the one thing i

02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:09.679
really despise because this from being

02:17:09.679 --> 02:17:11.359
that [ __ ] cult

02:17:11.359 --> 02:17:13.679
i i despise when i would have somebody

02:17:13.679 --> 02:17:15.760
monitoring what i'm reading or looking

02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:18.160
at like i'll look at it and decide like

02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:20.080
you know i i'll decide if i want to

02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:23.359
drink fish tank water to cure my right

02:17:23.359 --> 02:17:25.280
i'm probably not going to do it

02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:26.880
i don't like this thing of like no we

02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:28.399
can't take a chance you're too stupid

02:17:28.399 --> 02:17:29.760
like you don't know me [ __ ]

02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:31.840
patronizing yeah but that's the i've

02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:33.599
seen that up close for many many years

02:17:33.599 --> 02:17:34.960
especially like working in hollywood

02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:36.719
[ __ ] is like peop you could tell where

02:17:36.719 --> 02:17:38.479
people came especially in the industry

02:17:38.479 --> 02:17:39.679
side

02:17:39.679 --> 02:17:41.439
it's rare for them not to be like these

02:17:41.439 --> 02:17:43.200
privileged like twits

02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:44.639
and the way they think about like but

02:17:44.639 --> 02:17:46.399
you know people are stupid and we have

02:17:46.399 --> 02:17:47.200
to do

02:17:47.200 --> 02:17:49.280
like i hate that

02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:51.280
that's i guess that's what upper class

02:17:51.280 --> 02:17:54.080
[ __ ] is is knowing not to say the unsaid

02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:54.960
parts

02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:56.639
and low classes when you blurt out

02:17:56.639 --> 02:17:58.080

the kind of

02:18:04.639 --> 02:18:06.479
social class economic class that you've

02:18:06.479 --> 02:18:08.800
