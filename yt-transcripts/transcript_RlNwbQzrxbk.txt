00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.519
level

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.000
if he wants to go uh you say small

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.959
government with this guy

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.720
oh i hope he's i want him i want to feel

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.920
the effects of him immediately

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:25.680
comptroller you don't want to wait for

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.799
this thing to get through a bunch of

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:27.599
different uh

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.599
i don't want the big channels i don't

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.440
want the swamp taking over taking out my

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.480
champion yeah

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.760
he's the type of that will drain the

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.840
swamp he's fine

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.000
he probably has drained the swamp that's

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.280
right

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.640
that's why he's all strong and why he

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.959
could [ __ ] but yeah so i'm saying with

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.239
the ones that are real where there's a

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.519
woman actually getting

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:46.400
bummed down on that show because we

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.440
already found out there's like the fake

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.879
names of the comics in the episode i

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:49.599
brought up

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.440
i know a bunch of them are fake if not

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.680
most but there's got to be a few that

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.239
are

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.680
yeah the concept had to have started

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.360
with a real thing there is definitely a

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.040
woman whose

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.959
solution to the biggest problem in her

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.360
personal life was calling cheaters

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.280
and being like i got a live one are you

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.360
sitting down is clark gable there

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.959
for this i actually believe that's what

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.040
i'm saying this cute little 19 year old

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.159
because

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:13.599
that's the stupidity of someone that

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:14.799
would call a show to have someone

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.320
investigated three months in the dating

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.720
limb

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.239
yeah do you know what i mean yeah that's

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.600
like a 19 year old girl you're like yeah

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.560
probably

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.000
like i think he's cheating on me because

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.919
probably you should split up yeah it's

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.320
break up break up now bail go more than

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.600
like more than likely miss

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.440
well we left on was um i know well we

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.199
left for well we should say we are live

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.960
today obviously on wednesday

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.199
um we went to comedy camp went to comedy

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.800
camp with robert kelly

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.000
very fun very very fun yeah more fun

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.280
than i thought it was going to be i must

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.840
say

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.880
but also i kind of should have seen the

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.680
idea

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.560
of the grouping that was going genuinely

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.919
going for a crazy

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.639
multi-mile hike was going to fall apart

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:55.919
i should have felt more confident than

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.120
that and i and i

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.639
i'm happy it worked out that way but i

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.479
didn't like the anxiety build up they

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:00.960
sounded

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.000
like you were going to go on a

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.080
multi-mile putt or hike

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.160
yeah very much up until the hour was you

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.520
don't have to go which kept hurting my

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.320
feelings

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.919
first of all when robert kelly looks you

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.039
and he keeps going goes dude it's not

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:11.919
that bad

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.280
you'll be fine i pray and you're like

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.440
yeah bobby yes

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.840
i know it relatively i'll be fine i will

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.479
be fine

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:19.840
i know i'm gonna and i'm gonna live

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.320
through this but i mean uh it's just

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.160
i don't see what's that i mean to me

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.960
it's swatting bugs non-stop

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.759
and itching and different versions of

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:30.960

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.560
those woods

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.160
yeah apparently you go hiking down the

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.519
wrong trail you come back a different

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:37.200
person

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.880
it's not the becky we knew it's a

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.720
different becky

that was

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.600
like your campfire's not supposed to

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.240
hurt you the campers

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.680
and then already started throwing in

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.080
hedge it was it became a whole thing

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.680
there really there was there was natural

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.279
born killers on that

00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:58.959
then there was a werewolf on our table

00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:00.480
that everyone was saying was a raccoon

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.000
but that was definitely aware that was

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:02.959
mr raccoon

00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:04.240
why are they agreeing with this you

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.640

00:20:37.919 --> 00:20:39.280
[ __ ] up and we're just

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.799
kind of laughing along at the end didn't

00:20:40.799 --> 00:20:42.799
realize you eaten by a bear

00:20:42.799 --> 00:20:44.960
we're like look at this guy you don't

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.919
think that's funny

00:20:45.919 --> 00:20:47.760
yeah i mean it's great that he died i

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.960
don't think it's funny that a man

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.840
believes

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.240
that a bear is his friend uh no that

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.039
bear kills him

00:20:53.039 --> 00:20:54.400
you don't think that's [ __ ] i do

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.760
think it's [ __ ] sweet the sweet sweet

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.200
justice of nature it is natural

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:57.840
selection

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.039
but when we were watching it when you

00:20:59.039 --> 00:21:03.840
hear the idea you're like all right okay

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.440
there's nothing funnier than seeing a

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.600
wing suit person crash into a mountain

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.000
yeah or a [ __ ] base jumpers shoot not

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:12.799
open up

00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:15.120
i'm just like exactly you [ __ ] doof

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.159
it was because

00:21:16.159 --> 00:21:17.919
you're chasing me no but you're chasing

00:21:17.919 --> 00:21:19.440
the adrenaline of that like that's the

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.240
stupidity

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.080
well that's that's you know what you're

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.120
i don't know what you're chasing is that

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.159
this could possibly be

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:25.440
in the same line of thought i don't

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.520
think it should be like it's so

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.520
tragic it's like no he did he did that

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.960
himself dude that

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.480
mccluskey or whatever as we talked about

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.000
here before but that documentary man

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.440
where the guy

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.520
base jumped landed and then the park

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.600
rangers chased him into the

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.760
like the creek and his parachute got

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.280
tangled up and he ended up drowning and

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.280
they blamed like the forest rangers for

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.360
chasing him for doing an illegal base

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.960
jump so they did a demonstration of base

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.000
jumping

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.240
and then like they were they were

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.120
landing

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.799
on parachutes and waiting to be arrested

00:21:54.799 --> 00:21:55.760
the cops were all there was a

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.280
demonstration and the cops are arresting

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.039
everybody that's their

00:21:59.039 --> 00:22:01.679
act of civil defiance and dude and it's

00:22:01.679 --> 00:22:02.640
like the fifth we're gonna see him

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.679
arresting somebody and this one in the

00:22:03.679 --> 00:22:06.000
background just goes

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.240

i don't know i saw you start aiming for

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.360
try to grab runnings

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.600

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:14.880
in water

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.200
that's gonna murder you also yeah water

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.000

00:23:19.679 --> 00:23:22.000
you almost as hard as concrete

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.559
at that at that speed but i really don't

00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:26.240
i don't feel bad i mean i feel bad for

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.000
the families of people who lost people

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.440
to that but i mean as a person like

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.039
you're a [ __ ]

00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:32.240
now the whole time you're rooting for

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.640
the bears to get them in grizzly man

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.320

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.840
me my friend kept making is like and he

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.440
goes back and has a job

where he just talks about his friends

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.240
with bears and you're like all right

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.919
dude and then at the end we're like

00:23:43.919 --> 00:23:45.520
it's clearly funny he got eaten by a

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.440
bear but i'm saying you listened to

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.039

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:50.960
oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ]

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.120

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.880
fights in action movies are always like

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.720
big noise like and then you see a real

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.000

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.400
there is a there's a brutality to it

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.919
where you're like to hear a man scream

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.240

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.120
sadness of not having it on video is

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.279
yesterday having that football catch

00:24:19.279 --> 00:24:20.880

00:24:22.799 --> 00:24:25.120
and dan starts out just showing me he's

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.000
showing me his uh

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.080
over the middle like tight end passing

00:24:37.279 --> 00:24:38.559
the best is it was one of those really

00:24:38.559 --> 00:24:40.640
cheap it wasn't a pig skin it was one of

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.840
the cheap plastic ones you get at the

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:42.480
grocery store

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.320

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.440
noise of the rubber

the course like how far would you go to

00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:52.880
get tickets for your show i think

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.240
well it just doesn't i think christine

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.760
should be honored

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.320
you should be i think this man is

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.679
looking at it wrong i think brandon's

00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:03.039
looking at it from a negative aspect i

00:28:03.039 --> 00:28:03.600
think it

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.200
shows how much he's a fan of yours and

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.039
how beautiful christine is yeah that he

00:28:07.039 --> 00:28:09.279
could still arrive to orgasm

00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:11.520
uh of course did he say yes at first

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.720
yeah he said yes

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.159
but he's calling to apologize for saying

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:16.880
yes yeah now you get more upset

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.279

he'll be funny but the funniest part of

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.480
that is if he goes because i wouldn't uh

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.240

would have been fine but it was the

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.240

deep waters when i was busting that

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.840
russian joke out around minute 67.

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:31.120
i was like new york

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.279
how does this go how did this [ __ ] go

00:30:33.279 --> 00:30:35.360
i had a helium one time i didn't see the

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.240
light

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.640
it was an hour 45 or something i did

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.360
jesus

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.480
right yeah it was like a lot it was long

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.159
it was really long and it was a

00:30:44.159 --> 00:30:45.760
situation where it was like a thing

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.279
where they were like why did you

00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:50.159
like why did you i go i swear to god if

00:30:50.159 --> 00:30:50.399
you

00:30:50.399 --> 00:30:52.880
told me my headlines could be 30 minutes

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.159
i would do that

00:30:54.159 --> 00:30:56.320
but i do 45 minutes because i'm like

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.399
well it seems contractual obligation no

00:30:58.399 --> 00:30:59.679
that's what a fair show

00:30:59.679 --> 00:31:01.120
yeah and by the way it's nothing to do

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.000
with like not wanting to do it for the

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.240
crowd like i worry that i just people

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.440
lose steam and giving a [ __ ] that i'm

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.320
funny after that i'm

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.640
sure i hope they don't but i'd always

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.679
rather hit them

00:31:09.679 --> 00:31:11.440
i know for a half hour i can keep you

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.760
like if i'm concisely doing a half hour

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.399
set

00:31:14.399 --> 00:31:16.880
i can keep you like at [ __ ] 10 the

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.000
whole way but you know

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.799
you have to pace more for uh yeah for

00:31:20.799 --> 00:31:22.559
even that other just 15 minutes you know

00:31:22.559 --> 00:31:23.600
i mean like uh

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.880
and even not so much that's why i could

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.200
like do 45 and it usually stretches took

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.399
an hour sometime you know i mean if

00:31:28.399 --> 00:31:29.679
you're having a good time what minute

00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:32.240
did they hit you with the stretch with

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.760
i don't even know i couldn't even guess

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.519
uh i don't think it's 45

00:31:35.519 --> 00:31:36.720
yeah i don't think the time was being

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.640
taken very well there anyway because for

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.360
a first

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.360
for the first time in a long time i felt

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.799
like moments and the sets were all fun

00:31:42.799 --> 00:31:43.919
all the shows were great by the way

00:31:43.919 --> 00:31:45.440

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.440
a while though yeah

i did have that on a couple of the shows

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.840
where i thought it was up to kind of

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:52.480
long but

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.559
maybe maybe not i don't know i'm not

00:31:54.559 --> 00:31:56.399
sure but it was a collector's cup

00:31:56.399 --> 00:32:00.159

allow people to accept

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.919

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.200
afraid of black people

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.040
at all jay i was [ __ ] laughing about

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:34.000
it he's terrified of blacks

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.200
it was a ton of people there what a time

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.240
to do it by the way

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.760
that's why he was doing it it was like i

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.879
thought he was doing it to be like yo

00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:50.320
i'm getting a tip jar started and i was

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.919
like hey [ __ ] hilarious and that's

00:34:51.919 --> 00:34:53.760
why i threw five like oh i don't

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.000
was it a joke or was he doing that like

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.119
behind someone's back

00:34:57.119 --> 00:34:58.400
i shouldn't be doing it i took it as

00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.680
like a joking thing that's why i gave

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.040
him five i was like [ __ ] yeah

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.560
i think he was joking and then just

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.079
didn't i think it was weird

00:35:04.079 --> 00:35:06.079
is he allowed to he's here no he's not

00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:08.079
he's obviously not allowed to

00:35:08.079 --> 00:35:09.680
i was taking into account he's allowed

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.359
to do it yeah are we allowed to just

00:35:11.359 --> 00:35:13.200
like masturbate in the hallways now

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.800
are we allowed are he was like a flood

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.320
of people and he was doing it like hey

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.520
because he knows us he always says

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.800
what's up to us when we walk in he goes

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.079
yo i'm getting a tip that's why i was

00:35:22.079 --> 00:35:22.720
like hey

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.599
and that's why when you walked away

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:25.440
you're like the audacious in fairness

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.839
maybe i missed the game

00:35:27.839 --> 00:35:29.440
i thought he was directly asking me to

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.880
give him

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.440
a joke that's all he showed a joke he i

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.480
was the i was the one in front

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.520
he shows it up he goes i'm getting a

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.359
chip tip jar started i go oh yeah he's

00:35:37.359 --> 00:35:39.359
getting the tip jar started in that case

00:35:39.359 --> 00:35:41.839
bam and i put a five man maybe i read it

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:43.839
totally wrong can i say this yeah

00:35:43.839 --> 00:35:46.720
i do think it was a joke that could

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:47.280
easily

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.200
be confused as not a joke yeah

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.960
especially because i was confused with

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:51.680
your reaction

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.800
we were laughing about it and then when

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.839
you walked away like can you believe you

00:35:53.839 --> 00:35:55.119
did that i was like he was like kind of

00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:56.160
like a joke because there's all these

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.000
people in the [ __ ] lobby

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.480
yeah but it's a that's a bad joke do you

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.400
think he was just trying to get money

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.960
i mean i do think he was joking yeah but

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.520
he wrote on the tip

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.520
questions are ten dollars like this is

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.040
five dollars so

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.320
he's probably set it up like let me try

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.960
to get but well listen

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.400
nothing was said to him so there's no

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.079
harm no foul but yeah i didn't

00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:19.200
understand there was a joke happening

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.800
there i thought it was a guy asking for

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.200
tickets

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.599
oh he said five dollar admission yeah

00:36:23.599 --> 00:36:24.560
because i think he knew

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.720
i didn't see the sign what the sign says

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.400
they said like zero was uh

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.000
question it was like a scale it's like

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.599
one to five zero to five yeah but then

00:36:31.599 --> 00:36:32.079
when we

00:36:32.079 --> 00:36:32.240
we we we we we we we we we we we we we

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.440

right inside it was a little nowhere

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.200
near the level nowhere near the level of

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.079
anger i had though

00:36:48.079 --> 00:36:49.440
for it should have not been okay i

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.960

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:51.839
happening at all i

00:36:51.839 --> 00:36:53.359

00:50:37.119 --> 00:50:37.839
had a few other

00:50:37.839 --> 00:50:41.119
miles away a couple ballots yeah the

00:50:41.119 --> 00:50:42.400
ballads for sure i was more interested

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.119
in the whole winger catalogue

00:50:45.119 --> 00:50:46.880
i took winger's look because he he came

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.400
he was the first guy with long hair with

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:49.920
scruff

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.079
no one had that he started that so then

00:50:52.079 --> 00:50:54.720
yeah then i

00:51:00.559 --> 00:51:02.800
the baby faces with the long hair no one

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.000
was doing yeah like any kind of like

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.040
beard with it

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:06.400
yeah so he came out with a scruff

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.599
because they were always clean shaving

00:51:07.599 --> 00:51:09.200
all those those hair metal dudes can you

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.319
bring them up

00:51:10.319 --> 00:51:12.319
and then he had that scruff and chicks

00:51:12.319 --> 00:51:13.839
went crazy

00:51:13.839 --> 00:51:16.160

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.760
everything's bad about it why does this

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.119
guy clean shave face

00:54:19.119 --> 00:54:20.880
i never man if you're fat you got to do

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:22.400
the beard yeah he would look cooler with

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.119
a beard

00:54:23.119 --> 00:54:25.760
even bruce valanche looks better with a

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:26.480
beard

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.240
yeah he really does so much better with

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.920
a beard then he looks like an old lady

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:32.640
yeah like when he shaved off this guy i

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:33.599
mean

00:54:33.599 --> 00:54:35.440
pick one of the chins and grow some hair

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:38.160
on it i don't care if it's the neck one

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.920
or the one that's a little bit under his

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:41.760
lips because one of them needs some hair

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.040
on it to give some definition there's a

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:44.160
jawline existing

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.720
well if he's you know he looks younger

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:48.319
without the beard so if he's trying to

00:54:48.319 --> 00:54:49.680
go after 12 year olds

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:52.559
but he's only 19. oh he's only 19. yeah

00:54:52.559 --> 00:54:54.160
but he looks like 930 is getting in

00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:55.599
trouble for this

00:54:55.599 --> 00:54:57.839
yeah well she's 12. it let the kid swing

00:54:57.839 --> 00:54:59.119

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.960
who's trending upwards is that guy's

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.640
wearing your shirt is that sure he's

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.160

and he gets popped and you're like [ __ ]

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:19.839
that is funny it's like robinson home

00:55:19.839 --> 00:55:21.359

gave him a [ __ ] shirt

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:28.480
he's all given through himself if you're

00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:29.920
great if it was like watch me grow day

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:31.520
care center yeah

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:42.240
shirt um

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:44.640
so where we're at is him almost there

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.000
essentially following the [ __ ]

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.680
talking chris back into letting him and

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:49.440
chris christina goes you know what i'm

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.040
going to let you [ __ ]

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:52.799
i'd never do this this is the first time

00:55:52.799 --> 00:55:54.319
i've ever seen chris hansen start to

00:55:54.319 --> 00:55:55.040
feel

00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.720
he said he had to remind himself over

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.319
and over again that if

00:55:58.319 --> 00:56:00.240
we weren't doing a sting and this was

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:01.520
working out for him that he was about to

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.960
[ __ ] a 12 year old

00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:06.880
to make him stop

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:09.359
to make him stop feeling like ah you

00:56:09.359 --> 00:56:11.760
poor [ __ ] because this guy

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.839
unravels immediately when he sits the

00:56:13.839 --> 00:56:16.319
table and he actually feels bad for him

00:56:16.319 --> 00:56:18.240
he said he starts to feel big you can't

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.160
help but not again the fact that he is

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:20.880
19

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:23.359
as much as you hate to say it like you

00:56:23.359 --> 00:56:24.480
you forgive it a little more than it

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:26.559
being like a 50 year old or something or

00:56:26.559 --> 00:56:27.760
30 or 40 year old

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:30.640
because he's a he's a loser who's never

00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:31.839
had a chance at anything

00:56:31.839 --> 00:56:33.200
you know what i mean yeah he feels like

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.400
such a loser he's like this is the only

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.920
person that can like

00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.359
convince to like me you know what i'm

00:56:37.359 --> 00:56:39.280
saying but it's evil

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.520
so [ __ ] him but it is funny how chris

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:42.880
anson has to almost be like

00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:45.200
hey champ hey you're getting more out

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.119

chances are i won't be there i'll

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.880
probably be retired worried about my own

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:01.920

let's talk about luke perry

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:31.280
well i just heard this from jay on the

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:32.560
commercial break i heard over the

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.480
weekend the story but he was buried in a

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.560
mushroom suit

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:39.120
which is like i guess it's organic and

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.960
then what just in the ground

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:42.719
you're basically putting like they put

01:12:42.719 --> 01:12:44.080
you in a

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:47.040
black suit covered with spores mushroom

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:47.679
spores

01:12:47.679 --> 01:12:50.320
and it decomposes your body at a fast

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:50.880
pace

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:53.520
they put you in this giant wicker basket

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:54.560
and so it's very

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:57.040
uh good for the environment was he a

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.199
witch

01:12:59.199 --> 01:13:02.159
who does this right now and also much

01:13:02.159 --> 01:13:03.600
it's much cheaper

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.600
to do than burying can cost anywhere

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.120
from like eight thousand to twenty

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.400
thousand then cremating

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.520
what do you think all that what do you

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:12.239
think all that 90210 money went man

01:13:12.239 --> 01:13:15.120
it saves a lot of it saves it's good for

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:16.480
the environment but how does that he's

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.840
still going in the ground than that how

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.199
much is that gonna cost

01:13:19.199 --> 01:13:21.120
i think this is around five five

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.040
thousand oh wait hold on these eggs can

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:24.800

cremated

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:47.600
probably cremated yeah cremator's the

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.040
way to go yeah except i heard some

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.560
[ __ ] up [ __ ] that when you're cremated

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:51.760
that you know it's happening you know

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:52.719
you sit up

01:16:52.719 --> 01:16:55.360
i heard some of the bodies can sit up no

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:56.960
it's like a pizza oven you can't sit up

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:57.280
well

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.280
it's like they have to try like no they

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:03.840
can first do just like clunky

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.880
this was told to me by a friend but they

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:09.040
said that that is the opening scene to i

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.480
believe it's

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:12.480
night of the living dead the remake i

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.280
believe that's what happens in the

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.640
beginning try to cremate a guy and he

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:15.440
sits up

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:16.320
are you talking about that is that the

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:19.040
science you're working on

01:17:19.199 --> 01:17:21.280
george harbor romero are you working on

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:22.400
romero science

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:24.480
what's going on no someone said that it

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:26.320
like hits a nerve in your back

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:28.840
or in your in your hips and it makes the

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:30.400
body

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.480
combined with body parts separating the

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.159
course of cremation easily prevents for

01:17:34.159 --> 01:17:35.890
stories of bodies sitting up

01:17:35.890 --> 01:17:37.360
[Music]

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.840
uh and a funeral pyro for performing a

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:41.440
variety of movements

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:42.719
the bodies do move and create the

01:17:42.719 --> 01:17:45.040
movements

01:17:47.199 --> 01:17:48.640

yeah you're dead either way yeah i just

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.320
kept thinking about like how weird it is

01:17:58.320 --> 01:17:59.600
if you're just at work and you start

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.360
creaming your body in a baby and a body

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:01.840

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.520
like a guy who cares about wearing a

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.040
mushroom suit that looks like a guy that

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:13.520

do dirt play

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.480
that do want to go to that but just to

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:41.600

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:10.880
yeah your ashes are right under a tree

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:12.639
there so it's probably how much does it

01:23:12.639 --> 01:23:13.120
cost

01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:15.840
500 bucks so yeah it's just the urn

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:17.199
you're just paying for 500

01:23:17.199 --> 01:23:18.639
i thought we were getting a process

01:23:18.639 --> 01:23:19.760
where they're going to pull me out of

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:21.040
some weird thing and like i gotta be

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:21.920
honest with you

01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:24.719
i'm kind of a fluid

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:26.960
we all thought that jake if you thought

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:28.480
that a little bit

01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:30.159
he's currently he's currently in the

01:23:30.159 --> 01:23:31.840
preceding process

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.639
yes we're lubing up his body for

01:23:34.639 --> 01:23:39.040
insertion this is when we rectify his

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:42.159
handling i don't even want it anymore i

01:23:42.159 --> 01:23:44.960
don't want to get cremated

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:46.840
there goes me hugging that tree going hi

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:48.480

kicked you into the hudson and just

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:52.639
shoot you with flaming arrows i would do

01:23:52.639 --> 01:23:53.440
that

01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:55.520
they should offer that put my body on it

01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:57.199
put my body on a raft and have someone

01:23:57.199 --> 01:23:58.080
shoot a [ __ ]

01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:00.400
flaming arrow to light it up what if you

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.400
what if you [ __ ] have that weird

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.840

your chest

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:17.280

holding the tree yeah i know like what

01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:20.320
if someone's walking their dog

01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:22.239
and it's pissing on the tree that's my

01:24:22.239 --> 01:24:24.080

in his head hit the ground it'll

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:45.360
definitely make some sort of a hipster

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:47.120
legal case though where they would stop

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:48.800
if someone did that like you carved your

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:50.320
name into my father

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.639
my father tree i bet that would be a

01:24:52.639 --> 01:24:54.239
joke or if they're gonna cut it down

01:24:54.239 --> 01:24:56.239
they'd have to hear that case yeah it's

01:24:56.239 --> 01:24:57.840
like too emotional because some of my

01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:58.719
dad's

01:24:58.719 --> 01:25:00.400

01:25:28.639 --> 01:25:29.679
tree grove

01:25:29.679 --> 01:25:31.120
if you had the taxidermy done where his

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:33.040
hand was over his mouth so he's like

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:35.360

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:37.040
oopsy

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:40.000
did i do something it's a great oak and

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.199
if someone goes visit

01:25:41.199 --> 01:25:42.719
they ride a bike they just park it right

01:25:42.719 --> 01:25:45.199

perfect oh

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:51.040
[ __ ] dude i mean i think we're on to

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:52.080
this i really want to see

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.840
can you hire someone to do a viking

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.760
funeral there's no way

01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:57.760
there's got to be i mean you know on

01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:58.880
other countries i'm sure it's very

01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:00.320
probably if you go to new zealand i bet

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:02.159
they don't give a [ __ ] or we're sweet

01:26:02.159 --> 01:26:04.480
australia they're like yeah i don't know

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:09.679
i'll shoot you

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.560
can you have a viking funeral it is it

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:14.639
generally isn't illegal to dispose of a

01:26:14.639 --> 01:26:17.360
dead body in that manner an alternative

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:20.239
might be to have the body cremated dorks

01:26:20.239 --> 01:26:22.239
then do a ceremonial viking funeral

01:26:22.239 --> 01:26:25.040
no the deceased would just be in an urn

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:25.679
[ __ ] you

01:26:25.679 --> 01:26:28.000
i want the real deal now i'm wondering

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.199
why it's illegal

01:26:29.199 --> 01:26:30.639
because you can't just dump a body in

01:26:30.639 --> 01:26:32.320
the river you're not dumping it

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:33.440
christine you're

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:36.760
sending it to valhalla

01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:41.570
[Laughter]

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.840

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.840

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:14.400
sleeping

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:15.920
above me and kristen because you're in

01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:17.840

and mike uh making that noise i said he

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:27.040

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:37.920
knowledge of manowar is you just broke

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:39.520
the record of decibels with someone's

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:39.840

they did a big like

01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:41.119
thing at the end what's the big deal

01:36:41.119 --> 01:36:43.280
what the curtain call is it was uh

01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:46.320
before kevin nash and scott hall left to

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:46.719

01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.679
right yeah right they were in different

01:36:59.679 --> 01:37:01.440
matches all together but it was what

01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:03.600
they it was their enemies their enemies

01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:05.280
in on the show and then they came out

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:06.400
and did like a

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:08.239
four guys hugging and going up on the

01:37:08.239 --> 01:37:10.080
cage and like you know yeah showing this

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:11.440
like sign of like brotherhood and like

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:13.119
saying goodbye to those two guys

01:37:13.119 --> 01:37:14.800
and they were like in a lot of trouble

01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:16.000
for that and you're almost like why who

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:16.480
gives it but

01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:19.679
crazy children watch this and want to

01:37:19.679 --> 01:37:20.080
believe

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:21.679
in it like you're showing like you're

01:37:21.679 --> 01:37:23.119
just showing everybody what actually was

01:37:23.119 --> 01:37:24.719
actually was what really

01:37:24.719 --> 01:37:26.000
is something that's real that happened

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.440
because of that which is crazy which no

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:29.040
one knows is hunter host helmsley was

01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:30.320
supposed to win king of the ring that

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:30.639
year

01:37:30.639 --> 01:37:33.040
he was scheduled to win ring uh win king

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:34.080
of the ring this is on bruce pritchard's

01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:35.280
podcast they talk about it

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:37.840
on something to wrestle triple h was

01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:38.719
supposed to win

01:37:38.719 --> 01:37:40.400
this like big tournament or whatever and

01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:42.239
then he came out to say goodbye to scott

01:37:42.239 --> 01:37:43.520
hall and kevin nash

01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:45.600
with uh sean michaels and x-pock and

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:46.880
they did that's the click that's what

01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:47.520
they were called

01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:50.080
it was before the match happened it was

01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:51.440
at the end of the night it was the last

01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:51.920
match

01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:53.920
it was a dark match it wasn't on tv they

01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:55.119
just came out to do it

01:37:55.119 --> 01:37:58.000
and uh it pissed off vince mcmahon that

01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.760
instead of letting triple h win the king

01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:01.360
of the ring stone cold steve austin won

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:02.719
it and that's what launched stone cold

01:38:02.719 --> 01:38:04.080
like stone cold that was like the

01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:05.520
beginning of him being the [ __ ]

01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:06.639
biggest thing in the business

01:38:06.639 --> 01:38:08.800
that's so funny how big triple h is in

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.320
wrestling now for getting in trouble

01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:11.679

01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:15.600
that steroid trial in like night

01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:16.000
whatever

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.800
the 90s was that wrestling was fake yeah

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:20.239

man had to admit it for something they

01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:23.600
get off on the steroid charges because

01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:24.800
he was in on it because they were saying

01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:26.400
it wasn't a sport it wasn't an actual

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:28.320
sporting event it was a predetermined
