00:14:09.199 --> 00:14:11.440
have once she died i did a deep dive

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.360
into her tweets to decide whether or not

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.120
i should be so it was justified yes once

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.040
i found out that i had seen what she had

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.959
said yes wait so she was saying like

00:14:18.959 --> 00:14:20.399
weird [ __ ]

00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:21.279
no

00:14:21.279 --> 00:14:23.839
i'm just joking oh she was just shot uh

00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:25.120
accidentally they gave her like they

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.560
gave somebody like they gave him a real

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.360
gun

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.519
with bullets it wasn't blanks no it was

00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:31.360
real bullets what the [ __ ] gave him a

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.920
real gun and he just was like pop

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.839
point blank yeah where'd he hit her in

00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:37.839
the chest i'm not sure

00:14:37.839 --> 00:14:40.240
not good though that's what i will say

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.480
that's terrible it's really terrible yes

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.760
i saw that and i saw like i saw someone

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.880
now i'm not gonna be one of those guys

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.000
that's like

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.079
don't make fun of it because it is just

00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:51.920

gleeful no you're something that happens

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.519
like puppy research i saw that knowing

00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:00.720
yes

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.279
yes yeah you liked it oh i love anything

00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:04.560
dude and i'll just be honest i just

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.639
don't like falci for probably the uses

00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:07.839
of my algorithm

00:15:07.839 --> 00:15:09.360
also he you know he probably also did

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.639
kind of he seems like he's been lying

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:12.560
this whole time um that's how i was with

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.279
penn state with the child right

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:17.440
yeah exactly i was i was a giddy yeah

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.279
exactly this is a very penn state

00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:20.800
situation

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.399
it's dude they're coming out now being

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:23.600
like yeah

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.639
you know

00:15:24.639 --> 00:15:26.959
the eco health alliance did do gain of

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:28.480
functions research but fauci didn't know

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.759
about they're doing fountains yeah joe

00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:31.920
didn't know basically joe didn't know

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.279
and then she's just gonna have to die of

00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:35.360
lung cancer in like a month i'm gonna

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.959
tear it down i'm not going i'm not gonna

00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:39.199
be part of this i'm done dude shout out

00:15:39.199 --> 00:15:41.199
to joe paw for that apparently the eco

00:15:41.199 --> 00:15:43.199
health alliance tried to sell the virus

00:15:43.199 --> 00:15:45.040
to darpa

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.880
which apparently is like people were

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.560
like yeah no they did try to do that and

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.839
darpa was like

00:15:49.839 --> 00:15:51.519
we're cool with this yeah we don't want

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:52.639
this [ __ ] we don't want to use this

00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:54.240
buy as a bio weapon they're right well i

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.000
don't know anything that's going on i

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.040
don't think it's impossible to

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.560
understand i'm just going all from rogan

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.240
podcast dude it's time he's been the

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.639
king rogan's still the rock dude i went

00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:04.079
back to i was listening to rogan last

00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:05.759
night i was listening to sanjay gupta

00:16:05.759 --> 00:16:07.920
did you see that yeah i mean i had seen

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.079
it i'd seen clips and i'd heard clips

00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:11.120
but then i listened to the whole thing

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.480
did you see the boy right before he had

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.800
on before gupta no who was it this other

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.160
guy he was he used to work for the new

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.160
york times and he got kicked off

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.240
for just looking into the covet stuff

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.440
dude's a man

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.279
really he's a good boy i don't like any

00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:25.199
of those journals no he's a good boy you

00:16:25.199 --> 00:16:26.959
got good boys they're just with sub

00:16:26.959 --> 00:16:28.720
stacks they're usually good boys

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.160
you get kicked off you get a substance

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.759
he was a substitute

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:33.279
some people have some sticks they're

00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:35.360
pretty bad that are bad during us really

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.279
that are my least favorite journals

00:16:37.279 --> 00:16:38.399
really yeah

00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:41.199
if you get a sub stack dude that's just

00:16:41.199 --> 00:16:42.800
yeah yeah i hear you though it's like

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.040
having a patreon true you could be an

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.959
elite baller but yeah i was if you watch

00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:48.639
those two back to back dude i'd watch

00:16:48.639 --> 00:16:49.680
those two

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.519
and uh

00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:53.120
my mother-in-law called me to get some

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.720
scoop she's like matt i gotta know like

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.800
how do you feel about this she's pissed

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.720
i haven't got the jab yet allegedly

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.079
really yeah

00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:01.600
so she called me be like i was you know

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.240
like what why dude i was like six hours

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.160
of just interviews deep and i was like

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.079
well

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:10.240
yeah it felt pretty good yeah yeah yeah

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.160
felt good i'm like you know i'm not a

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.600
i'm not slamming the lady she's she

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.439
watched a lot of cnn so i was able to

00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:16.400
hit like did you hear about i was

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.240
listening to sanjay gupta and he had

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.919
some decent points i don't think i don't

00:17:19.919 --> 00:17:21.760
think the pro

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.079
vax people are totally wrong no it's for

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:25.839
geezers

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.240
it's it's a gene therapy that geezers

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.760
can go get if they want that young

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.360
people probably you know if they want to

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.360
get it they can they shouldn't be forced

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.200
yeah i just stand with kyrie irving bro

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.480
that's all kyrie russell i'm a big big

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.320
bad floyd mayweather came out supporting

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.280
yeah dude

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.240
so did so did chris brown all the bros

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.919
all the brothers dude

00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:45.520
it's not good those are two dudes that

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.960
have smacked that [ __ ] up yeah this is

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.120
true yes they did but yeah a lot of a

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.280
lot of the bros are coming out and uh

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.760
and defending yeah man yeah kyrie gets a

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.280
lot of [ __ ] although he did believe the

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.960
earth was flat for a minute okay could

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.720
happen to anyone it could happen to

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.799
anyone

00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:05.039
yeah we're all an unprep dude we've all

00:18:05.039 --> 00:18:06.799
have like completely lost like a big

00:18:06.799 --> 00:18:10.080
sliver of sanity due to like

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.919
dude the [ __ ] uh yeah i watched uh

00:18:13.919 --> 00:18:15.280
[ __ ]

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.640
i can't get you out of my head again on

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.480
youtube yeah that final episode just

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.720
destroys me yeah i still don't know what

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.320
it's about i don't know it's the

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.320
algorithm dude it's dude i'm back to

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.000
that it's fully the algorithm yes we

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.120
need to stop worrying about the

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.720
algorithm guardian what the [ __ ] are you

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:29.840
doing

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.600
all right yeah we did we got sucked into

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.640
like just

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.559
military-grade information technology

00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:35.760
out of nowhere

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.600
facebook dude facebook's and i i think

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.039
facebook's fake imploding what do you

00:18:39.039 --> 00:18:40.000
think they're gonna change their name

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
too

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.440
you see that yeah i heard they're going

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.640
to change they're doing a little revamp

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.840
it's like a strip club where they get

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.120
like a shooting in the strip club and

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.720
they're like now we're club wizards

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.160
instead of atlanta yeah it's [ __ ]

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.960
[ __ ] club bullets yeah

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.720
you want to use that analogy but yeah

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:58.000
the um i think facebook

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.320
i have a theory about facebook i think

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.760
they are

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.280
i think they had were interfering with

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.440
the cia's ability to destabilize the

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.799
democracy like the things of their

00:19:06.799 --> 00:19:08.640
choosing so now their painting was like

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.160
no they're harmful to other democracies

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.520
right because dude it must [ __ ] them up

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.880
think of how bad they were they had they

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.440
could have with like regular cable news

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.720
they could have came and like like

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.919
slammed us but now like all the

00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:21.760
facebooks all the instagrams people like

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.120
it really gets information out there

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.960
people don't want so i think right now

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.240
they're saying like dude you read the

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.919
things about facebook

00:19:27.919 --> 00:19:29.600
just like facebook will come to congress

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.160
and they're like people use facebook to

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.080
do a bombing what do you guys got to say

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.480
for yourselves and they're like um we're

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.840
really sorry about this we're looking

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.280
into it yeah yeah yeah yeah they keep

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.440
getting crushed yeah like they used it

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.039
to like abduct women in yemen and

00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:44.640
they're going to be like being mad at

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.840
phones

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.640
yeah

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.559
being like hey the you know the boston

00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:49.679
bombers

00:19:49.679 --> 00:19:52.640
used a telephone to set off an ied or

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.760
something like that

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.400
this is att's fault yeah well i think no

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.000
it's not so now they're well they're

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.200
saying though that the government wants

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.720
to regulate facebook to make it like a

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.320
phone so they'd have full control over

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.200
it

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.799
so i think the government is kind of

00:20:04.799 --> 00:20:06.559
like yo this is i don't know i don't

00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:08.000
know anything about it i'm not i'm a

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.919
little torn on it i purely i use pure

00:20:09.919 --> 00:20:12.000
conjecture because when twitter banned

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.080
trump dog maybe it is time we break up

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.760
big tech here

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.159
you're gonna silence my dog

00:20:18.159 --> 00:20:20.400
we gotta go to the truth platform yeah

been going up i'm pretty sure they have

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.000

00:55:34.799 --> 00:55:36.799
out

factory

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.240
daniel craig and supermodels [ __ ] in

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.480
you told me about it and i got a toe in

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:08.240

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.160
male i see long hair and tits in my body

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.480
it's not even me my body's like oh yeah

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.160

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.520
penis and you go and you see a couple

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.000

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.480
when he's coming going

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.240
with long hair also he looks like a

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.079
hulka maniac

01:01:28.079 --> 01:01:29.359

01:01:29.359 --> 01:01:31.599
animal from muppets yeah it's no good

01:01:31.599 --> 01:01:32.799
yeah i don't know what it was man i

01:01:32.799 --> 01:01:34.400
think it was i think my psyche was

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.760
searching for completeness that's why it

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.040
was more of like a

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.319
collective unconscious thing where it

01:01:38.319 --> 01:01:39.599
was like i was tapping into this

01:01:39.599 --> 01:01:41.760
intelligence outside of myself yeah so i

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:42.880
needed to integrate where you're just

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.240
kind of whacking off that kind of gay

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.799
stuff i got it it's maybe but the fact

01:01:46.799 --> 01:01:48.480
that i'm not into it anymore

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.079
the fact that i mean you could you could

01:01:50.079 --> 01:01:51.359
put it down i'm like dude i'm like

01:01:51.359 --> 01:01:53.119
little nausax dude it's like you're

01:01:53.119 --> 01:01:54.640
you're you know you're hitting me with

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:57.039
uh your boozy badass dude i'm a bit of a

01:01:57.039 --> 01:01:57.330
[ __ ]

01:01:57.330 --> 01:01:59.920
[Laughter]

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:01.359
dude i'm telling you i think there's no

01:02:01.359 --> 01:02:03.200
i'm joking dude i call jack harlow i

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:04.799
think there's true you mean basically

01:02:04.799 --> 01:02:06.559
our little nonsex and jack harlow i

01:02:06.559 --> 01:02:07.680
would do i would definitely agree to

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.440
that i think there's way more dudes i

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.799
think it's a silent epidemic and i don't

01:02:10.799 --> 01:02:12.559
think this is a projection sign epidemic

01:02:12.559 --> 01:02:13.839
of dudes whacking this

01:02:13.839 --> 01:02:16.559
i think it's way more and i think the

01:02:16.559 --> 01:02:17.520
data

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:20.400
of web searches reflects this a lot of

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:35.039

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:12.000
here's the thing dude when i see when i

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.839
see black men going against the

01:06:13.839 --> 01:06:15.839
mainstream media narrative

01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:17.839
my instinct is to be like stop being

01:06:17.839 --> 01:06:19.920
white you black [ __ ] and agree with me

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.200
yeah yeah that's what they that's what

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.680
they do that's what guy dares to go off

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.680
the thing kyrie irving the white guy

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.839
dares to go away from like big corporate

01:06:27.839 --> 01:06:28.880
agenda

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:32.000
i justifiably say you [ __ ] white

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.160
piece of [ __ ] yes you're not black

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.280
anymore

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:37.039
that's what they do yeah they strip you

01:06:37.039 --> 01:06:39.359
of being black they try to align you

01:06:39.359 --> 01:06:41.280
literally the president said that yeah

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.799
if you don't vote for me you're not

01:06:42.799 --> 01:06:44.000
black

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.280
dude it's pretty crazy

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.640
it really makes you think when you watch

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:49.580
this podcast

01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:51.440
[Laughter]

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.119
i was like i saw we were joking about

01:06:53.119 --> 01:06:54.319
the capital stuff we're not going to

01:06:54.319 --> 01:06:55.760

01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:00.400
homosexual

um we're just gay as hell dude i hate

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.480
trump

01:07:05.119 --> 01:07:06.640
if he comes back dude it's going to be

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:07.760
just like dog comes back we're going to

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.760
be in groundhog's day forever until joe

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.280
biden and trump died that's what we're

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.880
in dude i told you i watched can't get

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:14.400
you out of my head again

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.640
every [ __ ] day we're in just

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.160
everyone's outrage not that you need a

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:19.520
documentary to notice everyone's

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.359
outraged every day but none of it's real

01:07:21.359 --> 01:07:23.520
no no one cares none of it is no one

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:24.799
none of it's real that's what chappelle

01:07:24.799 --> 01:07:26.240
was saying he's like dude no get none of

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:27.680
my gay friends are pissed yeah it's just

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.200
corporate interest this is this is the

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.559
fact i think isn't there something like

01:07:30.559 --> 01:07:32.160
twitter has like

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.920
millions of bots

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:36.000
there's a bunch of fake people just like

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.559
probably being paid to there's people go

01:07:38.559 --> 01:07:40.160
here's the narrative we want to push

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.000
here's the means to accomplish it and

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.280
they you can if you have enough money

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.640
dude you can literally you know like

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.799
warren buffett can sway the stock market

01:07:46.799 --> 01:07:49.280
if you have enough money you can enter

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.119
points of discourse and opinions and

01:07:51.119 --> 01:07:53.359
give them like a say and you know i

01:07:53.359 --> 01:07:54.880
think what was the stanley milgram

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:56.559
experiment with the obedience

01:07:56.559 --> 01:07:58.640
73 of people what was it i was thinking

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.559
about it 73 of people

01:08:00.559 --> 01:08:02.640
raised the electric shock to a near

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.240
fatal level because an expert was

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.760
telling yes so that's you know that's an

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.359
experiment but you could say easily

01:08:07.359 --> 01:08:08.720
conservatively i heard the stanford

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:10.559
prison experiment was a bit of a

01:08:10.559 --> 01:08:12.240
bit of a fraud oh it was great it was

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:13.920
but it was crazy yeah i heard they bsed

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:15.599
it but the milgram experiment wasn't it

01:08:15.599 --> 01:08:17.600
an old [ __ ] that did that one

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:18.960
most likely i mean that's that's they go

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:20.880
fantasy like i'm the boss you guys get

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:21.920
in here

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:24.799
god damn the industry baby's still up

01:08:24.799 --> 01:08:27.279
last thing i want to do is get a horny

01:08:27.279 --> 01:08:28.880
be honest with you

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:30.560
when you saw montero and like the ways

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:31.759
he moved his butt where you're like

01:08:31.759 --> 01:08:32.960
tricked into thinking it was a girl for

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:33.920
a second

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:35.920
little nah's ex is cute he's a cutie i'm

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.359

01:08:38.719 --> 01:08:41.679

these [ __ ] do i mean dude i don't

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.880

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:49.040
baby boy and i turned on tv and

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.880

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:57.839
but

01:08:57.839 --> 01:08:59.759
the trans community

01:08:59.759 --> 01:09:01.279
if anything

01:09:01.279 --> 01:09:04.480
