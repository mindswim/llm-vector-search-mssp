streaming

00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:41.519

i set up a sound board before before we

00:16:59.839 --> 00:17:01.600
go on with anything else if anyone was

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.720

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.839
um but i have a sound board

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.600
it took me hours to do this so listen to

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.120
this bad boy so there's the here's the

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.760
intro music

00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:16.470
it's coming in good

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:23.839
[Music]

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.280

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.720
thank you my brother

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.000
thank you my brother

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.559
[ __ ] yeah so any time

00:17:32.559 --> 00:17:34.240
someone donates or something i'll be

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.679
able to press this

00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:38.000
although having said that i just got an

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.320
email saying that someone here i believe

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.160
it was hannah from the skank skanks

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.000
donated five dollars

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.600
and her message was again

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.000
the dilemma continues

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.679
the live streaming

00:17:51.679 --> 00:17:54.480
and the donations and the chats

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.400
it all just gets a little bit too much

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.799
sometimes the conversation is still

00:17:58.799 --> 00:18:01.440
flowing and i'm doing my best

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.000
but then i'm distracted by all this [ __ ]

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.520
and i thought we had it finished so

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.200
thank you hannah listen

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.799
thank you my brother maybe i'll have to

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:09.760
get more of it brother is a

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:14.000
gender-neutral term by the way for me

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
maybe not thank you my brother

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.400
thank you my brother

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.640
yeah brother is gender neutral for me

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.160
except for i i i call everybody brother

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.440
you know

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.200
if they're white

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.640
and then i feel

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.960
if i'm talking to like a [ __ ]

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.160
sometimes i'm talking to a black guy

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.480
i tend to i i try not i don't sometimes

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.559
i won't say it because i

00:18:38.559 --> 00:18:40.640
i don't want him to think that i don't

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.720
say brother all the time and because

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.559
he's black

00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:46.559
i'm suddenly going yo

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:49.840
you know what's good my brother

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.200
you know so i don't want him to look at

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.200
me going look at this [ __ ] cracker

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.840
ass [ __ ]

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.320
trying to be cool

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.039
with the [ __ ] players

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:02.880
with the with the boys so sometimes i'll

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.120
just go yo dude

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.200
even though i say brother all the time

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.760
so in order to

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.919
prevent myself from almost coming across

00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:15.679
as pandering or racist i i do treat

00:19:15.679 --> 00:19:18.880
i act differently around people of color

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.799
the pox

00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:22.160
the big pucks

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.640
i act differently around them

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.880
out of awkwardness so i guess in many

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.840
ways you could say

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.640
i'm a little bit um

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.400
racist maybe is that is that does that

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.640
make sense

00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:41.600
am i a little bit racist because i i i

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.240
try not to i try not to be awkward

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.600
around black people

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.320
you know what i mean

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.200
oh excuse me

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.960
so hannah donated on the thing i don't

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.720
know if you guys want to keep donating

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.720

shoot your [ __ ] mouth just do nothing

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.320
so this is it

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.280
every week we're just leveling up slowly

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.360
little changes here and there there was

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.960
a time i didn't even have this in my

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.159
background

00:22:56.159 --> 00:22:57.919
this sound proofing that doesn't

00:22:57.919 --> 00:23:00.480
actually do any sound proofing it's 100

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.919
just to make it seem like i'm not in my

00:23:01.919 --> 00:23:04.320
bedroom

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.120
little [ __ ] trick in the trade

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.679
this is this is like a pro like a fake

00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:12.000
background

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.840
like when when you have a [ __ ] uh

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.039
sitcom

00:23:15.039 --> 00:23:16.480
and like there's only like you only see

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.760
half the kitchen

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.360
i mean all on the other side it's just

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.720
it's just all it's 100 bedroom oh my god

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.760
oh yo

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.679
[ __ ] melissa anne thank you my

00:23:25.679 --> 00:23:27.120

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.520
you want for 10 bucks

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.080
is that it

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.760
[Laughter]

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.360
most comics

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.120
most comics would have way too much

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.600
dignity to do things like that but i

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.720
personally i think the idea of even

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:50.000
talking to strangers is so embarrassing

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.919
though you know in for a penny in for a

00:23:51.919 --> 00:23:54.720
pound right

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.080

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.240
because he's a year older than me

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.520

[ __ ] shane gillis

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.600

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.760

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.159

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.120
someone said rap is better than skanks

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.760

the [ __ ] bullock the daddy bullock

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.240
[ __ ] gillis corona i don't know

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.279
someone just said they were talking

00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:15.440
about on their podcast

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.200
but i don't subscribe to their patreon

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.880
because uh

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:22.240
you know i don't like podcasts but

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.200
um

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.200
yeah mike rainey if anyone's watching

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.799
and this is this is what happens with

00:25:26.799 --> 00:25:28.880
this podcasting world it becomes almost

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.960
soap opera-esque in terms of everyone's

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.880
friends and they talk about it this and

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.720
that

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.640
that's the difference between like the

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.960
new york comedy scene

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.440
and the shareheads out west in la they

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.559
don't talk about anything where is here

00:25:44.559 --> 00:25:45.760
we're all wearing the same clothes we're

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.120
just jumping around

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.640
it's like this weird little incestuous

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.919
stuff and then slowly but surely if

00:25:49.919 --> 00:25:51.360
you're watching enough podcasts you'll

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.799
start to

00:25:52.799 --> 00:25:54.080
you know someone will tell a story on

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.440
four different podcasts but they'll only

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.919
tell you a little bit trying to keep

00:25:57.919 --> 00:26:01.159
an anonymity

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.279
and uh

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.520
so

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.600
every time i'll say a word one i'm gonna

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.200
let go

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.480
i'm sorry i haven't learned the language

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.720
yet i'm doing my best

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.159
so rain and

00:26:16.159 --> 00:26:18.240
rainy came over here with the dad me

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.080
guys go check out that episode if you

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.919
haven't heard it yet

00:26:21.919 --> 00:26:24.880
and him and tim turns out a few days

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.159
later

00:26:26.159 --> 00:26:27.760
i'm hanging out

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.559
with a couple of friends of mine

00:26:30.559 --> 00:26:32.240
tommy pope and shane gillis and i get a

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.000
text while i'm out with them off rainey

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.080
just going yo by the way i just uh just

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.559
test and call just test the puzzle

00:26:38.559 --> 00:26:40.799
for the rona go get yourself checked and

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:43.039
it's funny to have that conversation

00:26:43.039 --> 00:26:44.960
because i was there with them and that

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.919
that text just came

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.400
at in the middle of the moment

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.080
so it's like it's weird for me to i have

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.919
to dissect it but then also i'm like uh

00:26:53.919 --> 00:26:54.799
oh

00:26:54.799 --> 00:26:56.880
am i a spreader

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.480
because i've i've been [ __ ] the

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.120
victim of some of of spreading in the

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.520
past

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.640
i've caught some stuff

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.360
i i never got [ __ ] i never got a text

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.679
like rainy ain't no ain't no [ __ ]

00:27:11.679 --> 00:27:13.200
chicks ever [ __ ] coming to my phone

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.720
going yo by the way

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.120
stinking down there

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.320
you should go get checked

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.919
chicks will never admit that they died

00:27:23.919 --> 00:27:26.000
they'd rather they'd rather you [ __ ]

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.039
spread it to another girl than tell you

00:27:29.039 --> 00:27:30.880
they got they got some dankness going

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.880
down

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.039
that's what they would do

00:27:39.039 --> 00:27:41.200
i got the clap i'm happy to i'll admit

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:41.840
it

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.039
i didn't choose to do it

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.480
every girl then i talked to was like hey

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.919
by the way

00:27:49.919 --> 00:27:51.360
you might want to get checked you know

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.640
and i'd say every girl there was

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.640
probably like maybe three girls in the

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.320
in the last two days come on where am i

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.559
going

00:28:00.799 --> 00:28:02.000
every single one of them was like well i

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.360
didn't give it to you i don't have i

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.120
just got tested and i don't have it and

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.960
you go well it was it was [ __ ]

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.960
definitely one is

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.279
yeah it was i know it was but if you

00:28:11.279 --> 00:28:13.760
want to [ __ ] say face you do that but

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.039
we all know we all know which one it was

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.320
relationships gone by but the point is

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.240

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.279

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.640
other people there who are just as high

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.039
risk as [ __ ] collie wobbles

00:28:57.039 --> 00:28:58.960

00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:04.720
tell i've known from the beginning

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.600
i i just believe

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:11.600
there's something within my bod my soul

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.200
that says

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.440
um you know i'm just not catching it not

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:20.960

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.600
believe i just believe it's the same

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.120
i washed my hands for two days at the

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.080
beginning of this [ __ ] thing

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.320
i haven't haven't used sanitizer in

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.279
months

00:29:37.279 --> 00:29:39.120
no way

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.880
there's no way i i haven't caught worse

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.559
things in the in the building sites in

00:29:42.559 --> 00:29:45.760
new york than this [ __ ] corona plus

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.440
listen i might be overweight but like

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.559
i'm not [ __ ] morbid i might be obese

00:29:50.559 --> 00:29:53.279
and i am technically obese by the way

00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:56.159
according to my bmi

00:29:56.159 --> 00:29:58.159
but i'm six one and a half i can carry

00:29:58.159 --> 00:30:00.960
it and

00:30:01.279 --> 00:30:04.720
but i'm not morbidly obese

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.360
so as long as i'm not morbidly obese i

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.640
don't think i just don't think i'm the

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.200
guy who gets taken out and also if i

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.240
just happen to die young

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.559
so be put me out of my misery at this

00:30:16.559 --> 00:30:17.600
point

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.240

like a like a chick achieving something

00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:37.760
to me it's like when you see uh

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.760
it's like when you see a bear ride a

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.600
tricycle in the circus and you're like

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.559

chicks do that they stick obviously they

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.480
can stick stuff in but it's much harder

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.680
for a guy to [ __ ] a thing

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.640
it's sticky even the idea like sometimes

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.920
you know people who have whipped cream

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.760

like

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.040

i've seen some stuff before people

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.160
[ __ ] like they cut up half a

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.520
grapefruit and stick their dick through

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.119
it and and then they get a [ __ ] and

00:36:55.119 --> 00:36:56.400
supposed to be the best [ __ ] of all

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.640
time it's like there's just on there's

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:01.680

how about that

00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:45.280

i'll show you my tiny pee hole

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.040
but that it's only tiny in proportion to

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.200
the giant sword that i have relatively

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.640
outside of that but who's doing that

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.960
as you get off sure you get older uh you

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.440
know sex becomes boring right so you

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.800
want to start slapping people or

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.079
something

00:39:12.079 --> 00:39:15.079
um

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.359
you want to start slapping people

00:39:17.359 --> 00:39:18.640
or

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.079
doing all sorts of stuff you bring in

00:39:20.079 --> 00:39:22.640
ropes and chains and and maybe spitting

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.240
on each other but the idea of someone

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.400
melting [ __ ] chocolate a bit of

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:29.520
hershey's on my nipples never [ __ ] in

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.440
a million years

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.160
turned me on

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.920
it's wild

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.599
so we're talking about that kid [ __ ]

00:39:39.599 --> 00:39:42.079
the pie and i don't blame them

00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:44.079
i swear to god if i had a spare

00:39:44.079 --> 00:39:46.720
watermelon growing up you know we didn't

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:48.800
have watermelon in ireland

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.119
no no no that was like a special that

00:39:51.119 --> 00:39:53.440
was like a tree more like a as a not the

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.280
novelty of having a [ __ ] watermelon

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:56.560
in ireland

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.119
there's no such thing

00:39:59.119 --> 00:40:01.040
you would only do it as a joke

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.280
look i bought a [ __ ] watermelon

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:04.720
and then you'd probably just like throw

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.119
it in the [ __ ] garbage

00:40:07.119 --> 00:40:08.560
in the rubbish

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.280
bin

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.160
and

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.520
um

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.839
so the kid on [ __ ] that show he was

00:40:15.839 --> 00:40:17.680
banging the pie and it became famous but

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.560

[ __ ] wrap-up show that's what i'm

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.720
getting at this shit's creek apparently

it's been really successful i only heard

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.160

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.599
i only heard about it like [ __ ] um

00:41:33.599 --> 00:41:36.400
a couple of months ago

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.440
it ran for six

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.480
[ __ ]

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:42.319

00:41:42.319 --> 00:41:43.839
i never heard of it that's a canadian

00:41:43.839 --> 00:41:46.319

00:41:46.319 --> 00:41:47.839
you could be a [ __ ] you could be a

00:41:47.839 --> 00:41:50.000
superstar in canada

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.440
and then you come to like new york and

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.720
people don't even acknowledge you in

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:58.800
starbucks they won't even recognize you

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.280
there's a lot of canadian comedians come

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.800
to new york and they're like oh yeah i'm

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.079

00:42:04.079 --> 00:42:05.520
like oh yeah

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.280
well you gotta sign up for the open mic

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.599
sorry

00:42:11.359 --> 00:42:13.599
but this shit's creek show

00:42:13.599 --> 00:42:16.000
they have this show and it's a big wrap

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.280
up

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.960
and they and it's like a documentary

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:23.040
about the impact of this stuff

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.359
and what it meant to all the cast and

00:42:25.359 --> 00:42:27.440
what it meant to all the people watching

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.839
and and

00:42:28.839 --> 00:42:31.040
maybe because they said it was like a

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.319
very

00:42:32.319 --> 00:42:34.720

and then the second they walk away this

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:36.559
is an example they'll do oh look that

00:52:36.559 --> 00:52:38.559
guy [ __ ] sucks and then you but i

00:52:38.559 --> 00:52:40.079
always thought

00:52:40.079 --> 00:52:41.520
this was just

00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:42.400
like

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.760
scumbags

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:46.960
involved in open mic comedy or even just

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:48.400
like you know

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.800
low-level stand-up comedy but then as

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.960
i've gotten older those guys have gone

00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:54.480
on a lot of those guys have gone on to

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.480
be famous

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.079
they're doing shows

00:52:58.079 --> 00:53:00.800
they're getting auditions

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.079
and then you start to realize you go

00:53:02.079 --> 00:53:04.079
wait a second all these guys are just

00:53:04.079 --> 00:53:08.000
[ __ ] career lying [ __ ]

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.920
it's a good example if they start off

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:12.559
like that they'll

00:53:12.559 --> 00:53:14.000
the only reason they haven't some people

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.280
haven't made is because of talent but

00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:17.280
they're all still the same

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:20.400
evil career lying [ __ ]

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.160
so once you learn that nearly everyone

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.520
on tv

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:25.359
anyone in entertainment

00:53:25.359 --> 00:53:27.599

00:53:27.599 --> 00:53:30.079
a lying [ __ ]

00:53:30.079 --> 00:53:31.599
you know

00:53:31.599 --> 00:53:35.359
so it's like i'm watching this [ __ ]

00:53:35.599 --> 00:53:38.480
shit's creak

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:39.920
and they're all talking about the impact

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:42.079
of this show it's like it oh we ran like

00:53:42.079 --> 00:53:44.000
this and and and they're reading all

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000
these letters about like oh you gave me

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.280
the courage to come out of the closet

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:50.640
which they might have done but like

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:51.760
they're all like

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:53.280
oh

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.520
and they have this big final they do

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:57.680
this show they finish it up go that's a

00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:58.640
wrap

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.480
and that's it that's the end of shit's

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.079
creek and everyone's crying and go oh my

00:54:02.079 --> 00:54:04.240

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.640
show

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:08.480
i feel like

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.880
they filmed the show

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:13.520
and then

00:54:13.839 --> 00:54:16.720
someone says

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.920
yo by the way we're doing it like it

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.200
like an extra behind the scenes thing

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:26.720
so you gotta still you gotta ham it up i

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:28.160
don't think anyone's sitting down when

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:29.760
they do when they do the [ __ ] i keep

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:31.440
banging the mic when they do a sit down

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.119
and they sit and they

00:54:33.119 --> 00:54:34.720
and they tell them about they it's just

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:36.480
them and the white background you know

00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:37.760
like it's a photo shoot and they sit on

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.839
the one chair and they go

00:54:39.839 --> 00:54:41.599
the impact of this

00:54:41.599 --> 00:54:43.520
it changed everyone's life forever and i

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:44.480
don't think

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:48.400
did it actually change people's lives

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.800
in this day and age

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:53.359

00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:04.480
better liars that are ugly but no one

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:06.720
wants to see them on tv they're like

00:55:33.359 --> 00:55:37.599
think that any actor has been real

00:55:37.599 --> 00:55:41.839
when being interviewed about anything

00:55:42.559 --> 00:55:44.319

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.280
have cameron diaz tells a funny story to

00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:00.400
jimmy [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:03.680
jimmy [ __ ]

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:06.240

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:17.119
a time she got a [ __ ] wax

00:56:17.119 --> 00:56:19.440
and and there was poo or something on

00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:21.040
the [ __ ] thing and everyone laughs

00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:22.400

and she just delivers it well

00:56:45.119 --> 00:56:47.839
because she's a professional actress

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:06.000
really such an impactful thing

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.319
and i just can't believe we went so far

00:57:08.319 --> 00:57:12.480
and it's like it was a show

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.240
maybe it's cause i'm so much i'm such a

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:15.839
cynical [ __ ]

00:57:15.839 --> 00:57:17.839

00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:21.440

00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:44.110
[Music]

00:57:46.079 --> 00:57:48.480
it's a show

00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:49.680
they're trying to make it like has

00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:51.280
anyone really i've been watching a show

00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.559
and it gets cancelled halfway through

00:57:52.559 --> 00:57:55.839
you alright whatever

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:59.520
the shows last long enough

00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.520
and it's like

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.119
[ __ ]

00:58:03.119 --> 00:58:04.960
what was that one everyone watched game

00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.079
of thrones

00:58:06.079 --> 00:58:09.760
game of thrones come on column don't be

00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.200
irish

00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:13.760
game of thrones you idiot

00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:17.440
game of thrones as we'd say

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:19.440
that finished and it was and it stunk

00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:22.720
the ending was [ __ ] terrible

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:26.240
i don't know where these people get off

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:28.240
it's just you're you're it's

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.760
a tv show

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:32.160
is not that culturally important

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:34.960
a tv show is

00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:38.240
just a lazy hobby

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:40.240
so we can just distract ourselves from

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.720
from our lives because we're tired and

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:45.040
we're um we're too tired to read a book

00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:46.880
so we just watch a bunch of flashing

00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:48.319
images

00:58:48.319 --> 00:58:50.640
there's no way a show is that important

00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:51.839
is there is

00:58:51.839 --> 00:58:53.280
that just me

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.280
there's no way a show is that important

00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:57.760
to people

00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:01.920
right

00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:04.319

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:15.280

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:19.680
days is that

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:21.520
you want to hear an irish version of the

00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:23.440

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:28.200

00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:39.280
spent most of my days

00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.480
what was the rest of the words i don't

00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:41.119

00:59:41.119 --> 00:59:42.720
zipping and bopping and zipping and

00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:44.720
doodling when a couple of guys they were

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:46.559
up to no good started making trouble in

00:59:46.559 --> 00:59:47.760
the neighborhood

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:49.920

00:59:51.359 --> 00:59:53.599
auntie and uncle in bellaire

00:59:53.599 --> 00:59:55.920
that's that's all i know and then yeah

00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:57.119
you probably know all the words in the

00:59:57.119 --> 00:59:58.400
chat

00:59:58.400 --> 00:59:59.920
but watching that it's a 30-year

00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.240
anniversary for that show

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.799
and they showed this montage and and

01:00:04.799 --> 01:00:07.280
this stuff and they're talking about how

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.119
one person said i think the show is

01:00:09.119 --> 01:00:12.079
bigger now than it ever was back then

01:00:12.079 --> 01:00:15.599
and it's like on a highlight reel where

01:00:15.599 --> 01:00:17.440
a bunch of actors have gone on to be

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.359
super famous by the way will smith's

01:00:19.359 --> 01:00:22.319
gone on to be the highest grossing actor

01:00:22.319 --> 01:00:25.200
a couple of years in a row

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:28.200
and

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.640
they're all doing i was watching them

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.240
they're all crying and they're talking

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.079
about this that and the other and they

01:00:34.079 --> 01:00:36.079
make this big song and dance about it

01:00:36.079 --> 01:00:37.280
and it's like

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.599
it's it's a show

01:00:39.599 --> 01:00:42.640
it's just a [ __ ] show i think it's

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.960
just a happy payday because these guys

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:48.000
are so [ __ ] old

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.880
all the women on the show can't get work

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.280
anymore

01:00:54.079 --> 01:00:58.319
they're just lying everyone on tv

on a podcast

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.680
podcast might be the only real thing

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.720
left

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.240
because it's where people go when they

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.160
have no other options so they have no

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.680
choice they might as well be [ __ ]

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:16.480
telling the truth

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.240
and even now podcasting is mainstream

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:23.720
michelle obama

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.839
that [ __ ]

the trans the first black trans first

her i'd really doubt it but it's it's

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:45.040
it's one of the funniest things on the

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.079
internet

01:01:46.079 --> 01:01:48.960
is that the illusion that [ __ ]

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.960
um

01:01:52.079 --> 01:01:53.760
the idea that michelle obama could be

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.359
trans

01:01:55.359 --> 01:01:57.920

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.559
it's nuts

01:02:08.559 --> 01:02:11.440

conversation

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.400
i guess i just need the attention who

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.240
knows what type of mental illness drove

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.920

these

01:04:50.799 --> 01:04:53.119

apartment you live in

01:06:33.599 --> 01:06:35.680

be so rich that you don't do anything so

01:06:54.319 --> 01:06:55.680
then you look at people like michelle

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:56.799
obama

01:06:56.799 --> 01:06:58.799

you've got it all

01:07:12.319 --> 01:07:16.160

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:19.440
and another mansion

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:22.079
you've got it

01:07:22.079 --> 01:07:23.920
it's something weird within these people

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.440
it drives them especially politicians

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.119
are one thing but then

01:07:27.119 --> 01:07:28.720
matthew mcconaughey

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.559

i just saw

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.440
a little thing

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.200
online

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.640
matthew mcconaughey is thinking about

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.520
doing

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:40.799
comedy now

01:07:47.599 --> 01:07:48.400
this

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.760
it's a step down i know it looks great

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.200
when you see

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.079
bill burr and louis ck

01:07:56.079 --> 01:07:58.240
crush a stadium

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:01.039
but it's not what you should be doing

01:08:01.039 --> 01:08:04.319
you're an oscar-winning actor

01:08:04.319 --> 01:08:07.039
enjoy your money

01:08:07.039 --> 01:08:11.839
stop trying to do something that is for

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:14.160
poor people

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.719
that is for

01:08:16.719 --> 01:08:19.679
losers and talentless people when

01:08:19.679 --> 01:08:21.759
because they go to comedy they get

01:08:21.759 --> 01:08:25.400
sucked into comedy

01:08:30.799 --> 01:08:32.000
that's not why you should that's what

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.480
they comedy people spend so much comedy

01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:36.239
and there's always been this way comedy

01:08:36.239 --> 01:08:38.560
is like the last resort for someone for

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:40.880
most people it's like

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:44.799

01:12:34.159 --> 01:12:36.400
buying stuff and i feel like everyone's

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:38.239
probably a lot broker than we

01:12:38.239 --> 01:12:40.400
christmas can be tough

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:41.760
when you're forced to buy [ __ ] for

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:44.480
people you don't like

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.080
and i feel like everyone's probably a

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.679
lot broker than

01:12:47.679 --> 01:12:48.960
we

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:51.120
thought

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.239
right

01:12:52.239 --> 01:12:55.199
like everyone's getting by

01:12:55.199 --> 01:12:57.040
yeah let me say thanksgiving is my

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.159
favorite

01:12:58.159 --> 01:12:59.120
hey

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:01.280
you're mocking my accent dude

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:02.159
no

01:13:02.159 --> 01:13:03.280
no

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:07.600
most people are here for the accent

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.600
we'll get back to it it's weird now it's

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.920
a weird time

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:19.840
just kind of killing it you know

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.360
like you have you ever [ __ ] have like

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:27.840
a one-night stand or something and all

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.080
leads to like

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:32.719
a bit of riding

01:13:32.719 --> 01:13:35.920
you guys are finished in the sake

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:40.239
they they don't want you to stay

01:13:40.239 --> 01:13:41.760
you don't want to stay but they're not

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.920
gonna kick you out

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.840
and you're not gonna just go i gotta go

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:48.400
so it's like a kind of an awkward weird

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:52.000
moment of just sitting around

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.600
i'm not staying tonight but i'm not i'm

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.920

01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:58.719
got that post no

01:13:58.719 --> 01:14:00.880
clarity and guilt

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.000
combo

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
i'm just like oh my god that was

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.840
reckless

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:10.000
jesus oh my god we didn't wear a rubber

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.280
but you're making small talk you're like

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.239
so

01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:13.679
what part of virginia did you just say

01:14:13.679 --> 01:14:15.280

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:17.520

oh me yeah i moved here in 2014 um

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:22.960
and that's like the that's the way it

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:24.880
feels like right now in america like

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.640
trump is

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.719
trump and biden have just accumulated

01:14:28.719 --> 01:14:31.040
and like just clashed at this

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:33.040
the top of the mountain and they boat

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.800
and they've nutted and it's over they

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:37.199
nutted

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.239
they both busted and now we're kind of

01:14:40.239 --> 01:14:41.600
just killing time until someone

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.600
eventually goes all right i'm out of

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:44.640

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:54.000
a lot of violence too maybe i'm and i

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.360
don't wanna be a scaremonger

01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:00.159
but i feel like

01:15:00.159 --> 01:15:02.320
we got that the gremlin

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:05.600
rudy giuliani

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.600
and i called it last week i said some

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:10.000
confed that that guy after midnight and

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.840
now he just turned into used to be this

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.840
big tall

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:17.040
i put away the mob

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:20.960
i locked up john gotti

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.560
now he's just this wee little

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.159
he just every time he comes out it's

01:15:26.159 --> 01:15:29.440
like it's like from there's a chain

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:32.800
rudy giuliani does a chain

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:34.800
around his ankle back to a cage so that

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.320
he can't run away from his [ __ ]

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:37.600
whoever owns them he just comes

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.480
scrolling now

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.960
just in the the final 50 years of being

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:45.520
an italian he's because he's an italian

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:48.080
those for some reason those [ __ ] i don't

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.679
know what it is

01:15:49.679 --> 01:15:51.440
about [ __ ]

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.760
meatballs and and tacky track suits but

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:57.199
those guys live old

01:15:57.199 --> 01:15:58.880
there's a [ __ ] there's something

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.040
about tongue kissing your mother

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:03.120
into your 40s

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:05.280
that makes those people they live they

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:08.239
do not die

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:12.400
do you ever read the book outliers about

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:15.760
that village in pennsylvania

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:18.400
but they're all italian immigrants and

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:20.159
there's like a neighborhood feel and

01:16:20.159 --> 01:16:21.840
there's something about the the life

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:24.880
because the community was so high

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.719
the community was so involved with each

01:16:26.719 --> 01:16:28.400
other's life that they did that they

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.159
never died of like heart attacks or any

01:16:30.159 --> 01:16:31.760
of that [ __ ]

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.360
i think a lot of that too and they

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:34.560
didn't say it in the book but i read

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:37.040
between the lines i think a lot of da

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:40.480
was just italian incest

01:16:44.159 --> 01:16:46.239
spaghetti on your mother's lips italians

01:16:46.239 --> 01:16:49.360
do not die they just don't they live on

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.800
forever

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:53.120
so giuliani's on the back julian is 80

01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:55.199
years old he's got another 50 years of

01:16:55.199 --> 01:16:56.560
just this little

01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:59.280
with his with his tiny hands he almost

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:02.800
like a [ __ ] like a t-rex he just has

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:05.360
these tiny little hands in this head

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.920
that's just with with the [ __ ]

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:10.080
[ __ ] dribbling down his face

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:10.960
going

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:15.320
we demand a re-vote in wisconsin

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:19.679
so i feel like they're going to do

01:17:19.679 --> 01:17:23.120
enough in the media to rally up

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:24.320
the [ __ ]

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:26.719
you know

01:17:29.679 --> 01:17:31.280
they're not they're gonna do enough to

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.360
rally up the [ __ ] that

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.199
we're trump we're people that don't

01:17:35.199 --> 01:17:36.800
gonna believe and i don't know

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:39.120
i i i genuinely believe there's been

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:40.320
tampering

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.880
with illegal votes

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:45.120
i i don't think i care

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:47.520
and i don't think it was enough to

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:48.960
really change the election but i do

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:51.440
believe it was a crooked election i just

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:53.600
that's just naturally my pessimistic

01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.840
view

01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.199
all right

01:17:57.199 --> 01:17:59.520
and i think trump is gonna do enough

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:02.800
that people believe he was robbed

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.800
so when it comes time to leave he's

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:07.360
gonna do he like that meme

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:08.960
of laying out of the caprio he's gonna

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:11.440
come out and be like i'm not [ __ ]

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.840
leaving

01:18:14.159 --> 01:18:15.679
and then we're gonna have a bunch of

01:18:15.679 --> 01:18:18.000
[ __ ]

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.480
a bunch of [ __ ] weak

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:23.679
antifa [ __ ]

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.679
a bunch of anemic antifa

01:18:27.679 --> 01:18:31.360
fighting the the diabetic

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:33.600
maggot heads

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:34.960
the

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:37.920
the anemic antifa versus the [ __ ]

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:40.000
diabetic

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.520
maggot heads

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:43.199
and they'll clash on the streets and the

01:18:43.199 --> 01:18:45.280
news will make it bigger than it is when

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:48.080
most of us are just sitting at home

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:50.480
watching the queen's gambit

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:54.000
killing time until we croak it

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
that's what i imagine is going to happen

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.600
and then hopefully

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:01.040
hopefully it will all be done by

01:19:01.199 --> 01:19:02.320
i don't know what date that's supposed

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:05.400
to be

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:16.080
i don't understand the chair

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.400

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:25.520
when is that

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:27.360
hopefully it comes fast and then we can

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:31.120
all get a nice bit of steamy baby

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:36.800
twelve hundred dollars straight to

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:39.440
casino

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.560

2021

01:19:56.239 --> 01:19:58.320
a lot of clashing

01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.880
between the people that just just

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:04.480
the polar opposite idiots of each ant

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:06.000
meanwhile the smart people are just

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.640
sitting at home

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:12.080
watching will smith talk about the fresh

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:13.840

nothing's up

01:20:41.199 --> 01:20:43.040
so that's it

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:46.760
what else did i say

01:20:50.159 --> 01:20:53.679
i don't know i got into stocks

01:20:55.199 --> 01:20:57.520
anybody use stocks i got very few stocks

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.280
this is the funny thing i got into

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:01.840
stocks at a weird time

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:04.719
volatile [ __ ] going on

01:21:04.719 --> 01:21:06.880
i'll tell you who i have

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:09.040
these are my picks this is kali's

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:10.480
financial

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:13.360
part i don't have his

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:15.040
i don't have a i don't have a drop for

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:16.800
this but this is a segment called kali's

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:18.960
financial

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.000
segment

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.640
maybe the name needs work

01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:24.159
feel free to tell me about the name the

01:21:24.159 --> 01:21:26.480
name needs work it's a work in progress

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:29.840
here all the time

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:32.800
so here's this is what i got this is

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:34.400
where my stocks i got a robin hood

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.440
account

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:37.199
and i've got

01:21:37.199 --> 01:21:38.960
a little bit of money spread out and i

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.960
swear to god it's laughable how small it

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:42.640
is so don't make it feel like don't

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:43.840
don't think that you need to stop

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:46.000
donating because i have no money

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.159
and what it is it's only a tiniest

01:21:48.159 --> 01:21:50.480
amount

01:21:50.719 --> 01:21:52.560
wouldn't cover my rent

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:53.760
the amount of money i have invested

01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:56.400
would not cover my rent okay

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:59.520
so here i've got i got microsoft

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:02.239
i got apple

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:05.520
i got teeny bit of amazon

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:07.679
and then i've got a

01:22:07.679 --> 01:22:10.679
um

01:22:12.159 --> 01:22:15.040
what you call it like a retail fund

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:18.560
called i buy which is all about online

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:19.840
retails

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:21.280
that's what i got

01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:24.960
and the way my accounts work is

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:26.560
and i'm not changing them that's who i

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.159
have and i've left them to do their own

01:22:28.159 --> 01:22:30.400
thing

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:33.120
every time i check

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:36.560
i'm either down 20

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.880
and then a few days later um broke even

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:40.800
again

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:42.480
someone said robin hood is gambling for

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.800
white people and gambling also we also

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:46.480
do that

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:47.679
um

01:22:47.679 --> 01:22:50.480
any crypto no no i don't understand

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:52.080
crypto and i'm just not getting into

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.840
that right now

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:55.440
although i should have i would have had

01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:57.360
a lot more money if i invested in crypto

01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:59.199
but hey i'm not willing to lose all that

01:22:59.199 --> 01:23:00.400
because i've seen so many people lose

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.560
that [ __ ]

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:13.520
bosses something about lucky bastard

01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:16.560
i don't understand

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:19.120
someone said i bought [ __ ] stocks that

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.800
won't make you any money at this point i

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:23.280
i feel like

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:24.320
i'm

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:26.239
not wrong i feel like they're going to

01:23:26.239 --> 01:23:27.840
just keep going up over the next few

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.040
years so this is what i have so

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:30.239
everything i do i know at this point

01:23:30.239 --> 01:23:31.360
they're not going to get me an immediate

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:32.960
return but they're better than me having

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:35.520
the money in my bank

01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:37.040
but what happens is every time i check

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:39.920
the stocks i'm either down 20 or broken

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:42.320

so there's nothing wrong with being a

01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:45.760
plumber that's where the money is

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:47.760
you're constantly needed

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:50.080
because people are [ __ ]

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:52.080
that was like my financial advice

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:53.920
growing up

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:56.719
i was also told to get into food

01:26:56.719 --> 01:26:58.480
this wasn't this was advice from my

01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:00.560
father ragin aiden

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.800
is my father's nickname because he has

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:04.400
anger issues

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:06.080
not his fault he got them from his

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:08.239
father and it's all just been passed

01:27:08.239 --> 01:27:10.239
down

01:27:10.239 --> 01:27:12.719
most people inherit like a watch

01:27:12.719 --> 01:27:14.080
with their grandmother's [ __ ]

01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:15.440
engagement ring

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:16.800

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.840

01:27:20.159 --> 01:27:22.159
and anger issues

01:27:22.159 --> 01:27:24.800
emotionally stunted bloodline

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:26.719
that's what i got

01:27:26.719 --> 01:27:29.360
one of my the advice my dad gave me

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:33.480
was get into food

01:27:34.719 --> 01:27:38.639
no idea how to get into food no um

01:27:38.639 --> 01:27:41.280
where to go in the food sector in the

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:44.639
grocery sector he just said get into it

01:27:44.639 --> 01:27:47.199
he goes people always need food

01:27:47.199 --> 01:27:48.960
they need to eat every day that's my

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:50.000
dad's

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.239
[ __ ] business

01:27:52.239 --> 01:27:54.320
tips

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:57.199
my dad would tell you get into beds

01:27:57.199 --> 01:27:58.880
get into plumbing

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:00.960
get into food

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:03.280
every day people sleep every day people

01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:05.760
[ __ ] and every day people eat

01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:07.280
and i'm like how do i get into food my

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.560
dad would just be like

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.560
look at like we'd have tesco so be like

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:12.560
look at trader joe's the equivalent he

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:14.639
goes look at trader joe's do what

01:28:14.639 --> 01:28:17.120
they're doing oh yeah

01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:19.120
do what trader just like

01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:21.440
no advice he goes i can't talk now i

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:24.639
need to read my newspaper

01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:29.520
so i'm doing everything i can

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:31.360
to drag myself

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:34.239
into the world of money management

01:28:34.239 --> 01:28:35.920
because until you know money management

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:38.080
i don't think you'll ever have money

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:40.400
maybe i'm wrong but that's what my goal

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:42.480
it has been and it will be for the next

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:43.840
few years

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:45.520
now that i'm earning three hundred and

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:48.080
thirty dollars a month on my patreon

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:50.080
which is not to be sniffed at

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:52.080
head over [ __ ] hit subscribe as low

01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:54.840
as a dollar if you can

01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:58.639
um i don't i think that's a good goal

01:28:58.639 --> 01:29:00.239
because if i understand money i can

01:29:00.239 --> 01:29:02.159
teach my kids money

01:29:02.159 --> 01:29:03.679
and then hopefully we're not done to be

01:29:03.679 --> 01:29:05.360

01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:08.480

01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:14.320
[ __ ]

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:16.960
so that's my goal

01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:19.199

01:29:19.199 --> 01:29:21.199
goal obviously i want to achieve a lot

01:29:21.199 --> 01:29:23.679
of stuff in the entertainment business

01:29:23.679 --> 01:29:26.080

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:37.360
um

01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:38.800
and i think that's it

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:40.719
for today

01:29:40.719 --> 01:29:41.679
i know it's

01:29:41.679 --> 01:29:44.000
shorter than i usually do on a friday

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.480
but i released two [ __ ] episodes on

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:48.400
the patreon just two days ago and i

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.639
don't want to burn myself out the

01:29:50.639 --> 01:29:52.400
episodes in the patreon will come out

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:54.560
nearly every monday i also got big dogs

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:56.320
which is an hour and a half every week

01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:58.080
so there's only so much talking you can

01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:00.000
do

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:00.960
right

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:05.360
and i get it i bore myself sometimes

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:06.400
but

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:08.159
hey

01:30:08.159 --> 01:30:10.400
and we also got a new outro

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:11.679
and i think

01:30:11.679 --> 01:30:14.080
you might like it

01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:16.239
so

01:30:16.639 --> 01:30:19.600
we're gonna say goodbye

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:22.960
and the music's gonna start now

01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:27.920
and this is all this this is it

01:30:28.159 --> 01:30:30.800
