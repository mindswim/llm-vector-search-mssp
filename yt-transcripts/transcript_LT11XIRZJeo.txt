00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.239
sam

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.239
have you ever used a stove for something

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.560
other than intended example home heating

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.239
lighting a cigarette

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.560
knife hits etc

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.159
knife hits yeah i think it's where you

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.319
like i know that kind of drug well i

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.159
don't know if it's meth or crack or crap

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.799
i believe it's marijuana

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.080
yeah you would heat the night off and

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.640
then you put like maybe some hashish or

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.720
uh something like that on the hot knife

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.920
and um

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.599
you kind of freebase it

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.599
so i've heard

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:02.720
that's what you're that's what your

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.640
mom's doing up in the kitchen right now

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.439
my favorite thing i had for dinner huh

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.519
um i for sure have my mom used to heat

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:10.799
the

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.319
in the morning she would just turn the

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.799
oven on and open the door to the oven

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.639
instead of like heating the whole house

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.720
she would just heat the kitchen that way

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.400
wait the heat wasn't on throughout the

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.199
night

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.120
it was but i guess if it was cold i

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.720
don't know she would just open up to

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.160
crack the stove

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.880
i know you're [ __ ] dressed

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.240
oh yeah dude

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.840
also my dad i don't think there was a

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.800
lighter in my house from 1991 to 97. he

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.680
just [ __ ] lit his marb his marble

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.720
reds off the [ __ ] burner oh

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.840
man if that ain't a [ __ ] garbage bag

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.160
move i don't know what is lighting your

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.199
smoke off the stove yeah cause there's

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:52.720
two schools of thought on that you

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.479
either get down there with your face and

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.600
because you have to take a puff

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.600
gotta get some oxygen flow through there

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.440
for sure and when you just put it in

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.120
there into the oven like when you reach

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.120
your hand down it's just burning like

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.560
you have to bend over and like get your

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.840
face in there

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.080
get a hot one he says those brows you

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.680
gotta get up on that pilot light

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.560
um

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.400
i used to he used to do it all the time

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.000
and also you know what's really garbage

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.080
we'd go over his buddy's house

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.360
at the time and uh no longer friends and

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.440
we'd go we'd go over his house and he

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.000
had an electric stove and my dad would

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.680
do it on that so

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.360
he would have to sit there for like 10

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.039
minutes so that puppy got warm enough

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.280
sitting there puffing on it yeah that's

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.880
like a car lighter man there's nothing

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.400
like when a car later

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.720
over either too hot or too cold you're

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.759
like

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.479
dude you know what i used to go with

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:47.520
with uh

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.039
with carla i don't think they make them

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.720
anymore but the car lighters some they

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.240
would get like you know malfunction you

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.840
would push it in and it would shoot out

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.840
like once it's hot it would pop because

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.680
they used to pop out remember to let you

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.440
know they're done well some would like

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.880
shoot out under the seat you'd be

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.720
[ __ ] swerving all over the car that's

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.039
the toddler in the face

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:06.880
i put one on my tongue when i was a kid

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.479
for some reason

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:09.840
i went to bed

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.639
yeah just i i put it on hot or i got it

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.479

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.799
squandered away eventually but

dear lord baby jesus thank you for the

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.840
trash business he also has like i think

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.159
my whole family from the mccusker side

00:29:42.159 --> 00:29:43.840
are all like slightly autistic too so

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.840
like he'll get into [ __ ] so like he got

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.360
into

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.720
he got into like rollerblading

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.600
he's he's also like at this time he was

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.000
probably like 250 or 60 pounds because

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.520
he got he got rich and got fat

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.240
immediately oh he was fat fatter that's

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.679
great so he got rich and like

00:30:01.679 --> 00:30:03.600
immediately almost touched 300 and he's

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.960
only he's like six feet so he

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.720
immediately got fat as [ __ ] then he's

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.000
like i gotta scale this down he quit

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.520
drinking because that was his

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.360
triglycerides were like i think triple

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.640
like a normal human being so we got to

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.399
chill with that

00:30:14.399 --> 00:30:16.960
so he took off

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.799
so he would just get into [ __ ] like he

00:30:18.799 --> 00:30:20.559
got into muscle cars did that and then

00:30:20.559 --> 00:30:21.919
like just ditched that and then he got

00:30:21.919 --> 00:30:24.320
into like rollerblading he

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.480
hit his elbow so he quit rolling

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.559
muscle cars to rollerblading what the

00:30:28.559 --> 00:30:29.840
[ __ ] about it

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.000
downwards downward move yeah yeah i

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.440
think i think his account was like all

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.080
right dude let's go to the road

00:30:39.039 --> 00:30:40.000
yeah

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.600
then he got into bicycles and so his

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.240
basement is just like there's 35

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.279
like 1970s so he'll find schwinn's in

00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:48.559
the trash because he still does trash

00:30:48.559 --> 00:30:50.960
and then he'll fix them up so we have

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.360
like just literally 30 40 bicycles in

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.279
our basement that's a cool little hobby

00:30:55.279 --> 00:30:56.640
though that's all right yeah that was

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.840
his first job when he was little he used

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.679
to fix bicycles when he was like oh

00:30:59.679 --> 00:31:01.039
that's pretty good then mask him he's

00:31:01.039 --> 00:31:02.399
like i was like six and i was fixing i

00:31:02.399 --> 00:31:03.519
was like dude [ __ ] you you're probably

00:31:03.519 --> 00:31:06.240
14. yeah now i don't want to sound naive

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.760
here but you i mean this sounds like a

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.200
like a pretty big

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.039
you know trash company

00:31:11.039 --> 00:31:13.279
doesn't that those businesses tend to

00:31:13.279 --> 00:31:14.880
fall to

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.519
a certain group of people so and this is

00:31:17.519 --> 00:31:19.519
this is what happened though so when

00:31:19.519 --> 00:31:21.760
they had it so they did mccusker and

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.519
sons was operated in the middle of

00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:25.519
chester during the crack epidemic

00:31:25.519 --> 00:31:27.120
so like they were already like they had

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.720
guns like my uncle would get like try to

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.240
get like he got jumped a couple times

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.559
and like so they had they had a uh so

00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:34.000
that people would break in constantly

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.600
and then like with trash they're scrap

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.799
metal so they're they'd have to they

00:31:36.799 --> 00:31:38.159
would like pat down employees at the end

00:31:38.159 --> 00:31:40.000
of the day it was insane but they had a

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.720
guy so they let they let a homeless man

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.960
this guy called time bomb tom would live

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.200
in the trash cart

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.399
evt my man he was nuts so he would hang

00:31:50.399 --> 00:31:52.000
around so they were like look man we'll

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.600
buy you a trailer he's homeless so they

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.960
bought him a trailer and gave him a

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.000
security guard outfit

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.200
he would walk around all day patrol

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.960
thinking he's the [ __ ] too he was nuts

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.320
so he would call my dad at three in the

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.000
morning like kevin they broke in kevin

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.600
they broke in again i got them i shot

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.760
one

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.279
he didn't do anything but he would like

00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:12.559
so my dad would rush down there and he

00:32:12.559 --> 00:32:14.399
would event these big break-ins so like

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:16.080
tell my dad like he was earning his keep

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.720
which it was so [ __ ] fun

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.080
but yeah man that was great it was it

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.399
was a big trash company and they had

00:32:22.399 --> 00:32:24.000
brush they brushed up with the mob a

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.039
couple times people would steal

00:32:25.039 --> 00:32:26.880
dumpsters that was a big thing they'd

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.600
steal your dumpsters yeah you'd find out

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.279
you'd have to deal with it but no he he

00:32:31.279 --> 00:32:32.640
said he had a couple people i think the

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.159
way he uh

00:32:34.159 --> 00:32:36.000
a couple i'm trying to phrase in his

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.399
language a couple of goombas try to

00:32:38.399 --> 00:32:39.919
shoulder up to him a couple elbow up to

00:32:39.919 --> 00:32:41.360
him a couple times he told him to [ __ ]

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.200
off he rollerbladed away

00:32:47.039 --> 00:32:48.159
because that's the other thing too it's

00:32:48.159 --> 00:32:50.080
like you know with a again you have a

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.159
family-owned trash business so you can

00:32:52.159 --> 00:32:54.080
get rid of any so if somebody if you

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.840
were to try to kill somebody you easily

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:56.640
can

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.080
if you wanna you can make that body

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.760
disappear real quick yeah if you want an

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.080
excavator and a trash company and the

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.039
only people that work with you and your

00:33:03.039 --> 00:33:04.320
brothers you can totally kill people and

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.519
get away with it

00:33:05.519 --> 00:33:06.480
so

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.880
you know and he he was kind of uh

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.720
he had one of his friends was kind of

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.960
tied in r.i.p the guy just died recently

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.200
but he was his dad had been kind of tied

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.279
into some organized crime stuff so like

00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:19.840
he they like knew you know it was like

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.000
the whole ridley park mob families thing

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.480

00:33:27.919 --> 00:33:29.279
so it was like you know but that element

00:33:29.279 --> 00:33:30.960
was definitely around man yeah i could

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.720
imagine he probably had to

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.720
you know sidestep a couple of things and

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.720
do to deal with some [ __ ] like that yeah

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.159
he had to go to court one time when i

00:33:38.159 --> 00:33:39.360
was little i remember him mentioning

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.960
something about rico charges and there

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.360
was someone that he knew got brought in

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.360
on rico charges and they had to ask him

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.840
some questions or something

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.679

00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:51.279
dude the trash business in the 80s and

00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:54.320
90s and [ __ ] delco what the [ __ ] he's

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.519
leaving your mom's hanging out the

00:34:00.799 --> 00:34:03.039
transfer station they only let back then

00:34:03.039 --> 00:34:04.320
it was like the wild west was like

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.440
anyone could have a trash company but

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.960
then the transfer station you needed to

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.000
come up with some sort of money so

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.159
that's why him and all his brothers put

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:11.839
all of their houses they took mortgages

00:34:11.839 --> 00:34:13.359
out on all their houses and just rolled

00:34:13.359 --> 00:34:14.879
the dice on the transfer station and

00:34:14.879 --> 00:34:16.720
[ __ ] love that so it didn't work it

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:17.679
was like it would have been a whole

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:19.119
different story for the mccusker family

00:34:19.119 --> 00:34:20.960
dude

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.960
little like i would when i was like nine

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.320
years old i would go to work for i would

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.480
sit in a trash truck with him and i just

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.320
i would just listen to cb radio all day

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.240
long of different truckers talking yeah

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.520
i would hear this is not it was just

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.960
slurs constantly so i'm like dad what

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.560
does that mean he would be like

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.839
that's what that's what they call indian

00:34:41.839 --> 00:34:43.520

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.800
all right what's that one he's like

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.399

00:34:46.399 --> 00:34:48.879
say that

00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:50.159
and then i would get out of the truck

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:51.679
from like learning slurs all day and

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:53.679
then he would let me shoot rat we would

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:55.520
turn they had a big warehouse where they

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.879
would turn the lights on and then rats

00:34:56.879 --> 00:34:58.480
would scatter so you could sit there

00:34:58.480 --> 00:34:59.839
with a nine millimeter turn the lights

00:34:59.839 --> 00:35:01.119
on as soon as the rats started running

00:35:01.119 --> 00:35:03.839
it was just you're blasting rats

00:35:03.839 --> 00:35:06.000
what you were doing i think i saw that

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.359
game on the boardwalk and wildwood

00:35:07.359 --> 00:35:08.960

four-wheelers three-wheelers oh we had

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.040
to get rid of them all because two of my

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.480
cousins went to the hospital on the same

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.160
day one time so we had to get rid of all

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.240
the atvs and dirt bikes well they i

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.599

00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:37.200
got rid of them we had atvs and dirt

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.960
bikes and go-karts did you ever have a

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:40.240

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:45.280
they're too dangerous they flip it over

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.880
yeah this thing that was a big myth in

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:48.800
the 90s those things would just [ __ ]

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.599
turn over what happened to your cousins

00:44:51.599 --> 00:44:54.319
uh well so my

00:44:54.319 --> 00:44:56.079
it was we had one we had one one of the

00:44:56.079 --> 00:44:58.800
dirt bikes we had my cousin tried to he

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.359
tried to ramp uh like not a sand mound

00:45:01.359 --> 00:45:02.480
but like there was a thing in the front

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.000
yard you could definitely get air off of

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.560
it so he ramped that and then the

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.720
like the break caught his lip and ripped

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:11.200
his lip open

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:12.800
yeah so he got fish hooked and ripped

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.319
his lip and then on the same day my

00:45:14.319 --> 00:45:15.680
cousin had this you know he went to the

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.119
hospital and then my other cousin hopped

00:45:17.119 --> 00:45:18.640
on the derp like

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.160
it was riding it and fell over and got a

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.720
third degree burn on his life jesus

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.400
right so after that there was a

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.280
discussion it was like all right we

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.800
gotta like you know they were my cousins

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:27.839
all got hurt and we were like what the

00:45:27.839 --> 00:45:28.880
[ __ ] we didn't get hurt why do we have

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.240
to get rid of the dirt bikes my [ __ ]

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.480
yes my cousins are [ __ ] blah blah

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.640
so you know so this is just the whole

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.800
brew just running around in this [ __ ]

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.400
compound it'd be like a go-kart going

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.920
with two people in it we need a two-man

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.920
go-kart

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.560
multiple times

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.880
two-man go-kart a four-wheeler and like

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.640
a moped and a dirt bike we're buzzing

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.119
around at all times man that is garbage

00:45:51.119 --> 00:45:53.440
new money [ __ ] right there i [ __ ]

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.760
love it

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.839
holy

00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:01.440
[ __ ] did you guys have like a robot that

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.040
just served drinks or something like

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.200
that

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.800
you seem like the kind of people who

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.240
would like train your dog to get you a

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.000
beer too like they can open up the

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.960
fridge with

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.160
yeah bring your bud heavy

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.599
no matter how much money you guys have

00:46:19.599 --> 00:46:21.980
you still use the white foam coolers

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:26.400
[Laughter]

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.800
so one of the basics is so obviously i'm

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.400
assuming you had a garage

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.319
on your house yeah

00:46:32.319 --> 00:46:34.319
yeah we had a garage attached to the

00:46:34.319 --> 00:46:36.160
house turn that into a living room and

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:39.760
then build an exterior garage wow

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.680
that's three different that's three

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.119
different bad answers right there that

00:46:43.119 --> 00:46:46.079
you just gave me in that one sentence

00:46:46.079 --> 00:46:48.400
any time you turn an existing garage

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.599
into a living room it's [ __ ] trash

00:46:51.599 --> 00:46:52.640
dude

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.319
you gotta take that little step down

00:46:54.319 --> 00:46:57.040
into it it's almost colder

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:59.119
no matter how much padding you put on

00:46:59.119 --> 00:47:00.560
that floor you can tell you're walking

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.540
on a concrete slab

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:04.000
[Laughter]

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.440
i forgot about that yeah i'm like yeah i

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.040
do step down out of the kitchen into the

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.480
living room then up back into the mud

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.760
room yeah it's too funny

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:14.640
it's like a split level um

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.480
and then i so in the proper garage the

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.319
new one you built which is a class move

00:47:18.319 --> 00:47:20.640
that's a new money move but class move

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.480
yeah um did you have a refrigerator in

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:24.079
there

00:47:24.079 --> 00:47:27.440
oh no i i think we have a

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:28.559
no we didn't actually we had a

00:47:28.559 --> 00:47:30.319
refrigerator in our basement

00:47:30.319 --> 00:47:31.119
and

00:47:31.119 --> 00:47:32.880
we had a second floor my dad used to as

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.400
another hobby used to make bullets on

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.800
the second floor of the new garage

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.800
what make bullets you can make bullets

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.640
yeah if you buy something or something

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:41.839
you can buy bullet parts and make

00:47:41.839 --> 00:47:43.680
bullets so i used to make bullets up on

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.599
the second part of the garage this guy's

00:47:45.599 --> 00:47:47.760
a [ __ ] loose cannon this guy's gonna

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.760
end up on a list or something

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.760

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.200
armory on the second floor of the garage

00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.240
but no one's allowed to ride a dirt bike

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.359
yeah like it could explode he had

00:48:01.359 --> 00:48:04.319
gunpowder up there yeah exactly um so

00:48:04.319 --> 00:48:05.200

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.000
would put candles in the window she put

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.680
the cam plug in candles in the window so

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:20.480
we were doing candles yeah per window

00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:22.319
and then i i think we did lights once or

00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:23.440
twice and then they just stopped they're

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:24.640
like we're not doing this so it would be

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:26.400
like we had a couple elves on the stairs

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.400
and then put a candle in every window

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.240

foods or sprouts depending but sprouts

00:59:11.119 --> 00:59:13.440
sprouts is just another grocery store

near us

00:59:14.559 --> 00:59:16.240

nah it's not as like crazy as whole

00:59:17.839 --> 00:59:19.280
foods but it's it's definitely not it's

00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:20.960
like a step up from acme it's better

00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:22.880
than acme and then in terms of

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:25.040
organicness less than whole foods but

00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:27.119
still good comparison sounds fancy as

00:59:27.119 --> 00:59:28.960
[ __ ] yeah living the life down there i

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:32.240

in the 70s when people were just like

00:59:46.319 --> 00:59:47.839
that's not even a real thing nobody even

00:59:47.839 --> 00:59:49.440

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:50.880
witch they'd make fun of her all the

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:52.960
time for it and then so i have my mom's

00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:54.319
system with food i have like a bunch of

00:59:54.319 --> 00:59:55.599
weird food allergies that's why i have

00:59:55.599 --> 00:59:57.680

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.079
okay i don't really if i eat snacks i'll

01:00:10.079 --> 01:00:11.440

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.200
that's it did you get snacks growing up

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.119

01:00:17.599 --> 01:00:19.359
snacks were a battle she my mom had like

01:00:19.359 --> 01:00:21.119
a weird thing

01:00:21.119 --> 01:00:23.359
and then it was like so it was weird in

01:00:23.359 --> 01:00:25.200
terms of like salt levels like i would

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.599
eat i would when i snack wise growing up

01:00:27.599 --> 01:00:28.799
i would take

01:00:28.799 --> 01:00:30.559
uh like you know the 24 pack of bagel

01:00:30.559 --> 01:00:32.880
bites

01:00:33.119 --> 01:00:35.520
i think i could fit like nine bagel

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.040
bites or i think it was actually like 12

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.720
on a plate and i would microwave 12

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.880
bagel bites while that was going i would

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.799
i would put spaghettios and i would dip

01:00:42.799 --> 01:00:44.319
bagel bites and spaghettios and eat them

01:00:44.319 --> 01:00:45.680
and my mom wouldn't blink an eye but if

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:46.799
i ate like

01:00:46.799 --> 01:00:49.200
that's bad for you

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.640
that might be the trashiest meal we've

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:51.839
heard and we had somebody said they

01:00:51.839 --> 01:00:54.960
microwaved [ __ ] burgers last week

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:56.319
yeah i said microwave bagel bites you

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:57.280
got to eat them real quick because like

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.640
that by the end of it they would turn to

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.799
cement yeah you could eat the last one

01:01:00.799 --> 01:01:02.319
like chilling on it'd be tough dude it'd

01:01:02.319 --> 01:01:03.119
be like yeah

01:01:03.119 --> 01:01:04.960
yeah spaghettios with meatballs dude

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.880
growing up my snacks was [ __ ] up dude

i was eating real bad dude i forgot

01:01:09.119 --> 01:01:11.520
about spaghettios man we used to [ __ ]

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.000
have them all the time so [ __ ] good

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.760
they were so good yeah the meatballs are

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:18.960
good how bad must that have been for us

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:21.119
like was that even meat

01:01:21.119 --> 01:01:23.839
yeah i was i mean also too the sodium in

01:01:23.839 --> 01:01:25.839
those are like unbelievably through the

01:01:25.839 --> 01:01:27.040
roof

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.400
i would eat one of those every single

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.400
day can of spaghettios as many bagels

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.920
the bagel bites would eventually run out

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.760
there was like toaster toaster strudel

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.920
situation was like by the end of the

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.520
week you know they had like the icing

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.200
packets and the strudel yeah at the end

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.319
of the week you'd have to eat like a

01:01:40.319 --> 01:01:43.520
naked strudel that would be like yeah

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.280
but dude you had [ __ ] toaster shroom

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.640
man

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.720
yeah yeah we stepped up from pop-tarts

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:51.920
to toaster strudels and then we got the

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.599
toaster strudels taken away because we

01:01:53.599 --> 01:01:54.960
were fighting over icing packets because

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.559
people were doubling up sure yeah

01:01:56.559 --> 01:01:58.079
squirtles were definitely a conflict

01:01:58.079 --> 01:01:59.920
heavy snack

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.720
but for sure alliances are drawn yeah

01:02:41.119 --> 01:02:42.880
the back of a pickup truck but uh you

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:45.039

all right i just got one last question

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.480
for you and i think i think you're gonna

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.880
pass the test on this one um

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.400
growing up

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.039
your ketchup was kept in the fridge or

01:03:45.039 --> 01:03:46.960
in the cabinet

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.720
dude i don't know because i never used

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:51.359
ketchup i'm all barbecue sauce for any

01:03:51.359 --> 01:03:52.799
anything on ketchup i just use barbecue

01:03:52.799 --> 01:03:54.799
sauce but my wife keeps it in the

01:03:54.799 --> 01:03:57.760
cabinet and i think it we kept it in the

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.280
fridge i don't know honestly i have no

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:02.480
idea your wife keeps the ketchup in the

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.640
cabin yeah

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.240
you got to rethink this marriage i don't

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.520
know

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.920
is it serious how it's going on here

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.520
yeah she keeps it in the cab all right

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.359
here's the final question wait hold on

01:04:13.359 --> 01:04:14.880
put a pin in that what do you where do

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.559
you keep the barbecue sauce

01:04:16.559 --> 01:04:19.119
fridge okay yeah barbecue sauce

01:04:19.119 --> 01:04:20.079
making sure i'm not dealing with an

01:04:20.079 --> 01:04:22.079
animal over here

01:04:22.079 --> 01:04:23.680
i think you [ __ ] know a guy over here

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:24.960
he's not surprised i know this guy 10

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.079
[ __ ] years he's keeping his ketchup

01:04:26.079 --> 01:04:27.920
in the cabinet

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.599
and my last question is the syrup where

01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:31.280
would you keep the syrup in the cabinet

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.880
or in the fridge

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.640
but my mom would eat the my mom gets

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:36.079
like the maple she will get pure maple

01:04:36.079 --> 01:04:37.920
syrup

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.799
keep it in the cask

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.280
that's the final verdict right there

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.160
what are you talking about he just

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.880
answered [ __ ] every question as trash

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:49.280
is possible for the last 55 minutes he

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.200
keeps his his his sarah in the right

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.680
place also he's classy but this is

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:55.920
new money it's this to me he's like a

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.160
kennedy you know what i mean

01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.520
that's what everybody in my neighborhood

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.720
strives to be

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.400
did you hear them

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.240
sold the trash business they're doing

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.680
very well

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:07.839
they scammed some land off a couple guys

01:05:07.839 --> 01:05:09.839
out in garnet valley that will cook and

01:05:09.839 --> 01:05:12.000
met

01:05:12.319 --> 01:05:13.920
they're going to build a compound out

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.839
there the kids are going out there too

01:05:15.839 --> 01:05:17.839
well once i open syrup i'll put it in

01:05:17.839 --> 01:05:19.680
the fridge just for a good measure yeah

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.119
you gotta play it safe a little bit but

01:05:21.119 --> 01:05:22.559
i don't mind if the syrup is out of the

01:05:22.559 --> 01:05:24.720
fridge it's to me it doesn't matter i

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.839
gotta all right one more while we're on

01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:28.160
this these are all very recurring

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.799
uh butter did you keep it in the fridge

01:05:30.799 --> 01:05:32.960
or like on the counter growing up it was

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.799
out all day but it was not out as long

01:05:34.799 --> 01:05:36.400
as my aunt marsha's butter and milk

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.559
would sit out all like my cousins next

01:05:38.559 --> 01:05:40.480
door their milk would get a sip of milk

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:43.440
over there and it was always like

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.640
hang on a second there's something wrong

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:47.440
with my earphones

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:50.000
what'd you say warm milk water they

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.760

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.440
kids so like they were the cereal set up

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.720
was like you would use it the milk would

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.160
be in and out of the fridge like someone

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:56.880
would pour themselves in a bowl of

01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:58.079
cereal and leave that milk out the

01:05:58.079 --> 01:05:59.839
