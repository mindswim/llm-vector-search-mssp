i can't believe sorry for that break

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.880
you can't unless you guys what else you

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.559
guys got i can't take the story no

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:14.640
story's in that is so [ __ ] funny what

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.240
else you guys got huh what are we

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.160
working on i've only

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.640
watched 15 minutes of don't look up

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.480
what don't look up it was too liberal

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.760
for you

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.559
it was just all around like bad you know

00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:27.520
yeah

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.960
what bothered me the most was in the

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.640
beginning when they find out the

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.240
asteroids coming

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.760
like they just figured it out they're

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.600
like just doing the math what's the plot

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.559
i don't know the plot there's an

00:18:36.559 --> 00:18:38.720
asteroid that's going to hit earth

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.320
and it's better supposedly based on a

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.679
true story or something like that i

00:18:41.679 --> 00:18:42.799
thought it was i thought it was like an

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:44.960
analogy for climate change i think a

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.240
bunch of people like deny that the

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.840
asteroid's coming i guess yeah or

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.799
something

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:50.400
but in the very beginning they find out

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.760
that it's gonna

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.880
hit earth and they like the scientists

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.520
go into like full panic

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.960
look tell me this isn't happening this

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.120
is happening oh my god oh my god and

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.120
it's like no one would do that

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.200
nobody would do that you'd be like all

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.520
right well we gotta tell

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.200
the president

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.640
or whoever you got to tell joe biden

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.559
yeah yeah

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:14.640
joe mine's like what's happening what

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.240
happened

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.520
you wouldn't you wouldn't start

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.520
panicking until someone told you there

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.720
was no plan and were [ __ ]

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.600
right well aren't they the trajectory of

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.240
of these things are are noticeable for

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.440
years right

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.880
i think that's normally how it is but

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.679
this one

00:19:31.679 --> 00:19:33.520
is six months what year is this the 70s

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.679
no no this is like present day but you

00:19:35.679 --> 00:19:37.520
guessed the seventh i don't know because

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.720
he said they didn't know what they were

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.080
doing nobody knew what they were doing

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.160
in the 70s

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.880
except for the president was it 1850

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.480
what year was it

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.000
my dad had a telescope i know about

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.120
space

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.520
yeah we had a telescope yeah yeah i saw

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.960
hayley's comments i think it worked i

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.120
don't think it worked once once every 75

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.640
years it comes around i couldn't get my

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.400
eye i could never yes i could never

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.400
focus the telescope it's it's hard when

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.919
you're an adult to get your eye in the

00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:04.559
right spot to see the image

00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:06.080
let alone if you're a kid you're like

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.720
that doesn't work well he had a nice one

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.600
yeah

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.679

when he smoked and [ __ ]

00:20:39.919 --> 00:20:41.440
really yeah that's where that was his

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.640
little study room because the only place

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.320

sit there for a half hour no this is how

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.240
i got hemorrhoids yeah as a kid i would

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.720
sit and pretend that i was hosting a

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.000
talk show

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:14.880
and

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.720
my knees your knees would touch the tub

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.000
from the toilet

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.480
and i pretended like johnny carson and i

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.320
would bring an item from my bedroom like

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.679
a sneaker

00:21:23.679 --> 00:21:25.440
and then i would explain

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.400
to the

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.320
audience about the shower curtain about

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.880
my sneaker

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.799
pretend i was talking to an audience and

00:21:54.799 --> 00:21:56.480
i would sit there for way too long and i

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.720
developed hemorrhoids as a kid as a

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.400
young boy yeah

not doing homework

00:25:42.559 --> 00:25:44.080

once a while they'd knock in the door

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.559

do push-ups

00:32:41.279 --> 00:32:43.600

together yeah but you know i do with

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.839
everything when you live with a woman

i mean when i lived alone in an

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.240
apartment i would do it like if the hot

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.520
water ran out i'd start thinking about

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.960
other people in the apartment what the

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.560
[ __ ] they were like

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.720
just other floors yeah yeah would you

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.320
say you have maybe an accountability

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.839
issue

00:38:37.839 --> 00:38:39.280
maybe please

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.040
please

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.160
i think

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.000
he's not taking accountability for

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.920
possibly having an accountability yeah

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.920
yeah right somebody else did it that's

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.359
another thing you can't call them out no

00:38:49.359 --> 00:38:51.680
i'm a cat i'm really upset let me count

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.839
i hate myself no you don't i do you're

00:38:53.839 --> 00:38:55.359
getting there i'm accountable you're

00:38:55.359 --> 00:38:57.040
turning around i have an accurate selfie

00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:00.480
your boat is slowly turning in that tube

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.480
pretty clear picture of where i'm at

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.599
that's why i'm always looking at the

00:39:03.599 --> 00:39:05.520
ground

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.520
that's why i'm almost staring off into

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.960
space next time you look at the ground

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.480
grab a broom that's awesome most of the

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.680
time when i'm staring off into space

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:12.960
it's just like i don't think i'm ever

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.480
going to be able to change this

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.160
yeah you're not yeah you're not you're

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.240
getting worse yeah you're fully grown

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:20.320
since i met you yeah you've deteriorated

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:23.920
really quite a bit yeah really right now

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.760
i think you just know me better yeah

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.599
that's usually how

00:39:27.599 --> 00:39:30.000
that's absolutely how that works yeah i

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.359
do remember a phone call where there was

00:39:31.359 --> 00:39:34.320
a pizza crust in your house for like

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.680
you told me this we were on the phone

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.800
you're like this pete this thing's

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.920
killing me and i was like what you're

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.200
like there's a pizza crust that's been

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.880
on top of my toilet for

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.640
a week and a half

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.720
dude you just gotta throw it out like i

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.000
had to talk you into this wait was it

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.079
yours yeah yeah he lived alone he just

00:39:48.079 --> 00:39:49.599
was eating pizza in the bathroom and put

00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:51.680
it crust on the toilet and left it there

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.000
for a week and a half

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.520
how many pisses he and shits he took

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:58.079
just looking at it and just being like

00:39:58.079 --> 00:39:59.359
i gotta turn things around all right

00:39:59.359 --> 00:40:00.720
let's dissect this where do you think

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.079
that comes from where you can't pick up

00:40:02.079 --> 00:40:04.160
and clean stuff

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.680
i don't know i just feel like i'm always

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.240
working on

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.880
[ __ ] something you talking about you

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.440
know yeah real workaholic

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.640
that's what i'm saying it's even if it's

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.040
just a thought it's like i'm i'm turning

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.200
something over and i can't like

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.560
do you know that's probably why you're

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.000
so cluttered up here is because all your

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.680
space is cluttered there's a

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.359
psychological component there where like

00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:27.599
your workspace is

00:40:27.599 --> 00:40:29.200
a mirror image of what's going on in

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.800
your mind i don't know this is kind of

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.480
the happiest i've been in a long time in

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.240
my room because i'm cleaning up after no

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.880
no no no my room has been the messiest

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.400
it's ever been

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.480
but this is i've like a genuine i doubt

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.440
that

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.520
what no she he cleaned it he cleaned it

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.359
because he needs a woman in his life to

00:40:45.359 --> 00:40:47.119
shame him because our shame he doesn't

00:40:47.119 --> 00:40:49.040
do anything well i don't i try not to

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.640
shame you yeah

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.200
i don't shame you for that stuff

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.319
i don't throw rocks in that glass house

00:40:56.319 --> 00:40:58.000
you'll find another glass house oh i

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.119
found it

00:40:59.119 --> 00:41:00.560
everything else

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.720
any mood i'm in it's got to be changed

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:03.839
well

00:41:03.839 --> 00:41:05.760
this is your favorite thing to do yeah a

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.359
lot it's funny yeah

00:41:07.359 --> 00:41:08.720
yeah but when it's when it's you being a

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.040
grumpus for no reason

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:13.280
that's i then i'm genuinely like

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.319
hey

00:41:14.319 --> 00:41:16.560
yeah i'll just match his energy yeah

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.839
okay just give you an idea like what we

00:41:18.839 --> 00:41:21.359
see i'm not i don't even realize i'm

00:41:21.359 --> 00:41:24.079
doing it i'm not doing anything

00:41:24.079 --> 00:41:25.599
someone else you come in and he goes

00:41:25.599 --> 00:41:26.740
like this

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.990
[Laughter]

00:41:30.079 --> 00:41:32.640
and his eyebrows go up and go what like

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.800
like i'm bothering him with life no i

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.200
never get well no sometimes if i'm

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.200
watching something

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.640
well

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.000
if you always have this face like you

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.359
like you're thinking about digging up

00:41:43.359 --> 00:41:44.960
the wife you just killed

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.280
like i want her back

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.880
that's a recurring nightmare that i have

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.400
every couple of years

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.480
what's that is i'm like walking with a

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.000
group of people and we come to like a

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.200
hill

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.319
and uh oh yeah you've told me yeah and

00:41:58.319 --> 00:42:00.960
i'm like oh this is where i buried all

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.960
of those bodies

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.800
every one of them's in here and they're

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.319
gonna find them

00:42:06.319 --> 00:42:09.359
how do i move them also i gotta remember

00:42:09.359 --> 00:42:10.800
that i buried these people here because

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.319
i'm gonna i gotta move them at some

00:42:12.319 --> 00:42:13.200
point

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.119
yeah this is a recurring nightmare yeah

00:42:15.119 --> 00:42:17.040
it's like every every couple years i get

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.800
it and it'll be like it'll be i'll be in

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.040
like a totally different dream having a

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.640
fine time then all of a sudden that hill

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.960
shows

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.880
having a nice time and all of a sudden

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:30.000
that hill shows up and it's like gotta

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.319
get rid of these bodies god dude and i

00:42:32.319 --> 00:42:34.160
can't believe you've been living this

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.440
whole time

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:38.480
like you didn't put bodies in this hill

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.640
so that's like that's the feeling that

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.280
i've had you've been walking around

never really gave a [ __ ] and i never had

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.160
like something to look forward to yeah

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.520
weekly basis

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.119
support and support of all our other

00:43:51.119 --> 00:43:52.319
friends that are

00:43:52.319 --> 00:43:54.000
in this circle so it's like it's kicked

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.599
off to a point where like it's it's

00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:57.920
actually i haven't felt this happy in a

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.720
while yeah it is weird that comedy's in

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:02.160
the place where it's like if you don't

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.560
have a podcast you feel like you're not

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.000
a person really

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.440
i was always just trying to avoid it

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.520
what i was avoiding it for the wrong is

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.119
that a gay thing to say i think it's

00:44:11.119 --> 00:44:12.160
kind of well you said if you don't have

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.160
a podcast you don't feel like a person

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.880
no no well like in the in the comedy

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:19.280
world it feels like you're like not

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.520
doing you know what i mean

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.040
it's weird like you're like hanging out

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.160
with people you're like talking to

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:25.119
people

00:44:25.119 --> 00:44:26.880
and like i don't know

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.480
when you don't have anything to promote

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:29.760
is that what you're saying yeah it's

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.440
like you like i don't know well that's

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.960
just the two kind of the worlds in

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.400
comedy right now it's either you're a

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.720
[ __ ] industry person that's getting

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.480
everything true or you have to sit down

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.240
and talk with your buddies about how

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.560
shitty of roommates they are yeah sure

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.960
those are your options yeah yeah

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.920
which one leads to actually a fruitful

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.599
respectful career

00:44:49.599 --> 00:44:51.839
yeah selling out clubs you [ __ ] if

00:44:51.839 --> 00:44:54.160
you have a successful podcast

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:57.119
yeah i think you do sell a lot like you

00:44:57.119 --> 00:44:58.640
get you

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.000
everybody in the audience knows you a

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.680
lot more which

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.079
i think has its pros and cons right you

00:45:04.079 --> 00:45:06.240
know yippee and chatty they chat a

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.079
little but that's fine but

00:45:08.079 --> 00:45:10.400
i mean i guess they get jokes better

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:11.839
yeah like they know where you're coming

00:45:11.839 --> 00:45:13.280
from on everything so that helps like

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.280
i've seen it with matt yeah like matt's

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.280
stand-up's great now not that it wasn't

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.560
then i hear you saying but now that

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:19.839
everyone is perspective because he's a

00:45:19.839 --> 00:45:21.680
weirdo so he would go on stage and be

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.079
weird and do goofy [ __ ] that is funny

00:45:24.079 --> 00:45:25.680
but regular people would see him and be

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.280
like what the [ __ ] is this guy doing

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:28.480
yeah right and when you're only doing

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.000
like 10 minutes or something somewhere

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
it's like it's taking takes you five you

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
have to be like oh this is

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.760
yeah he's this is intentional where do

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:38.000
you hear the boat bit

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.400
the boat roar the boat bit rory's gonna

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.960
[ __ ] shoot a boat talk about the

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.960
boats

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:55.920
took off that was the first glimpse of

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.200
like oh [ __ ]

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.200
how what's the story behind that it was

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.280
something about a turret at a rest stop

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.040
and then i opened the door

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.880
at our the hotel room and chris was

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.400
sitting there like the turd and the rest

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.400
stop something like that and then me and

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.359
bees are

00:46:09.359 --> 00:46:11.520
in the car just started calling the turd

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.520
it's [ __ ] funny it was such a funny

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.040
nickname it is frightening the influence

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.880
you have and it was a six hour drive

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.079
that was that was the first time you

00:46:18.079 --> 00:46:19.599
could just destroy someone because then

00:46:19.599 --> 00:46:21.200
we did shows

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:24.000
and dudes in the audience like

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.400
yo this is hilarious well he was saying

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.000
it in the car ride home because he was

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.119
you're going home and you're going to

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:30.960

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.440
turret on the phone

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.200
and i was like don't do that you know

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.960
what i should say i'm going to do it i

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.480

all right i want i want i won't and then

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.720
the next time there was a silence in the
