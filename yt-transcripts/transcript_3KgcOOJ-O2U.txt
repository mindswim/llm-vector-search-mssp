00:37:23.599 --> 00:37:25.520
you look like if notre dame had a mascot

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.960
for their magic the gathering team

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.280
ilya's a lawyer and he's so fat whenever

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.119
the judge says order in the court he

00:37:37.119 --> 00:37:38.720
answers i'll take a number 5 with a

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:42.040
large 5.

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:45.310
[Applause]

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.800
judge they don't say that um

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.480
sean actually used to wrestle in high

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.720
school which is surprising because you

00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:59.839
look like you've never experienced

00:37:59.839 --> 00:38:04.040
physical human contact before

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.960
um okay like i said ellie's a lawyer and

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.720
i hope he's not a bad lawyer because

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.160
that would mean he and his clients are

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:13.640
both in cells

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.519
[Applause]

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.000
sean's a video editor i know you guys

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.599
are thinking why does child porn need

00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:28.839
video editing

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.359
[Laughter]

00:38:33.359 --> 00:38:36.400
some good timing right there

00:38:37.359 --> 00:38:39.359
are you done

00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:43.040
yeah that's what the laughter was okay

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.560
all right any game of thrones fans here

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.760
amazing

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.280
i mean i feel like ilia kind of looks

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.920
like the creator george rr martin but if

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:56.200
the rr stood for really [ __ ]

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:59.380
[Applause]

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.520

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.839
sean you orange creep you look like a

00:39:13.839 --> 00:39:17.200

strong gentiles win and uh

00:39:47.119 --> 00:39:48.320
you know i was impressed with both of

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.560
you guys but uh yeah i think gardening

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.240
has got a slight advantage here all

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.920
right shayna what do you think honestly

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.160

00:39:59.119 --> 00:40:02.160
stupid you both look on stage

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.720

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.839

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.119

00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:30.480
starting with ilya round two starts

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.359
now

00:40:31.359 --> 00:40:33.760
thank you

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.240

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.240
sean you look like you own a fleshlight

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.920
i don't mean the sex toy i mean a lamp

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.960
made of human skin

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.839
you [ __ ] ghoulish freak

00:40:49.839 --> 00:40:51.440
i didn't know people still got scurvy i

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.480
don't even want to roast you i want to

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.560
give you a multivitamin

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:55.920
you're the kind of pale skin you can

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.359
only get by living in a woman's attic

00:40:57.359 --> 00:41:00.240
with other knowledge

00:41:01.359 --> 00:41:03.200
gardenia is actually an italian name it

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.119
derives from the italian word for garden

00:41:05.119 --> 00:41:06.800
which is interesting right for instance

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.880
in the sentence when sean was a kid he

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.480
used to torture and kill small animals

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.680
before burying them in his parents

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.240
gardenini

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:19.560
i only killed the jewish animals

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.659
[Music]

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.920
um ilia got circumcised at the old age

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.800
of 16 years old

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.400
and that's true not by choice that's

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.839
just how long it took the doctors to

00:41:31.839 --> 00:41:35.160
find it

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.160
no but ilia was such a bad athlete in

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.520
high school he never tried out for a

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:44.880
team and still ended up getting cut

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.160
but getting circumcised at 16 was rough

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.000
for ilia mainly because none of its

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.599
classmates wanted to sign his cast

00:41:54.079 --> 00:41:54.800
but

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.200
last job all right but there was an

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.960
upside he did end up getting to use his

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:03.480
foreskin as a corsage at the prom

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.000
fight club give it up for round two of

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.880
your main event

00:42:10.079 --> 00:42:11.599
go to our judges six what are you

00:42:11.599 --> 00:42:14.400
thinking after round two again very good

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.079
but i think gardening still has the edge

00:42:16.079 --> 00:42:18.640
on it i like sean in this one all right

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.280
shaner i like showing a lot but uh eli i

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.960
think you had a [ __ ]

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.119
it was great uh the back and forth there

00:42:25.119 --> 00:42:26.800
you [ __ ] nailed it on that one

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.800
awesome yeah i'm really struggling with

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:32.160
my anti-semitism because

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.520
i feel like the dude with the old

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.200
testament name might have edged that out

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.560
a little bit

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.319
you might have edged that out

00:42:38.319 --> 00:42:40.319
all right really close

00:42:40.319 --> 00:42:41.920
wood what are you thinking after round

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.040
two

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.880
sean made me think about his dick skin

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.920
so

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.500
ilia wins that round

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.359
[Laughter]

00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:50.400

his life

00:44:59.119 --> 00:45:00.640
the proposal only took five minutes the

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.240
rest of time was how long it took ilya

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:05.839
to get up off his knee

00:45:07.119 --> 00:45:10.440

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.520
good but i'm gonna i'm gonna give it a

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:03.520

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:07.359
[ __ ] good

00:47:07.359 --> 00:47:09.760
matt mccusker yeah it was good it was

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.000
definitely it was a barn burner

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.480
and i'll i'll be specific in my feedback

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.480
um

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.720
it was very close but where

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.480
ilia where you missed you had a couple

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:21.599
jokes

00:47:21.599 --> 00:47:23.040
that i think you were talking about

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.040
yourself

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.559
specifically the one especially we were

00:47:26.559 --> 00:47:27.920
talking about like living in your mom's

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:29.040
attic

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.040
yes that seemed more like a you thing

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.480
than a gardener

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.960
but i say you did a phenomenal job i

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:36.960
give it to gardenia i do another vote

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:39.119
for gardini he's got it wrapped up but

00:47:39.119 --> 00:47:41.220

yeah uh guardian took that uh

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.119
but the one the one moment he almost

00:47:47.119 --> 00:47:49.280

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.200
ago

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.280

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.040
chromosomes and that was the fight that

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:57.440
was it you had him he [ __ ] rolled it

00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.119
though it was close

00:47:59.119 --> 00:48:01.760
gardeini though another vote for sean he

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.359
