i might dude i mean

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.280
take this as it is but i'm real into

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.199
black i identify politically as a black

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.959
conservative right now

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.160
black conservatism is the absolute death

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.440
of so you sjw you identify as a black

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.759
conservative because why then you can

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:29.360
just be a conservative and not be called

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.759
a racist

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:32.960
pretty much yeah

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.479
you have to think about that i'm like uh

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:35.840
i'm pretty much black oh black

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.919
conservative no politically well in

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.759
today's world there's

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:43.199
it's all imaginary like force fields and

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.800
like i can shoot you but you can't hit

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.639
me it's like i'm wearing a force field

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:47.759
you can't hit me

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.360
so a black conservative when they come

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.639
out they're like i'm conservative and

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.400
they're like oh that means you're racist

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.000
i'm shooting you with bullets and he's

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.280
like i have a force field that you can't

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.440
hit with bullets dude it exactly is that

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.960
but then if you i watch a lot of black

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.880
conservative youtubers and they tell a

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.320
lot of their white subscribers they're

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.120
like

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.240
stop letting these people call you

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.759
racist [ __ ] them there's just say what

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:06.880

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.960
dude so can you no no that's not how

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.240
that works i know but he's like don't

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.759
let them even bully you for a second

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.039
dude he's like just get out there don't

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:24.479
want to bully you you'll [ __ ] get

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:25.840
fired

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.440
that's getting bullied i mean that is

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.240
true that's true the far left is just

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.680
[ __ ] it's they're getting it

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.919
but so this is my i don't even remember

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.680
my whole point but

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.360
yes i'm a black conservative now and

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.880
you're a black conservative and you're

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.000
going to meet jordan peterson yeah i'm

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.800
going to meet you at jp so is what it is

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.880
oh so this is my whole point sorry

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.880
so then like when guys like jp come out

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.960
and make conservatism kind of cool for

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.520
younger people democrats freak the [ __ ]

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.240
out because if democrats lose

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.120
95 of black people vote democrat yeah if

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.479
they lose like i think it's i don't know

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:01.600
the exact number but it's something like

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.160
15 to 20 of the black vote the democrat

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.240
democratic party can't win it's they

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.600

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.879
that as that guy should have crushed

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:20.879
that guy yeah that's my thing when they

00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:22.080

black people are stratified economically

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.839
when people talk about the black

00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:35.599
community they just mean poor black

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:37.440
people and liberals want to convince

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.719
black people that they're all poor and

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:40.159
oppressed and that they need the

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.000
democratic party to help them

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.440

that part of my life i don't like the

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.000
government blocking websites i hope they

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.920
block porn dude why because you don't

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.680
need it dude yeah but that's not for the

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.360
government to decide if you can watch

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.440
porn or not that's i mean can 10 year

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.040
olds smoke cigarettes the government's

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.120
the government mandates smoking and

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.800
alcohol purchases

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.600
poor's not good doesn't cause cancer

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.320
yeah but societal causes are 18 18 and

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.000
older what if they do

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.320
what if they did a study dude i mean

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.920
imagine yeah you can get it but you're

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.440
not supposed to imagine if you can just

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.600
buy liquor online liquor is not like one

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.120
click shopping though

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.800
so it's like porn is a different thing

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.399
and apparently imagine they did a study

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:28.399
that said like they it definitely

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:30.079
caused erectile dysfunction in younger

00:10:30.079 --> 00:10:31.680
kids who grew up with porn who were

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.760
never in the analog world like at least

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.680
i was in the animal i jerked off i think

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.959
we even said this before i've jerked off

00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:39.360
to enough kohl's catalogs where i'm safe

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.600
so wait you're

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.920
pro-legalization of marijuana yes

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.720
anti-legalization of pornography no

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.360
doubt okay no doubt if they blocked it

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.560
i'm just saying i wouldn't even have a

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.240
political take yo that's just my

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.680
political take dude yeah you're allowed

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.000
to i mean it's a good i would if they if

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.519
it was a secret ballot because this is a

00:10:55.519 --> 00:10:57.040
democracy so if it was like here's the

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.959
issues what do you i would just go

00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:01.040
yes legalize we'd be like pro

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.279
they said yes no anti-porn don't stop

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:05.360
the assault rifles they're cool

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.680
look i just think they're [ __ ] cool

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.560
and then it said porn i would go get it

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.320
out of here dude you're done with porn

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.200
enough get it out i'm this is a good you

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.959
know porn killed all those kids at sandy

00:11:16.959 --> 00:11:19.040
hook right porn yeah that was porn that

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.560
broke in there

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.839
people are trying to blame the assault

00:11:21.839 --> 00:11:24.320
rifles but it's actually hey i mean dude

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.000
i didn't mean assault rifles ar-15s

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.360
excuse me assault i mean here's the

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.120
thing too with assault right you can ban

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.800
if they ban assault rifles i think okay

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.519
it's not going to stop crazed [ __ ]

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:34.959
wingnuts who are out to hurt a bunch of

00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:35.760
people

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.839
i think it would help

00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:38.880
i think

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.560
gun control would help yeah then they

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.480
start looking into explosives dude yeah

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.680
let's get rid of that i think isis

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.959
[ __ ] you can't get rid of you can't

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:46.160
get rid of the main ingredients for

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.760
explosives all right you can't isis

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.200
can't get assault rifles that easy what

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.120
do they do they build [ __ ] claymore

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.200
bombs and blow up isis can get a hold of

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.720
assault rifles pretty easy yeah but what

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.920
do they do when they can't not all of

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:56.880
them can

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.240
they have a lot of

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.399
a lot of ak-47s yeah but they what do

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:01.839
they do if they can't they build bombs

00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:03.519
they take vans and run them into people

00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:05.440
yeah

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.600
so you you mean like in england

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.279
yeah and europe like that version yeah

00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:10.959
or even before they got their hands on

00:12:10.959 --> 00:12:12.880
that [ __ ] they would bomb stuff yeah

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.079
then it's like where they get the bombs

00:12:14.079 --> 00:12:15.200
they could have been you know yeah

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.120
they're getting pretty good bombs yeah

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.120
no you can make bombs pretty easy easier

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.320
than you think i don't think isis is

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.720
making fertilizer bombs

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.639
i think they're using like chemicals

00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:27.360
like ied bombs that are like you can't i

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.880
i will say i'm just speaking a little

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.040
bit out of terms of bomb-making i think

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.360
my one friend made like a very small

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.600
smoke bomb in fourth grade so i've i've

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.600
you've definitely liberated yeah i i've

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.000
met you know some explosives dabbled and

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000

the one time they built a fertilizer

00:12:54.079 --> 00:12:55.519

around myself yeah but it's back there

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.480
it's in there if the government steps

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.839
online too much

00:13:01.839 --> 00:13:03.680
if they keep legalizing porn you'll be

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.440
able to fertilize bomb something i'm

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.120

bombing anyone i'm gonna fertilize bomb

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.240
the monk debates dude if they don't

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.279
knock that [ __ ] off dude

00:13:15.279 --> 00:13:17.120
that was that i mean this is the last

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.800
i've gotten so political dude but it's

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.639
like you are very political they can't

00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:23.279
do those sjw debates they got to start

00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:25.200
thinking of like they can't have black

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.120
dude lady versus two white guys that was

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.959
[ __ ] they should have given two

00:13:28.959 --> 00:13:30.560
white guys won

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.120
they did but it's still imagine how much

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.320
clearer they would have got their points

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.399
across if they could if jp could have

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:38.320
tagged in the conservative black guy

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.920
because there's so many things he can't

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.920
[ __ ] say to you but think how

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.279
from the other side of that think how

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:45.120
unfair it is if you're like i'm a

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.440
political correctness advocate

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.880
and it's like all right

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.040
we're having a debate who is it it's two

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.720
white guys

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.639
that'll be tough who do we get

00:13:54.639 --> 00:13:56.800
oh a jew brought in a black dude [ __ ]

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.120
we're double he was no he was admit dude

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.800
he was so prepared for that with his

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.560
minister [ __ ] dude when he started when

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.639
he as soon as he talked and he was like

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:06.480
a lot of you may think man we got to

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.000

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
ahead well it's you can find it on

youtube it's pretty great it's called

00:14:11.199 --> 00:14:13.519
the monk debates and this is a guy named

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:14.720
dyson

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.120
and a chick goldstein yeah i think from

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.560
sarah maybe i don't know she was writing

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.000
from the new york times the failing new

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.600
york times i believe

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.839
and uh it was jordan peterson the great

00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:24.959
doctor

00:14:24.959 --> 00:14:26.240
and uh

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.199
fry

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:29.360
stephen fry he was great man gay jewish

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.199
british guy he was a [ __ ] he he

00:14:31.199 --> 00:14:32.800
was good he's very liberal too so that

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.519
was

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:35.199
that was nice and hit i agreed with him

00:14:35.199 --> 00:14:37.600
more than i think anyone yeah about me

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.680
he was the one who could actually

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.120
whenever i try to like do the thing

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.560
where i stand outside the parties and

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.240
talk like yeah but i never it never

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.279
makes sense because i just sound like an

00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:46.639
idiot he doesn't sound like idiots he

00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:48.639
was so good at just being like outside

00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:49.920
the parties and be like yeah and then he

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.519
called that guy a snake oil [ __ ]

00:14:51.519 --> 00:14:53.760
salesman dude and it was it it was in

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.680
canada and he was like oh political

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.440
correctness he's like

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.040
you guys have it here

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.920
how's it going yeah you guys how's it

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.600
going how do you like it yeah well that

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.519
and the thing that did piss me off about

00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:07.120
this debate and they did it like we're

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.079
so anti-pc dude we're so [ __ ] edgy

00:15:10.079 --> 00:15:11.279
the one thing the lady said that

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:12.880
actually made a lot of sense that i saw

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.800
was like she was like well pc first came

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.000
around and people were mad that like

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.519
they couldn't say [ __ ] anymore and it

00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:18.880
was like

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.560
fair enough

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.399
oh that was like but then but then she

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:23.680
was like but then i went to a trump

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.440
rally and people were voting for trump

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.360
just so they could say racist jokes they

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.120
they told me and it's like yeah you

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.959
heard one guy say like you can't say

00:15:30.959 --> 00:15:32.160
anything anymore and you're like well

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.160
okay this is trump's opera it's like

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.519
all right that

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:37.440
she she went off she skidded off she had

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.440
a nice opener and just skittered off the

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.600
[ __ ] deep end of just [ __ ]

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.399
but

00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:43.680
it was uh

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.800
again though

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.000
well the interesting thing i was telling

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.600
you is how they they try to quantify

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.959
like who won and they pulled the

00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:50.720
audience before and it was like

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.320
roughly 70 percent

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.560
against the thinking pc culture is bad

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.000
for society 30

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.240
thinking it enhances society after the

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.920
debate the people who thought it

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.160
enhanced society dropped six percent was

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.079
up on the against its side so they they

00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:06.160
dissuaded some people yeah so but

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.399
imagine dude if they had

00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:10.160
even not even jordan p if you just had

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.079
[ __ ] stephen fry black conservative

00:16:12.079 --> 00:16:14.079
but they needed jordan p because he was

00:16:14.079 --> 00:16:16.079
the ticket that's ticket sales i mean

00:16:16.079 --> 00:16:18.160
the the real debate was between jordan p

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.000
and dyson yeah and jordan i think was

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.560
slashing him up he destroyed him cry

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.160
dyson does that [ __ ] [ __ ] where he'd

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.240
be like yeah oh what but you you don't

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.519
need to understand you're standing

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:29.519
outside of your own away to privilege

00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:30.800

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.520
going to drop some leaks too you guys

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.440
drop some breadcrumbs you're figuring

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.039
things out i gotta again it's funny

00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:37.280
because i do follow that i'll just say

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.039
this dude i follow the q a on and it's

00:21:39.039 --> 00:21:41.280
funny to it's interesting to watch this

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.200
like thinking this guy drops breadcrumbs

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.240
and people like because like he'll just

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.200
say like

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.799
why yeah he'll ask like 20 questions

00:21:46.799 --> 00:21:48.400
what's the queuing on explain it to

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.400
somebody who has really no idea so

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.440
starting in like 4chan and 8 channel

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.840
slow down on that too what's that

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.039
i don't know what the [ __ ] it is dude

00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:58.799
4chan and a-chan are just these like

00:21:58.799 --> 00:22:01.280
trump board they're like guys they're

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.559
like they were i think they were the

00:22:02.559 --> 00:22:04.080
response to like

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.880
uh anti they're like anti-pc type guys

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.960
who like started getting behind trump

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.320
and then their their message i guess

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.600
about all this stuff then some guy

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.760
dropped into that as q anon

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.880
like to predict that podesta and huma

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.039
dean were going to be indicted

00:22:19.039 --> 00:22:20.559
never happened

00:22:20.559 --> 00:22:22.480
so and there was like speculation about

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.159
huma dean getting indicted but like no

00:22:24.159 --> 00:22:27.360
one knows for sure and uh so like but

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.919
then like who's uma dean uh anthony

00:22:29.919 --> 00:22:32.080
weiner's wife and hillary clinton's like

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.400
top advisor okay back in the day

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.840
so

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.039
the uh

00:22:37.039 --> 00:22:39.600
he drops he'll like say like

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.280
like think about pay attention to saudi

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.799
arabia or like write essay like pay

00:22:42.799 --> 00:22:44.159
attention to saudi arabia what about

00:22:44.159 --> 00:22:46.159
this look out for this blah blah blah

00:22:46.159 --> 00:22:48.880
and it was purported that he

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.640
so he was wrong about huma dean and

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.840
anthony madine and the other guy podesta

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.799
but

00:22:54.799 --> 00:22:57.200
he kind he like sent out like a defcon

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.080
one

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.080
non-nuclear blah blah blah like two days

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.720
before the fake hawaiian missile crisis

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.400
so people some people started because

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.600
everyone's like he's a shield [ __ ] him

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.880
he's a larper which is like when you go

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.240
on message boards you can pretend to be

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.520
a government agent

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.919
so he's been like kind of he also kind

00:23:11.919 --> 00:23:13.679
of predicted that when they toppled that

00:23:13.679 --> 00:23:15.679
one saudi arabia rich family when they

00:23:15.679 --> 00:23:17.600
all got in trouble that was a few days

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.600
before that but then he came back

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.880
retroactively and here's where it gets

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.880
shady where he was like yeah i had to

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.960
say that [ __ ] about uh

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.559
what you're gonna call it

00:23:26.559 --> 00:23:28.159
i i fake

00:23:28.159 --> 00:23:29.679
i threw in bad breadcrumbs about

00:23:29.679 --> 00:23:31.760
indicting huma dean on purpose because i

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.280
had to throw off the other side just to

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.559
give them something to worry about so we

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:35.919
could do other stuff so like he set it

00:23:35.919 --> 00:23:37.840
up to where like he can make predictions

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.120
if they're not true it's like yeah i did

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.960
that on purpose if they are true but

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.559
then again it was pretty specific about

00:23:42.559 --> 00:23:44.400
the [ __ ] defcon one and then the fake

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.679
missile crisis

00:23:45.679 --> 00:23:47.039
but it's like it goes dude you can go

00:23:47.039 --> 00:23:48.159
down this rabbit hole of this [ __ ]

00:23:48.159 --> 00:23:49.200
because they're all sounds like you're

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.880
in the rabbit hole i love no i don't i

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.080
don't really believe get out of this i

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.120
don't really believe in it because this

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.240
is all attractive i think it's

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.280
interesting

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.360
i mean my rabbit i'm i'm always on a

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.320
metal level so my very metal my metal my

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.159
meta rabbit hole is like

00:24:02.159 --> 00:24:04.480
they're the net the narrative of q anon

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.480
is that like donald trump is a freedom

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.559
utter freedom fighter dude who's okay so

00:24:08.559 --> 00:24:10.400
that's wrong who's been asked donald

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.120
trump is a con man who's a [ __ ] idiot

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.559
you think that dude because you're lit

00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:16.320
but they were saying no he really

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.080
listened to the whole narrative he got

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.919
asked to run they're thinking maybe he

00:24:19.919 --> 00:24:22.720
got asked to run by the military the top

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.640
military people because they there's a

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.919
coup going on right now between the

00:24:25.919 --> 00:24:26.960
three they call them three letter

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.240
agencies cia fbi nsa so

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.200
the

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.320
intelligence top military

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.840
like generals and admirals they were

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.960
sitting around they were watching the

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.559
apprentice and they were like we need

00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:38.400
the ultimate freedom fighter yo how

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.320
about this [ __ ] who's been on the

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.000
howard stern show i don't understand i

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.760
don't unders i i can't say i understand

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.320
all this stuff

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.600
this is the

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.960
the thing right now that they say that

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.760
there's a huge fight between the cia fbi

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.480
nsa and military intelligence and

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.640
military intelligence is undermining

00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.600
under

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.559
under executive orders they can totally

00:25:02.559 --> 00:25:04.720
occupy and undermine the cia fbi and all

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.720
that stuff yeah so that's what q anon is

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.200
claiming is going on slowly trump's

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.200
leveraging the military intelligence to

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.960
completely take over the cia fbi and nsa

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.799
so that's like the q and i thing but the

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:18.000
thing is it's saying like we're

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.679
entrenched in like this evil government

00:25:19.679 --> 00:25:21.600
so in my head it's like

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.720
not a lot of people trust in the

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.159
government are taking very seriously who

00:25:24.159 --> 00:25:26.320
are about 20 to you know 40 something

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.400
yeah so in my head it's like the

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.200
ultimate conspiracy is staging this fake

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.360
coup to get a bunch of people believing

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.039
in the government again to be like oh my

00:25:35.039 --> 00:25:36.960

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.880
sensitive story in quotes the trigger

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.559
for them cnn is they know the material

00:26:58.559 --> 00:27:00.159
was discussed in the brief and presented

00:27:00.159 --> 00:27:02.720
as an attachment oh my god holy [ __ ] bro

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.840
what are we gonna do

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.039
i don't know i just read it i'm like

00:27:05.039 --> 00:27:07.120
holy [ __ ] it's [ __ ] coming dude

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.960
trump's bringing the storm

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.039
allegedly or again i again i stand on

00:27:11.039 --> 00:27:12.720
another level being like this could all

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.679
be so this is like tabloid stuff for

00:27:15.679 --> 00:27:17.440
incels i mean dude if you're if you're

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.360
the republican party

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:20.720
it could be yeah it could be that so

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.320
this is but it's like national enquirer

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.880
for insells dude how do you like the

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.120
democrats control the young vote pretty

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.200
much across the board in america how do

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.640
you get younger people engaged in

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.360
politics tabloids wild ass conspiracy

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.440
theory on the q and on this is like if

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.200
this is a political

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.080
thing

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.520
or like a political scheme it's

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.720
ingenious

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.000
because dude that would totally get

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.360
people to vote republican again it'd be

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.799
like holy [ __ ] the republicans but they

00:27:44.799 --> 00:27:46.159
do say it's outside the party though

00:27:46.159 --> 00:27:47.520
they say like dude republicans are

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.840
implicated in this so are democrats

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.320
so i i mean i don't know yet dude i miss

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.159
on the almost on the forefront

00:27:54.159 --> 00:27:56.640
like with everybody else

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.480
what you looking at i'm just looking at

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.000
this this article i read last night

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.080
about uh and this is just such a

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.840
political episode it is dude this is

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.039
what this is

00:28:05.039 --> 00:28:07.760
the [ __ ] height of politics right now

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.679
there's a guy named richard rorty

00:28:09.679 --> 00:28:12.880
he's a liberal liberal philosopher okay

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.120
but uh he had a he had a pretty sick

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.320
prediction of trump's rise in 98.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.120
and this is he's dead he died in 2007

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.320
but uh

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.600
this is his his passage that he wrote

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.399
you know in 1998 but basically about

00:28:28.399 --> 00:28:29.919
kind of what happened so sorry that this

00:28:29.919 --> 00:28:31.520
is boring listener but i thought this

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.559
was really interesting let's have it

00:28:32.559 --> 00:28:34.480
dude stop apologizing said members of

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.320
labor unions and unorganized unskilled

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.000
workers will sooner or later realize

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.520
that their government is not even trying

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.520
to prevent wages from sinking or to

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.919
prevent jobs from being exported around

00:28:43.919 --> 00:28:45.600
the same time they will realize that

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.080
suburban white-collar workers themselves

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.000
desperately afraid of being downsized

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.919
are not going to let themselves be taxed

00:28:51.919 --> 00:28:53.679
or provide social benefits for anyone

00:28:53.679 --> 00:28:54.480
else

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.200
at that point something will crack

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.600
the non-suburban electorate will decide

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.120
that the system has failed and start

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.440
looking for a strong man to vote for

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.440
someone willing to assure them that once

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.279
he is elected the smug bureaucrats

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:09.760
tricky lawyers overpaid bond salesmen

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.919
and post-modernist professors will no

00:29:11.919 --> 00:29:14.320
longer be calling the shots whoa and the

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.159
strong man has appeared dude it's donald

00:29:16.159 --> 00:29:18.559
trump yeah did he call this in 98 yeah

00:29:18.559 --> 00:29:21.039
he's he's talking about how kind of what

00:29:21.039 --> 00:29:24.080
i said earlier about how

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.520
the left and the democrats used to be

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.240
pretty pretty [ __ ] good until

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.240
about the 60s when it became more

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.840
focused on instead of getting things

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.200
done

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.679
just culture wars yeah no it's true man

00:29:35.679 --> 00:29:37.200
so i mean don't get me started on the

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.799
state of [ __ ] black schools dude how

00:29:38.799 --> 00:29:40.960
they dipped down in the 60s

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.000
i mean you probably don't know about

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.360
dunbar high see if i don't know much

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.880
about black history but

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.480
tell me about it please

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.559
well it was like dunbar hives i think it

00:29:48.559 --> 00:29:51.039
was in like washington d right around dc

00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:52.640
area and it was

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.120
so back during segregation it was it was

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.200
an all black school all black staff but

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.399
it was also too like a lot of black

00:29:58.399 --> 00:30:00.320
people couldn't get jobs and like like

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.159
they would go to colleges but like a lot

00:30:02.159 --> 00:30:03.520
of colleges wouldn't really hire them so

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.760
a lot of like black professors master

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.360
degrees had to come down they just

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.559
taught in high school it's like one of

00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:10.000
the only jobs they could get yeah so

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.440
they had this school the dunbar school

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.559
and it was like

00:30:12.559 --> 00:30:14.480
you had a

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.000
everyone from the area could get in but

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.360
it was kind of like it had like really

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.039
rigorous academic standings and you know

00:30:19.039 --> 00:30:20.240
if you didn't do well i guess you would

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.000
just fail out but it was like very it

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.520
was very much like all the other white

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.960
schools where it was like they took like

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.200
a new england uh

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.360
like like a new england approach to just

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.640
like teaching where it's like very hard

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.240
you taught all the classics like latin

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.840
greek all that stuff

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.520
and they did like when they when they

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.360
did the standardized test they were like

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.279
right below like the top tier white

00:30:39.279 --> 00:30:41.039
school then above a couple other of the

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:42.399
white schools so they were like right in

00:30:42.399 --> 00:30:43.840
the top they're in the mix they're in

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.679
the cream of the crop dude sure and then

00:30:45.679 --> 00:30:48.000
in the 60s people started complaining

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.840
that like it was elitist that like in

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.279
the you know like a bunch of black

00:30:51.279 --> 00:30:52.240
people too are being like this is

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.600
elitist we should let everyone go to

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.440
dunbar and they just kind of lowered the

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.640
bar and let everyone in there and the

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.840
whole school just went the [ __ ] and then

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.120
they were saying so you're saying inner

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.880
city black schools once black people get

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.480
into schools they should [ __ ] ruin

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.159
them it was all black school

00:31:04.159 --> 00:31:05.679
it was an all black school but they were

00:31:05.679 --> 00:31:07.760
saying like they weren't allowing it to

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:10.960
be stratified by like education level to

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:11.679
where they're like this should be

00:31:11.679 --> 00:31:12.799
available to everyone and they're like

00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:13.760
well if you do it you're going to let a

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.440
bunch of like disruptive kids who aren't

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.799
disruptive

00:31:16.799 --> 00:31:18.559
is that what you would call disruptive

00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:20.720
other black kids into this black school

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.399
so they're saying like the pc agendas

00:31:22.399 --> 00:31:24.240
[ __ ] up inner city schools to where

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.000
then they they introduced like

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.840
afrocentric um they called like

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.159
afrocentric

00:31:30.159 --> 00:31:33.039
i can't think of the word for like

00:31:33.039 --> 00:31:34.640
a course of study i forget what it's

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.399
called but basically like afrocentric

00:31:36.399 --> 00:31:38.480
approaches to teaching to where like

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.159
they almost lower the bar to a school

00:31:40.159 --> 00:31:41.039
where they're like we're not going to

00:31:41.039 --> 00:31:42.240
teach you like history history we're

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.760
going to teach you afro-centric history

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.039
and it's like

00:31:45.039 --> 00:31:47.279
okay so you know you get guys saying

00:31:47.279 --> 00:31:48.960
that like the liberals [ __ ] up schools

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.480
for black people pretty bad really yeah

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.399
yeah there's a lot of how long have we

00:31:54.399 --> 00:31:55.760
been talking about this

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.240
yeah 30 minutes

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.000

i mean that that way i'm definitely

00:34:51.839 --> 00:34:53.679

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:56.079
first four months maybe longer than i'm

00:34:56.079 --> 00:34:57.839

there i was like

00:35:01.119 --> 00:35:02.480
i think it's gonna get really fun after

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.160
a while though i think so too i hope i

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:04.960
mean

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.880
and if not and if i come home and sell

another guy the headliner and the show

00:35:19.599 --> 00:35:21.280

mean you're doing clubs doing showcases

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.240

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.240
group of guys

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.680

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.599
if i was in this to make money yeah i

00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:45.920

oh yeah trio that's a sick force and

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.839
we're back into

00:36:52.839 --> 00:36:55.280
politics but no

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.720
it was that and it's like i'm already

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.720
anxious about moving to new york

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.320
and then you to have people be like

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.839
don't do that there's nothing up there

00:37:01.839 --> 00:37:03.040
it's like yeah you don't know what i've

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.079
been doing

00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:06.480
i'm not moving up there to start doing

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.040
stand-up exactly like i'm moving up

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.560
there because i have a show on a pretty

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.880
decent network i'm friends with good

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.800
comics up there that's in there that i

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.040
do stand up alongside of and do just as

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.880
well and that's the thing though if they

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.960
were like they don't know any of that

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.440
like somebody messaged me today and was

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.599
like so you're moving to new york

00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:26.640
i don't want to sound like an [ __ ]

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.640
but i honestly thought you'd never do it

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:29.760
and i was like well i kind of wanted to

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.520
wait until i knew i was actually good

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.359
enough to go there yeah i didn't want to

00:37:33.359 --> 00:37:35.040
[ __ ]

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.480
start up there i wouldn't want i don't

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.079
know how people start up there i don't

00:37:38.079 --> 00:37:39.839
know how they do it it must [ __ ] suck

00:37:39.839 --> 00:37:41.200
unless you went to like college in new

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.440
york can you nyu would help yeah but

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.280
like if you just move up there as an

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:48.640
open miker that's got to be [ __ ] nuts

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.640
but yeah i wanted to wait until i was

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.240
capable of doing stand up don't get me

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.920
wrong i there's still a strong

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.880
possibility i could fail well yeah but

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.320
but if anyone does anything like that

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.800
there always is yeah but yeah it's like

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.800
you know enough people

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.480
like you you could actually do like it's

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.920
like philly it's like you got there's

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.000
only helium yeah it's like you know once

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.440
you're in helium it's like you know

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.359
imagine like being in the helium already

00:38:11.359 --> 00:38:12.720
before even going to philly it's like

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.880
you know being even on the radar is nice

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.040
which is what i did exactly so it's like

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.920
suck a dick dude anyway anyway

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.359

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.480
his stuff it's all he's telling people

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.079
to take him take it i know so what what

00:45:04.079 --> 00:45:05.280
happened possibility for your own life

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.560
in my opinion what happens a lot with

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.960
peterson and we're back

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.280
it's about the comment is like

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.440
so peterson will talk about how he's

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.280
like witches are in swamps there's a

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.280
reason they're in swamps

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.880
so it's like

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.640
he uses these

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.319
silly

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:24.400
like you can dismiss them as silly you

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.520
can't it's like

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.839
the movie frozen it's just

00:45:27.839 --> 00:45:29.520
it's propaganda that's all it is and

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.319
like

00:45:30.319 --> 00:45:32.079
so in order to combat that you can just

00:45:32.079 --> 00:45:33.599
be like who are you listening to that

00:45:33.599 --> 00:45:35.920
[ __ ] youtuber that's railing on

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.160
[ __ ] disney movies that's exactly my

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.520
point so that's but if you're high in

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.280
openness like me it's like i'm highly

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.520
open to archetypical ideas like that so

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.880
i can be like all right i get what

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:46.160
you're saying i'm not gonna just judge

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.599

lot of people getting ashamed of him

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.560
dude cause i have that one extra ticket

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.560

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.319
bring him in dude [ __ ] that bring him

00:48:22.319 --> 00:48:23.599

00:48:23.599 --> 00:48:24.880
drunk yelling at me that jordan

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.240
peterson's a [ __ ] i was like all right

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.720
that's fine i don't care the other thing

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.559
i don't care chaps my ass and they call

00:48:30.559 --> 00:48:32.160
him like a pop psychologist he's like

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.839
dude if you study psychology he's cited

00:48:33.839 --> 00:48:36.079
in like hundreds of studies but i

00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:38.880
digress dude whatever i do think he's

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:40.480
the problem in my opinion what's

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:41.760
happening he's definitely getting

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.720
overexposed right now yeah there's he's

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:46.559
there's too much [ __ ] too much he's

00:48:46.559 --> 00:48:48.000
doing way too much he's doing way too

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.359
much he's doing way too much he's doing

00:48:49.359 --> 00:48:50.960
too much he's doing so much he's doing

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.160
too much and that's leaving him

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:53.839
vulnerable because he's doing hours and

00:48:53.839 --> 00:48:55.200
hours of talks

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:57.760

imagine the new york times like i know

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:04.240
who also are really actually trying to

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.000
pick with your words it's like

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.920
if somebody tried to write a hit piece

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.680
on me it wouldn't be that hard to be

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.680
like this guy's a [ __ ] piece of [ __ ]

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.920
it wouldn't be hard dude but uh i did

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.200

here i told you about that

00:50:17.119 --> 00:50:19.040
like every couple weeks someone wrote a

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:20.880
hit piece on me it would end up with me

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.559
being like anthony wiener did in jail

00:50:22.559 --> 00:50:23.680
dude

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:25.119
yeah yeah if somebody explained what i

00:50:25.119 --> 00:50:26.960
was up to

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.480
it wouldn't be like oh i don't like him

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:29.920
it'd be like we got to get rid of this

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.839

00:50:31.839 --> 00:50:33.839

12 15. is it in my living room

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.119
you think it's a hit piece it could be a

00:50:49.119 --> 00:50:50.720
hit piece because they were like

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.720

to say

00:55:20.079 --> 00:55:21.359
that's what he said that's a hell of a

00:55:21.359 --> 00:55:23.359
thing to say in a debate

00:55:23.359 --> 00:55:25.440

and how he looks around during that

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.880
debate jordan peterson we're both very

00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:44.960

dude the funniest do you ever see the

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.079
memes of doctor strange you ever seen

00:55:48.079 --> 00:55:49.680
jordan peterson versus sam harris when

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.440
they liken it to i think

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:53.359
captain america and dr strange know iron

00:55:53.359 --> 00:55:55.680
man and doctor strange so they do things

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.280
and they call jordan peters and doctor

00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:58.720
strange because he's always doing weird

00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:00.240
circles

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.319
dudes and sam harris is like iron man

00:56:02.319 --> 00:56:04.240
dude it's so funny jordan peterson and

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.720
sam harris's debate bothered me so much

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.000
you're doing another one it's so

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.920
annoying yeah the first one sucks like

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:11.680
we need to establish what truth is

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:13.760
before we like he's like now let's go

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.599
back and put a pin on this yeah he has

00:56:15.599 --> 00:56:18.160
that npr voice it's like so what we need

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:20.880
to do is discuss uh it's truth it's what

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:22.480
it's so [ __ ] annoying to hear them i

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:25.680
mean dude it's talking about nothing

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.040
yeah that it is it's a level of

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.720
abstraction that's just useless to most

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:29.680
people

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:31.200
no i do [ __ ] with though rupert

00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.599
sheldrake who's that he's just a british

00:56:33.599 --> 00:56:35.520
uh he's like a british university

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.440
classic british liberal i was black

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:38.960
conservative was until he was a black

00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:40.559
conservative dude

00:56:40.559 --> 00:56:42.799
but he's he like battles all the dawkins

00:56:42.799 --> 00:56:44.400
and all the atheists he's a he's like a

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.960
guy he hates yes dude this guy

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.240
if you want to know if you want to win

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:50.079
arguments versus atheist watch rupert

00:56:50.079 --> 00:56:51.200
sheldrake and he gives you sick

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:53.440
arguments to beat people with that's uh

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:56.079
that's o'connor's gripe with

00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:57.440
um

00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:59.839
religion yeah but the thing is atheists

00:56:59.839 --> 00:57:00.960
always

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.559
battle people on religion by pointing

00:57:02.559 --> 00:57:03.920
out how weird religion is but if you

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.520
attack an atheist on their philosophy

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:06.880
it'd be like what do you exactly believe

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:08.240
and they're like they get into like

00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:10.480
their matters unconscious the universe

00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.079
is unconscious but then that leaves

00:57:12.079 --> 00:57:13.359
consciousness where it's like where does

00:57:13.359 --> 00:57:14.880
that come from and they're just like uh

00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:16.880

saying he's a goddamn pedophile you hate

00:58:32.799 --> 00:58:34.319
the pope a lot of the [ __ ]

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:42.160
because that he said it's okay to be gay

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:43.920
i think pope said

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:45.680
yeah i saw that god made you that way

00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:48.079
yeah and these bishops are probably like

00:58:48.079 --> 00:58:50.319
alex jones take on that was tough dude

00:58:50.319 --> 00:58:52.240
what was his he's like he's trying to

00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:54.240
say that they made you way you made them

00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:55.760
gay because you touched them and like he

00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:57.359

00:58:57.359 --> 00:58:58.960
were just like he goes i don't care

00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:01.280
anymore i've got that dude it was well

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:03.920
white nationalists don't like catholics

00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:06.160
yeah it's true so

00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:07.920
he's just no alex jones is a christian

00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:08.640
bro

00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:10.079
catholic

00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:11.760
christians yeah how do how do catholics

00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:13.839
get oppressed by white nationalists

00:59:13.839 --> 00:59:14.720
because

00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:15.920
what do you mean i guess it goes the

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:17.520
irish irish are a lot of there's a lot

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:18.960
of irish countries

00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:21.119
they're oppressible too irish and highly

00:59:21.119 --> 00:59:24.160
oppressible we are immigrants true that

00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:26.160
and so yeah a lot of the a lot like the

00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:28.240
clan doesn't like catholics a lot of the

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.839
wait so i'm oppressed yeah we're

00:59:29.839 --> 00:59:31.839
oppressed yes first off the irish were

00:59:31.839 --> 00:59:32.430
slaves

00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:34.960
[Laughter]

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:36.799
that was a funny part in that yeah god

00:59:36.799 --> 00:59:39.040
damn it's that debate in that bunk

00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:40.400
debate

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:42.160
there was a part where

00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:44.079
stephen fry was like we've all been

00:59:44.079 --> 00:59:46.400
slaves throughout human history

00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:48.400
and then the black dude was like

00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:50.880
that was chattel

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:52.799
slavery it's a lot different

00:59:52.799 --> 00:59:54.880
so it's funny that like

00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:56.160
my slavery is worse than yours my

00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:57.839
slavery is worse than your slavery is

00:59:57.839 --> 00:59:59.440
literally his argument and it's like

00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:02.000
dude don't do that

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.200
i would take

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.880
this is gonna be a hot take but like i'd

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:08.319
rather take 1860s slavery versus

01:00:08.319 --> 01:00:10.799
11 a.d that's not a hot take dude that's

01:00:10.799 --> 01:00:13.200
a fair take dude i would take 1860

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.680
[ __ ] slavery over like living i mean

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.599
[ __ ] i mean that's

01:00:17.599 --> 01:00:19.680
for sure in the present moment yeah but

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:21.520
then it's like if you have 1860 slavery

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.359
you're still you know

01:00:23.359 --> 01:00:25.920

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.440

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:30.000
about galley slaves like the arabians

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
would uh they would steal white guys

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.599
we're on to slavery dude we're hitting

01:00:33.599 --> 01:00:35.680
it dude i mean i'm we're [ __ ] sliding

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.440

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.119

that it's better to be of 1860s slave

01:02:57.119 --> 01:02:59.760
versus the 1400s probably yeah

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.599
if you were if you were like a 1500s

01:03:01.599 --> 01:03:03.839

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.640
been there but you were ripped but my

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:45.920
whole thing my prediction the thing is

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:47.440
going to take black conservatism over

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:49.599
the edge is like black conservatism

01:03:49.599 --> 01:03:52.359
speaks to conspiracy they can spin a

01:03:52.359 --> 01:03:54.160
conspiratorial thing that i think will

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.240
get a lot of black dudes to switch to be

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.520
like yo you've been fooled this whole

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.200
time bro and it's like a lot of people

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.359
you can check the facts i mean everyone

01:04:01.359 --> 01:04:03.680
does and they but yeah but this is like

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.480
a

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.079
this is just a better conspiracy theory

01:04:06.079 --> 01:04:07.680
to latch onto and a lot of it's backed

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.359
up by better facts do you think perhaps

01:04:09.359 --> 01:04:10.880
you are latching onto a conspiracy

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.440
theory which one i'm battling a lot of

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:16.000
them right now bro

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.680
let me which one are we talking about

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.520
here true

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.520
but yeah i think uh this has been a

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.760
heated this is this is pretty much

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.520
debate this is the bulk debate like i

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.280
mean is it monk debate or bunk debate

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.960
bunk okay bunk debate i think you can

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:31.839
put this up to uh

01:04:31.839 --> 01:04:34.160
this is a similar level of intellectual

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.680
debate you were you're definitely

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:38.079

01:06:31.359 --> 01:06:33.359
