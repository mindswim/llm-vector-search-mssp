because i thought i had a clean streak

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.240

to be quite honest have you ever thought

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.440
of that maybe you pushed her in that

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.880
direction when she saw someone she

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.440
looked up to being sexually [ __ ]

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.199
right vulnerable like that it's never a

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.120
choice but it can happen like no it

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.880
modifies your dna it's like being

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.000

unbeknownst to you until i don't know we

00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:49.040
there was a lot to it this was like 45

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.600
minutes of planning yeah of uh you gotta

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.959

ancestry.com you can not get cocked

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.440
you can find out you can test your kid

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.519
and find out if the kid's yours or not

00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:09.040
and then you can uh

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.640
and you just be like see ya i know i

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.080
loved you for the past year you were

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.360
thinking we were thinking you'd play the

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.519
long game on it and [ __ ] stick around

00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:17.600
really yeah dude i actually this

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.360
it depends how successful the kid's

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.760
gonna be

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.080
chances are not successful if it's a

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.880
cuck kid well you never know

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.640
that kind of trauma can shape someone

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.360
into a pretty special person

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.640
i don't know i think

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.640
young trauma does create great people

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.240
but it i think nine times out of ten it

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.399
creates a [ __ ] another piece of [ __ ]

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:40.560
yeah right yep so

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.920
it's better to just be middle of the

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.839
road average human your whole life

00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:44.800
definitely

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.800
were you guys weird kids are we just

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.399
kind of normal or i think every kid was

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:50.320
weird but i feel like you were the same

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.160
i was this kid since fifth grade yeah

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.760
yeah because you know

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.800
you don't want to produce something you

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.560
don't have an old looking face but i

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.560
feel like you've always like

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.000
you probably just wear like just a

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.760
smaller version of this and just yeah i

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.399
was just a big kid in school taller than

00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:05.839
everybody bigger

00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:07.440

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.120
um everyone's like sort of like in the

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.120
same height range at that point too up

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.800
until like high school then you really

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.560
start separating

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.079
you know like i was i felt like i was

00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:25.440
the same height as everyone in like

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.720
seventh grade

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.320
and like

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.079
and even there was even really tall kids

00:10:30.079 --> 00:10:31.839
that just went through puberty early so

00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:33.760
they were like a fully adult in eighth

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.959
grade yeah those guys are there and then

00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:37.040
they wound up being five years yeah yeah

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.640
the dudes that quit cigarettes by ninth

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.000
grade

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.519
those guys are all those guys that were

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:43.519
jacked and tall yeah yep yeah i had a

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:45.600
buddy who's like in the junior navy

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.600
seals like in like sixth seventh grade

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.040
which is you know just some like after

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.279
school program but it sounded badass

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:53.279
they gave him like terrorism

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:55.760

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.200
more intense than that where they yeah

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.959

like doing push-ups and [ __ ] um and yeah

00:11:02.079 --> 00:11:03.600
so in like seventh and eighth grade he

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.760

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.480
messages into those kids brains like

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.560

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.240
yeah really yeah we lost we lost in the

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.519
championship but i was thinking you

yeah little tiny guy hiding behind the

00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:46.079
line yeah

00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:47.760
he was better than me so they would like

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.320
and they had like after you go up by 21

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.160
you could like choose a player on their

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.440
team to pull

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.160

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.120
yes

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.720
so he would he would he would score

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.920
another team would be like all right

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.680
he's off he's off and then they start

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.800
giving the ball to me and then i would

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.240
just you know

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.000
we wouldn't let up we were just [ __ ]

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.480
mercy what no you played the rest of the

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.480
game that's a weird [ __ ] mercy rule

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.240
yeah that's just getting dumb dude that

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.160

it's like hard to get up and down the

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.920
field

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.519
i think you could bring them back in if

00:13:27.519 --> 00:13:29.360
they close the gap

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.279
okay yeah did you relax this is what

00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:32.800

january and i don't know how these kids

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.680
would just get hit with these balls

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.959
because they don't wear any equipment

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:56.240
yeah that's the one

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.079

00:20:19.919 --> 00:20:22.720
[ __ ] [ __ ] he's not well i was

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.640
actually curious my mind like that's

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.240
intimidating to me hanging out with like

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.840
people like that like yeah i'd be i'd be

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.039
scared

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:30.640
yeah that was my first time like really

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.960
spending any like like serious time with

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.200
those guys not just like

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.360
a show or not just being like that yeah

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.440
yeah and that yeah i was thinking the

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.880
same thing like i was just like sitting

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.240
quiet and they were like super nice to

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.480
me yeah right yeah they were good dudes

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.000
the whole thing the whole thing was like

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.600
the whole thing was [ __ ] crazy it was

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.679
nuts that brooklyn bizarre like

00:20:49.679 --> 00:20:52.159
denounced it yeah after louie yeah well

00:20:52.159 --> 00:20:54.080
they made a mistake

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.280
they made a mistake because now they're

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.400
not going to do it at that venue yeah so

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.159
because because they allowed lilly on

00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:01.520
because louie dropped in brooklyn

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.360
bizarre had to put out a statement that

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.960
was like we didn't know he was coming it

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.960
wasn't our fault we want to keep a safe

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.480
place for performers and [ __ ] and it's

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.760
like as if he's still going around he's

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.960
not doing that anymore he hasn't yeah

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.520
he's not doing that so so this new bit

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.960
i've been working on and everybody that

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.039
was there would have let him do it right

00:21:17.039 --> 00:21:19.600
yeah there was no safety concern

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.880
and some of the the people that were

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.559
complaining about it they weren't even

00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:24.880
working the gig right no one that was

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.880
there complained exactly no one that was

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.720
at the show or worked on the show was

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.240
that anybody that's complaining about it

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.159
is literally not talented enough to be

00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:34.720
there right it's that simple yeah yeah i

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.400
i would be surprised like i wonder who

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.159
made that choice

00:21:38.159 --> 00:21:39.520
to like i wonder if that was just their

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.280
social media like brooklyn bizarre

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.880
people that they were just like putting

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.799
this out or they're like they got the

00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:46.559
staff well maybe the venue isn't used to

00:21:46.559 --> 00:21:47.600
that kind of

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.600
pressure from the outside because i

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.679
don't know how many folded kind of

00:21:51.679 --> 00:21:52.960
shows they have that get that kind of

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.400
response on social media so maybe

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.520
they're just not used to it and they

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.360
fold quickly but dude you know because

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.760
as mad as like as mad as it seemed that

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.000
everyone was about it it was like there

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.400
was only like six people talking about

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.919
it yeah there was

00:22:05.919 --> 00:22:07.360
some chick from there was a bunch of

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.520
like chicks from brooklyn right that

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.640
like

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.240
they were all like oh this is louie's

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.679
like a workplace safety thing it's like

00:22:13.679 --> 00:22:15.440
you'll never work with him yeah you'll

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.039
never be good enough to be

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:19.520
in the [ __ ] universe

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.960
don't worry about it it's like it's like

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.400
a michael vick situation he's not

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.240
fighting dogs anymore yeah you don't

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.840
have to worry about that free michael

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.679
vick and you'll never be one of his dogs

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:29.440
that fight dude yeah you'd never be good

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.120
even if you wanted to dude it would

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.039
literally be like a [ __ ] arena

00:22:33.039 --> 00:22:34.880
football player being like [ __ ] mike

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.640
vick yeah yeah i would i don't feel safe

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.919
with him around

00:22:37.919 --> 00:22:39.280
this arena you don't have to worry about

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.480
it dude he's never going to play with

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.080
look we were we were talking about this

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.320
on the last cast there there's something

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.400
to like i can

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.720
relate this only to the music world

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.120
where i would see certain musicians on

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.360
stage kind of preach the the mental

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.919
health thing yeah and you can see

00:22:55.919 --> 00:22:57.840
in the way that they say it

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.520
that it's kind of like

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.520
a trend and it's like it's just

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.559
a business yeah yeah i went and saw yeah

00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:06.240
all that oh my god i went and saw this

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.960
[ __ ] band and midway through their

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.880
show they're like this next song is

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.799
about when the band we we got together

00:23:12.799 --> 00:23:13.679
in

00:23:13.679 --> 00:23:16.480
2016 and we watched what horrible

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.240
[ __ ] happened and we all cried that

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.559
night when trump got elected yeah it's

00:23:20.559 --> 00:23:23.039
like dude you four [ __ ] [ __ ] cried

00:23:23.039 --> 00:23:24.640
during election night yeah now you're

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.240
playing rock and roll it's a weird thing

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.440
to cry about

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.120
furious

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.720
don't be that doesn't make you come tell

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.960
the crowd you cried on election day and

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.559
it is also it's like it's all those

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:36.559
blurbs like instagram models and [ __ ]

00:23:36.559 --> 00:23:39.200
too they put the same kind of stuff

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.039
like yoga has become like an important

00:23:41.039 --> 00:23:43.520
part of my uh decompression is my mic

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.360
low still a little bit i think so yeah

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:46.960
i'm just kind of far away pretty far

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.480
away

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.720
the thing creates an illusion and yeah

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.950
closer than it really is

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:53.360
[Music]

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.320
thank you

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.760
all right you think that'll be good i

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.039
think you're good now i can't see your

00:23:57.039 --> 00:23:59.039
face you can't see those lovely eyes of

00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:00.559
yours

00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:01.919
what up

00:24:01.919 --> 00:24:04.480
how we doing what band was it i did that

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.640
are you not allowed i forget i forget i

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.080
don't care if i shouldn't be a fan of

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.440
them because they're just like oh i

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.279
wasn't uh okay i got dragged to that

00:24:11.279 --> 00:24:14.000
anyway with some chick uh it was a bit

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.760
oh the song ended up being about like

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.600
police brutality and i was just like

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.000
dude shut the [ __ ] up it was a room they

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.520
don't really connect but like i guess

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.039
like if you're pissed off about that

00:24:23.039 --> 00:24:24.480
thing then yeah you pissed off that but

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.760
like at least have like a story that

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.279
makes sense in the moment for that it

00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:29.360
was just a room full of like wealthy

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.600
white people singing along to a song

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.919
about police brutality on black people

00:24:33.919 --> 00:24:36.080
well and it was just like shut the [ __ ]

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.440
up here's the weird thing about those

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.240
dudes that i noticed um especially when

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.080
i did uh

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:42.960
uh

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.559
stuff like like the pop punk scene like

00:24:44.559 --> 00:24:46.159
warped tour and stuff like that those

00:24:46.159 --> 00:24:49.520
guys say that stuff on stage and then

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.880
behind the scenes they're like these

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.039
[ __ ] [ __ ] dude like yeah yeah they

00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:55.120
like talk like of course yeah

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.880
of course it's all fake weird yeah yeah

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.880
yeah but because you know now that's

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.640
what it's based off your like ideals is

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.559
like that's how you create a following

00:25:02.559 --> 00:25:04.159
of course is it it's like i don't would

00:25:04.159 --> 00:25:06.240
anyone care if they didn't bring it up

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.240
like that that's weird

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.159
why even feel obligated to say it if

00:25:10.159 --> 00:25:12.720
it's a younger impressionable audience

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.400
they kind of you think everyone they're

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.840
enjoying themselves is like yeah but

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:16.799
they haven't mentioned something

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:18.880
anything about police brutality yet like

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.960
how's the rest of the set gonna go

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.799
if they don't bring up how they felt on

00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:24.960
election night can i leave here feeling

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.559
like this is a band i can be a fan of

00:25:26.559 --> 00:25:28.799
right that's a good huge comedy during

00:25:28.799 --> 00:25:30.080
this whole thing is like all these

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.919
comedians coming to open mics and it's

00:25:31.919 --> 00:25:33.279
basically the same

00:25:33.279 --> 00:25:35.600
premise with different thoughts of like

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.440
the same issues it's like you tell a

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.440
joke that like you know maybe no one is

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.200
like the premise hasn't been touched yet

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.039
you don't have to be like i'm

00:25:43.039 --> 00:25:44.400
a good person it's like almost they're

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.919
trying to portray themselves as a good

00:25:45.919 --> 00:25:47.919
person even though you're just like

00:25:47.919 --> 00:25:50.480
you're you're pandering to [ __ ] a

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.760
bunch of people who don't give a [ __ ]

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.559
about you yeah yeah yeah i i hated that

00:25:54.559 --> 00:25:56.320
it's weird in comedy like that's not

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.480
like go go become a politician then

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.840
please like you seem like you have

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.840
pretty good ideas go be a politician

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.159
stop yelling at me no one cares no one

00:26:04.159 --> 00:26:05.760
in the room cares no one outside the

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.159
room cares it's just a comedian

00:26:08.159 --> 00:26:09.440
basically doing what louis does and

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.679
jerking off in front of everyone right

00:26:11.679 --> 00:26:14.640

year

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.119
our our physics teacher got swapped out

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.640
go after class a lot and hang out and

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.800

everybody i mean yes the answer is yes

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.079
to a physics teacher yes she was [ __ ]

00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:45.200
gorgeous

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.880

just ran away into the country

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.320
like it's physics alone he knows how to

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.920
make her come instantly why wouldn't she

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.240
take him up on my offer i don't think

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.000
that's how physics works

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.839
almost come down dude that's so funny

00:36:59.839 --> 00:37:03.119

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.280
there's a bunch of it's like a bunch of

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.680
farmers here

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.400
there's some rich areas around here this

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.920
isn't this i don't think this is

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.240
considered medford this is not too rich

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.240
i don't know we want to buy some [ __ ]

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.960
nice houses on the way in and also again

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.079
i would say this is a good there's

00:40:52.079 --> 00:40:53.920
people that own planes there's people

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.839
that individually don't [ __ ] live

00:40:55.839 --> 00:40:57.119
here

00:40:57.119 --> 00:40:58.640
yeah in the airfield

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.319
yeah you don't live at the airport yeah

00:41:00.319 --> 00:41:01.520
but you should no they live in their

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.440
barrio

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.119
rare probably like within an hour if

00:41:05.119 --> 00:41:06.640
you're flying like a yeah basically

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:09.040
these things go to like ac and back

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.319
over likely

00:41:10.319 --> 00:41:11.440
i mean

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.319
they're little planets they're gonna

00:41:12.319 --> 00:41:13.760
take these things like chicago there's

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.599
no amelia earhart yeah that might be a

00:41:15.599 --> 00:41:17.200
long flight their gas tank doesn't look

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.200
it's that big although it's probably in

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.200
the wings right is all the gaps

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.119
i don't think that's where they put it

00:41:23.119 --> 00:41:24.319
that is what happens when you lose a

00:41:24.319 --> 00:41:25.680
wing and it's like oh [ __ ] we also gotta

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.440
get crowds

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.040
you definitely run out of fuel if you

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.400
lose a wing

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.160
you run out of people there's actually

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.480
um last year there was um a major uh

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.800
helicopter accident some dot montgomery

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.880
gentry did you know the country band

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.440
yes yeah troy gentry went up and they

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.520
were gonna perform here on friday yeah

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.599
and [ __ ] um malfunction of the

00:41:45.599 --> 00:41:47.119
helicopter one of the pilots took him

00:41:47.119 --> 00:41:49.040
out and they [ __ ] crashed landed and

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.680
they both died

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.960
that was that was just like

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.560
that was a week after he wasn't telling

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.079
those stories they were best you know

00:41:58.079 --> 00:41:59.599
montgomery gentry they're gonna come out

00:41:59.599 --> 00:42:01.359
here and under a helicopter malfunction

00:42:01.359 --> 00:42:02.960
they both died

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.720
dude we're going to go to the wildlife

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:05.920
country

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.920
it's so funny you got that philly jersey

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.640
accent i'm like yeah i don't know

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.599
and also the storytelling's so tight

00:42:13.599 --> 00:42:15.119
midway through i feel like you gave up

00:42:15.119 --> 00:42:16.640
on the story it just

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.920
got to the end yeah it was pretty good

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.359
you were like that guy in the helicopter

00:42:23.599 --> 00:42:25.839
you're telling that story

00:42:25.839 --> 00:42:27.359
well i just realized like people were

00:42:27.359 --> 00:42:28.880
probably gonna list like it was a big

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.200
deal here uh the pilot lived in one of

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.000
these motel rooms

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.400
strike one on that guy's resume

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:37.200
yeah

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.880
the first thing you asked for pilot is

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.800
where does he live really i think he was

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:44.079
drinking like the drunk flying is nuts

00:42:44.079 --> 00:42:45.680
yeah probably all right i bet to those

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.079
guys it's just drunk driving yeah i bet

00:42:48.079 --> 00:42:50.640
to those i mean the the risk is

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.880
jail time how you get caught drunk

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:53.920
flying you're going to jail yeah you

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.359
don't get like warning or anything yeah

00:42:55.359 --> 00:42:56.160
yeah but if you're just doing a

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.880
helicopter around here like there's no

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.000
like checkpoint like there's no one

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.359
gonna pull you over like oh that guy's

00:43:01.359 --> 00:43:02.960
doing some swerving yeah but if you like

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.720
crash land or something or like oh yeah

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.160
if you didn't die

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.440
you know i bet they test you is that

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:10.319
pilot 21 or whatever the dude gets

00:43:10.319 --> 00:43:11.359
i just don't think i don't think

00:43:11.359 --> 00:43:14.079
musicians in helicopters mix oh yeah any

00:43:14.079 --> 00:43:16.640
type of aircraft yeah but mostly i mean

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.880
they've got to get on planes but yeah

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.400

because i also don't give a [ __ ] like

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.560
it's also such a short interaction you

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:37.520
don't know whether they're in on the

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.440
joke or not yeah true and to say trump

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.440
daddy obviously they think it's funny

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.119
yeah and i i went on stage and i was

00:45:43.119 --> 00:45:45.440
like if trump got shot it'd be funny

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.599

00:45:47.599 --> 00:45:48.560
right

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.079
he said you say every joke with a wing

00:45:50.079 --> 00:45:51.920
and a smile yeah that's kind of it yeah

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:54.000
it's all tongue-in-cheek but it's also

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.240
like i'm kind of serious about i like a

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.400
lot of things about trump right like i

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.319

political party again he's going to win

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.160

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.000
dude that's uh that's going to win for

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.760
kanye they would end up joining forces

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:26.880
that'd be too powerful i watched

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:28.160

00:46:34.079 --> 00:46:34.960
that's

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:36.800
someone needs to be like a little bit

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.720
charismatic yeah nowadays you gotta have

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.040
at least ten yeah yeah instead of saying

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:42.480
serious stuff i should have got they

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.720
should have got jon stewart

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.480
that actually yeah i would have done it

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.599
but for the debate are you talking about

00:46:47.599 --> 00:46:50.000
the debates jon stewart to run for

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.839
president yeah the democrats that seems

00:46:51.839 --> 00:46:53.119
like someone gay enough that they would

00:46:53.119 --> 00:46:54.839
[ __ ] jerk off to

00:46:58.319 --> 00:46:59.680
he's interesting [ __ ] like he's getting

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.359

i've also seen him take respon like or

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:13.520
at least feel bad that he feels like he

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.760
created this shitty political identity

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.760
environment that exists now and he like

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:18.960
caught in purgatory and i don't know

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.280
when i get caught in like a weird

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:23.280
when i feel like i'm in between lives i

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.680
have a hard time doing the podcast

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:26.559
yeah because it's like i don't want to

00:53:26.559 --> 00:53:28.160
get on there because you'll end up

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:30.319
saying [ __ ] that you like oh man

00:53:30.319 --> 00:53:32.160
yeah i've done that i mean me and this

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.480
chick break up every [ __ ] week so

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.240
every [ __ ] episode i'm like this

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.119
[ __ ]

00:53:37.119 --> 00:53:38.319
and then by the time it comes out we're

00:53:38.319 --> 00:53:39.599
back together

00:53:39.599 --> 00:53:40.880
so yeah probably not listen to that and

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:42.000
then there's an episode where i'm like i

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.760
[ __ ] love this lady she's great then

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:45.200
the next week i'm like dirty [ __ ]

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.839
[ __ ] it's disgusting

00:53:47.839 --> 00:53:49.520
i respect that though because

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:52.000
uh we're like i'm pretty new to the

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.839
podcast game and you realize it's kind

00:53:54.839 --> 00:53:58.160
of oddly difficult to

00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.400
let it out there when yeah that shit's

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.079
recording yeah

00:54:02.079 --> 00:54:04.240
and do you kind of just have to

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:05.760
go into it being like you know [ __ ] it

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.280
like in the long run it's gonna work out

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:10.079
like if i'm just honest well i don't

00:54:10.079 --> 00:54:11.119
know me and matt have had this

00:54:11.119 --> 00:54:13.280
discussion a lot like if we if it's like

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.440
if the podcast doesn't work out for us

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:17.680
and then we just have recordings of us

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:20.240
just in a room like i've i've i've

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.680
jerked off into like you know

00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:26.640
[Music]

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:27.599
exactly that's what i mean and then

00:54:27.599 --> 00:54:29.200
you're gonna have a family and they'd be

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.800
like dad i found this weird file on the

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:31.920
internet

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:32.800
it's like

00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:35.040
god damn it turn that off

00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:36.799
there's a podcast i did uh right around

00:54:36.799 --> 00:54:39.520
here uh 10 hours long tripping on acid

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:41.200
and then we did it again listening to

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.520
the podcast while podcasting also on

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.040
acid so i think we're going to keep

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:47.119
doing it until we got it down to an hour

00:54:47.119 --> 00:54:48.400
but i don't think it's going to make any

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.520
sense

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:50.799
because we're only we only listen to it

00:54:50.799 --> 00:54:52.480
when we're also on acid

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:54.160
so it's

00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:56.000
we might be on to something or i don't i

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.280
couldn't even get through you telling

00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.760
that story right so imagine so i can't

00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.280
even imagine how bad that [ __ ]

00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:02.720
podcast i think most of the time i

00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:04.160
talked into a screwdriver instead of a

00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:05.520
mic so i don't know well that's pretty

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:06.880
great because that's pretty good that's

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:08.960
a funny bit yeah that's the worst part

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:10.880
about taking acid at least in my

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:12.799
experience has been the two or three

00:55:12.799 --> 00:55:14.559
weeks afterwards where i try to talk

00:55:14.559 --> 00:55:16.960
about it yeah i hate it i hate it try to

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:19.119
explain it i've never taken it i get

00:55:19.119 --> 00:55:20.400
drunk

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.839
someone that would absolutely hate it

00:55:21.839 --> 00:55:23.520
see i think you would like it i think i

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.359

much fun to do every once in a while i

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:31.280
didn't think i was into drugs i kind of

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:32.960
like them

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:35.040

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.960
all they take all you're happy yeah

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.280

00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:37.920
[Laughter]

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:40.000

that like it's like i don't want to die

00:56:42.559 --> 00:56:44.000
but it's like if you were looking at how

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.799
i'm living you have no idea yeah you'd

00:56:46.799 --> 00:56:48.079
be like yeah you're up to you know you

00:56:48.079 --> 00:56:50.400
could like do a bunch of [ __ ] that's not

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:52.000
good for your health and still not want

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.440
to die just because it's

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:55.040
like i started to think about it because

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.559
i always like anytime i'm smoking

00:56:56.559 --> 00:56:57.920
cigarettes it's just like i don't really

00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:59.839
do this as like a habit right i don't

00:56:59.839 --> 00:57:02.480
but i but i've been like quasi doing it

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:03.440
for like

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.760
10 years i'm like yeah that's not good

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:07.359
i'm like kind you know and when i do do

00:57:07.359 --> 00:57:08.559
it i do it

00:57:08.559 --> 00:57:09.920
hard yeah

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.680
do you smoke by yourself or only when

00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:14.079
you're out uh

00:57:14.079 --> 00:57:15.200
like

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:17.760
just recently in the past like two years

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:20.160
like when i get really sad i'll just sit

00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:23.599
and like just change smoke yeah

00:57:23.599 --> 00:57:25.440
which i never did most of the time i'm

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:27.520
just like bumming them off people yeah

00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:29.520
um that's the way i only hate i owe the

00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:31.359
comedy community like millions of

00:57:31.359 --> 00:57:33.040
dollars in cigarettes well that's what i

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:34.400
was thinking because

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:35.839
um

00:57:35.839 --> 00:57:38.079
i i haven't really like i i only did

00:57:38.079 --> 00:57:40.720
stand up a few times but as far as the

00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:42.400
music scene goes some of the the

00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:45.440
lifestyle is a little conducive to like

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:47.280
kind of getting into

00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:49.440
more stuff first of all the shows you're

00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:51.520
doing you know you can get free drinks

like drink tickets and stuff like that

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:55.440
yeah yeah like you go outside like other

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:57.839
comics or other musicians or smoking and

00:57:57.839 --> 00:58:00.240
then also yeah i i feel like people

00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:02.000

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:43.760
i'm kind of asking like how do you get

00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:44.799
to stop

00:59:44.799 --> 00:59:46.799
yeah for like normal people

00:59:46.799 --> 00:59:48.559
doing stand up really it's like what the

00:59:48.559 --> 00:59:50.319
[ __ ] am i doing and then most of the

00:59:50.319 --> 00:59:51.839
people that do open mics are [ __ ]

00:59:51.839 --> 00:59:54.720
weird or [ __ ] or they suck

00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:56.240
and uh that's who you surround yourself

00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.760
with and if you come like if you have

00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.680
any personal drive and you're just

00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.119
surrounded by open micros your whole

01:00:01.119 --> 01:00:03.119
life you're just like this is i got to

01:00:03.119 --> 01:00:05.119
make some changes right yeah and i

01:00:05.119 --> 01:00:07.520
remember doing uh a few philly open mics

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.799
when i was doing stand-up for a little

01:00:08.799 --> 01:00:11.200
bit yeah philly

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.559
is not that bad though yeah i was

01:00:12.559 --> 01:00:14.640
surprised by how much of a bummer it was

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.559
it's pretty bad

01:00:16.559 --> 01:00:18.319
i was like bummed yeah like going to the

01:00:18.319 --> 01:00:20.960
mics i didn't expect that because

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:23.760
i uh i was like a comedy fan i'm like oh

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.440
like the art form is to make people

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:26.720
laugh and like

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:29.119
have fun yeah but well that's right like

01:00:29.119 --> 01:00:30.480
whenever i don't know sometimes if

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:32.319
you're like you tell someone that you do

01:00:32.319 --> 01:00:33.599
stand up and they're like wow that's

01:00:33.599 --> 01:00:35.280
like takes a lot of courage i can never

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.400
do that it's like you should see the

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.240
people that are trying yeah it's like

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.839
there's there's so many mentally ill

01:00:39.839 --> 01:00:42.079
people doing it see how bad everyone is

01:00:42.079 --> 01:00:44.799
yeah uh but also it used to be fun like

01:00:44.799 --> 01:00:47.040
open mics when i yeah usually when you

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.880
start and [ __ ] it's really fun

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.480
and then like when you're new to a scene

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.400
it's really fun and like when you find a

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.920
group of friends you like get [ __ ] up

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.599
with and have fun at every mic it's

01:00:55.599 --> 01:00:57.760
great yeah but then yeah and then the

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.720
last literally in 2016

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.559
when trump got elected it literally just

01:01:02.559 --> 01:01:05.200
immediately comedy got [ __ ] gay

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.559
right away that was around when i

01:01:06.559 --> 01:01:10.480
started fascists for the it's like

01:01:17.839 --> 01:01:19.520
the first thing i looked up like i added

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.599
philadelphia comedy network on facebook

01:01:21.599 --> 01:01:23.119
and it was just

01:01:23.119 --> 01:01:24.559
[ __ ] just a there was a there was a

01:01:24.559 --> 01:01:25.920
mess going on i was out and did

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.520
something without sounding too arrogant

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:30.079
that's when it kind of split into

01:01:30.079 --> 01:01:31.040
me and

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:31.760
yeah

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.760
first good good no because i remember

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.680
literally split into me and good good

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.440
right yeah bit because of the the

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.960
compound media thing because you stopped

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:41.920
no no that was back when like uh

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.079
back then it like split slightly but

01:01:44.079 --> 01:01:46.319
then yeah but eventually it was a year

01:01:46.319 --> 01:01:48.240
ago it really so that's why you brought

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.720
um digital graffiti to helium instead of

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.319
keeping it active well that was kind of

01:01:52.319 --> 01:01:54.720
when it started to split too because we

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.960
took it out of good good and put it in

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.400
and they were pissed off about that and

01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:59.760
yeah they were they're little greedy

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.760
greedy little guys yes i do despite

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.119
their [ __ ] wokeness they're still

01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:05.039
little it's kind of annoying they try to

01:02:05.039 --> 01:02:06.400
take claims like well you just did it

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.920
here i'm like yeah because it was there

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:10.319
to do with the like yeah well they also

01:02:10.319 --> 01:02:11.760
they as soon as we took the show

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.760
somewhere else then they condemned it

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.119
then they were like this show's mean

01:02:15.119 --> 01:02:16.960
it's bullying it's racist

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.480
it's like so much fun we did it in your

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.160
theater the first five [ __ ] times we

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.680
did it and you loved it because it sold

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:23.440
out and you paid us 50 bucks each and

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.280
you got to keep whatever 600 right so

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.720
you know that's how they are that stuff

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:30.400
is so weird i mean that's been the weird

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.240
fallout of like the lewis i don't know

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:33.760
like there's just so many people that

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.839
are like silently watching what you're

01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:37.200
doing and it's like it doesn't matter

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.720
what you're actually saying it's just

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.240
like whatever you're hanging out with a

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.839
particular crowd like i don't know like

01:02:41.839 --> 01:02:44.079
did you like i've lost those people as

01:02:44.079 --> 01:02:45.920
friends on some level like

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.319
it's it's that sucks yeah it's weird

01:02:48.319 --> 01:02:50.480
it's also just like i mean it's not you

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.079
know it's it is a two-way street like

01:02:52.079 --> 01:02:53.680
i'm not reaching out to them a ton

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.359
either but there is a weird thing where

01:02:55.359 --> 01:02:57.520
i'm trying to reach out i've i've texted

01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.359
people like yo just talk to me and it'll

01:02:59.359 --> 01:03:01.359
be fine right and they refuse but there

01:03:01.359 --> 01:03:02.720
is a thing where it's like yeah i knew

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.200
like doing skank fest or like defending

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.640
any of the stuff that they did ever

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:09.520
would like led to just distance and it

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.520
was just weird yeah [ __ ] like and then

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.440
like you like you never met this person

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:14.880

yeah so it worked out i mean all it

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:37.839
takes is just communicating just talk to

01:04:37.839 --> 01:04:39.200
each other be like yo

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.599

trying to be funny i wasn't being

01:04:43.599 --> 01:04:45.680
hateful i'm sorry i understand why

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.359
you're upset right

01:04:47.359 --> 01:04:49.920
that's it there's some certain things

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.359
but you have to admit those are pretty

01:04:51.359 --> 01:04:52.240
funny

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.880
it was pretty funny i stand by the bit

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.319
well dude it's like if you see someone

01:04:56.319 --> 01:04:58.720
go on like a platform and then totally

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.480
change who they are i mean that's one

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:01.839
thing if you you'd be like pissed at

01:05:01.839 --> 01:05:02.799
them but it's like if they're just

01:05:02.799 --> 01:05:04.960
saying the same [ __ ] they're just like

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.960
on a podcast that you don't like it's

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:09.599
like what the [ __ ] is the problem yeah

01:05:09.599 --> 01:05:11.280
you know what i mean wouldn't like you

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.720
aren't we supposed to go into those

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.079
places it's like

01:05:14.079 --> 01:05:16.079
right yeah isn't the different ideas of

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:17.760
comedy that's kind of what's exciting

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.280
about it is that you got people saying

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.480
different like the comedians shouldn't

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:21.680
care about what other comedians are

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.280
saying yeah worry about getting your

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:24.799
laughs and just because the comedians

01:05:24.799 --> 01:05:26.480
tell them [ __ ] up jokes be like other

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.319
people like it so shut up and also

01:05:28.319 --> 01:05:30.079
people like i don't like say like oh you

01:05:30.079 --> 01:05:31.839
should stop talking about your political

01:05:31.839 --> 01:05:34.240
movements well there was a thing but

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.359
also

01:05:35.359 --> 01:05:37.920
where i i would i would see like certain

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.000
tweets of people getting pissed at

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.280
certain jokes

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:42.799
and um

01:05:42.799 --> 01:05:44.960
it's annoying but not

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.480
it's on the internet so it's kind of

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:49.520
normal but there are certain ways

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.880
where

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.960
this is like a new idea that i've never

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:55.440
never verbalized before but

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.119
seeing people act

01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:58.720
the way they do on the internet in

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.480
person it's

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.720
very strange i can't explain like when

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:04.960
you see someone taking a video of

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.200
themselves and talking to it it's way

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.119
more strange

01:06:09.119 --> 01:06:10.960
but when you see the video on the

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.480
internet it doesn't seem that weird but

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:14.400
you realize how weird it is yeah there

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.000
was a dude making like videos at

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.400
skankfest like making like an instagram

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.760
story or something like it wasn't it

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.359
wasn't an instagram story it was like a

01:06:21.359 --> 01:06:23.119
larger planned little thing and it was

01:06:23.119 --> 01:06:24.240
just like

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.920

offensive comedy thing is one thing it's

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:32.799

01:06:32.799 --> 01:06:34.160

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:30.960
yeah i mean that was a good question

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:31.920
then

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:35.200
wow really this must be groundbreaking

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.240
damn

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:38.720
so tonight's show dude what do you think

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:40.960
i'm excited it could be 30 people or 300

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.839
people i'm not sure i think

01:07:43.839 --> 01:07:45.839
probably right at 100. i think it's

01:07:45.839 --> 01:07:47.599
going to guess i'm going to say this is

01:07:47.599 --> 01:07:50.559
you you think this is all right

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:51.920
what do you feel you're bringing the

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.119
energy dude

01:07:53.119 --> 01:07:54.640
i think i got a bunch of random people

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.160
hit me up that i've never met people ask

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.760
you for tickets and [ __ ] yeah yeah i

01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:59.440
think i'll get some people but i was you

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:00.960
gotta if you have [ __ ] like this sell

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:02.400
tickets ahead of time

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.920
yeah i did before and it was just it

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.599
just turned into a hassle i know i'm

01:08:05.599 --> 01:08:07.119
sure it's a hassle but like it'll lock

01:08:07.119 --> 01:08:08.960
people in right because then there's

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.039
like a whim where you see the flyer and

01:08:11.039 --> 01:08:12.480
you're like i'd like to go to that right

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.480
you buy tickets three days before this

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:16.400
yeah meanwhile today you get home from

01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:18.000
work and you're like [ __ ] it yeah i'm

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.080
not cut like mccusker no you're when i

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:21.120
told him to come to this he was like

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.880
hell yeah i'll be there and then

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.640
day of the show he's like wow

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.000
so that's what i'm worried about i had a

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.199
bunch of people being like i'm

01:08:27.199 --> 01:08:28.799
definitely going to be there all this

01:08:28.799 --> 01:08:30.719
[ __ ] but also i was like yeah i kind of

01:08:30.719 --> 01:08:31.839
probably should have

01:08:31.839 --> 01:08:34.400
sold blocks yeah just not [ __ ] it at

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:35.920
least i get the money like if you [ __ ]

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.600
bail by well i'll perform in front of an

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.199
empty chair and pretend that's you yeah

01:08:39.199 --> 01:08:41.359
i should know i i'd rather have a pact

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:43.199
for him i don't really care about

01:08:43.199 --> 01:08:45.359
i'm just giving you all the money

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:47.199
so you get all this

01:08:47.199 --> 01:08:49.920
sick that's a problem

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.120
um

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.799

01:10:39.199 --> 01:10:40.640
subtle lines

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.880
that the crowd doesn't always [ __ ]

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:45.040

that doesn't get a laugh that's just a

01:11:01.679 --> 01:11:03.840
subtle [ __ ] like somebody that is

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.600
that like i'm a huge like i know exactly

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:07.360

the military garb from a country that

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:10.640
