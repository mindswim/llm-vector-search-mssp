wanted to do we were gonna go straight

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.200
connor imitating joe rogan's podcast

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.400
which would have been

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.640
awesome if we recreated joe rogan's

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.000
studio in your basement

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.280
which billy and spot are more than

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.519

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.560

watson

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.000
yeah we could have made it a jail cell

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.440
we could make the studio in jail making

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.200
it a jail cell set up metal bunks

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.800

steel toilet in the middle and then a

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.519

doing workout programs um

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.639
with a small caveat that he was in a

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.079
white supremacist gang in prison

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.000
but in the california prison system it's

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.199
unavoidable

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.040
so if you if you're you know it's like

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.320
if you think you're going to get out of

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.720
it

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.759
if you think you're going to get out of

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:27.280
work you're going to get out of putting

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.000
work for your people

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.440
in the california prison system you're

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.199
you're [ __ ] unless you [ __ ] up

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.840
and now so now the mccuskers all have

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.280
prison terminology that they've been

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.160
using which is

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.000
pretty great especially i tell you who's

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.199
really taken to this bit

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.880
is billy yeah who is just full-on dude

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.000
he's

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.360
he was telling me squad was making fun

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.240
of him they were talking about what's

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.240
worse stealing prison valor or stealing

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.160
troop valor

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.440
what do you think i think stealing

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.600
troop valor you get caught it makes more

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.880
sense at least

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.479
troop valor you get caught and filmed on

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.320
youtube where everybody that they've

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.840
caught stealing troop valor has been

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.639
like a pretty

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.960
clearly not like a fat autistic dude at

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.000
the mall

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.080
trying to get like a 20 off annie anne's

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.720
pretzel same guys what uh what platoon

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.600
are you on he's like

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.680
i was in fourth company they're like nah

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.199
they weren't in afghanistan

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.520
uh well this this patch signifies like

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.199
no that patch doesn't segment it's

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.039
it's kind of hard to watch yeah i think

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:22.720
we should let the guys who steal valor

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.600
kind of slide

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.840
yeah it's the same crowd as catch a

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.120
predator

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.440
exact same crowd and i have the same

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.800
exact feeling

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.039
when i watch the videos like if i watch

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:34.960
a [ __ ] guy getting busted for

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.639
stealing valor at the mall

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.039
a part of me is really like it hurts to

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:40.479
watch that guy go through that

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.240
yeah same thing with to catch a predator

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.400
when they catch a [ __ ] guy

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.919
on catching a predator it's like damn

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.320
dude yeah catching a predator it's like

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.800
putting out

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.080
it's like putting out a skunk trap and

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.440
getting a rabbit you're like i don't

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.199
want to get you

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.360
to get like a 22 year old [ __ ] guy

liberal media wants us to believe to

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.639

team

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.560

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.800
a vr headset i don't think so damn

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.720
well that'd be something that's a stupid

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.959
[ __ ] question why

00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:11.519
why was that a stupid question vr

00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:12.480
headset for

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.200
i don't know i like uh i don't know i so

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.320
badly want to be good at

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.320
a game like that but i watch like i'll

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.079
watch people play online like i'll just

00:10:20.079 --> 00:10:21.600
watch like youtube videos of people

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.760
playing that game and it's like

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.720
i can't even believe like how good they

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.360
are

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.399
i'm just thinking about people starting

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:30.640
to get ptsd once like the vr for war

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.040
game starts to get really good

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.079
yeah that was reading a book and they

00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:35.519
were saying people were getting like

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:37.200
things like ptsd when they were

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.560
simulating uh

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.040
interrogation techniques on u.s soldiers

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.160
they would come out of it with like in

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:42.480
terms

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.600
like the terms like their cortisol

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.040
levels and [ __ ] they would come out of

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.000
it like [ __ ] up

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.760
that makes sense yeah getting like

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.680
waterboarded exactly yeah exactly even

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.360
if you know it's okay i simulated

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.160
waterboarding

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.519
in the book there's a terrorist who

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:54.959
somehow figured out you know like some

00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:56.240
dudes can like open their nose and

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:56.959
beerbong

00:10:56.959 --> 00:10:58.320
yeah he was getting waterboarded he knew

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.839
how to open his nose so the water just

00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:00.959
flowed right through him

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:02.640
damn it came and it was it like went

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.079
into his nose and out of his mouth like

00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:06.320
a mountain like a little fountain

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.320
he would taunt the people by doing like

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.920
he would count he knew the time frame

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.200
you're only allowed to water board for a

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.120
certain amount of time so he would ca he

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.399
would he knew the times and he would

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:14.720
just be

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.160
he would do a three two one with his

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.519
hands and be like all right dude [ __ ]

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:18.240
you

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.920
that's the best terrorist ever yeah it's

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.200
pretty tight dude they're trying to

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.839
claim that he was a liar because he uh

00:11:23.839 --> 00:11:25.200
he just claimed like all the he's like

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.120
yeah i did that yeah i did that too

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.959
yeah it's not like torture usually

00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:30.880
induces a response that's like you need

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.399
to give an ant he didn't it wasn't

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:33.519
hurting him so he could just sit here

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:34.160
and be like yes

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.760
well eventually what [ __ ] lost me

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.720
well the problem is they do

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.320
waterboarding and then they also do

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.959
like serious sleep deprivation so you've

00:11:40.959 --> 00:11:42.560
been like deprived of sleep for like

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.760
three weeks or you know

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.880
you still get to sleep but they do a

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.959
thing where you just stand in a box

00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:48.480
and like let you start to fall asleep

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.000
and rattle lights and [ __ ]

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.120
back up and they'll do that to you for

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.720
like if they do that to you for if they

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.160
did that to me for 48 hours i'd be

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.279
hallucinating

00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:56.160
so then after you're in like a

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.360
hallucinatory sleep see all the details

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.720
and that was kind of like the pushback

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.240
against torture where it's like i mean

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.839
they're gonna talk about stuff

is how the idea of going viral is

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.360
affecting our behaviors in mass

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.960

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.480

nico's the man nico is the man dude i'm

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.640
this is i'm telling you i don't think

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.080
any of us are spared from this it's

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:36.480
literally

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.559
so there is the going viral is a highly

00:28:40.559 --> 00:28:42.159
socially desirable

00:28:42.159 --> 00:28:44.080
thing to happen yeah and there's like

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.000
immense payoff

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.120
so there's a bunch of people being

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.039
attracted to this kind of

00:28:49.039 --> 00:28:51.919
you know going viral who there's certain

00:28:51.919 --> 00:28:54.000
behaviors like dude those dudes like

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.679
dancing with their mom that one thing or

00:28:55.679 --> 00:28:57.440
like him dancing with his mom saying bad

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.120
words having his shirt off

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.480
it's like thing there's like if you

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.240
watch vine the ones that go to the top

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.919
have a certain set of behaviors

00:29:03.919 --> 00:29:06.000
that i think are being emulated in mass

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.360
so it's going to completely

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.799
stuff in front of your parents in the

00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:10.720

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.320
start like bleeding out into the real

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.520
world it's like normal patterns of

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.679
behavior we're slowly gonna be like

00:29:15.679 --> 00:29:16.880

totally yeah yeah yeah everyone like

00:29:18.799 --> 00:29:20.559
because eventually these people will be

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:22.240
parents so they'll be

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:25.200

00:48:06.319 --> 00:48:06.960
though

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:08.480
already trump does hate him yeah yeah

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.160
dude i read an article i was of course i

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:11.680
was ready to hate bezos because i'm like

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:12.160
i was

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.760
saudis hacked his phone that's how they

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.920
got those pictures of the [ __ ]

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.880
of him cheating yeah so apparently so

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:20.240
i've read an order again this could be

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.000
just probably this guy has enough money

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.680
saudis hacked his phone and got pictures

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.520
of him cheating yeah

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:27.200
so they could hack amazon and they

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.760
hacked his phone

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.920
there's like the amazon extorting a

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:32.800
[ __ ]

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.880
trillionaire is a sick move true but

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:37.040
it's like he amazon's like

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.520
storage like their cloud is i think like

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.400
it was more

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:41.599
supposedly it was more of like a

00:48:41.599 --> 00:48:43.359
personal thing you think trump set him

00:48:43.359 --> 00:48:43.760
up

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.280
yeah i think trump with one of his

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.280
princes on that yeah kushner kushner was

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:47.680
like

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.280
you're like one of those nudes you were

[ __ ] saudis and he was like

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.559
co-cursor went to the saudis and was

00:48:52.559 --> 00:48:55.359

00:48:58.079 --> 00:48:58.640
[ __ ]

dude you're the same people that were

00:49:00.319 --> 00:49:02.640

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:26.960
tubes that come from earth

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:28.800
that go all the way like to the moon

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.640
that are like mild hundreds of

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:32.480
thousands of miles long that would have

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.240
like beaches and [ __ ] somehow inside of

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.599
these tubes and like humanity's just

00:51:35.599 --> 00:51:37.040
going to spread out in tubes across the

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.319
galaxy until you figure out

00:51:38.319 --> 00:51:41.359
tubes dude he wants to live

00:51:41.359 --> 00:51:42.640
that sounds cool someone needs to put a

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.400
bullet in his head dude apparently i

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.119
don't like it

00:51:45.119 --> 00:51:46.880
he's this is all he cares he's a big

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.800
star trek he's a star trek nerd

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.160
again this is from the atlantic who

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.760
knows i support this it's an article

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:52.240
that makes you

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.839
like the tubes well i don't know about

00:51:53.839 --> 00:51:55.760
the tubes but i like the space effort i

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.440
look he's got blue origin he's like so

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.400
he cares about

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.880
his thing i know he's been donating a

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:03.760
lot to charity but

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:06.880
you know let's let's focus on i don't

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:07.920
know why don't you give one of those

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:10.160
billions of dollars to

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.160
fix something because all he cares about

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.599
his space that's the thing he's still

00:52:13.599 --> 00:52:14.079
focused on

00:52:14.079 --> 00:52:15.280
he thinks he's oh no he thinks it's a

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.200
waste of money he was like in order to

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:17.599
fix

00:52:17.599 --> 00:52:19.760
in order to make earth inhabitable we

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:20.640
have to slow down

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:23.520
growth that's he's very gerby-esque what

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.040
so he's like in order to make earth

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.480
inhabitable we have to slow down the

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.000
growth of the human species where we can

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.119
just start launching to

00:52:29.119 --> 00:52:31.440
like creating tubes to go into space and

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.760
then live in tubes

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:36.400
are you sure about these two dudes man

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:37.280
the tubes

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.599
i thought it was why why why not just go

00:52:39.599 --> 00:52:41.760
to different planets and just live there

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.359
he is that's musk is on that right now

00:52:43.359 --> 00:52:44.880
dude he's on his other he's on his own

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:46.559
[ __ ] bro he's [ __ ] richer than musk

00:52:46.559 --> 00:52:47.520
so he's like so he's just

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:48.960
i'm gonna go too i think this is like a

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.559
tesla edison type thing

00:52:50.559 --> 00:52:52.160
we're dealing with here i i have a

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.839
feeling bezos is getting so cucked my

00:52:53.839 --> 00:52:54.480
musk

00:52:54.480 --> 00:53:00.160
musk yeah yeah bezos i don't know

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.280
the article in the atlantic was written

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:07.520
by a journalist who twice tried to smite

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:07.920
him

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.599
this is kind of why bezos is kind of

00:53:09.599 --> 00:53:12.160
sick she like wrote a thing or maybe

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.839
i don't know wrote a thing and tried to

00:53:13.839 --> 00:53:15.920
smite bezos in an article

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:17.680
she wrote like a book or something and

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:19.280
bezos was like yo

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.800
i'm not [ __ ] letting that he like he

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.240
was like he's so he like dominated

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.119
publishing

00:53:23.119 --> 00:53:24.559
so he's like yeah we're not [ __ ] with

00:53:24.559 --> 00:53:25.760
your publisher so we're not gonna print

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:26.800
it did something we're not gonna print

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.079
books because you try to attack me at

00:53:28.079 --> 00:53:29.680
least this is what the author claimed

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:32.800
yeah sunk sunk the [ __ ] book

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.240
and then this lady came out with another

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:35.839
article being like this is why amazon's

00:53:35.839 --> 00:53:36.800
so [ __ ] up

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:38.640
and he pulled advertising from the

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.000
magazine

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.280
so it was just like that was a huge

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:43.280
debacle and then she wrote an article

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:44.720
find a third one like a long one in the

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:45.520
atlantic

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:48.160
that kind of makes bezos look cool so

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:49.200
i'm like

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:51.440
i mean how is jesus i mean if you're a

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:52.559
that's the other thing too if you're a

00:53:52.559 --> 00:53:54.240
billionaire

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.400
like how many people are are able to

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.079
withstand like if someone throwing a

00:53:58.079 --> 00:54:00.319
hundred mil at you

00:54:00.319 --> 00:54:02.000
no one be like yo write this thing i

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.680
need a journalist to write this thing

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.119
that makes me look good

00:54:05.119 --> 00:54:07.119
and i have a hundred mil yeah you can do

00:54:07.119 --> 00:54:09.040
that without even blinking

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:11.119
yeah so i don't know i don't but again

00:54:11.119 --> 00:54:12.400
i'm reading this and i'm like

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:14.079
it's about how amazon's a like basically

00:54:14.079 --> 00:54:15.440
more of a philosophy than a company

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:17.119
because it just like

00:54:17.119 --> 00:54:18.640
it doesn't make any sense what he what

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:20.319
he does is so diversify like

00:54:20.319 --> 00:54:23.040
when you're saying how they took the

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.000
what was it

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.599
how they had like hacked his phone

00:54:25.599 --> 00:54:27.839
amazon servers hold like the cia and all

00:54:27.839 --> 00:54:28.640
like they got like a lot of the

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:29.119
governments

00:54:29.119 --> 00:54:30.720
well not anymore because trump hates

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:32.319
them so they're like good

00:54:32.319 --> 00:54:33.839
they gave that contra i think they're no

00:54:33.839 --> 00:54:35.359
that was attracted to someone else yeah

00:54:35.359 --> 00:54:37.599
let's not have a cia on a corporation's

00:54:37.599 --> 00:54:38.880
[ __ ]

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.400
it's it's on it's like you're gonna do

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.920
it you can't do it it's not exactly

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.920
too big they're too big you can build

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.760
tubes to space i think you can build a

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:46.960
server for the gun i think you got to

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:48.240
break them up yeah you gotta break them

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:48.799

work out so hard he's preparing himself

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:32.799

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:32.160
workouts that are like [ __ ] soviet

union era [ __ ] calisthenic like it's

00:59:34.799 --> 00:59:36.480
just dudes doing the weirdest

00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:38.480
i got in there there was a chubby like a

00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:39.839
fat mexican lady

00:59:39.839 --> 00:59:42.000
just dancing that was her that was her

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.440
workout she was just dancing she wasn't

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:44.799
even moving her body she was moving her

00:59:44.799 --> 00:59:46.000
[ __ ] hands

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.880
in the mirror and then next door was

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:50.559
this i think greek dude

00:59:50.559 --> 00:59:53.359
that was just holding his knees and

00:59:53.359 --> 00:59:55.040
shaking him around

00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:57.200

to exercise now

01:00:03.839 --> 01:00:06.400
again me criticizing anyone's workout is

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.359
ridiculous but

01:00:07.359 --> 01:00:09.040
they obviously have never even seen

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.040
someone work out they're just in there

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.240
just making [ __ ] up

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.400
and then an indian dude comes in also

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.920

it's the craziest place it's the

01:00:32.319 --> 01:00:34.240
craziest place

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.760

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.599

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:31.360
shamans say that the champions

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.679
[ __ ] purely just like that that guy's

01:17:35.679 --> 01:17:36.960
not being like that's [ __ ]

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.960

like you're

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.719
like you're trying to you're trying to

01:17:44.719 --> 01:17:45.840

figure out a way to spin this true

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.199
positive and you make sort of that

01:17:57.199 --> 01:17:59.040
thinking face of like

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:01.440

trans this is a very sacred trance and

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:14.320

[ __ ]

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.400
history sick story i was i was listening

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.600
to more of that carlin

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:44.960
yeah on a supernova about japan

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:46.719
in world war ii and remind me i forgot

01:19:46.719 --> 01:19:48.159
about this story there was this guy on

01:19:48.159 --> 01:19:49.760
the baton death march

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:51.840
who now if you don't know about the

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.440
baton death i didn't know what it is so

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:55.280
like i think it was like 1942 it was

01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:56.480
early in the war

01:19:56.480 --> 01:20:00.960
in the pacific and japan had pushed

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:02.640
filipino and american soldiers to the

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:04.800
end of this island and uh

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:07.199
with like literally with bayonets or

01:20:07.199 --> 01:20:08.400
just like tactic-wise

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:11.440
the town was baton gotcha um

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.840
so then they were marched when they

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.040
surrendered

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:18.639
uh like 70 miles just a march

01:20:18.639 --> 01:20:20.719
and they were like starved they were

01:20:20.719 --> 01:20:22.400
[ __ ] there was i think it started

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:23.440
with

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:26.800
80 000 and only 50 000 made it like 30

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:30.560
000 died on this march which in 70 miles

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:30.960
30

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:34.400
000 people got either executed tortured

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.000
if you fell behind there was just trucks

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
behind you that would just run over you

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.520
there was it was the craziest [ __ ] in

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:40.960
the world like the baton death march is

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:41.280
rough

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.800
so that's them marching out other

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.800
imagine running them over

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.080
yeah there was just a bunch of people

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:47.840
from japan doing backpack b raiden

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.840
flying forward

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:51.199
and like if you asked for water they

01:20:51.199 --> 01:20:53.120
would [ __ ] just cut your head off if

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.000
you [ __ ]

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.320
oh they would do like sun torture they

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.080
would just make you stand in the sun it

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.480
was 110 degrees jesus

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:02.320
you're on a fight and with no head cover

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.440
that would just make you stand out in

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:03.920
the sun

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:05.120
true that's pretty [ __ ] up it was

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.199
really mean it was mean

01:21:07.199 --> 01:21:09.280
but uh there was this guy who played

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.800
fullback for notre dame

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.960
1937. he played against usc

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:17.120
and scored two he scored the

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.400
game-winning touchdowns

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:19.840
against us you know this or you were

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.120
just listening to this no i remember i

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:22.560
remember this article because it was

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:25.120
i read it gotcha and he talked about it

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.719
a little carlin talks about it

01:21:26.719 --> 01:21:30.159
so this guy his name is tinelli uh

01:21:30.159 --> 01:21:31.440
and i think he played professionally he

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.120
played for like the chicago cardinals at

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.000
the time

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.320
uh he had his notre dame class ring

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.239
and this japanese soldier like beat the

01:21:40.239 --> 01:21:42.239
[ __ ] out of him and stole the ring

01:21:42.239 --> 01:21:44.560
and then so he was like heartbroken he

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:45.600
like that was the one thing

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.239
keeping him like alive and then a

01:21:48.239 --> 01:21:49.280
japanese officer

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:51.120
saw that beat the [ __ ] out of that

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:53.199
soldier gave it back to him it was like

01:21:53.199 --> 01:21:55.040
i went to usc

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:56.800
i was at that game you're the [ __ ]

01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:59.120
man gave him the ring back

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:02.400
how sick is that [ __ ] yeah and then just

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:03.760
like made him sit out in the sun

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:05.440
and then let him go and tinelli had to

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:07.520
get in like a these train cars that were

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:08.800
like

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.040
just packed in it was 110 degrees out

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:12.239
and they were in train

01:22:12.239 --> 01:22:13.920
cars that you couldn't like dudes would

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:15.440
pass out and not be able to fall

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:17.120
like that's how packed they were if you

01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:18.800
had a [ __ ] or piss you would

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.480
no he was done after that he got [ __ ]

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:21.760
up he didn't play perfect he survived i

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:22.239
think

01:22:22.239 --> 01:22:24.080
i think he survived the war in a

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:25.760
japanese prison camp that like

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.760
everyone died in holy face the filipinos

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.280
got the worst though

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:31.520
yeah yeah they got it real bad because

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:33.040
they were considered

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:36.239
race traders to the japanese don't they

01:22:36.239 --> 01:22:38.000
get like crushed in china too

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.679
the filipinos yeah i know they're like

01:22:39.679 --> 01:22:41.440
hardcore second-class citizens in china

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:42.080

01:22:47.679 --> 01:22:50.639
well they got to get out of china true

01:22:50.639 --> 01:22:51.920
