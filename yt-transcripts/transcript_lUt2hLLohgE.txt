get inside a cheek exercise that's a

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.040
very sensitive area to smack a girl oh

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.840
yeah

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.119
sometimes like what the [ __ ] are you

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.840
doing you mean they're like in their

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.680
blood connect with the crack a little oh

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.799

i don't even know i don't hold at all i

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.200
just cry again i go dude

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.479
i just karate chop them right on the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.479
butthole

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.079
dude if you gave a girl karate shop on

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:43.439
the butthole not as hard as you could

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.479
obviously because you'd split her in

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.720
half yeah but if you did like uh you did

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.479
like a quick [ __ ]

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.479
to the butthole they'd

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:51.759
probably do something i mean yeah if you

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.680
can split them they'd probably split i

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.360
could just put a brick

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.479
i have no doubt i could say girl's

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:57.600
butthole would be nothing girl's

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.799

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.139

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:36.240
uh

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.759
at one point is this is what made me

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:39.280
laugh and i mean this story with all due

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.000

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.039
uh

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.199
and michaela this is a complete respect

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.120
absolutely all right so i mean dude

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.360
exactly yes tip of the hat respectful to

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.759
the canadians our neighbors up north

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.440
stay strong stay strong justin from

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.680
canada and uh

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.360
we uh

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.280
so we get done one of the things he's

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.360
talking about is how when you look at

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.479
something you're always valuing

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:03.360
something

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.120
so like your eyes you know you value

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.720
things naturally so whatever you're

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.880
looking at you're valuing that yeah

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.720
that's what yeah that's exactly what

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.479
happened all right so whatever you're

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.400
looking at that's the most not the most

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.240
important thing to you but your eyes

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.080
you've decided you've got a value system

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.680
sure something moves quickly you

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.520
naturally you look at it because that's

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.039
a it could be a threat something like

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:23.840
that

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.639
so

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:26.479
you're assigning value at all times

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:28.960
basically was what i gathered anyway we

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.360
get done i'm talking to michaela and

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.280
jordan and while he's talking to me i

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.840
was just looking at michaela's tits

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.759
and it was it was making me laugh so

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:39.520
much that i was like while talking to

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.039
him i was like

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:43.840
i've assigned value this is better and

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.840
this is nothing but respect of course i

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.759
wasn't like oogling i just happened to

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:49.680
look over and see them you caught they

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.120
attracted you thought it was a threat

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.240

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.599

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:54.880

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:31.440
yeah it's clever but he would have went

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.520
but that's extremely disrespectful what

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.280
you've done yeah worry about it but he

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.120
might carry a knife yeah he could have

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.039
killed me on the spot he might have if i

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:40.880
was dispatched by jp that'd be pretty

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.919
tight

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:43.680
sent to the next realm gains all your

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.560
powers he just highlighted you

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.759
he probably hasn't he probably keeps a

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.280
blade on him i would i would imagine he

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.120
keeps that thing something

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.639
bo staff up his sleeve that he can

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.639
he might have staffed you it was that

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:58.560
was that was a wise move to keep that on

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.759
your [ __ ]

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:00.720
yeah

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.160
if you that would that's a joke i think

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.520
he would have been like

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.039
i think that's a joke that even if they

00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:06.479
heard it now they wouldn't really like

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:08.319
that much

00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:10.160
but i thought it was a funny goof that

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.440
is a funny goof and he might have

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.680
giggled but i don't know i feel like

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.280
because he's a funny guy he had some

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.520
funny quips he's a funny guy yeah he's a

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.800
[ __ ] you know he's like a musician

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.240
right

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.879
i don't like that did you see the song

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:24.479
i don't know again i will look at things

00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:25.840
on youtube and i'm half paying attention

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.199
he has a song i think he just caught a

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:29.360
track no it sounds like a pink floyd

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.319
tune

00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:32.240
it's sick dude i didn't think it was him

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.479
i thought he put out a weird music video

00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:37.200
and it dude he's he's putting out music

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.880
my fears could be coming true that he is

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.959
a glory hound oh that means total glory

00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:42.320
yeah

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.320
440 or 432.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.720
what do you mean

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:49.120
it's probably 440 if i had to guess

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.959
although pink floyd apparently recorded

00:08:50.959 --> 00:08:52.640
in 432 and it does sound very

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.120
floyd-esque so good doc might have been

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.399
432. yeah i mean dude he's for sure i

00:08:58.399 --> 00:08:59.760
mean we're all glory hounds at some

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.080
level and he is sure sure but he doesn't

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.160
he he uses his glory houndness for i

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.680
would say it was [ __ ] crazy just

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.440
watching him he

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.200
he's crazy dude

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.800
he's in the ether dude

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.720
he's fully in either he's like he's just

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.480
walking around but it makes sense when

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.680
he goes and then he pauses

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:20.720
you like freestyle raps for like a

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.519
second yeah he's doctor strange dude i

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:24.640
think first

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.959
he is doctor she's dr strange's for sure

00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:28.320
but the first night like i was sitting

there the first like 20 minutes i was

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.040

tough yeah i didn't understand what the

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.320
[ __ ] he was saying it's a weird thing to

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.240
strap into too i saw him in upper darby

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.720

00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:48.080
he doesn't like jp

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.399
cause the sponge is just a cnn lip well

00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:52.000

00:09:57.519 --> 00:10:00.720
like a mechanized media machine that's

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.399

00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:16.000
well for us that was our western front

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.520
but i try to use the language of like

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.799
the east

00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:20.559
try to be respectful the eastern front

00:21:20.559 --> 00:21:22.400
is russia true they can't yeah they flew

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.760
from california i get what you're saying

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.600

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.600
the same thing it's it is a circle oh

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.720
you're saying it's not flat

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.320

from this drill sergeant will come out

00:33:22.159 --> 00:33:24.159
every day this is from the book the guy

00:33:24.159 --> 00:33:26.080
would be like i want to let you guys let

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:27.679
you little [ __ ] know that there was

00:33:27.679 --> 00:33:30.240
a report on like some military base of a

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.240
guy sucking another guy yeah let you

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.080
know they're in jail for 80 years all

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.000
right none of that [ __ ] so they were

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.200
again you were going to jail for 80

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.480
years for sucking he could have been

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.399
fibbing that drill sergeant that will

00:33:40.399 --> 00:33:43.519
try to make people not suck but

00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:45.840
apparently he did find out about a guy

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.760
in his platoon who sucks yes he said

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.200
they he heard that they went away to

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.200
jail yeah yeah yeah so they got sent

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.559
they got sent away

00:33:52.559 --> 00:33:53.519
you would probably go to jail for

00:33:53.519 --> 00:33:55.440
sucking i think they would say military

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.960
jail dude i mean it wasn't wasn't it

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.000
illegal they just never enforced it and

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.240
no but i mean like military legally

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.159
there was don't ever don't even ask it's

00:34:04.159 --> 00:34:05.440
like it's not a thing

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.279
but no but i mean now

00:34:07.279 --> 00:34:08.800
like recently like while we've been

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.240
alive there's been states that it's like

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.800
sodom is illegal oh that was just to

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.440
arrest gay dudes yeah but i'm dude i i

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.560
thought that was real like they were

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.560
sending gay if you got caught sucking on

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.839
military problems i'm sure you did you

00:34:19.839 --> 00:34:22.000

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.159
80 years dude life sentence

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:26.159
i don't think that's true

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:29.359
but maybe do you think manchester united

00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:31.599
i think maybe he told a story about a

00:34:31.599 --> 00:34:33.760
drill sergeant lying to say you guys

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.760
better not suck we'll kill you i don't

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.040
know because he was saying he's like

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.720
there's guys going the way i read it was

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.320

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.079
that would have been great if like tom

00:55:22.079 --> 00:55:23.520
hardy had like a horrible gambling

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.280
addiction and through the fight

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:26.799
got paid it'd be fun see that would be a

00:55:26.799 --> 00:55:28.319
good one actually hit his brother and

00:55:28.319 --> 00:55:28.790
killed him

00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:32.000
[Laughter]

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.720
yeah that'd be great to write a movie

00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:36.079
because that's that's clearly in the

00:55:36.079 --> 00:55:38.480
vein of like a triple x fast where it's

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:40.160
got it's like guys being strong and fast

00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:41.760
and honorable yeah and you just go watch

00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:43.920
and you're like oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] gotta be

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:45.599
a better man yeah but it'd be nice to

00:55:45.599 --> 00:55:47.839
have that where it ends just wretchedly

00:55:47.839 --> 00:55:49.760
yeah where the guy that gets hit his

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.280
brother dies and like they lose the

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:53.200
house yeah he's like i'm not strong or

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.680
fast anymore ma yeah you're like it's

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.520
all right it doesn't make sense what's

00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:58.799
the point of this and then some fat

00:55:58.799 --> 00:56:00.160
[ __ ] the point of anything that dork

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:02.880
that has money comes and [ __ ] his wife

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:04.640
puts him in jail

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.799
or the guy wins the fight then he gets

00:56:06.799 --> 00:56:08.079
let out handcuffs because he had sex

00:56:08.079 --> 00:56:10.319
with like a 16 year old sophomore

00:56:10.319 --> 00:56:11.760
which is still tight

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.280
that still plays into the hardcore

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:16.160
masculine part two

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:22.160
uh i was thinking because we were

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:24.319
me and uh the fellas were working on

00:56:24.319 --> 00:56:25.760
that king show

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.119
we're trying to we're we're working on

00:56:27.119 --> 00:56:28.880
we're right whatever but i was i was

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:30.240
talking to john yesterday it'd be funny

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:32.319
if any time we introduce a character you

00:56:32.319 --> 00:56:33.359
know how like

00:56:33.359 --> 00:56:35.040
in any series you add characters and

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:36.640
they leave they come and go every

00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.160
character that leaves the show needs to

00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:39.680
kill themselves

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:41.280
there's never another way that somebody

00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.839
leaves the show

00:56:43.839 --> 00:56:47.119
character eventually kills themselves

00:56:47.119 --> 00:56:48.720
just building up the circumstances to

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:50.480
why they have to do it would be so funny

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:52.240
yeah because yeah if the viewer knew

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:54.240
that they were going to eventually you

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:56.160
just slowly see like them drop a cup and

00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.559
be like

00:56:58.559 --> 00:57:00.240
like just the whole time

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.480
small things bothering them immensely

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:04.240
especially the medieval suicide methods

00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:05.599
of yourself nothing beautiful self

00:57:05.599 --> 00:57:08.799
guillotines oh dude even though yeah

00:57:08.799 --> 00:57:10.160
entering the iron what's like the thing

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:11.200
they put on

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.319
iron maidens

00:57:12.319 --> 00:57:14.559
stand there for [ __ ] one month

00:57:14.559 --> 00:57:15.700
i'm killing myself

00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:19.690
[Laughter]

00:57:20.559 --> 00:57:22.319
oh the one with nails that you closed

00:57:22.319 --> 00:57:23.440
you see that one

00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:25.599
dude they did some wild stuff

00:57:25.599 --> 00:57:27.040
they were bad boys the boys were up to

00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:29.040
no good they were bad boys i wonder how

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:30.319
tolerant they were of other people

00:57:30.319 --> 00:57:31.680
though in terms of like people's beliefs

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:33.280
and i'm sure there were very lifestyles

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:35.280
no they put them in a [ __ ] nail bed

00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:37.280
they closed it

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.319
yeah they would just push you out of a

00:57:38.319 --> 00:57:40.799
window immediately yeah dude was like

00:57:40.799 --> 00:57:42.720
this is my country song

00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:44.079
yeah i got to get that country out of

00:57:44.079 --> 00:57:45.440
here

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:47.119
[ __ ] with that it's different it'd be

00:57:47.119 --> 00:57:48.880
funny that back then they're like that's

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:50.559
different than us like we should kill

00:57:50.559 --> 00:57:53.599
them we should kill them that's exactly

00:57:53.599 --> 00:57:55.680
that's different than us tribalism yeah

00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:58.079
dude that's in chimps [ __ ]

00:57:58.079 --> 00:57:59.760
i don't know that's different than us

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:01.599
that's exactly everything

00:58:01.599 --> 00:58:03.359
that's exactly everything yeah but

00:58:03.359 --> 00:58:04.559
that's not like us like what should we

00:58:04.559 --> 00:58:05.839
do we should

00:58:05.839 --> 00:58:07.920
break that there's a whole other tribe

00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.079
we found they're wearing pants different

00:58:10.079 --> 00:58:11.520
than us

00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:13.280
we gotta break in there at night and cut

00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:14.799
their heads off

00:58:14.799 --> 00:58:16.240
and but we'll still we'll keep their

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:19.119
wives yeah true bring their wives to

00:58:19.119 --> 00:58:20.240
intro

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.000
their wives

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.079
yeah that must have been weird man

00:58:24.079 --> 00:58:26.319
because as a lady it's like

00:58:26.319 --> 00:58:28.319
you know you'd eventually come around

00:58:28.319 --> 00:58:29.599
and play ball

00:58:29.599 --> 00:58:31.520
with whoever your captor was yeah i mean

00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:32.960
there must be they come around

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.640
i'm sure there was a couple

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:36.880
down ass [ __ ] who would be like [ __ ]

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.480
you never [ __ ] you

00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:40.160
first off the chances are it was an

00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:41.599
arranged marriage and whoever they got

00:58:41.599 --> 00:58:43.440
arranged to was also a psycho that's

00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:44.640
true that's a good there was not a lot

00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:46.559
of loyalty back then in fact i'm sure it

00:58:46.559 --> 00:58:48.559
still doesn't exist today if that ruski

00:58:48.559 --> 00:58:50.160
that was doing the shelves upstairs cut

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.160
my head off she would have just moved in

00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:53.920
true she would have been like well he's

00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:55.040
nice

00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:58.480
he's cleaner than shane

00:58:58.559 --> 00:59:00.559
he doesn't yell at me yeah it's true

00:59:00.559 --> 00:59:01.920
women actually yeah women were like

00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:03.599
currency and

00:59:03.599 --> 00:59:04.640
that's the same thing that would happen

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:05.440
to me

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:07.119
some hot chick [ __ ] kidnapped me i'd

00:59:07.119 --> 00:59:08.960
be like i love this lady

00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:10.240

00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:36.000

00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:52.400
wow yeah i'm not like oh [ __ ] i got but

00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.960
the more [ __ ] up thing is it is a uh

00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:56.480
yeah but if you're a bro stuck down at

00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:59.359
like 85

00:59:59.599 --> 01:00:01.119
you got it there's gotta be a sorry

01:00:01.119 --> 01:00:02.880
dumbass you should have wasted ten years

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.079
doing stand-up comedy you should have

01:00:04.079 --> 01:00:06.240
gone to open mics and battled with

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:09.119
[ __ ] mentally unstable people for 10

01:00:09.119 --> 01:00:11.680
years that is funny though that that is

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:13.920
a big deal the quest having like a

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.359
digital platform i thought you're

01:00:15.359 --> 01:00:17.119
talking the quest it takes to reach this

01:00:17.119 --> 01:00:18.400
level no i'm saying that that's what i'm

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:19.920
saying it's like it's a journey everyone

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.760
you know is like you idiot go get your

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.200
series seven and learn how to do

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.400
accounting and i was like i don't think

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.400
so and instead i was just like selling

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.559
weed at an open mic it all came together

01:00:28.559 --> 01:00:30.160
like i knew i was right yeah i had a

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.640
feeling this was gonna work out dude i

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.720

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.440
my mom was begging me she was like

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.040
please just please go get a job and

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.799
they're right they were right well they

01:00:48.799 --> 01:00:49.839
didn't know this should have never

01:00:49.839 --> 01:00:51.520
worked what happened is we were so

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:54.160
[ __ ] that like the technology just

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.079
siphoned around we're like oh perfect

01:00:56.079 --> 01:00:57.920
yeah we jumped we leaped it was a

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.319
quantum leap we were so [ __ ] and

01:01:00.319 --> 01:01:01.839
steam lining towards like deep

01:01:01.839 --> 01:01:04.240
embarrassing failure at such a rapid

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.920
pace that we quantum leaped with

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.280
technology

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:10.400
we found a wormhole dude

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:15.599
[Laughter]

01:01:15.599 --> 01:01:19.359
it was my late 20s on an air mattress

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:23.480
i don't know where this is

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:26.950
i'm losing everything

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:30.240
[Laughter]

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.000
and then just one day it was like here's

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.960

nothing has changed i'm like i still

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.280

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.200
i don't know one thing

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.960
