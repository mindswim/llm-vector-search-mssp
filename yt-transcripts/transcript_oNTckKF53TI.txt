well if you start working there i'm like

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.799
if you i broke down like if you start

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.799
hosting you'll get like

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.840
200 a weekend maybe yeah and that takes

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.560
about a couple years to do and you know

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.160
and then that's two hundred dollars once

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.399
every like maybe four months

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.480
and i'm explaining four months is quick

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.239
too exactly and i'm like or you can if

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.360
you know if you really get good where

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.400
you're featuring that's you know i'm

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.239
like which will take forever

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.360
that was like you know then he got and

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.120
he was just like oh man i you know i was

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.720
sitting here thinking maybe that's that

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.480
was like it's like i'm at the end of my

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.160
rope man you know i don't i don't i'm

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.040
like

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.400
i'm like dude you might you can try it

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.680
if you want bro but i'm like if you're

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.959
thinking like you're about to cash in on

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.200
some stand up dude it's like you [ __ ]

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.840
think again especially if it's if he's

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.599
just an old party boy he's like i got

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.519
some hilarious stories it's like yeah

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.680
they don't really translate to stand up

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.840
exactly and that was like

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.840
that's kind of that yeah exactly and

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.160
that sucks that stand up so [ __ ]

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.400
oversaturated right now that everyone's

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.319
just like yeah i could do stand-up i

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.000
know but which is funny because stand up

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.200
is horrible

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.800

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.560

i am wearing a ramones t-shirt right now

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:07.759
that's pretty cheap pretty corny i might

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:09.680
start longboarding just like the the

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.800
typical

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.000
uh migratory route of like students i'm

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.199
gonna start just like standing on the

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:17.280
top of 34th street here and just long

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.240
boarding all the way down to like

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.919
drexel's campus do you ever see when

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:21.520
someone carves up the street right

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.880
i hate it so much

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.720
dude it makes me laugh so hard when i

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.160
was in school there was a kid i had a

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.440
class with that would long board to

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.199
class every day yeah and he would come

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:31.360
into class and put his long board at the

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.199
front of the room and i [ __ ] i was

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:35.120
just like dude you are the biggest

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.560
[ __ ] douche

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.440
ever

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.599
well it's such an odd thing to have to

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:41.599
like carry like carrying around a long

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:43.120
board with you it's like

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.880
just like carrying around like four two

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.880
by fours and walking around yeah and

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.199
then it's just clearly an inconvenience

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:51.039
so then it's like you're clearly doing

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:53.919
this to look cool yeah yeah i mean

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:55.440
getting the classes quick but it was

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.680
westchester so no matter what it's not

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.360
that long of a wall yeah the only thing

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.800
that'd be cool if he just laid down on

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.599
it [ __ ] rolled down

00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:05.360
he's [ __ ] awesome if you lose if he

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.479
like a cool rock got a helmet yeah

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:10.240
yeah that'd be acceptable but that's the

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.919
only acceptable thing to do onboarding

00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:13.440
the class is

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.360
amongst the gay [ __ ] you can possibly do

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.280
it's tough dude do you know who's really

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.639
you know uh

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:20.400
what the [ __ ] the guy's name reuben

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.840
the reuben report yeah what's his name

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.000
i forget his first name not tom rubin

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.400
not rick rubin not mark rubin is it not

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.080
real mark rubin

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.000
[ __ ] what the hell is the guy's name

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.080
what up dave ruben all right dave reuben

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.279
you know he's gay is he gay he's gay oh

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:40.640
[ __ ] i didn't know that dude didn't know

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.159
it either i was listening i'd listen to

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:42.880
like

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.040
10 minutes of his rogan podcast exactly

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.160
and then he was like yeah jordan

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.080
peterson's touring with a gay guy and i

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.440
was like i don't remember a gay guy on

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.000
that show it's him makes sense i had no

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.920
idea the worst part about when i found

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.600
out about that because i've always not

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.600
liked dave rubin but i haven't been able

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.440
to put my finger on it so that's kind of

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.600
why it was kind of like you just

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.519
you instinctively don't like gay people

00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:04.800
is that what you're saying what made me

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.560
feel bad it made me feel like that yeah

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.160
where i was kind of like dude that's

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.600
what i hate about this guy's always like

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.720
everyone i think i don't know man

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.080
something about that guy i don't [ __ ]

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.680
like him i don't know what it is and

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.800
then i found out he was gay and i was

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.560
like oh he's just a gay guy yeah but i

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.800
was i was like i still don't really like

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.240
i don't really enjoy him he like goes on

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.760
that rogan podcast and like talks about

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.080
his fans and i'm like who the [ __ ] is a

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.600
dave rubin fan

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.920
it's like i [ __ ] love dave rubin dude

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.920
yeah and he was like i you know i was

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.760
with with peterson i would open up every

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.600
show with like 15 minutes to stand up

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.959
and i was like dude that was not stand

00:09:34.959 --> 00:09:36.880
up that was you being a [ __ ]

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.560
home man it turns out you're actually

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.160
gay so that makes sense

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160
it was just a gay dude being gay it was

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.600
so that was the funniest part to me

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.800
because i was like damn dude i'm so

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.240
homophobic because the whole time i was

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.680
just like i don't know man there's

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.800
something about you know like

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.560
something's off i don't like and i like

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.920
as soon as i found out he was gay i was

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.680
like oh like my brain could finally be

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.160
like oh perfect and like just categorize

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.640
it yeah like totally fine now you're

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.800
like he's acceptable yeah

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.480
why because you have lower because you

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.080
have lower standards for gay people in

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.440
your mind for stand up yeah

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.800
for sure

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.519
i mean

00:10:09.519 --> 00:10:12.240
i mean this is unreasonable but my thing

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.040
was it was just funny to me to be like

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.880
it was just a it was closure for me

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.120
personally yeah but i found out i'm like

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.040
am i [ __ ] that homophobic dude that i

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.399
was like

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:23.200
but

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.200
i don't know i've said it before even

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.720
when people are like hey man i don't

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.839
care what you do with your body it's

00:10:27.839 --> 00:10:29.120

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.279
like i i

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:35.040
the fact that it like goes on doesn't

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.720
bother me but as soon as dave rubin is

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.079

in dildeberg lifting up rocks finding

00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:38.800
salamanders they'd just you wouldn't be

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.360
chris hardwick was just being a muslim

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.120
dude that was a hot take we had to

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.200
delete a podcast because i started

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.800
making fun of a pittsburgh cop for

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.240
shooting a black kid

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.760
but uh yeah well you're trying to find

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.200
the funny angle on it and you're like

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.120
there was a funny angle it was funny and

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.320
i couldn't explain in fact it was his

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.160
first day there was a cop that shot a

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.399
black kid on basically his first day and

00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:07.519
just

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:09.120
coming in and making noise he was

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.360
setting the tone on day one i mean he

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.959
came in it was like i'm gonna clean up

00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:14.720
the streets you know what's weird too i

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.360
wonder how much first person shooters

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.279
growing up with them how much that

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:21.040
influences cop like the quickness to

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.240
pull the trigger i mean you if you grew

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.680
up from the time you're a kid playing

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.000
duck hunt then you're playing doom then

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.680
you're playing call of duty and then

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.040
you're like oh now you're a cop here's a

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.200
gun i wonder how much faster your do you

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.040
think video games cause

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.800
violence i mean dude i've said it before

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.720
doom was invented by darpa

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.160

then someone gave you a real gun and

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.079

00:13:04.079 --> 00:13:05.360
just reflectively do what game do you

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.120

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.120
was just the name of the game yeah i'm

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.200
not saying it causes

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.320
murder i'm just saying it might

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.160
quicken up someone's ability to like pop

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.480

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:35.920
influence on young kids

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.360
no

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.800

00:13:42.079 --> 00:13:43.360
shoot people do you think rap is

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.880
detrimental to the african-american

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.440
community yeah i think so you do

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.079
i knew a guy who was like 30 one time

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:52.560
who started doing uh you know what let

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.040
me cut you off there what matt

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.959
because you know i think it is yeah i've

00:13:56.959 --> 00:13:58.240
been living up he i didn't let doesn't

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.760
let his kids listen to rap pardon me

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.440
matt what

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.680
part of me i've i've been living up in

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.639
new york and since then

00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:08.000
you know you come across all types of

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.519
different walks of life it's not like

00:14:09.519 --> 00:14:12.000
you backwoods folk around here so i mean

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.519
please let me have the floor for one

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:15.040
second take it

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.120
uh for you to insinuate that

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.120
african-americans are plagued due to

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.079
[ __ ] hip-hop music is excruciatingly

00:14:22.079 --> 00:14:24.240
offensive no it's not yes it is no it's

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.639
not you're placing the blame on hip-hop

00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:28.480
instead of the real blame what's the

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.199
real blame the white man that's true and

00:14:31.199 --> 00:14:34.160
systemic oppression that all could be

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.720
however i think so sitting around harry

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.240
sitting around all day is that what you

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.760
think african americans do no i'm just

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.880
saying if you're just sitting around

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.560
your car you're driving around and it's

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.880
just non-stop war drums of like kill

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.880
kill kill murder and all of a sudden you

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.120
know i think from the time you're eight

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:49.920
to

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.000
i knew a guy who was 30 who was talking

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.440
about how he started taking percocets i

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.360
was working with him i'm like dude don't

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.079
take percocets it leads to bad [ __ ] you

00:14:58.079 --> 00:14:59.279
know i'm like people get hooked on them

00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:01.519
it's just a bad idea don't do it and he

00:15:01.519 --> 00:15:02.959
was like ah you know what's wrong with

00:15:02.959 --> 00:15:04.639
them blah blah blah and i was trying to

00:15:04.639 --> 00:15:06.320
think of a reason to like talk this guy

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.760
out of it i'm like well if you if you

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.360

you won't get your dick card i knew a

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.199
guy who's to try to [ __ ] check and

00:15:13.199 --> 00:15:14.320
he'd take too many percocets couldn't

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.399
get his dick card and this guy as a

00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:18.320
source goes nah

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.760

rap dude that's not real that's that's

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:27.360
not like that's nothing that's not

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.440

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.519
life on he was like i don't know man i

i just i just think it's irresponsible

00:15:40.079 --> 00:15:42.480
and what it's you know it's convenient

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.920
for you as a white man to sit here and

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.920
you know

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.920
wag your finger at african americans i

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.199

saying i told you i'm a black

00:15:55.519 --> 00:15:56.880

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.600
and i still think it is kind of

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.840
addictive but at the same time if you're

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.320
in a busy line and some guy is just like

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.000

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.919
backwoods heartland american bro you

00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:47.200

but i'm in lowe's and hungary

00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:52.960
so

00:19:55.919 --> 00:19:57.360
must be not see like that's one of those

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.280
i'm so jealous of your lifestyle yeah

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.559
that's true like you just get to work

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:02.640
and not worry like you you build stuff

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.320
which is i mean that's important yeah

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.160
it's very important otherwise how is our

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.840
civilization going to progress exactly

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.919
but also it's like i wish i wasn't

00:20:09.919 --> 00:20:12.880
struck with this burden of just

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.120
you know being in a metropolis just this

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.480
burden that comes with being so

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.320
intelligent and caring about other

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.039
people and it'd be so nice to just be

00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:24.320

this [ __ ]

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.280
i am done with the [ __ ] well it was

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.440
funny i was talking to uh

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.200
the spud man did we yeah we talked about

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.920
[ __ ] reuben on this one

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.280
and uh

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.800
what the [ __ ] he was saying something

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.480
about like

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.480
how it was in my head he was like well

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.280
you know

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.200
he was like if he's like there's nothing

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.520
wrong with being gay but if everyone was

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.000
gay it would be disastrous for the world

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.599
because no one reproducing you know

00:38:49.599 --> 00:38:50.560
whatever

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:51.839
or i guess you could do the artificial

00:38:51.839 --> 00:38:54.240
insemination and [ __ ]

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.079
but

00:38:56.079 --> 00:38:58.480
i just wonder what if literally

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.800
if there was like everyone in the world

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.480
became gay it's like

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.160
i don't know what the [ __ ] would happen

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.000
i'd [ __ ] suck your dick i don't i

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.040
don't worry about that i'm just saying i

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.400
mean i totally let you suck my dick i'm

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.760
the same what would happen to the base

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.119
dude

00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:12.560
if it was the full gate takeover because

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.079
in my head i'm thinking that it's almost

00:39:14.079 --> 00:39:15.760
like a global

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.680
thing like we're getting overpopulated i

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:18.960
think

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.200
we might go into gay ice ages every now

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:22.480
and again

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.079
for like do you think due to

00:39:24.079 --> 00:39:25.520
overpopulation do you think maybe the

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.040
media is trying to

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.440
maybe no jesus biological thing do you

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.720
think the jews are trying to control the

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.119
population by making everybody gay has

00:39:33.119 --> 00:39:34.720
nothing to do with the jews are you sure

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.560
positive there's a lot of jews wait uh i

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.480
live in new york now yeah you see a lot

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.800
of jews there oh boy you want to talk

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.640
about jews

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.920
you you're like do you see the amish

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.760
ones upside down the real jews yeah dude

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.599
real deals the weird al yankovic jews

00:39:47.599 --> 00:39:51.280
they're real weirdo yanks dude

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.800
but my head it's like dude i wonder if

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.880
we just go like super gay for a while

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.200
every now and again as a species yeah

00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:58.960
then like we like the population thins

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.800
out and then they're like you know then

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.400
lightning strikes two tablets and it's

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.640
like no more being gay

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.839
that makes sense

00:40:05.839 --> 00:40:08.320
yeah so you think god

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.359

00:40:11.359 --> 00:40:13.280

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.040
um no i will say the funny thing about

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.319
another thing about that podcast was

00:41:20.319 --> 00:41:23.760
funny he was a hard liberal reuben yeah

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.040
and then like

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.440
he did a video about like why he like

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.440
problems he had with the left and then

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.319
the thing he did it for retitled it like

00:41:32.319 --> 00:41:34.560
why i'm leaving the left and he said

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:35.920
this on the podcast he wasn't even

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.440
planning on leaving the left side he was

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.960
like things he didn't like about the

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.040
left of the time so then he got so many

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.119
people being like yo you're the man this

00:41:43.119 --> 00:41:44.960
is awesome he even said he goes and then

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.880
you know i just uh i kind of just ran

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.359
with that so now he just like went viral

00:41:49.359 --> 00:41:51.359
of a video that like someone else made

00:41:51.359 --> 00:41:53.359
up the title for he kind of said it was

00:41:53.359 --> 00:41:54.880
like weird for a second and i i was kind

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.480
of like dude you kind of just exposed

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.760
did you just admit that you're doing

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.280
this for the likes you just joe rogan

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.520
exposed himself to be like so i got a

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.520
lot of likes and then i just was like

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.240
[ __ ] conservative yeah yeah well it's

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.599
funny that we're in a time where

00:42:07.599 --> 00:42:09.599
everybody has to have a political view

00:42:09.599 --> 00:42:10.480
yeah

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.160
it's like dude there's

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.480
too many of us are [ __ ] retards yeah

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.920
man it's like none of us should have an

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.280
opinion on how the government should

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.359
work honestly not none of us but a lot

00:42:19.359 --> 00:42:21.839
of like like chocolate covered pretzels

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:23.760
he should not have a political opinion

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.599
he needs to focus on tube tops dude i

00:42:25.599 --> 00:42:28.000
think instead of the illuminati i think

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.920
the the real threat is the global

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:32.720
network of just [ __ ] idiots that is

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.480
that's the real threat of like just

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.839
constantly clapping chocolate covered

00:42:35.839 --> 00:42:38.560
pretzels in all towns across america

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.720
just exactly i don't even think they

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:41.599
don't even need the internet to

00:42:41.599 --> 00:42:42.880
communicate i was wondering the other

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.640
day and this is just a thought but it's

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.920
like i don't even know if like you can

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.680
take things like racism all that stuff

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.520
it's like i think it's almost even just

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.760
an idiot problem it's like

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.520
it's just people who are [ __ ] morons

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.760
fighting each other and they do racism

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.760
racism to each other but it's like

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.680
i don't know i it's that's important i

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:01.119
was just kind of like i have a lot of

00:43:01.119 --> 00:43:02.560
thoughts i don't put into words yet no

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.560
that's kind of fair but i just think

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.760
there's like a lot of [ __ ] like that

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:06.880
where it's like dude if we could just

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.079
like

00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:09.760
i don't know maybe not give [ __ ]

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:10.839
idiots a

00:43:10.839 --> 00:43:12.880
platform maybe you take away the right

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.200
to vote after a literacy test what do

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.800
you think of that dude when they like

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.560
said like you needed to own land to vote

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.839
and they're like that's [ __ ] and

00:43:19.839 --> 00:43:21.440
it's like

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.040
i don't know man there's a lot that was

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.880
just a dumb [ __ ] it was just an

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.200
old i mean obviously there was racism in

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.200
it it wasn't just racism

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.119
i know but it was also like that was

00:43:31.119 --> 00:43:32.400
back when you could look at poor people

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.160
and be like oh

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:37.440
yeah don't let them disrupt the politics

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.079
poor people are unruly they [ __ ] are

00:43:40.079 --> 00:43:41.599
they're rowdy dude trust me i get on the

00:43:41.599 --> 00:43:43.119
r train

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.200
basics dude i've been saying this

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.880

video you saw i'm just like i got a

00:45:52.079 --> 00:45:53.520
feeling i don't see something in real

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.000
life it i don't doesn't exist i got a

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.280
feeling you and chocolate covered

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.800
pretzel are on the same wavelength than

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.160
that what immediate experience just

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.760
immediate whatever's 10 feet in front of

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.760
you you guys are both like goldfish

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.040
yeah that's it i mean that's how you

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.480
have to be whatever's going on i'm i'm

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.480
with it exactly if i haven't seen it

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.920
it's not real i guarantee if you walk

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:11.200
out it's the ancient art if you're like

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.200
yo chocolate covered pretzel or dinosaur

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.480
is real but i ain't never heard no

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:15.760
dinosaurs

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.359
i wasn't around for them

00:46:17.359 --> 00:46:18.400
he was in such a rush he would have

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.920
smacked me with one of his sabers dude

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.079
with his savers damn there they were

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:23.280
swords

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.119
do you think he has blades in them he

00:46:25.119 --> 00:46:28.400
has to so he had the full-on

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.400
like if he smashes them down hard enough

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:31.920
on the floor

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.839
he can just probably absolutely spin

00:46:33.839 --> 00:46:35.200
around and dude what do you think

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.119
happens to the stinky legs they just

00:46:37.119 --> 00:46:39.040
probably just go up they probably like

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:41.920
knee up into wheels

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:44.319
like a transformer how it like folds up

00:46:44.319 --> 00:46:47.200
yeah the wheels dude or little maybe

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:48.319
maybe

00:46:48.319 --> 00:46:49.920
maybe some wheelies or something i don't

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.000
know yeah but that makes people leans

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.160
back on his wheels and takes off do you

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.160
think he's well didn't you say his feet

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.760
were in different directions

00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.200
yeah but i mean i'm sure you could get

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:02.079
custom made wheelies

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.240
i think that's just a wheelchair at this

00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:05.280
point i think he should be in a

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.800
wheelchair

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.839
not not as ripped as he is

00:47:08.839 --> 00:47:10.880
man true

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.160
if he that's probably what happened he

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.520
might everything he's probably busted

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.040
out the chair on like a sunday yeah but

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.040
if he was in the chair he's so ripped

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.119
that it probably he got so much speed it

00:47:19.119 --> 00:47:20.240
was probably starting to lift off the

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.280
ground

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.880
you know what i mean he's probably one

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:24.800
of the first he might start flying a

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.160
little

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.599
he might help her

00:47:27.599 --> 00:47:29.040
well that's also too he's like he's

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.640
doing those like the sticks so he's

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.079
working his pecs a lot but if he got in

00:47:32.079 --> 00:47:34.400
the wheelchair that's all right dude

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.720
he was [ __ ] he was he would rip your

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:39.440
dick off i mean

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.200
i would love to put you up to a

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.960
challenge to like try to take a hand job

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.040
from that guy it's probably blinding

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.000
speed

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.079
probably feels so good i know he just

00:47:48.079 --> 00:47:49.599
probably lays the stinky legs on a

00:47:49.599 --> 00:47:51.520
[ __ ] pillow in front of him and just

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:53.839
sits down

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:56.480
i mean he's probably such a good hand

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.760
job

00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.200
i mean his hand jobs have been life he's

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.640
been living and dying because he's

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.560
[ __ ] getting tube tops and crutches

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.000
so he's probably dude he probably if you

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.319
close your eyes stay as old sl dude it's

00:48:06.319 --> 00:48:08.079
probably just like

00:48:08.079 --> 00:48:09.920
it's probably so powerful i see this is

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.520

00:48:32.079 --> 00:48:33.599
a lot of people start a lot of like

00:48:33.599 --> 00:48:35.280

habits matt

00:48:50.319 --> 00:48:51.920

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:54.000
have drug problems yeah about seventy

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.680

eighty-five yes

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:00.079

probably he sucked so [ __ ] bad well

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.880
his whole show was based off like puns

yeah but uh he's muslim but also

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.040

comic was gay and all of a sudden you're

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.160

gay dudes and heterosexual dudes

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:20.319
different and it was funny because dave

00:50:20.319 --> 00:50:22.480
rubin i'd watch him interview people and

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:23.760

00:50:35.359 --> 00:50:38.160
a part of you would suck his dick

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.760

00:50:50.319 --> 00:50:52.079
you ever thought of jordan peterson not

00:50:52.079 --> 00:50:53.599
sexually but just it popped into your

00:50:53.599 --> 00:50:54.800
head while you're going about your

00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.800

while i was jerking off i mean i have to

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.400
i've tried to avoid it based on when i

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.319
met him i tried to not jerk off i never

00:51:04.319 --> 00:51:06.160
really thought about jp while jerking

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:07.599
off or at all do you ever have things

00:51:07.599 --> 00:51:09.680

in it dude i see it's so

00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:16.720
now that i live in new york and like

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.319
sexuality is like

00:51:18.319 --> 00:51:20.240
way more open it's just like i mean this

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.920
is there's nothing to be ashamed of i

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.680
don't need

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.119
you know yeah

00:51:25.119 --> 00:51:26.720
so what happened what comes in your mind

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:29.359
anything just dave rubid just whatever

00:51:29.359 --> 00:51:31.440

talking about how her mom was telling

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:24.640

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.839
when you come to philly i'm sure like

01:02:07.839 --> 01:02:09.280
when i come to philly it brings back

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:12.880
some terrible memories of like

01:02:13.839 --> 01:02:15.680
even imagining

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.040
you seeing it's weird you probably get

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.640
off the train in a philly and like you

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.319

01:02:20.319 --> 01:02:21.680
i know it's great well it's so it's

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:23.520
there's so much discrimination here and

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.920
true in new york it's like this

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.359
it's beautiful yeah if you put like you

01:02:27.359 --> 01:02:28.960
wouldn't believe you put like colombians

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.960
with pakistanis i'm sure there's like

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.040
zero prejudice going on up there dude

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.280
there is none they all get along i'm

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.079
sure

01:02:36.079 --> 01:02:38.400
actually i'm i haven't really i mean i

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.839
it's not like i ever saw discrimination

01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:41.760
here either but yeah it's just a bunch

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:44.240
of worker bees scurrying i know

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:46.240
people are moving too fast in new york

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.960
the place i live in this time generally

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.000
uh

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.920
it's just a bunch of foreigners working

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.839
hard as [ __ ] yeah like carrying boxes

01:02:53.839 --> 01:02:54.960
why would you pick new york if you're a

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.040
foreigner that's exactly what i said me

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.400
and mckeever were driving into the city

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.000

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.680
would you live here don't they know it's

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.119
like i would i would live in

01:03:03.119 --> 01:03:05.440
mechanicsburg yeah for sure but then i

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:06.880
guess it's like you make more money in

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.000
new york and they're just sending it

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:08.880
home

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.880
i guess yeah i mean i'm sure rent's a

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.400
little more expensive but it's also they

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:13.520
don't i don't think they give a [ __ ]

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.880
they can live

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:16.079

there yeah they're all

01:03:24.799 --> 01:03:26.640
just steaming right along that's true

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.240
that makes sense down these box trucks

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:30.480
around [ __ ] usually the destination

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.000

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.960
on the wall yeah he looks like a [ __ ]

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:07.039
runner he looks like run dmc i think he

01:05:07.039 --> 01:05:08.960
looks like ryan it looks like mr big but

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.720
then the one on the corner is just a

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.720
black lady well it's always it's like a

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.559
regular tough for a

01:05:14.559 --> 01:05:17.760
muralist to like paint black people

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.520
because it's like you got to be really

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.440
good at painting otherwise like you can

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.119
really [ __ ] up and make people look like

01:05:23.119 --> 01:05:25.520
super weird and funny because i i stayed

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.280
at a statue and it just dude it looks

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:29.359
like jamie foxx every day i drive past

01:05:29.359 --> 01:05:31.119
it i'm like ah jamie foxx

01:05:31.119 --> 01:05:32.480
like every time i see it i'm like oh

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.920
it's just like that guy [ __ ] up and

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:35.359
also you can't really paint too many

01:05:35.359 --> 01:05:37.760
white people on a mural

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:39.200
so it's getting scary it starts getting

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.319
real scary

01:05:40.319 --> 01:05:42.079
once there's a big white face on a

01:05:42.079 --> 01:05:43.599
building looking over everybody it's

01:05:43.599 --> 01:05:45.200
like oh mr burns this looks like

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.440
mussolini's headquarters this is not

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:48.799
good

01:05:48.799 --> 01:05:50.480
you really can't you do you need black

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.559
people on murals that's i could see i

01:05:52.559 --> 01:05:54.480
agree with you for a while that bugged

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:55.200
me

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.119
but just to be like why the [ __ ] can we

01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:58.880
get one [ __ ] hockey on one of these

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.400
and then i saw a mural with a white guy

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.839
and i was like oh we gotta take that

01:06:01.839 --> 01:06:02.720
down

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:05.119
that's too powerful scary if i see a

01:06:05.119 --> 01:06:06.960
white guy painted onto a wall i'm like

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:08.720
dude that's i'm fall i'm voting for him

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.400
yeah that's true i'll join his arm right

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.799
now why are we marching

01:06:12.799 --> 01:06:15.039
hand me a torch

01:06:15.039 --> 01:06:17.280

01:06:24.079 --> 01:06:26.880
dude uh yeah you'd be surprised

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.280
yeah you're probably right

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.880
[ __ ] think of any listener we have

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.559
that's reached out to you well

01:06:32.559 --> 01:06:34.000
don't say it's a black show just say you

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.760

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.160
distinction it's a black show

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:41.599
