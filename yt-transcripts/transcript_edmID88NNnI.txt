Rice and not OJ think OJ's domestic

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.550

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.940
like a we should say something the

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.400

missed that one the NFL the NFL

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.130

do have to make statements sure which

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.700
that should be the trade-off if you want

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.840
these corporations to

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.670

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.360
enough from sure people are like I was

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.480

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:07.350
yeah the French Revolution is pretty fun

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.520
to listen to

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:12.860
while digging up - they just they really

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.420
acted like a bunch of [ __ ] the

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.990
revolutionaries like there was just they

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.480
they just really overreacted they [ __ ]

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.300
they could it was they they needed to do

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.280
it gradually and they freaked out he

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.010
went to fall we're [ __ ] liberal you

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.620
don't need [ __ ] religion and this is

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.930
like we don't need kings or religion and

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.420
all that [ __ ] they kind of they just got

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.290
out of control they started well they

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.240
all sort of beheading each other tight

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.430
they turn eventually they're like it's a

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.770
argument to see who's the most like

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.040
revolutionary would you be able to maybe

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.530
plug that into modern-day times

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:52.800
yes very easily it is called it

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.990
revolutionary yes Ted I mean one one of

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:56.280
the things that's really funny [ __ ]

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.550
Kings they had this this meeting

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.670
basically their Senate got together and

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:04.110
it was like in the wake of like

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.330
Revolution was happening mm-hmm so the

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.670
Senate got together to be like here's

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.050
the changes we need to make and they

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.340
thought it was gonna be like kind of

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.200
moderate compared to what but everybody

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.600
kept one topping each other to be more

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.000
like well the you know no more [ __ ]

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.020
there's one thing they had was Royal

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.170
hunting grounds so like only the Lords

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:29.070
or Kings could hunt like only the the

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:30.600
master of that land was allowed to hunt

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.400
on it peasants peasants could never hunt

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.620
yeah you could get killed if you and so

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.810
one one of the priests got up and

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.580
changed that one of the bishops got on

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.050
and was like we got to get rid of that

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.300
and one of the Lords loved hunting so

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:46.400
he's a [ __ ] that also paying tithes is

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.570
unfair and we shouldn't do that anymore

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.720
and the bishop had to be like yeah

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.580
[ __ ] just lost all of my money

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.340
because I took away hunting laws all my

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.320
powers yeah and they there yeah then

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.790
they started taking land from the church

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.310
then they took like they did it just got

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.050
yeah they got wild man so these were

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.540
people vying for the attention of the

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.120
peasants being like I'm rich no time or

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.450
the customs the peasants I don't think

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.280
gave like I mean they cared but they

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.480
weren't they didn't give a [ __ ] this is

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.540
all like Parisian [ __ ]

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.700
oh damn fighting money that I don't like

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.690
these revolutions well

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.760
they aren't very likable yeah it's like

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.350
and there's paintings and stuff of like

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:27.300
how glorious and cool this revolution

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.460
was of like women leading the charge

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:30.840
it's like they ended up just cutting

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.520
everyone's [ __ ] heads off and then

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.670
Napoleon yeah like they just [ __ ] the

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.980
bed and then Napoleon burned Europe was

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.030
there so you're telling me there's

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.620
people like hundreds of years ago who

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.210
painted head pictures painted of them

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.570
protesting yes like Facebook profile yes

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:48.060
it's damn wrench lag - oh that's so

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.280
funny now we've done this before they

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.450
support France oh they're like they

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:53.130
stayed they stood with France yeah oh

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.800
that's so tight yeah yeah yeah that's so

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.910
[ __ ] fun which yeah that it's just

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.970
the whole thing is like mm-hmm it's

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.280
scary to listen to kind of I mean not

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.390
that I think we're going through that

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.640
but you can see where that cycle came

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.260
from go through baby versions of it

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.200
though yes like what do we have instead

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.600
of the guillotine it's just the [ __ ]

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:20.730
the press cut my [ __ ] head off dude

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.650
yeah it is funny though the idea of

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.680
going fuels jobs now is like that's as

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.180
close as you can get to killing someone

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.140
just yeah yeah destroy their livelihood

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:35.190
and shame them yeah it's pretty but yeah

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.220
the the imagine like the [ __ ]

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.960
Parliament that meeting they had where

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.490
they all just kind of lost control and

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:42.870
they like the described it as like a

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.630
feverish like well we should also get

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.300
rid of this and they're like yeah and

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.100
then this and then they all woke up like

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.690
the next day like whoo we went a little

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.300
too hard on that [ __ ] he just changed

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.770
our entire country and one big [ __ ] so

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.750
it was pretty disastrous precess it's

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:03.210
also funny like the king and queen kept

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.550
trying to like escape they got like yeah

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:07.020
like they were like held hostage just

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.940
Philip it was King Louis king Louis

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.810
using Louis Louis and Marie Antoinette

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.250
alright everybody didn't like Marie

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.589
Antoinette cuz she was a hue and she was

00:15:16.589 --> 00:15:18.540
Austrian so they didn't really like her

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.310
the French didn't like her so they were

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:21.839
excited to [ __ ] get her on the

00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:23.370
guillotine they'd been waiting for that

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:24.900

servants dressed as them go out they had

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.290
one guy this was a good idea for King

Louie to escape that a guy dresses like

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.730
this diplomat coming in and out every

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:41.370

ridiculous outfit sure every night and

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.230

like really like cool historical things

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.880
that just end with people getting their

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.470
[ __ ] heads cut off it's like a boss

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:34.330

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.160
into just like oh yeah and then we just

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.750

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:38.890
just loved how it all started like

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:40.270
couple people were in a bar but you know

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:41.890
what's [ __ ] [ __ ] always yeah like

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:43.570
a beer hall somebody stands on a table

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:45.220
and it's like I'm not paying this

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.340
[ __ ] salt tag that conversation ends

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.710
with some cake on the lady's head off in

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:53.770
a square some dude he puts a hot status

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:54.940
in the beer hall and everyone's like

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.550
[ __ ] yeah dude [ __ ] yeah they would

00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:01.750
really like they they would cut people's

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.130
[ __ ] heads off and like parade them

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:05.410
around town [ __ ] rules crazy

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:08.200
that's so funny walk around like ya got

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.820
that [ __ ] [ __ ] you did it like

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.190
two guards there just captured two

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:13.600
guards cut their heads off and run

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.910
around was it was a guillotine ooh

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.130
I think so that must have been clay

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:19.840
thinks it tight when they came out off

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.850
there's new and new newer newer issues

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.970
of them they were using the guillotine

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.760
recently in France not like not like

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.980
they would like execute prisoners that

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.120
was the death penalty didn't they do

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.580
that like I think in the 20th century

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.950
yeah which is tight there's the last

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:37.630
guillotine was I think I would go

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:41.440
guillotine yeah the whole like the

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.510
guillotine was also a woke thing it was

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:44.680
like real it's supposed to be like kind

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.780
of an immaculate clean yeah like a

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.430
humane way to kills me yeah who knows

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:50.430
maybe lethal injection hurts like [ __ ]

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:52.570
yeah dude we're back then was like

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.850
whatever though back then yeah I mean

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:56.530
firing squad would suck yeah they were

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.330
like they did I said like just like you

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.010
know what no it's cool mouse traps

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:04.960
yes but yes so that's what I've been

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.140
doing then I popped on Carlin came on

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.429
listen to his he's got a new one against

00:20:09.429 --> 00:20:11.799
the Japanese he's still he's on the

00:20:11.799 --> 00:20:13.540
third one of that he's still going to

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:14.799
feel a little uneasy listening to

00:20:14.799 --> 00:20:18.840
anymore really but it was funny just

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.220
they were talking about he was talking

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.150
about Pearl Harbor

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:24.040
yeah and how like historically it's like

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.570
one of the dumbest [ __ ] decisions

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:28.000
ever did like military planners today

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.190
are like why would they do that well I

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:32.730
mean obviously hindsight's you know

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:35.830
but still it's funny to just double F it

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:39.010
could've been a double F no I how would

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:39.790
it be a false-flag

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:41.290
they're like we just want to attack the

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:44.500
Japanese so we hired the Japanese to

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.410
attack us I don't know no I think

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.390
someone faked it could've been a fake I

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.700
could have been actors the Japanese Navy

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:56.320
was in Pearl Harbor

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.260
yeah did you what it was two planes a

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.480
crashing for Harper's as one you can

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.790
easily fake Pearl Harbor do you think

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.130
Pearl Harbor was 9/11 I'm saying if

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:07.540
you're saying I'm just throwing it out

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.250
there if you're saying that it was

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.220
didn't make any sense no but it was more

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.860
than two points how many was it probably

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.510
like a hundred hundred planes

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:19.179
it was aircraft carriers I thought was

00:21:19.179 --> 00:21:20.770
just like two little prop planes crashed

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:24.630
never I was like what the [ __ ] oh really

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:27.220
oh we're gonna award I thought was like

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.590
two propeller planes came in that was it

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:31.900
was really yeah I swear to God knows I

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.910
mean it was a huge operate yeah they're

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:37.330
big planes they brought their Navy damn

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.059
yeah it was war the Navy pulled up and

00:21:40.059 --> 00:21:42.490
then the plane was there it was aircraft

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:44.590
carriers yeah the big ones yeah they

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.230
brought the boys out [ __ ] yeah

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.450
say like totally devastated yeah if it

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.630
was two planes it would have gone almost

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.160
unnoticed that's what I'm saying how you

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.390
wouldn't even know it would be like just

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:56.919
yeah I could be anyone flying the shitty

00:21:56.919 --> 00:21:59.770
playing into like it was the boys pulled

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:01.570
off they really went for okay which is

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.210
ended yeah it's documented gotcha now

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.100
the false flag comes in where did we

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.290
know they were gonna do it alright go

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:09.640
ahead because there is some weird [ __ ]

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.710
about us taking some ships out of that

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:12.060
Harbor

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.580
mmm-hmm some like good ships that could

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.320
have just happened to not be docked that

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.720
could have held them off that not would

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.040
have held them off but would have been

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:24.270
shitty to lose for us you know I got you

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:27.030
so we like kind of kept some old shitty

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.790
ships for them to blow up yeah and be

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.960
like oh you got us it's all so weird

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.280
like back then people didn't just like

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.160
over ste overseas like stealth fly over

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.960
there was like a massive ships coming

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.540
for probably several days and I'd

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.550
imagine the US military was scoping the

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.220
waterways and being like yo bro Japanese

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:51.210
Navy's on the way okay say what yeah

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.310
maybe they did yeah I mean there was

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.870
like radio stuff where they would be

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:56.580
like oh [ __ ] something's happening yeah

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.220
where are they gonna hit oh the closest

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.570
island to them they thought it was gonna

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:02.040
be around there right which I think they

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.750
did get hit too like Guam and [ __ ] like

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:04.260
that

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.960
but who knows regardless I thought it

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.370
was funny day like I've never heard

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:10.320
historians talk about how [ __ ] stupid

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.170
that was like because I don't know for

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:14.520
some reason you think of it as like an

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.410
even matchup the US and Japan in World

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:18.630
War two but it wasn't yeah it was like

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.360
yeah it was literally just sucker

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:29.100
punching the biggest guy in the room why

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.210
did you think you were gonna knock him

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:31.980
out yeah that makes sense

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.130
us a classic 911 burst pitch though

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:01.230

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:04.830
and then yeah sit back like they were

00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:43.090
genocide

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:46.030
I was reading the Indian wrote that

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:50.250
Winston Churchill the Washington Post

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.690
Washington Post claimed the family was

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:56.860
not a genocide how how they were saying

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.980
that it was their own food plate yeah it

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:01.540
was a blight but then they kept all the

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.190
other food yeah oh and wouldn't let

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:05.710
people hunt or fish but that it's I

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:07.270

wonder how true all that hit Clinton

00:31:49.329 --> 00:31:51.789
Foundation stuff is I mean dude Haitians

00:31:51.789 --> 00:31:53.829
comin in [ __ ] the Haitians maybe they

00:31:53.829 --> 00:31:55.449
got tricked online I don't know you

00:31:55.449 --> 00:31:57.459
think they've read about it if you were

00:31:57.459 --> 00:31:58.869
Asian you'd be pissed

00:31:58.869 --> 00:32:03.459
oh my god no they were [ __ ] that their

00:32:03.459 --> 00:32:06.119
family called them it was just like bro

00:32:06.119 --> 00:32:10.449
yeah she [ __ ] [ __ ] my kids like

00:32:10.449 --> 00:32:11.589
what should I do it like I don't know do

00:32:11.589 --> 00:32:14.349
you go [ __ ] here's her address go yell

00:32:14.349 --> 00:32:16.569
at her [ __ ] scream at her try a bunch

00:32:16.569 --> 00:32:18.039
of Jews his belt stood ready to [ __ ]

00:32:18.039 --> 00:32:22.749
slap her they probably yeah I don't what

00:32:22.749 --> 00:32:24.849
what were some of the crimes allegedly

00:32:24.849 --> 00:32:29.219
uh there was a so allegedly there was a

00:32:29.219 --> 00:32:32.469
where the place was affected by all like

00:32:32.469 --> 00:32:33.969
their earthquakes in her all that [ __ ]

00:32:33.969 --> 00:32:36.639
and hit it there was a textile mill

00:32:36.639 --> 00:32:38.739
built in the part that wasn't affected

00:32:38.739 --> 00:32:40.449
and like no one ever fixed any of this

00:32:40.449 --> 00:32:42.219
yeah yeah they just went down to build

00:32:42.219 --> 00:32:43.419
factories with the money they blow

00:32:43.419 --> 00:32:44.649
factories are the money on the parts

00:32:44.649 --> 00:32:45.789
that weren't affected and then there was

00:32:45.789 --> 00:32:47.949
people in trucks who were just pull out

00:32:47.949 --> 00:32:50.109
who just literally drive around then fly

00:32:50.109 --> 00:32:51.249
away and then like apparently they

00:32:51.249 --> 00:32:52.659
looked in the Clinton Foundation they

00:32:52.659 --> 00:32:54.699
were just billing the Clintons like we

00:32:54.699 --> 00:32:56.169
did survey and they never built anything

00:32:56.169 --> 00:32:57.819
in the places where they did probably

00:32:57.819 --> 00:32:59.109
didn't I just didn't build that much

00:32:59.109 --> 00:33:00.309
[ __ ] and for all the money it doesn't

00:33:00.309 --> 00:33:00.729
add up

00:33:00.729 --> 00:33:03.940
alleges it I thought there was dark man

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.039
and then a Clinton aide was caught

00:33:06.039 --> 00:33:09.039
smuggling children out of Haiti and then

00:33:09.039 --> 00:33:10.359
feel like what the [ __ ] are you doing

00:33:10.359 --> 00:33:11.739
and then the claims like now now she's

00:33:11.739 --> 00:33:13.769
cool she's going why do they love kids I

00:33:13.769 --> 00:33:15.879
don't know dude it's I don't think they

00:33:15.879 --> 00:33:17.469
love kids I think the conspiracy is that

00:33:17.469 --> 00:33:18.070
the

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:21.880
sir [ __ ] kids I think the elite kids

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.110
though I think that's always been a

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:25.740
peasant's mindset about the elites

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.180
nobody that's like what they used to say

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.290
about the Jew they'd be like the Jews

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:32.860
drink the blood of Christian babies you

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.420
know the aunts always been a very dumb

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:36.790
peasant mind it's the [ __ ] kids

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:38.410
although Epstein's temple didn't really

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:41.860
oh the temple Epstein the problem was

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.030
that yeah it is funny though because

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:44.830
there is a lot of folklore but Epstein

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:47.950
was in fact [ __ ] kids and there was

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:52.210
like a bunch of super music kids come 13

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:53.650
year-olds died that's pretty young

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:56.320
that's pretty young and like that's very

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.660
negligible super high profile peeps were

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:02.250
chilling with this dude there's no way

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:05.350
he was like secretly just trafficking

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:07.810
young sniz and he just had these friends

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:08.920
who weren't cool with it and he's like

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:10.330
well I'm not gonna tell them about yeah

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:11.850
yeah yeah they don't need to know about

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:16.030
kids yeah no I don't know I don't know

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:18.040
who knows I'm on a whole other wave

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.080
anyway Bros the [ __ ] nothing what's

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:24.070
the [ __ ] way that's the sickest wait

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:25.960
it's funny too because I used to make

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.400
fun of comedians for always being like

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.620
I'm [ __ ] depressed bro like I say

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.660
it's like nah bro yeah you don't you

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:32.860

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:35.020
actually are so real just grit your

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.430

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.620

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.980
gotta be a [ __ ] monster yeah you have

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:17.980
to be a monster a lot of times they use

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:20.890
the the fact that they're arguing with

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:23.140
their BAE cuz if you're if you're like

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.120

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.580
time in a relationship chances are

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:32.350
pregnancy no pregnancies like dude is

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:34.150

BAE's problems for about nine months you

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.190
could plant you could just fight her

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:41.230
constantly mm-hmm and then you yeah you

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:42.880
could use that as an excuse to the kid

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.869
yes I wish I could be here

00:37:44.869 --> 00:37:47.450

a if you're willing to leave your kid

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:59.240
you're also willing to make excuses on

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.400
other people you know it's so bad

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.009
yeah it's so bad it's a bad thing to do

00:38:04.009 --> 00:38:05.869
and then to have a bunch of people kind

00:38:05.869 --> 00:38:07.339
of defend it a little bit to be like

00:38:07.339 --> 00:38:11.089
well it's hard sometimes for people and

00:38:11.089 --> 00:38:13.130
it's just like yeah not dude it's under

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:16.490
it's in defendable unde offense but it's

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:17.720
like yeah it's [ __ ] up

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.289
you didn't defensible to be like well

00:38:20.289 --> 00:38:23.839
who says that it's the best to have both

00:38:23.839 --> 00:38:25.849
where people defending it there's people

00:38:25.849 --> 00:38:27.410
who are like we'll stop applying your

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:28.970
norms and what a family should be it's

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:30.410
like look people have to live together

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:33.289
but like abandoning your children it's

00:38:33.289 --> 00:38:36.380
[ __ ] up they're like well yeah well

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.569
that's different this is what you did

00:38:38.569 --> 00:38:41.539
it's bad it's bad news if any was even

00:38:41.539 --> 00:38:42.890
thinking of everything about getting

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:44.779
divorced dude the only acceptable way to

00:38:44.779 --> 00:38:48.230
divorce the only way to I know I didn't

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:50.539
have a kids Oh true if I had kids I

00:38:50.539 --> 00:38:51.650
would have suffered for 18 years

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:53.329
silently like a lot of the good parents

00:38:53.329 --> 00:38:53.930

the government forcing people to live

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.870

you ever get into like the new black

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.430
churches when they have like [ __ ]

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:14.080

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:16.270
like not fought the Church Fathers or

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:16.720

open a podcast studio I think it would

01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:55.630

happen oh dude

01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:39.410
okay obviously the mainstream media

01:13:39.410 --> 01:13:41.150
blocked you from seeing it it would be a

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:42.830
guy walking through tunnels the holding

01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:45.200

01:15:57.670 --> 01:15:59.079
little bit of stuff coming down but yeah

01:15:59.079 --> 01:16:01.449
it was like Bigfoot there was a ton of

01:16:01.449 --> 01:16:02.980
oh man I remember watching every I was

01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:04.570

01:16:04.570 --> 01:16:06.400
like the height of my ancient aliens

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.530
addiction and I was like [ __ ] yeah dude

01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:10.119
running someone has all the answers I

01:16:10.119 --> 01:16:11.889
did tune in and be like what's his name

01:16:11.889 --> 01:16:15.130
did that to Jesse Ventura did he really

01:16:15.130 --> 01:16:16.900
he had to show like that like where he

01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:20.320
would debunk [ __ ] he said he found like

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:23.099
a Fema camp with like he found like him

01:16:23.099 --> 01:16:24.820
basically he was trying to say he found

01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:26.110
a concentration camp he's like the

01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:28.840
government's gonna get off soon there's

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:31.059
a concentration camp that's probably

01:16:31.059 --> 01:16:32.619
what he found that was probably the camp

01:16:32.619 --> 01:16:35.409
in the woods maybe we gotta get ar-15s

01:16:35.409 --> 01:16:38.889
and walk the woods that's what you hear

01:16:38.889 --> 01:16:40.960
enough of these stories that again we

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:42.460
found the equation I wonder if first

01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:44.139
read the LAT the final equation it's

01:16:44.139 --> 01:16:46.269
just like oh I got a by an ar-15 yeah

01:16:46.269 --> 01:16:47.559
Sasquatch could be real

01:16:47.559 --> 01:16:49.690

01:17:18.789 --> 01:17:19.380
the the

01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:20.850
right wing in this country is like

crazy man it's like so you sit there and

01:45:41.250 --> 01:45:43.920
you imagine all of the internal parts of

01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:45.270
yourself that have arisen because of

01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:46.800

01:45:52.830 --> 01:45:55.350
the there's a gazillion aspects of your

01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:56.520
personality that pop up and you're

01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:58.290
supposed to like close your eyes and

01:45:58.290 --> 01:46:00.570
imagine a big dining room table and all

01:46:00.570 --> 01:46:02.280
of this and invite all the parts of

01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:03.989
yourself to this thing sir our eyes are

01:46:03.989 --> 01:46:06.239
closed it's so [ __ ] sick and then

01:46:06.239 --> 01:46:08.730
they're like like weird [ __ ] I can't

01:46:08.730 --> 01:46:11.310

01:46:11.310 --> 01:46:12.600
of you that's like afraid of things

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:14.120
there's a part of you know kind of like

01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:16.380
exactly know part of you that's like

01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:18.360
okay let's go guys let's keep staying

01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:19.920
busy guys come on with it and like you

01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:21.420

01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:23.460
these all these [ __ ] to the per cast

01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:25.110
that guy got his ass beat at the dinner

01:46:25.110 --> 01:46:26.550

01:46:28.770 --> 01:46:30.239
the [ __ ] out of him all right now that

01:46:30.239 --> 01:46:32.610
guy's gone dude we can focus on business

01:46:32.610 --> 01:46:34.199
who you were sitting there and like your

01:46:34.199 --> 01:46:35.760

01:46:37.110 --> 01:46:38.610
parts so there's all these parts of you

01:46:38.610 --> 01:46:40.860
and then there's your your true self

01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:42.600
which is supposed to be transcendent to

01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:43.860
all the parts and the idea is like the

01:46:43.860 --> 01:46:45.150

these weird like sub personalities that

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:52.230
take over and like that's like the

01:46:52.230 --> 01:46:54.630
that's what comes that's what drives

01:46:54.630 --> 01:46:56.310
people to act in these like real weird

01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:58.830

guided meditation kind of thing and the

01:48:48.630 --> 01:48:50.130
thing I went down was being a little kid

in me and constantly afraid of the dark

01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:53.010
when I was little it's like waking up in

01:48:53.010 --> 01:48:54.090
the middle a night and that's like that

01:48:54.090 --> 01:48:55.740
becomes a subpersonality of a little kid

01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:57.720
is like no no don't do this like a part

01:48:57.720 --> 01:48:59.430

01:53:50.059 --> 01:53:51.889
[ __ ] spinderella of reality around me

01:53:51.889 --> 01:53:53.719
to see that no no what I said was and

01:53:53.719 --> 01:53:55.309

01:53:55.309 --> 01:53:57.139
of like no no I hear what you're saying

01:53:57.139 --> 01:53:58.190

01:54:56.870 --> 01:55:00.050
you on every show Wow and I was like

01:55:00.050 --> 01:55:02.330

01:55:02.330 --> 01:55:04.400
totally unprovoked like I was just

01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:06.500

everywhere should she be famous right

01:55:15.020 --> 01:55:17.600

01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:19.910
maybe remaking ghostbusters again right

01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:21.770
now she could be the stuff I was like I

01:55:21.770 --> 01:55:24.770
do shows with the best comics in New

01:55:24.770 --> 01:55:26.900
York and I don't get buried every show

01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:29.600
but there's every show Cooper there's a

01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:31.610
sleeper babe in New York who no one's

01:55:31.610 --> 01:55:33.140

01:55:46.820 --> 01:55:49.699
Jay big Jay is a monster in rooms yeah

01:55:49.699 --> 01:55:51.350

then Tommy came in and was like what the

01:55:57.110 --> 01:55:58.520
