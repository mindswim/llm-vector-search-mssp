they would

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.560
like make advertisements you could rub a

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.680
cream on your body it would make you

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.240
less fat

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.400
and they said he had fat cream on he was

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.840

he would get into a hotel room and he'd

00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:10.400
get so excited why do you not demand

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.480
that the person in the room with you

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.000
doesn't sleep naked

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.839

00:43:15.839 --> 00:43:17.440
dude the way shane does it it's so

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.119
goddamn funny he got so excited and

00:43:19.119 --> 00:43:20.079
crawls

00:43:20.079 --> 00:43:23.520
underwear i kick my feet

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.720
you guys do it's hilarious

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:28.480
but when the joke's over and everyone

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.480
has died down yeah

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.119
you gotta put that that's why he got up

00:43:33.119 --> 00:43:34.319
he got up with the towel one time he

00:43:34.319 --> 00:43:35.280
didn't know his dick was showing he's

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.240
like all right i'm gonna take a shower

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.359
and he's just talking to me and i was

00:43:37.359 --> 00:43:37.760
like

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.160
dicks he literally was like your penis

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.040
is out

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:43.839
it wasn't it wasn't a funny thing it was

00:43:43.839 --> 00:43:44.240
but

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.920
there's one thing i'm always certain of

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.079
if it's the case that my dick is out

00:43:48.079 --> 00:43:50.400
yeah my dick's never just that's why

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.839
because i was holding the towel in front

00:43:51.839 --> 00:43:53.280
of me like a [ __ ] matador

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.359
because i was naked behind it i was like

00:43:55.359 --> 00:43:56.319
[ __ ] with dan

00:43:56.319 --> 00:43:57.680
but the bottom of the towel was still on

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.079
the bed so i was just holding up

00:44:00.079 --> 00:44:02.079
my lower half was just out take me back

00:44:02.079 --> 00:44:03.359
to the decision of

00:44:03.359 --> 00:44:05.440
sleeping naked the entire night next to

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.480
a buddy

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.200
we're not next yeah we're not in the

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.400
same bed

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.480
oh i'm sorry i didn't realize it's less

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.440
weird if there's

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.839
five feet between you not enough room

00:44:15.839 --> 00:44:17.359
for an adult to do a setup

00:44:17.359 --> 00:44:19.200
yeah no definitely not i probably could

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.880
have planked easily over to his bed yeah

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.400
i could have rolled over onto his bed

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.160
you don't think i plank at night

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.839
once i know old days of sleep yeah i

00:44:27.839 --> 00:44:29.440
play some [ __ ] bears i play some

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:32.079
weird games

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.240

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.920

you never jerked off a guy never did

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.480
they jerk off each other then

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:47.040
who somebody jerked off i know there's a

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.000
story of somebody

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.680
lewis and justin lewis no

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.240
they waited for me i went to the

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.040
bathroom

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:57.440
yeah and uh while i was in the bathroom

00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:58.319
taking a [ __ ]

00:44:58.319 --> 00:45:00.240
yeah which was you know it's a process

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.720
always i look at the phone i do whatever

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:06.480
be 30 40 minutes um

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:07.599
no it wasn't even anywhere near there

00:45:07.599 --> 00:45:08.960
but even if it was like 20 which is

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.119
still more as soon as i went in there

00:45:11.119 --> 00:45:13.920
they were like uh they were like hey

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.200
wouldn't it be funny when jacob's at if

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.520
we're both lying on the same bed

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.079
with our dicks out and they did that for

00:45:20.079 --> 00:45:21.680
like five minutes or so and i didn't

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.160
come out of the bathroom

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:25.839
and then they go wouldn't it actually be

00:45:25.839 --> 00:45:27.680
funnier if we it would be funny if you

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:30.079
came out we both had raging boners

00:45:30.079 --> 00:45:32.160
justin's playing justin's idea was the

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.520
mastermind at lewis from what i

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.520
from what i remember just louis told the

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:36.720
story and you know what dude he said

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.720
justin engineered the

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.440
push me hard yeah yeah he does say that

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:42.079
justin did

00:45:42.079 --> 00:45:44.160
engineer that part and then i think

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:46.079
justin was able to get a rager

00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:49.440
lewis maybe did

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.520
no maybe he did i don't know i don't

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.119
remember touch mine for strength

00:45:53.119 --> 00:45:54.480
or remember is the worst thing that

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:58.640
could happen take some of my power

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.720
if you give one pump you get a little

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.240
pump yeah it's like

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:03.850
it's like hot spot my dick

00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:05.599
[Laughter]

touch it let's just touch helmets see if

00:46:08.079 --> 00:46:09.599
it pumps you up so when you came out of

00:46:09.599 --> 00:46:11.599
the bathroom neither one of them

00:46:11.599 --> 00:46:13.440
i think one of one of them or both of

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.280
them were hard but whatever it was

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.359

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.760
have the result be for me i'm just the

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.200
wrong guy i just didn't do it

if you're looking for me to get like

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.440
upset or anything that's not gonna

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.040

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.560
they just did 20 30 minutes of gay

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.680
activity

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.440
to make a joke that didn't land hard but

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.480
they're just sitting there they're just

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.240
sitting there side kissing and you walk

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:42.079
by and then just for a little

00:46:42.079 --> 00:46:43.920
just to go like this yeah you just say

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.760

00:46:52.319 --> 00:46:54.079
sprinting like a warrior dude

00:46:54.079 --> 00:46:57.040
just jumped on that bed

00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:01.359
imagine their confusion hours later when

00:47:01.359 --> 00:47:02.960
you snuggle up naked next to them under

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.319
the covers

00:47:04.319 --> 00:47:05.359
they're gonna make you sending a lot of

00:47:05.359 --> 00:47:07.680
mismatches when you take your undies off

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:08.720
and fling them around

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.880

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.000
the person

sheets and kick his feet

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.119

he is just that's great

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:48.800
let's look yeah he's on the block what

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:49.760
do you do

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.840
mom he's an actor i don't like bragging

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.360
about my own work but

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:55.760
i've done 100 films corey is the one

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:57.920
that's trying to take over

01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:00.719
now they do a favor they do a favor here

01:19:00.719 --> 01:19:02.000
and they let it

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.640
they let inner like special stuff happen

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:06.239
in between his description

01:19:06.239 --> 01:19:07.760
but legitimately because you can see by

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:09.840
the positioning and everything of this

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.600
from the moment he goes i don't like to

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:12.880
brag about everything everything that

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.239
happens right here was

01:19:14.239 --> 01:19:17.920
fired off in a row it's crazy albums

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.920
probably about four or five tv series

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:21.600
that i've started i've done

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:24.400
probably over 100 appearances on tv he

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:25.920
just kept running at the mouth

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:27.120
you know i had like three number one

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.199
movies in a row i did a film called lost

01:19:29.199 --> 01:19:29.600
boys

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:31.600
i got fired because my mom was so

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:32.640
irresponsible

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:33.679
and if you're not going to be a good

01:19:33.679 --> 01:19:36.159
manager then just don't be my manager

01:19:36.159 --> 01:19:39.440
but my point is oh man

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:42.640
that was five minutes wasted yeah great

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:43.920
michael's just [ __ ] on him

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:45.600

at me it looks like she's mrs dalfire

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:02.640
it's aaron's dad just trying to stay in

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:04.480
his life it looks like she works an

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:06.320
early morning shift at a dollar tree

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:08.560

what are we doing hanging out because i

01:21:07.199 --> 01:21:09.440
sleep when you sleep because

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.280

fight at his final show is why do you

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:14.800
we have the longest talk about what do

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.000
we want to watch we're going to watch

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.440
what you want to watch i go that's not

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:18.960
how i mean it when i ask you what you

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.480
want to watch

01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:22.320
you can't just default to me and then

01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:24.400
yell at me if you're defaulting to me

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.719
really yeah keep going because i want to

01:21:26.719 --> 01:21:29.199
is this is this where this ends

01:21:29.199 --> 01:21:32.239
well this ends but it actually goes

01:21:32.239 --> 01:21:33.440
right into the next

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:37.120
712 commercials this is uh

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:39.120
my favorite is this is where aaron

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:41.040
carter's mom talks about her

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:42.800
philosophy on parenting and all the

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.159
other shitty parents are like

01:21:44.159 --> 01:21:46.639
what but she's like as long as you don't

01:21:46.639 --> 01:21:48.159
shoot them yeah

01:21:48.159 --> 01:21:50.320
sudden you're famous so your parents are

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:52.000
getting all the benefit of it

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.520
and then you're 13 years old and you

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.440
stop working yeah and you're like okay

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:56.320
now what do i do

01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:00.159
i have a different uh uh opinion on that

01:22:00.159 --> 01:22:02.719
i kind of look at it like okay you you

01:22:02.719 --> 01:22:03.679
got a

01:22:03.679 --> 01:22:06.239
child that wants to do this this is what

01:22:06.239 --> 01:22:07.920
they're good at this is what they like i

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:08.239
just

01:22:08.239 --> 01:22:10.719
nurture it i didn't push it but a lot of

01:22:10.719 --> 01:22:11.840
people think you do

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:13.920
but if they really really have the

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:16.080
talent you don't have to push it it's

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:18.159
probably best to nurture it in a

01:22:18.159 --> 01:22:20.159
behind-the-scenes sort of way until

01:22:20.159 --> 01:22:21.600
they're old enough to make the decision

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:22.560
on their own but

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:24.320
it's a guy who knows behind the scenes

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.000
yeah she goes like this she goes oh no

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:26.400
no

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.080
no you get their websites licensed to

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:30.719
you you own them i'm also a producer

01:22:30.719 --> 01:22:33.520
of the music i sing yeah see i like to

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:33.840
be

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:36.960
in front and behind

01:22:37.199 --> 01:22:38.639
yeah he's like corey you don't have any

01:22:38.639 --> 01:22:40.159
talent you keep pushing forward what's

01:22:40.159 --> 01:22:42.520
the point of that

01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:45.579
[Music]

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:50.320
i love it is this where it inspired him

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:51.040
to

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:53.520
work harder and do better now look at

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:55.199

01:22:55.199 --> 01:22:57.600

someone recognizes a pattern

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:53.840
and they change these yeah i don't like

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:54.880
when things are

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:58.239
wrong it's not like when they're happy

01:28:58.239 --> 01:28:59.840
they have too much jewelry they do

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:01.360
that's a problem that's a big red flag

01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:02.080
for me they were

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:06.080

01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:53.040

i did some commercials and stuff it's

01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:57.280
funny when people talk about child abuse

01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:58.000
in entertainment

01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.520
dogs it does still scent because there's

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:02.159
some kids who their dad's a [ __ ] pipe

01:32:02.159 --> 01:32:03.440
fitter and come home and

01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:05.440
ties them to a [ __ ] post and beats

01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:06.880
the [ __ ] out of them for fun and

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:08.880
yeah it's like a real torture situation

01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:10.400
here goes we would get

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:13.440
hit if we didn't learn our lines

01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:15.040
something about it being in the context

01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:16.880
of acting you're like

01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:19.679
were they beating you

01:32:20.239 --> 01:32:23.040
okay so then this is that part of it and

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:24.159
then right after that

01:32:24.159 --> 01:32:27.440
is the um cory making it it's great okay

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:28.960

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.480
himself oh man

01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:34.000

sand

01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:03.280
a lot of people don't know this but in

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:06.000

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.639
number two

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:11.840
both can relate to that um corey

01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:13.520
definitely more so

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:16.800
but you know when i was young i i was

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:18.719

01:34:18.719 --> 01:34:20.320
number of commercials and i brought in

hundreds of thousands of dollars

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:26.080
and i saw none of it

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:28.800
well you know there is some element of

01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:29.679
that

01:34:29.679 --> 01:34:31.360
that i always sold none of it goes well

just crying immediately

01:34:42.639 --> 01:34:43.760
