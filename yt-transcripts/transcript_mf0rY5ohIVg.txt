00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.070

any comic that puts on a costume to be

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.920
funny stinks okay just go out and be who

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.159

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:30.250
know I could never as a new comic open

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.490
like a walk-in and tell a headliner to

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.920
shut the [ __ ] up especially when I was

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.330
in the wrong yeah and he was 100% wrong

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.040
doing what he did when I said don't do

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.830
this yeah you know when we were on stage

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.880
and let me let me go over this one more

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.930
time I know I'm not gonna say his name

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:56.950
but if you ever see a new comic I guess

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.890
in the Philly area that puts on an

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:04.150
outfit he stinks in my opinon that's my

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.790
opinion so you can't show me cuz it's my

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:10.000
opinion but he stinks in my opinion all

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.210
right yes and if he's a crazy man

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.030
well tough all right learn how to

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.430
respect people that came before you that

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.220
[ __ ] made it possible for you to

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.170
[ __ ] do what you're trying to do I

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.590
respect every every [ __ ] comic that

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.170
that was doing it 20 years or 10 years

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.260
before me are you kidding me you know

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.800
the [ __ ] have no respect whatsoever and

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.450
yeah that's where I looked like the

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.580
ultimate [ __ ] dick Rider is when he

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.960
walks back there and I was like you

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.320
don't talk to him that way

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.420
no you know I would have said that

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:51.640
listen new disguise new comics really

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.430
think the [ __ ] the world owes him

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.140
something and they're [ __ ] they think

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.970
they're great because they get followers

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.330
on Twitter on Facebook you're not

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.089
[ __ ] great he likely it takes 10

00:11:04.089 --> 00:11:07.220
years to be good okay to be

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.430

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.959
you're barely listenable okay

00:11:13.959 --> 00:11:16.699
your [ __ ] your makeup is running

don't want to [ __ ] talk [ __ ] on that

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:31.210
comic because obviously you know we're

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:32.860

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.750
you know bosses doing us a favor

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:48.760
yeah and just dropping in and doing a

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.590
shitty show that he doesn't need to do

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.330

Scouts Boy Scouts are gay they've always

00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:52.470

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:54.269
daughter that wants to be a boy and

00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:57.710
she's nine yeah you can you can do

00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:59.240
that should be a good test though so if

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.910
it's like you have a daughter she is

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:03.920

[ __ ] again what you got to give a kid

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.250
time before they decide if they're trans

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.200
yeah I would say let them maybe hit

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.910
puberty yeah let's see what happens when

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:24.710
all of a sudden you start craving dick

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:27.020
yeah unless you just want to be a gay

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.880
boy yeah you're a woman who wants to be

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.890
a gay boy which i think happens quite a

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:32.930
bit I would say you well I think like

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:34.430

right before right after we turn this

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:29.170
off Matt explained a theory that I think

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:30.400
needs to be documented

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.890
when he finally fingers a kid go ahead

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:35.800
Matt no this this is this is why I

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.240
brought this whole thing up so I don't

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:40.060
get [ __ ] jared fogle whatever his name

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.670
is the reason I brought that up might

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:44.020
the whole theory that ties it all

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:46.270
together is that like you remember when

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:47.260
you're younger and you're having sex

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:49.810
it's why you bust your nut so fast when

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:51.880
you're little it's like you only last a

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:52.900
minute it's not because you're

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:54.040
inexperienced because you're [ __ ] a

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.690
hot kid you just don't know it yet

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.960
so take that home America take that home

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.480
America so this I don't know we have

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.010
some devout listeners that remember this

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:06.070
last week we discussed that all day in

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:09.030
Matt's head is just three Juggalos

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:12.400
smoking and arguing but and that's where

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.980
he comes up with these [ __ ] theories

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:17.230
this is just a [ __ ] textbook example

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:21.280
of a [ __ ] Juggalo smoking a [ __ ]

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.560
ball at his dad's apartment and this is

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:26.290

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:28.360

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.890

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.140
feeling like flash in front of the

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:43.670
chapel

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:47.170
