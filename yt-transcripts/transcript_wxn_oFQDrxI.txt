from a book he just came out with right

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.000
overload that was a couple years ago but

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.640
yeah

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.640
relatively wrong yeah relatively right

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.400
and are you working on anything else as

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.160
far as authorship uh yeah i did a i

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.280
wrote like a

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.280
i think it was like an 80 90 page book

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.520
that i i do another thing roma's which

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.040
is with my friend wes and it's kind of

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.640
like a self-development kind of thing so

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.559
i wrote like an 80 page book that's

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:43.920
going to be on we're going to build like

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.440
a little romance university thing so

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.079
that's on there in audio form but the

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.680
right now i'm just i'm writing i have a

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.520
novel another novel i started and i'm

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.120
taking a break from that to write two

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.879
short stories that like you know

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.559
shortish but they'll probably i'm going

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.239
to write two short stories that are each

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.320
about probably 50 to 60 pages so it'll

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.640
be like a kind of two stories but like a

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.920
novel length

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.519
excellent yeah i'm looking forward to

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.439
that man you're such a

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.840
deep guy i think you know your comedy

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.439
podcast doesn't

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.320
always show that kind of depth where did

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.240
this journey begin for you you're

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.080
obviously a very hilarious person you

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.040
and shane touch on so many topics that

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.520
most comedians are too afraid to even

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.600
think about you know you know where did

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.680
this begin for you were you naturally

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.439
inquisitive child were you always

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.119
questioning the narrative like in the

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.439
mainstream or how did this start i don't

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.720
know i don't think i really cared about

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.799
anything like that for a very long time

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.479
i remember watching

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.159
this you know it's funny even thinking

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.240
about this but i remember

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.000
like like i never watched i never had

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.600
any interest honestly in the news or

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.200
like politics it always seemed kind of

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.439
like alien to me the whole process of it

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.560
but i remember being like 20

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.439
21 22 i was at my brother's house and

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.280
like you know i just i was like at the

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.439
time i was smoking like tons of weed

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.640
constantly

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.920
and i also was just kind of like

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.119
chilling i didn't really have much of a

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.719
job because i was just like selling weed

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:05.840
and stuff at the time so i had like a

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.000
weird 20s where i kind of had all my

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.440
time like i didn't have to go sit in a

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.360
cubicle i didn't have that experience of

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.840
kind of like i guess being socialized

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.680
professionally which was something you

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.040
know i don't know if you ever talk to

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.120
people who like from young you know from

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.440
like 18 to like 40 have worked in an

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.959
office but it's a you know it like

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.319
really changes your mannerisms it

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.760
changes the way you speak and talk to

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.920
people and it for sure changes what you

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.840
do and don't talk about even i mean it

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.160
was almost like an absurd degree of like

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.519
people would talk about someone being

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.360
drunk and even that has to be euphemized

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.680
like no he had a couple huh you know you

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.120
can't smell like he's [ __ ] hammerhead

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.360
it's like oh yeah it's a little tipsy

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.640
you know so i don't know that was

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.239
something that always freaked me out but

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.080
i remember i'm sitting on my

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.920
my brother's couch and i'm like you know

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.560
the the tv comes on and it's the news

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.239
and i'm like watching the news and i'm

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.879
just super stoned i remember watching it

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.239
and being like

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.080
this is like the homeroom show from high

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.599
school i remember like it just see it

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.840
struck me as like that ridiculous and

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.840
the fact that it was like just just some

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.519
dude like being like in this thing and

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.280
it like just it seems like overly

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.440
contrived and produced and like

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.200
ever since that one experience i always

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.959
just like look at it with that same kind

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.879
of like yeah and i've all i've been

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.480
inside of a new studio before then when

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.800
you go inside of one you're like oh this

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.480
is like just weird cardboard cutouts and

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.159
you guys are you know not all of them

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.680
who do it but the guys i met were kind

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.799
of like

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.400
they kind of seemed like really dickish

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.840
and like you know and i saw they had two

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.280
modes too like i talked to them and the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.360
cameras would come on and it's like boom

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.799
different person and it was just kind of

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.120
the whole thing seemed strange to me

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.599
yeah the the plasticity

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.239
almost fakeness of it is very obvious i

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.360
think

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.519
the mainstream media in particular you

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.280
know we could talk all day about that

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.879
people can go and listen to matt and

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.959
shane's secret podcast i've listened to

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.879
pretty much every episode i've noticed

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.560
over time

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.120
you're becoming more spiritual would you

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.720
say this is true matt i feel like

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.799
there's a certain amount of spiritual

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.120
growth that you've been putting your

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.959
mind towards right like it's this is

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.799
something that you're actively seeking

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.000
out right

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.480
big time no big time the last thing if i

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.080
even get into that the funny thing about

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.599
the news is like yeah you realize it's

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:12.640
like

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.080
these guys aren't just like coming up

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.000
with these thoughts this is a scripted

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.759
program that's the genderized like

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.120
they're writing it they can't just like

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.239
the guy can't just pick well wait a

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.840
second it's like you can't deviate from

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.360
the script or you know you'll get fired

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.560
so people should always think about that

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.759
but yeah with the

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:27.280
this spiritual stuff it was funny i

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.680
never really had a

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.360
you know i didn't really care for it i i

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.120
grew up going to like catholic church

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.720
hated it and i was like this is boring

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.560
it sucks it's like restrictive and it's

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.560
you know very dogmatic and i just i

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.960
didn't like it at all so it kind of like

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.560
gave me a really it put a really bad

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.240
taste in my mouth for like any kind of

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.240
thing uh like that

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.520
but i was also in the position where

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.440
like i wasn't really i don't like hate

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.880
science i think it brought a lot of cool

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.639
stuff but i i'm also i wasn't really

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.160
interested in that very much you know

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.280
you know studying psychology and that

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.720
was the thing that originally turned me

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.520
off

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.520
to doing it was like so i thought i was

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.639
like yeah i can't wait to just like talk

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.000
to people and do all that stuff and like

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
no you got to like construct studies and

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.199
you have to like you know learn all the

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.639
statistics i'm like i don't want to do

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.039
all that so the the spirituality stuff

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.520
came weirdly from doing the psych null

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.120
podcasts which was like you know me just

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.080
like

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.199
reading different just kind of

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.639
researching different psychological

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.000
modalities and kind of breaking them

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.440
down and re-explaining them in a way

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.919
that i would think would be like easy to

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.520
understand and kind of stripping away

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.880
all the scientific as much of the

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.639
scientific jargon as i could you know

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.160
like finding out what actually works for

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.600
me what doesn't kind of giving a more

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.600
personalized account rather than like

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.960
you know in science what's known as

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.720
maintaining the objective view human

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.240
beings have like tricked themselves into

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.320
thinking they can be utterly objective

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.639
which is funny but the yeah so it came

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.080
out of when i was doing the when we were

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.600
talking about the act stuff acceptance

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.520
and commitment therapy and i'm like

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.800
researching and all this stuff and this

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.240
came from like like i would like try to

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.759
read about buddhism and it would just

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.520
like to me it would just come off as

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.600
these weird paradoxical riddles then i'd

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.120
be like all right enough this you know i

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.880
did never got anything out of it so i

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.560
did the acceptance of commitment therapy

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.560
one and that kind of really

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.520
almost manualized this approach to like

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.960
and i think one of the most important

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.199
things so imagine sorry it manualized

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.639
the approach to

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.319
gaining what's called psychological

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:11.520
flexibility

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.919
and psychological flexibility is

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.080
in a nutshell it's just the ability to

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.160
realize that you are thinking and you

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.720
are not like your thoughts aren't like

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.240
the god-given truth they're just

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.840
something floating through your mind and

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.440
especially about like self self

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.880
judgments and you know how you perceive

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.080
yourself and how you

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.600
what you how you perceive like what

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.759
others are doing like there that's just

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:33.600
a thought you know and it's being able

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.919
to kind of distance yourself from like

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:37.840
to recognize that you were thinking so

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.919
to recognize your thought as a process

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:41.600
rather than a content so it's sitting

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.759
there you go i'm a [ __ ] loser you can

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:45.199
either take that as a thought that

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:46.880
occurred to you like i'm thinking that

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.960
i'm a loser or you can say no i'm a

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.039
loser like i'm right i'm correct so yeah

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:52.479
so this and it's going to be a long

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:54.319
explanation but this is kind of the

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:56.639
the kind of path i meandered down so i i

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:57.840
started doing the psychological

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.440
flexibility stuff

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.720
and

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.720
you know so you like you start part of

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.560
it there's like six processes there's

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.319
like uh

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:08.240
there's presence there's acceptance is

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.680
one of them like accepting you know

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.360
yourself your situation as much as

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.360
possible there's working on being

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.039
present which is just like being kind of

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:16.560
where you are rather than mentally

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.000
appraising everything around yourself

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.319
all the time there's cognitive what is

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:21.919
it called cognitive diffusion which is

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:23.440
really just mindfulness of like you know

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.720
understanding that you're thinking and

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.319
you're not your thoughts

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:28.319
what else there's values like

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:29.680
cultivating what's actually important to

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.960
you and then committed action the whole

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.720
point is that you're supposed to like

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.240
have thoughts have feelings have

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.160
memories pop up inside of yourself and

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.759
rather than just kind of like

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:39.360
giving in to them and letting like you

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.560
know like at the fear of like oh

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.840
everyone's gonna think i'm a loser at

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.680
this party therefore i'm gonna like get

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.360
hammered and do all this stuff you're

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.960
rather than trying to avoid discomfort

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.440
you're then serving your values instead

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.879
does that make sense

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:53.199
absolutely yeah i think i think it's

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:56.319
important to step outside of the process

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:57.919
of thought because

00:07:57.919 --> 00:07:59.680
you're so quick to

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.160
get dragged downstream by this river of

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.919
emotions and thoughts that it really

00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:06.800
takes like the ability to swim and look

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.800
and see where the current is heading

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.360
before you get dragged away with it yeah

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.919
that's that's that's exactly it but this

00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:16.000
is the thing it's like if before you

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
come before you become conscious of the

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.440
fact that your thoughts are just

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.879
thoughts your feeling states are just

00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:22.960
feeling states and that they have a

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.360
uh fleeting and impermanent basis

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.639
meaning like if you say you feel anxious

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:30.160
if you just like let your but if you

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.399
accept the fact that you feel anxious

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:34.399
it'll just kind of pass naturally if you

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:36.800
start going i'm anxious why am i anxious

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.240
i don't want to feel this way you're

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.760
just making it worse it's like one of

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.080
those self-feedback loops um then people

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.240
start doing like well you know i i felt

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.440
anxious at the mall so i'm just not

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.560
going to the mall anymore and you know

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.480
you start kind of cutting yourself off

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.000
from all these things until you kind of

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.040
end up in this kind of like

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.800
self-constructed hamster cage of like

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.200
you seeking a constant comfort which is

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.560
you just kind of all you're doing is

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.920
thinking of threats constantly which is

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.920
you know kind of activating your nervous

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.600
system this is reporting like rather

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.880
than spending your life trying to

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.000
constantly

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.959
avoid perceived discomforts

00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:09.279
of just figuring out what's important to

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:11.120
you acknowledging that they're always

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.800
being pain and discomforts and then just

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.240
pursuing what's important to you and

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.240
over time those discomforts start to

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.920
kind of melt away that's not the goal

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.120
you're like you're not saying like i

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.399
don't ever want to be uncomfortable

00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:22.560
again you're saying look i'm going to be

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.839
uncomfortable i'm going to be anxious

00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:25.680
i'm going to feel self-critical i'm

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.600
going to suffer the judgments of others

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.040
that's going to happen to me no matter

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.959
what so let me just kind of move in the

00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:33.120
path that like i feel like is calling me

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.640
if i had to just kind of wipe my sleigh

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.920
clean and say like what would you do if

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.040
all that stuff was gone it's like well i

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.360
would do x y and z it's like go do x y

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.200
and z and then when the stuff pops up

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.320
that's where the mindfulness and all

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.399
that other stuff comes up to be like all

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:46.080
right i feel wildly uncomfortable my

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.760
heart's leaping out of my chest

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.360
but here's the thing i want to do so i'm

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.880
at least going to try to do that you

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.000
know and then that stuff starts to

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.839
subside so that and then you know you

00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:55.920
you you do all that and it's like

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.279
oh a lot of the stuff just comes from

00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:58.959
like you know buddhist practices and all

00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:00.800
this other all these other things so i

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.480
did the acceptance of commitment therapy

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.160
one that was like i was just hitting i

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.600
was just like being hit with skills that

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.880
i was like dude

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.399
what the [ __ ] why don't they teach us in

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:10.160
school this is super helpful and you

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.519
know so then at the time i knew there

00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:13.200
was a connection with buddhism so i

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.200
start kind of trying to read about that

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.640
and all this other stuff and then there

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.040
was a the book that really kind of i

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.480
think put it in

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.079
the perspective that kind of started

00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:23.920
pushing it more from me being

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.000
psychological concepts for mental health

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.920
and blah blah blah and mental well-being

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.279
there's that's one that's a scientific

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:30.880
paradigm of happening honestly i think

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.720
psychology is like uh

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.959
science's attempt at spirituality if

00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:36.160
that makes sense

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.519
it's like it hits on all the principles

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:39.200
but it kind of bleaches them with yeah

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.040
it's just for this you know materialist

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.320
plane and we're going to make you happy

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.519
here because there's nothing else and

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:45.279
you know but then i started i read this

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:46.640
other book the

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.720
untethered soul it's like journey beyond

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.920
the cell i forget what it's called but

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.360
it's called the untethered soul and you

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.440
know colon some other words so then i

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.839
read that book and it took it took all

00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:57.200
the stuff and acceptance and commitment

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.440
therapy but put it in a more like i

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.040
don't know what the word would be like

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.880
not folksy but it put it more in like a

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.040
spiritual intuitive sense and kind of

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.000
stripped it you didn't need all the

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.200
science all the studies you know you're

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.399
constantly when you're doing the science

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:09.519
stuff and there's been thousands of

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:10.480
studies and the studies have been

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.320
replicated and they're still here and

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.519
this was like

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:14.640
approach that stuff from what

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.480
intuitively feels right and it broke

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.399
down the same exact ideas in a way that

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:19.839
i was like oh my god this is so much

00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:21.760
more digestible

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.440
in the one part of the book they have a

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.000
whole segment of how you're not

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.920
how do you put this like that whole like

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.120
are you familiar with the whole inner

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.360
witness kind of thing of mindfulness

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.200
like you're not like asked this was like

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.959
i think from rahman and maharshi it's

00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:36.480
the whole question like who am i you

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.800
know it's like well i'm in the they go

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.720
through it step by step they're like i'm

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.560
my name you know i'm i'm matt mccusker

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.760
and then you know someone writes your

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.120
name on a piece of paper and says is

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.959
this you and you're like well no that's

00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:48.079
not me that's my name on a piece of

00:11:48.079 --> 00:11:49.440
paper and it's like i'm in like all

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.880
right so then it goes through step by

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.839
step it's like well i am you know the

00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:55.279
thing that's oh

00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:57.040
i'm matt mccusker here's my story here's

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.639
everything that's ever happened to me

00:11:58.639 --> 00:11:59.839
and they're like all right that's the

00:11:59.839 --> 00:12:01.440
there are the things that happen to you

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.959
but that's not you and you say all right

00:12:02.959 --> 00:12:04.880
all right well i'm this i'm a body i'm a

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.040
physical body and it's like well

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.519
like you're that's you know were you you

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:10.639
when you were six because that was a

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:11.920
different physical body than you have

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.279
currently and like you know who was the

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:14.560
you that was looking in the mirror at

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.320
six years old does that person still

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.200
look in the mirror and it goes through

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.399
all these things

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:20.880
and eventually strips everything away

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.120
to where you are just a

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.399
conscious awareness

00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:26.000
and all this other stuff accumulates

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.519
around your conscious awareness you know

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:28.880
and it's like that was one of the

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.320
moments all the mindfulness all the

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.040
meditation stuff i was like oh that's

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.639
the point of meditation to kind of get

00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:36.160
into that state where there's things

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.000
happening you're nervous you're afraid

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.519
you're bugging out you've ate an edible

00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:41.279
and you're bugging out you can either be

00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:43.680
like oh my god i'm dying or be watching

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.519
it witnessing the fact

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:47.200
that you know this entity that you're in

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.480
which you know obviously that's i guess

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.760
this is where like your family starts

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.360
being like what the [ __ ] you're just

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.200
witnessing this experience you're going

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.279
oh and then when you when you take this

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:57.519
more like larger transcendental witness

00:12:57.519 --> 00:12:59.519
mode to your experience rather than

00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:01.519
being caught up in the swirl of it

00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:03.680
it alleviates a ton of the anxiety and

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.959
that's where it clicked for me i'm like

00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:06.720
oh this stuff has like a

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.639
a ton of like when you go back to the

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:10.639
science mode it has a ton of clinical

00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:12.880
benefit and to like be able to believe

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.320
all this stuff and the more you believe

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.160
it the more powerful it becomes

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.279
and

00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:18.720
at the time i was also doing these

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.880
things that uh i mean it's just cannabis

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.399
meditation i was calling them deep dives

00:13:22.399 --> 00:13:24.399
right eat like a moderate to high dose

00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:25.920
edible for me personally i guess i

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.360
should say enough that would make me

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.880
anxious that would make me kind of be on

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.560
the verge of a panic attack

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.240
and i and i also i used to suffer from

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.839
anxiety like wickedly and i would force

00:13:33.839 --> 00:13:35.440
myself into the state but i would put on

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.040
some meditation music and just lay there

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.959
and meditate through it and i was having

00:13:38.959 --> 00:13:40.800
these kind of like profoundly religious

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.160
experiences and i wasn't even really

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.279
looking for that but it was it was

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:44.880
happening and then i started using that

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.800
kind of religious thinking and kind of

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.800
belief and you know a larger you know

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.959
like say like a governing like god

00:13:50.959 --> 00:13:52.480
basically a governing force over the

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.240
universe and then going into those

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.000
experiences i'd normally be anxious and

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.440
but equipped with that like belief and

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.040
that i'm okay and taken care of in that

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.199
capacity and dude it was like just

00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:03.199
shredding anxiety and like it was just

00:14:03.199 --> 00:14:04.399
like you know it was pr that was a

00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:05.920
pretty cool experience so you know i

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.600
know i just said a lot but that was kind

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.079
of that i will say that

00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:13.120
that resonates with me so much because

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.920
growing up in connecticut catholic of

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.639
upraising i experience a very similar

00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:21.199
thing like this disassociation with the

00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:24.320
real like if this is what's real this

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.279
pony show this old man in the silly robe

00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:28.560
going

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.199
you know like this is not you know you

00:14:31.199 --> 00:14:33.839
know religion it just didn't feel right

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:36.160
and then i smoked cannabis and i went

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.560
deeper and deeper and what blossomed out

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.160
of that experience like you're

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.600
describing was

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.880
for me very personally an intuition an

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.000
intuitive sense to look for something

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.160
other because at that time i was like an

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.880
atheist i wanted to be a ufc fighter you

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.880
know like i was into like this really

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.760
kind of

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.000
war-like mindset you know i'm six eight

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.079
i was the captain of my wrestling team

00:15:00.079 --> 00:15:02.000
so i almost could have been a ufc

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.760
fighter not that strong i'm pretty

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.199
[ __ ] skinny i might have been like

00:15:05.199 --> 00:15:06.880
the 16

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.639
yeah six eight

00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:10.720
you're wrestling people yeah yeah

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.440
headlocks and i would do the the cradle

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.880
that was my move get someone in the

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.959
cradle and flip them back

00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:18.399
well your arms are the size of their

00:15:18.399 --> 00:15:21.519
legs so yeah

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.079
this this dude rob waller from

00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:26.320
pennsylvania first probably the first

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.079
person i ever met from like rural

00:15:28.079 --> 00:15:30.160
pennsylvania he comes up to me and he

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.079
goes this is at a wrestling camp and

00:15:32.079 --> 00:15:34.160
these guys these are big tough wrestling

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.320
boys you know and rob waller looks at me

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.959
goes i'm gonna call you high pockets and

00:15:38.959 --> 00:15:41.440
i'm like hot pockets what the hell's hot

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.680
pockets he's like high pockets cause

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.079
your pockets are off the ground so high

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:48.320
and i'm like what the hell

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.399
but yeah that's you know wrestling and

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:52.639
being six eight they don't quite go

00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:55.279
together i was always kind of an anomaly

00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:58.560
a little bit of a black sheep but but my

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.199
point is cannabis really blended with

00:16:01.199 --> 00:16:02.560
martial arts because i was really

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.560
apprehensive to smokepot because i was

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.720
like no i'm a wrestler i gotta be good

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.560
for my team and all this but then i saw

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.639
eddie bravo you know taking a bong hit

00:16:10.639 --> 00:16:13.360
doing the twister i find out bruce lee

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.079
is is eating cannabis in his training

00:16:16.079 --> 00:16:18.399
sessions and i'm like wow like there's

00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:20.880
so much more to this plant i interviewed

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.279
chris bennett who's written five or six

00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:26.160
books on cannabis he studied the history

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.560
of cannabis has gone back so far i mean

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.240
i'm not sure how familiar you are with

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.680
this but they found cannabis resin on an

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.639
altar in jerusalem going back to the

00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:39.120
biblical times and something that chris

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.199
bennett has done is he's reinterpreted

00:16:41.199 --> 00:16:44.720
some of the biblical parallels and and

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.199
different phrases in the bible to reveal

00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:48.880
that they might very well have been

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.880
using cannabis as this kind of scionic

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.959
oil that they described that was

00:16:54.959 --> 00:16:57.279
supposedly healing those with epilepsy

00:16:57.279 --> 00:16:59.440
we know cannabis helps people with

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.839
epilepsy i mean this is the kind of

00:17:01.839 --> 00:17:04.160
thing that would have given jesus the

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.799
power to heal the sick from possession

00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:09.120
right it's this ability to to give

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.640
someone an oil that they didn't

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.039
understand it and and heal them but i

00:17:13.039 --> 00:17:15.919
mean knowing what you know now maybe you

00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:18.240
didn't know that until now but how do

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.079
you feel about like this spiritual

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.280
journey because i know you're taking

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.959
mushrooms you're smoking pot you're

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:25.199
obviously taking cannabis in a very

00:17:25.199 --> 00:17:28.640
motivated and an intentional way right i

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.480
think a lot of people just smoke pot

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.280
like

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.840
fun but like when you take that step to

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.120
put an intention in anything you do

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.679
it has power so when you multiply that

00:17:39.679 --> 00:17:42.080
with this sacred plant that's

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.559
literally built for our endocannabinoid

00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:47.200
system i mean is this i mean maybe i'm

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.360
going off on my soapbox here but is this

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.840
something you know man i mean dude that

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.840
it's like because i started smoking weed

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.520
when i was very young and i guess you

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.799
know 14 so which i guess is young but

00:17:58.799 --> 00:18:00.240
i remember doing it i loved it it was

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.440
awesome and then it like you know i just

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.880
started i started smoking i started

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.160
selling it all this [ __ ] and i was just

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.559
like like weed was like literally was my

00:18:06.559 --> 00:18:08.799
life for a very long time like it was

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:10.240
all i thought about it was all i was

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.240
around so i have like a really i have a

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.600
weird relationship i'm not weird but i

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.880
have a very you know like i have a

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.160
different relationship with it than i

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.520
think a lot of people do but i'm saying

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.720
that it gets better it's superior it's

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.400
just i just you know i've been around it

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.720
for a long time and you know

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.320
so

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.600
i started like you know and i started

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.360
getting like i would smoke it i would do

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.200
it and like i started like just getting

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.120
anxiety all the time from it i'd have

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.640
like you know a two-pole thing where

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.080
like sometimes it'd be like exactly what

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.440
i was looking for other times it would

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.360
just like freak me out and make me feel

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.039
like everything was wrong and bad and

00:18:39.039 --> 00:18:41.280
blah blah blah and there was something

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.400
funny again this is where like the kind

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.799
of more like intuitive

00:18:44.799 --> 00:18:47.520
spiritual mode kind of comes into being

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.960
but there would be like something i

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.480
would i would you know i would do it i'd

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.480
eat an edible i'd smoke it and i'd feel

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.840
kind of wrong and there'd be something

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.039
telling me like dude this would be

00:18:55.039 --> 00:18:57.520
awesome if you did this like if you

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.960
could schedule it like get out of

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.760
impulsively using it and schedule it and

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.039
then just like do it and then just

00:19:03.039 --> 00:19:05.120
meditate and then i had no it's just you

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.160
know it's the thought that occurred to

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.080
me and it just seemed like that would be

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.120
awesome and i'm like i don't know if i

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.480
could do that though

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.919
you know and it's still to this day it's

00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:13.840
like a challenge of like kind of like

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:14.960
separating and again i don't think

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.160
there's anything wrong with like smoking

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.000
weed going to the movies having like by

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.919
all means it's awesome go do that but it

00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:21.679
wasn't until i incorporated that into

00:19:21.679 --> 00:19:23.679
like a meditation practice that i became

00:19:23.679 --> 00:19:24.480
like

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.960
oh like this isn't just like you know

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.960
cheech and chong fun time let's smoke

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.039
weed and watch pokemon like this is

00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:32.240
really powerful if you like you were

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.000
saying if you use it with intention and

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.200
with the right you know in the right

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.200
context and specifically with intention

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.480
like like there's problems as you get

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.760
older you start being confronted with

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.840
problems that seem impossible you start

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.600
saying i don't i genuinely i just i

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.200
don't have the capacity to figure this

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.440
out i like deep relationship issues and

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.640
that's when i started being like all

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.720
right i'm at my personal wits end i

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.000
don't know what's going on i don't know

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.440
what's what i hear there's a voice in me

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.799
i can list all the things wrong with the

00:19:54.799 --> 00:19:57.120
other person and i can do that forever

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.480
but it's like let me try to take like an

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.679
honest inventory and you set the

00:19:59.679 --> 00:20:01.760
intention you know you ingest it however

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.120
you want to forever you know whatever

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.799
intensity or whatever whatever you want

00:20:04.799 --> 00:20:06.240
and then you just meditate and it was

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.600
like i noticed when i did that and it

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.120
would just bring up like it would point

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.720
me to little things that i was doing

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.840
kind of again i just you know just like

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.039
lowers your defenses a little bit and

00:20:13.039 --> 00:20:14.159
you go

00:20:14.159 --> 00:20:15.679
yeah i'm okay that's where i'm being a

00:20:15.679 --> 00:20:16.720
little weird you know and again it's

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.080
like it's not like a because i just did

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.360
the five grams of mushrooms that's like

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.600
an ego wipeout it's just you know not

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.600
doesn't last forever but it like it just

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.520
pulls the curtain aside you go oh my god

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.360
that's what i'm up to you're like yeah

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.640
and then you know eventually it starts

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.320
obviously it rebuilds itself but i think

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.640
cannabis is good because it's like

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.360
you can do these like meditations on it

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.440
dude by like three hours later you're

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.880
ready to roll like you know not even

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.480
like you could roll dooring it really

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.360
but like

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.679
as soon as it subsides you're good like

00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:45.039
you can go off you can go do whatever

00:20:45.039 --> 00:20:46.080
you want like you're not like i was

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.679
spaced out for like three [ __ ] days

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:49.120
after i did the five grams of mushrooms

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.600
but um not even in a bad way so yeah

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.600
it's like again it's just there's a

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.360
whole thing surrounding this kind of

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.520
discussion where people start going oh

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.120
yeah

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.400
and it's like you know whatever that's

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.880
that's fine and that's fun but like for

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.360
me personally if i'm being honest it's

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.480
it like

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.840
approaching cannabis with like kind of

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.400
like a more mindful intention has been

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.840
something that i would say like

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.440
transformed my life

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.960
for the better and just kind of you know

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.400
it didn't do it all at once but it kind

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.120
of

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.799
just reorients your path and kind of

00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:20.640
like hey try this and then try this and

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.080
try this and it kind of takes you away

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.080
from the whole like you know

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.159
mindlessly appeasing your own ego which

00:21:26.159 --> 00:21:28.000
you know again it's never enough you

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.679
like and i've experienced this of being

00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:31.679
like oh it'll be cool if i had that and

00:21:31.679 --> 00:21:33.919
then you get that you go hmm

00:21:33.919 --> 00:21:35.600
no my life kind of still sucks if i had

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.799
that and then i've hit a point where

00:21:36.799 --> 00:21:38.000
you're like you know what man i think

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
i'm just like deeply deeply frustrated

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.919
and it like i have to become okay with

00:21:41.919 --> 00:21:43.280
myself and that's a whole other thing

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.480
but you know

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.640
so yeah so that was kind of that's the

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.280
like you were saying that's the tangible

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.960
aspect of spirituality and that's what i

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.559
think these plants do it's like you know

00:21:52.559 --> 00:21:53.840
you could i could show up to church with

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.480
my parents and sit there and i equate it

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.400
to like like you know like a roman

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.120
catholic church versus like having a uh

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.280
mystical experience with a plant or you

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.559
know with other people or meditation

00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:05.600
chanting whatever you got to do because

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.760
there's other options to do it i feel

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.039
like it's like the difference between

00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:11.039
owning stock and pepsi versus drinking

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:13.679
pepsi so it's like it's like sure you

00:22:13.679 --> 00:22:14.880
know you can you can approach it in this

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.039
weird kind of hedging your best way or

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:19.280
you can like experience that kind of

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.640
religious ecstasy that people have been

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.480
doing for thousands of years

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.320
but it's like we're so blocked from it

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.840
it's weird it's psychotic it's

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.000
delusional it's this and that and then

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.320
you do it and you go this actually works

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.000
i mean science even shows that having

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
some form of religious practice extends

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
your lifespan has like real benefits

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.200
it's like well it's not real it's like

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.799
well the benefits are real

00:22:38.799 --> 00:22:39.840
so

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.880
you know until your point i i think

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.520
we're starting to you know maybe i'm

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.840
very self-absorbed in this podcast

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.360
community where people are thinking

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.159
thoughts like this often but it feels

00:22:52.159 --> 00:22:53.679
really like

00:22:53.679 --> 00:22:56.400
we're experiencing a shift towards

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.799
people being more aware of the

00:22:58.799 --> 00:23:01.360
subtleties of conscious i mean something

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.400
you touched on uh previously was like

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.400
the difference between

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.039
objective reality and subjective

00:23:09.039 --> 00:23:10.960
experience and i think

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.600
where of religion and spirituality kind

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.240
of differ from me is like religion wants

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.919
you to get on board with this

00:23:17.919 --> 00:23:20.559
predetermined objective reality whereas

00:23:20.559 --> 00:23:24.159
real spirituality always tells you to go

00:23:24.159 --> 00:23:27.280
inward into your subjective experience

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.320
to find the answers in internally is

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.000
where you find those answers not

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.320
externally right because when we pray

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.880
and when we meditate we're going inward

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.120
we're we're touching on this connection

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.200
and you know this is maybe just my own

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.000
personal belief but i have always taken

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.240
solace in the fact that there is a

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.520
higher version of my consciousness right

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.279
so like we touched on before with the

00:23:51.279 --> 00:23:53.600
ego and and and the watcher and the

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.440
witness of consciousness we have an

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.559
unconscious self a subconscious self and

00:23:58.559 --> 00:24:00.799
a super conscious self right and in

00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:03.039
between that makes up our consciousness

00:24:03.039 --> 00:24:05.200
right so there's really kind of three

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.159
parts they make up a fourth part and to

00:24:08.159 --> 00:24:10.159
me i think when we connect with our

00:24:10.159 --> 00:24:12.159
higher self which is that kind of

00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:14.559
consciousness that exists outside of

00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:15.760
time

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.240
is in that same mode of consciousness

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.039
when we're really stoned sometimes right

00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:23.279
and if you set the intention to do that

00:24:23.279 --> 00:24:24.640
you can do that

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.240
but it's not just going to work like

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.480
magic if you go and you know watch

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.360
pokemon and smoke pot you might not have

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:36.240
that but if you put a methodology behind

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.559
the kind of

00:24:38.559 --> 00:24:40.320
your motivations

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.320
it's not about being regimented but it's

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.120
about being able to

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.919
like we said previously get yourself out

00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:51.039
of that flowing current and look up

00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:52.799
see where you're heading and start to

00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:54.559
steer yourself in the direction you want

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:57.360
to go because you know past present

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.559
future

00:24:58.559 --> 00:25:00.480
you're not in the

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.880
present you're not in the uh present if

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.080
you're thinking about the past you're

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.279
not in the present if you're thinking

00:25:05.279 --> 00:25:07.120
about the future you know when we're in

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:09.039
the future we're having anxiety when

00:25:09.039 --> 00:25:10.400
we're in the past we're having

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.279
depression or regret or shame so being

00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:15.919
in the moment is all you'll ever really

00:25:15.919 --> 00:25:18.640
experience so

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.640
let's understand where we're at right

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.080
yeah and dude one of the

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.760
that's it no absolutely man and that's

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.200
the that's like a that's one of those

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.400
challenges too because like a lot of

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.600
times you just bring like you were

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.120
saying you're just bringing baggage that

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.640
just doesn't like say like i'm sitting

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.080
in a chair like right now i'm sitting in

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:32.960
a chair

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.320
and uh you know i'm like sitting here

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.520
trying to like write something i can

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.960
start thinking about nine million

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.080
different things and then start to

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.760
physically experience these things that

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:40.960
aren't here it's like you know i'm

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.880
worried about like is this thing suck or

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.320
what do i got to do today or i have

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.760
plans for two weeks then i don't know

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.200
like is there going to be some weird

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.559
social function i have to go to i might

00:25:48.559 --> 00:25:50.000
be uncomfortable in

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.279
but then i you know like you're saying

00:25:51.279 --> 00:25:52.480
the present moment is going what are you

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.000
doing right now i'm sitting in a chair

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.039
and i'm writing something it's like well

00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:56.320
then just do that like there's no you're

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.480
just you're you're putting your body

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.559
like daily through all of this extra

00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:03.440
stress that's not even here right now

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.640
which is probably going to make the

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.000
actual stressful event worse because

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.120
you've been thinking about it and you

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.960
know like fantasizing about it so it's

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.720
like yeah dude that's that's a humongous

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.919
it's a humongous skill to start to

00:26:11.919 --> 00:26:13.919
develop just just that alone and to do

00:26:13.919 --> 00:26:15.840
the mindfulness spell i have it on my

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.360
phone that's one of that has been one of

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.080
the

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.919
best things i've ever done i have it's i

00:26:19.919 --> 00:26:21.039
think it's just called the mindfulness

00:26:21.039 --> 00:26:23.039
bell app it's free and it just you can

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:24.480
set it to go off as many times as you

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.760
want and you'll be sitting there and it

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.840
goes bing and all of a sudden you go you

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.200
know again you set an intention behind

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.320
you say as soon as this thing as soon as

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.919
this thing goes off i'm going to

00:26:31.919 --> 00:26:33.600
physically release all the tension in my

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.799
body which you know you start to

00:26:34.799 --> 00:26:36.960
accumulate like just all the time

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.640
release that take an inventory of what

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.799
i'm doing how i'm feeling and if the

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:43.279
thing i'm doing fits into my larger

00:26:43.279 --> 00:26:44.880
scheme in terms of like what i genuinely

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.559
want to do with myself or not and you

00:26:46.559 --> 00:26:48.799
know you can confront that over and over

00:26:48.799 --> 00:26:50.320
and over and over it's pretty cool but

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.679
again a lot of this stuff gets kind of

00:26:51.679 --> 00:26:52.480
like

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.159
shoot off because it takes people to a

00:26:54.159 --> 00:26:56.720
place that is very uncomfortable to go

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.480
you know it's like i could have ignored

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.000
all this stuff i could have ignored all

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
the let's say the intuitional

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.679
communication that has been occurring

00:27:03.679 --> 00:27:05.039
since i've been young be like you know

00:27:05.039 --> 00:27:06.559
going into an office and being like this

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:07.840
is [ __ ] up

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.279
like you shouldn't be stuck inside in a

00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:11.520
cubicle all day this is [ __ ] this is a

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.120
[ __ ] up dynamic and you know if you go

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.640
in there and say that the whole context

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.159
durian's gonna go you're wrong you're

00:27:16.159 --> 00:27:18.080
[ __ ] up and it's like i don't think i

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.919
mean obviously i i you know i think i am

00:27:19.919 --> 00:27:22.399
on some level but i know for a fact you

00:27:22.399 --> 00:27:24.080
can't trap people in cubicles for 40

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.039
years and just bake them under

00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:27.520
fluorescent lights and give them like

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.760
[ __ ] non-worked it just just seemed

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.039
just bizarre

00:27:31.039 --> 00:27:33.120
so you know so it's like being in touch

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.320
with that part of yourself and like you

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.919
know there's something in you that's

00:27:35.919 --> 00:27:37.600
kind of beckoning you towards a more

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.520
genuine existence and you can ignore it

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.120
but it's only at your own peril and like

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.799
it once time a lot of time goes by of

00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:44.559
you ignoring that it gets harder and

00:27:44.559 --> 00:27:45.760
harder to confront because then you

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.039
start thinking of all the wasted time

00:27:47.039 --> 00:27:49.039
and you know it's like and there's also

00:27:49.039 --> 00:27:50.640
stuff too like

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.159
say the fact that like you think that

00:27:52.159 --> 00:27:53.600
might be the case

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.520
it's not like a a world-ending thing

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.880
you're like oh my god i ruined my it's

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.919
not like that i don't want to paint it

00:27:57.919 --> 00:28:00.000
like that but it's like you know just

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.760
learning how to slowly

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.200
go back and forth between like

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.799
intuitively realizing because i i

00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:06.080
couldn't do the same thing where i did

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.279
where i'd like

00:28:07.279 --> 00:28:08.720
started thinking everything's wrong and

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.919
then you know then you don't participate

00:28:09.919 --> 00:28:11.039
in anything and that's not a good thing

00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:12.799
at all so it is a bounce but just really

00:28:12.799 --> 00:28:13.919
learning how to listen to yourself

00:28:13.919 --> 00:28:16.159
intuitively and how like you know it's a

00:28:16.159 --> 00:28:18.159
big deal every you know i i do this too

00:28:18.159 --> 00:28:20.000
you approach life like yeah whatever but

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.360
it's like no what you choose to do and

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.360
don't do is is a tremendously big deal

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.480
and you know it should be approached

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.080
that way rather than kind of just

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.200
letting people talk you through it and

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.200
just following you know like oh i guess

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.880
these are the past i do i go to college

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.240
i do this i get married and i can just

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.520
go through the motions but like you said

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.640
there's that witness inside of you

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.320
that's going like

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.240
this doesn't feel real or like doesn't

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.760
feel like three-dimensional it feels

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.240
like our culture tells us to

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.799
tell that witness to shut the hell up

00:28:44.799 --> 00:28:46.240
because

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.760
it's no measure of health to be

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.760
well adjusted to a profoundly sick

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.240
society you know some great man whose

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.760
name is hard to pronounce because he's

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:59.120
from india said that and the truth is is

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.919
that our society is not geared towards

00:29:01.919 --> 00:29:04.240
making us healthy happy human beings

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.039
it's geared towards making us fortian

00:29:07.039 --> 00:29:10.720
type uh you know slave minds who just

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.039
plug into the system and act and

00:29:13.039 --> 00:29:15.840
function as a cog in the wheel and you

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:16.640
know

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.960
now they've gotten to the point where

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.279
since we're not happy being cogs in the

00:29:21.279 --> 00:29:23.360
wheel they have to go and play all these

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.760
mind games on us and and turn us against

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.559
each other and and i give us identity

00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:30.559
groups to fall into and then that

00:29:30.559 --> 00:29:32.399
creates a bunch of problems that we then

00:29:32.399 --> 00:29:34.559
fight over and and everybody's just

00:29:34.559 --> 00:29:37.120
looking for a sense of meaning in life

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.880
because that's all that is when you

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.880
attach yourself to one group or another

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.840
you're just trying to fit in you know so

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.520
ultimately

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.799
the true

00:29:46.799 --> 00:29:50.000
renegade thing to do the true way to

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.559
overcome is not by grouping up with

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:54.480
other people but it's going inwards and

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.799
being the example living

00:29:56.799 --> 00:29:59.760
the example that you think others should

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.840
look up to right because you can only

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:05.360
change yourself i mean i had a taoist

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.000
monk david way on the podcast and i

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.559
asked him i said david how do you help

00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:12.960
the people around you you know like what

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.799
do you tell your family when they're

00:30:14.799 --> 00:30:17.200
sick and he's like i don't man i don't

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.440
tell them they just see me

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.159
do what i do and if they have questions

00:30:22.159 --> 00:30:24.320
i answer them but i'm not gonna try to

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.480
tell them how to live their life you

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.720
know and he told me three things to live

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.840
by move massage meditate and i think

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.240
once you really understand that like

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.360
we're moving we're not perfect we're

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.360
soft sometimes we need a nice little

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.640
massage

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.960
and meditate you know because

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.600
it's just and i i'm probably repeating

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.679
uh that every episode since i

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:50.559
interviewed him moved from

00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:52.720
you know i i wanted you to hear that man

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.440
i think you could understand that and

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.399
yeah man i just i'm really into what

00:30:58.399 --> 00:31:01.760
podcasting has done for me as as far as

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.480
connecting me to more people that are

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.080
like-minded and that's not to create

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.000
some kind of echo chamber but it sure

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.720
can be kind of daunting to be like

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.880
feeling like oh wow i don't have anybody

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.120
to talk about this stuff with so i have

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.519
to ask you matt like do you

00:31:17.519 --> 00:31:19.360
generally feel like this is something

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.000
that you have people to relate it with

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.120
like you know going inward and then this

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.159
yeah

00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:28.000
for a long time i didn't and i want to

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.120
talk about the stuff you were talking

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.720
about before too before i forget the but

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.240
yeah to answer your question it's like

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.399
yeah dude the this is what and this is

00:31:34.399 --> 00:31:36.320
where i think personally again if other

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.919
people like other means for this that's

00:31:37.919 --> 00:31:39.840
fine for me personally the psychedelic

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.840
stuff is cool because it's like

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.799
you know they're going to do it now

00:31:42.799 --> 00:31:44.320
where and i think this is a good thing

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.840
too ultimately of like you know it's

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.440
going to be just another arm of science

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.200
and you go in there's you know a doctor

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.440
and you do it i think with psychedelics

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.640
you can also do a thing where it's like

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.000
with your family it's like you know i

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.519
did it with my brother my brother did it

00:31:55.519 --> 00:31:56.880
i like i knew my brother wanted to do it

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.880
and i got him a guided session and he

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.000
did it he was like yo you got to try

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.519
that that's awesome like you know

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:03.360
blindfold 5 grams you know play some

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.799
music however you want to do it you know

00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:06.320
just try to turn it into a meditative

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.559
intention exercise and i was so [ __ ]

00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:09.840
nervous dude i didn't want to do it i

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.279
was putting it off about then i finally

00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:13.039
i was like [ __ ] it i set a date but to

00:32:13.039 --> 00:32:14.880
answer your question it's like me and my

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.559
brother both did this thing you know and

00:32:16.559 --> 00:32:17.919
it's different i did it when i was like

00:32:17.919 --> 00:32:19.840
19. you know i was oh i did it it's like

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.600
way different when you're 35 dude so we

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.960
both did it and it kind of stripped

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.559
there was like so much defenses between

00:32:24.559 --> 00:32:26.399
us and you know like not even a bad way

00:32:26.399 --> 00:32:27.760
it was just we both had our own little

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.440
defenses or certain things we wouldn't

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.120
talk about it and now like that just

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.279
like we just talk about anything now so

00:32:33.279 --> 00:32:34.559
like i'll just you know and like that

00:32:34.559 --> 00:32:35.760
kind of creates like what you're talking

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:36.960
about like you don't have to be so

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.360
alienated you can kind of like if you

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.960
start to even get one person who you

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.480
would communicate this with and again

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.159
this all comes back to like the best

00:32:44.159 --> 00:32:45.600
prescription for all of it is just being

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.360
as honest as possible because you don't

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.960
have to be everyone's trying to be right

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.480
but it's like yeah good luck with that

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.799
but you can be as honest as you want so

00:32:52.799 --> 00:32:54.080
it's like you know now like you know i

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.440
have one person i talk to i have you

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.360
know my other friend uh andrew spud i

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.559
talk to i can talk to andrew about

00:32:58.559 --> 00:33:00.640
anything and then you start going i can

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.919
talk to anyone about this [ __ ] if

00:33:01.919 --> 00:33:03.840
they're not into it that's not that's

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.960
not really my issue and obviously i'm

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.799
not gonna like you know corner them like

00:33:06.799 --> 00:33:08.080
you know what kind of my uncles do to me

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:08.960
with sports where it's like i'm

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.399
genuinely not interested in what's going

00:33:10.399 --> 00:33:12.080
on with like the you know cleveland

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.080
browns at any given moment but

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.919
they'll like or whoever whatever sports

00:33:15.919 --> 00:33:17.120
team and they'll you know corner me and

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.640
i just you know i kind of like nod along

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.000
and i'm like okay man like that's cool

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.279
you know i'm not even being like oh you

00:33:21.279 --> 00:33:22.960
can't believe you like this it's just

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.320
it's like i'm glad you guys enjoy this

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.399
it's pretty cool they even said like

00:33:26.399 --> 00:33:28.880
sports is kind of like one of the

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.120
kind of spiritual practices of our times

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.480
is it's something people can actually

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.080
bond over and watch and like it's like

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.159
it's an organ organization outside of

00:33:36.159 --> 00:33:36.960
yourself so you know i don't want to

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.120
like snark on that i think it's cool i

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.960
just for me i don't really care who wins

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.679
i'm with you man i am not a sports fan

00:33:43.679 --> 00:33:45.120
maybe i gave you the wrong impression

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.279
when i said i was a wrestler but yeah

00:33:47.279 --> 00:33:49.600
the my family thinks some crazy podcast

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:54.799
has a hard fast rule no sports talk okay

00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:56.480
but yeah again it's like you know again

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.919
it's i can sit here and talk about this

00:33:57.919 --> 00:33:59.120
stuff to some of my uncles who love

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.080
sports and they're i'm just going to

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.440
glaze their eyes over and i'm not going

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.559
to be like

00:34:02.559 --> 00:34:03.919
that's cool man you know we all love

00:34:03.919 --> 00:34:05.360
each other and that's fine but it's like

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.720
recognizing that's a thing it doesn't

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.240
mean they're bad or you're bad it's just

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.760
it's just people are things resonate

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.440
with people on different levels

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.240
um

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.399
but to so the other thing talking about

00:34:14.399 --> 00:34:15.679
like you were saying earlier so yeah to

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:16.560
answer your question it's like yeah just

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.000
be honest with people and you know it's

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.119
some people are not going to end up

00:34:19.119 --> 00:34:20.079
people are going to laugh at you they'll

00:34:20.079 --> 00:34:21.760
do this but you'll be surprised because

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.040
that you know this i feel like people

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.280
who come into this stuff kind of go

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.720
through things where like they kind of

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.800
hit a hard wall so it's like if people

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.560
haven't hit that wall good for them man

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.599
you know i don't want to like force this

00:34:31.599 --> 00:34:32.800
down their throats i personally have hit

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.480
it multiple times so

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.159
but in terms of like you were saying

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:38.000
like you know we're not really this you

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.280
know a lot of the parts of society

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.480
aren't really set up for this kind of

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.240
inquiry or this kind of like you know as

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.760
honest and open discussion a lot of it

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.200
gets bashed and like you were saying

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.800
with the political stuff it's like you

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.760
know you're like well i'm on this group

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.440
so therefore i don't like this group and

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.200
dude if i go and talk to like say like i

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.320
have family members who are super

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.320
conservative and i start saying like you

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.399
know talking about like money and how

00:34:56.399 --> 00:34:58.000
money's just printed and they're gonna

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.680
be like oh you're a communist if i go

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.359
talk to friends if i know who are like

00:35:01.359 --> 00:35:03.119
super left and i'm like dude this is

00:35:03.119 --> 00:35:04.480
crazy we're being like told what to do

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.359
by the government they're going to be

00:35:05.359 --> 00:35:06.320
like you're a [ __ ] right wing

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.839
conspiracy nut and it's just like any

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:09.359
you know it's like it doesn't matter

00:35:09.359 --> 00:35:10.880
it's just very funny how like you know

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.160
they're just going to be like you're

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.000
that one you're this one a lot and as

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.359
soon as you kind of say something

00:35:15.359 --> 00:35:16.880
against like the

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.599
overarching let's say system you're now

00:35:19.599 --> 00:35:21.440
the enemy of the other ones like oh you

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.880
you hate the system they are all both

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.720
convinced that both hate the system and

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.320
whatever and they want to stamp you on

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.079
your forehead they want to give you that

00:35:28.079 --> 00:35:29.680
stamp on the forehead because what that

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.480
does is it gives them an excuse to not

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.680
think further on your position and like

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.520
you're saying that's not even really

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.280
your position because you're able to go

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.119
to one group and give an opposing

00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:43.280
position and another group and giving an

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.440
opposing position obviously there's no

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.440
bias there if you're able to you know

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.839
entertain both thoughts and entertain

00:35:49.839 --> 00:35:51.760
both conversations but it's it's

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.079
disheartening sometimes to see that

00:35:54.079 --> 00:35:55.920
people aren't willing to come to the

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.160
table to discuss certain things they're

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:02.000
just more likely to label you as a group

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:02.800
and

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.880
that that's the end of it sometimes

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.640
right but yeah maybe the spirituality

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.359
stuff

00:36:07.359 --> 00:36:09.599
exactly spirituality stuff is like you

00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:11.760
know the problem comes the problem it

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.079
goes from being like what should the tax

00:36:14.079 --> 00:36:16.160
rate be to be like i love both i love

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.680
both those guys like i love them both

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.800
you know and i'm gonna i'm gonna accept

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.560
both of them for they are i'm just going

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.160
to be honest with them and that that's

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.599
like different than being like you know

00:36:23.599 --> 00:36:25.520
i'm going to wear a you know a donkey

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.280
hat or like wave a you know a stick or

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.640
whatever or

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.560
whatever the other one is an elephant so

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.000
and honestly too like you know that

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:32.880
whole

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.160
because i used to be on some like

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.240
serious like [ __ ] the government forever

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.359
[ __ ] it's like i don't even think like

00:36:37.359 --> 00:36:38.800
that anymore i just think like again i

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.000
think people are just caught up in their

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.480
own [ __ ] and they just get like you know

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.920
and it happens to all of us and we can

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.359
be caught up in our own [ __ ] at any time

00:36:45.359 --> 00:36:46.400
but there are people i feel like who

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.680
don't think about this kind of stuff at

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.200
all and i think it does create kind of

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.640
problems but and if you look at like the

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.160
current situation now you know because

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.240
we have the covet stuff everyone feels

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.920
strongly about it one way or the other

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.960
that you know it's hard to be uh

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.640
whatever you know it's pretty jarring

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.320
like we have we've had mandates we have

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.520
masks and different areas and all this

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.440
stuff and again it's like you can fall

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.119
into the thing like well [ __ ] all that

00:37:05.119 --> 00:37:06.880
it's [ __ ] and it's like well you

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.400
know there are people who did die of it

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.839
and there are people who are genuinely

00:37:09.839 --> 00:37:11.359
afraid of it so that you can approach it

00:37:11.359 --> 00:37:13.119
like that where it's like i'm not being

00:37:13.119 --> 00:37:14.560
dominated by the government i just want

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.760
people to be comfortable but then you

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.839
can also say like all right man i also

00:37:17.839 --> 00:37:18.960
don't want to live in a world where i

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.599
have to like estimate the meters between

00:37:21.599 --> 00:37:22.720
me and another per that's kind of

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.079
[ __ ] weird like i don't you know so

00:37:24.079 --> 00:37:26.480
you know it it is there's a ton of like

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.240
variables going on with it but like the

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.760
thing that really cracks me up and i

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:30.960
kind of noticed this today when i was

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.040
out on a walk you start to pay because

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.240
you know right now we're being convinced

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.520
that the government loves us and just

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.440
wants us to like you know take this

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.880
medicine they've made and all this stuff

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.200
and if you say anything negative or even

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.800
just even like

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.640
saying like maybe i'll wait kind of

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.320
stuff it was a vaccine it's like you

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.240
know do you take it do you not and

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.720
to even suggest like yeah i'm going to

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.480
hold off i don't fully trust these

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.760
companies who are putting this out you

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.440
know i can go through a list of all this

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.280
[ __ ] up [ __ ] they did but i could even

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.480
bring that up you're again like you're

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.240
saying boom stamped conspiracy nut

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.920
[ __ ] psycho but if you look at like

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.119
the larger picture when you're walking

00:38:03.119 --> 00:38:04.320
around you start thinking like okay

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.839
what's okay to do without a mask and

00:38:05.839 --> 00:38:07.839
what's not and it's like

00:38:07.839 --> 00:38:09.920
can i can i go to church like well no

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.680
mask on for church and again there's a

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.200
lot of people there whatever mask on for

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.960
church even if you know so like there's

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.400
that like can i see my family in the

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.520
beginning they're like no you can't see

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.280
your family but we've been able to eat

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.960
outside without a mask the entire time

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.240
in a restaurant and they say well that's

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.760
supporting the economy

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.520
it's like okay you know i like to i i

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.200
want the economy to be good but it's

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.560
also like

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.160
you see a pattern you're like oh i can

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.079
take it off if i'm serving the dollar in

00:38:32.079 --> 00:38:34.320
some way and you start going like

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.520
that's kind of interesting you know what

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.520
else can i do good little boy

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.680
yeah you're a good little boy

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:40.720
you know

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.320
i might be over analyzing this i might

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.320
be biased but it's like okay so i can't

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.079
go outside without a mask and take a

00:38:46.079 --> 00:38:47.520
walk from my own mental health and

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.240
well-being but i can eat a bagel

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.760
that's like as scary as this is i can

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.079
eat a bagel as long as i pay money for a

00:38:54.079 --> 00:38:56.560
bagel if i want to go like see my

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.240
[ __ ] parents and talk to them or see

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.040
my whole family i'm now an enemy of the

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.359
state but i can eat a bagel with a bunch

00:39:03.359 --> 00:39:05.359
of strangers who are also eating bagels

00:39:05.359 --> 00:39:07.359
and you start going what the [ __ ]

00:39:07.359 --> 00:39:09.040
but the but this whole these people have

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.560
my best intentions and that's what i'm

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.079
saying if it's like if it's purely a

00:39:12.079 --> 00:39:13.440
best intention thing and it's like then

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.440
let people all talk speak their mind on

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.440
it and it's like you might you maybe i'm

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.880
wrong maybe it's like no for real dude

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.320
like you know this works we want you all

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.520
to be safe

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:22.880
it's like that's hard to accomplish when

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.240
you're like shutting people down or

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:25.920
labeling people because that goes into

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.680
like there's a guy richard dawkin is it

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.440
richard dawkins david dawkins he talks

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.200
about david i always [ __ ] his name i

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.400
think it's david

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.920
hawkins david dawkins but he starts

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.680
talking about this idea of power versus

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.640
force

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.320
and what they're using a lot of times is

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.079
force they're saying like you know oh

00:39:40.079 --> 00:39:41.520
you're gonna talk about this bam you're

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.880
[ __ ] kicked off of this you're kicked

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.720
off of that platform that's forced

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.400
because they're not like using like uh

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.839
like understanding would be a sense of

00:39:47.839 --> 00:39:49.200
power like if you use force you're

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.760
creating a counter force so like say you

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.920
say hey man [ __ ] this i'm not getting

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.599
this thing and i say you're a [ __ ]

00:39:55.599 --> 00:39:58.079
weirdo and a loser i've now created a

00:39:58.079 --> 00:39:59.440
counter force where i've tried to like

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.040
rather than understanding you which

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.480
would be like a sense of power being

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.160
like all right i'm okay with myself

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.920
let's hear your truth

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.200
i'm gonna come from you at a place of

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.640
understanding now i actually heard you

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.800
out and i can say oh i hear what you're

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.720
saying check this out and i can honestly

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.560
say how i feel about something that you

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.160
said and then now we're kind of like you

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.079
know maybe moving together a little bit

00:40:18.079 --> 00:40:20.000
but if if you use force then all you're

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.240
doing is creating counter force oh mass

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.920
no mass you're a loser you're wearing a

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.760
mascara [ __ ] you're just creating

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.599
animosity more and more animosity until

00:40:27.599 --> 00:40:29.280
a bubble forms and then it pops so

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.240
that's something i've been thinking

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.760
about a lot again that comes from a more

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.319
spiritual perspective so right and i i

00:40:34.319 --> 00:40:36.800
would push it a step further and maybe

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.960
maybe into uncomfortable waters for you

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.720
but personally

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.280
i'm not afraid because i have the faith

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.240
in

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.839
the sense of

00:40:45.839 --> 00:40:48.079
soul and self that

00:40:48.079 --> 00:40:50.480
even if i die of a hot a virus in a

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.560
hospital bed i'm gonna come back you

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.560
know and i can't say that everybody

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.960
needs to believe that but i personally

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.040
believe that i will reincarnate and that

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.000
my soul is much more than just this

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.400
body that i'm in right now so i think a

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.599
lot of the

00:41:05.599 --> 00:41:08.240
campaign of fear that people are

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.280
experience hinges on the fact that they

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.400
mortgage the scare scarcity of life or

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.640
they leverage the scarcity of life

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:19.040
against death right they give you this

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.839
impending sense of death and then make

00:41:21.839 --> 00:41:24.319
you feel like well life is so limited if

00:41:24.319 --> 00:41:26.560
i don't make these choices really the

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.119
right way then i could lose it all and

00:41:29.119 --> 00:41:31.200
that's that's that impending sense of

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.880
doom that i think a lot of people are

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.800
there their common sense and their logic

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.560
is falling victim to that you know

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.800
because we as you know

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.359
human beings we have these instincts to

00:41:41.359 --> 00:41:43.359
defend ourselves and protect ourselves

00:41:43.359 --> 00:41:46.480
and slowly over time and again this is

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.240
my opinion i kind of i dig it for the

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.880
record but over time they've

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.920
indoctrinated us to be in this kind of

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:56.000
well i'll do what you tell me kind of

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.040
mindset because it's easier that way and

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.160
people have so much stress to just put

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.720
food on the table that if you ask them

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.119
to do a math problem or

00:42:07.119 --> 00:42:09.359
locate you know papua new guinea on a

00:42:09.359 --> 00:42:10.800
map they're like what the [ __ ] are you

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.200
talking about like i gotta put food on

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.280
my table you know so there's a certain

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:18.240
amount of mental work that

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.640
getting out of the matrix requires and i

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.560
think that is the

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.680
inherent uh benefit that the matrix has

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.760
is it's really good at trapping people

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.000
inside of it once it's created you know

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.839
and i'm not again i'm not a chicken

00:42:31.839 --> 00:42:33.920
little sky is falling type person i

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.400
think we all came here

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.720
to do this to take on this challenge

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.560
yeah there's going to be evil people

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.760
yeah there's going to be [ __ ] up

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.880
people yeah there's going to be people

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.040
that are going to break your heart but

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.200
you signed up for it you signed up for

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.920
the lesson to learn and become stronger

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.440
from it and

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.800
ultimately

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.200
it reminds me of something my mentor

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.359
taught me when i decided to drop out of

00:42:57.359 --> 00:43:01.200
college it's like you know you are

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:04.319
who you say you are you know like he

00:43:04.319 --> 00:43:06.400
he came into my life in such a strange

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.560
way this homeless indigenous man from

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:10.480
arizona hanging out on the yale

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.040
university campus i was just a college

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.520
student at gateway not even yale you

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.400
know and

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.560
he changed my life by teaching me these

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.440
things about indigenous culture and and

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.040
praying and and

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:25.359
that connected me right and i think a

00:43:25.359 --> 00:43:27.040
lot of people

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:29.680
uh unfortunately get so dragged into the

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.240
current they don't have an uh a mentor

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.240
or an opportunity for a mentor to kind

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.920
of shake him up and be like no man this

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.160
is what the real world is you know and

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:40.560
because i was in that state of like

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:44.000
yeah catholicism is [ __ ] and weed is

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.640
really cool like what else is there it

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:49.280
hit me at this perfect time you know and

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.119
maybe that makes me a different person

00:43:51.119 --> 00:43:53.359
and masks and

00:43:53.359 --> 00:43:55.359
it and i just don't care like i don't

00:43:55.359 --> 00:43:57.839
wear a mask unless i have to because i'm

00:43:57.839 --> 00:43:59.599
not trying to be an [ __ ] you know

00:43:59.599 --> 00:44:02.079
like i want to be able to buy groceries

00:44:02.079 --> 00:44:03.760
and not make a scene

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.760
but you know

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:08.480
it's like i gotta you gotta

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.480
stand up for yourself too and i think

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.440
that the

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.880
what

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.800
david way the taoist i interviewed

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.400
taught me is like you gotta lead by

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.000
example and what you just said is

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.720
beautiful be powerful not forceful and

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.400
that's exactly what he was kind of

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.400
telling me too it's like be powerful

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.720
don't be forceful understand

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.200
where people are coming from so you can

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.760
then give them the benefit of your

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.480
understanding rather than discounting

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.720
them and trying to just force your

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.640
understanding on them you know because

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:39.760
we're all

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.839
signing up for this we all signed up for

00:44:41.839 --> 00:44:44.480
this crazy third dimensional reality

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.640
experience you know but i mean we're

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.480
kind of coming towards the close here

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.000
matt what are your your final thoughts

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.839
anything you want to leave with uh

00:44:51.839 --> 00:44:53.680
yes i mean dude you know i agree with

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.040
pretty much everything you're saying and

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.880
again like just think about the fact

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.000
that it's like oh what am i going to die

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.280
well i'm not afraid to die you know and

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.800
again it's like i am genuinely like i

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.480
don't i don't want to right now i'd be

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.359
upset

00:45:03.359 --> 00:45:05.599
but i also like you were saying

00:45:05.599 --> 00:45:07.359
i approach it more like i have faith in

00:45:07.359 --> 00:45:09.119
the fact that i'll be okay

00:45:09.119 --> 00:45:10.640
you know and it's like

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.240
i ultimately know that even if i do get

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.680
sick like you were saying i think i'll

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.680
be okay you know and if i'm not okay

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:16.880
then you know that's just out of my

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.880
hands and it becomes a question of like

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.319
you know do you want to preserve life at

00:45:20.319 --> 00:45:21.520
the cost of everything that makes it

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:22.960
worth living you know it's like you know

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:24.319
do i want to like live in a bubble

00:45:24.319 --> 00:45:25.760
forever so that i don't die it's like

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.920
well no so it's like you know well it's

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.359
just for a year okay well say it was for

00:45:29.359 --> 00:45:31.280
four years what time period would you

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.119
say this is too much for you know the

00:45:33.119 --> 00:45:34.960
you know the risk of not dying or

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.440
getting sick is one i get will you trade

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.440
a year of your life like i'll try to how

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.359
about five it's like no you know you

00:45:41.359 --> 00:45:42.480
know what i mean so it becomes the point

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.640
where it's like who who's to say how

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.640
much time is acceptable to sacrifice and

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.400
living in the bubble wrap mode and that

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.079
should be a conversation kilvin is like

00:45:50.079 --> 00:45:52.480
the vacation we all got strained on like

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:54.240
this is fun like we could do this and

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.319
then it's like no i why don't we get

00:45:56.319 --> 00:45:58.319
what dad get the rental car already we

00:45:58.319 --> 00:46:00.720
need to go home like yeah yeah no

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.240
absolutely so yeah i mean to close it

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.079
out yeah it's like you know just i'm

00:46:04.079 --> 00:46:05.599
really interested always and kind of

00:46:05.599 --> 00:46:06.880
like finding

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.880
little kind of ways to

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.880
take the more rational minded people and

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.240
just try to like open them up to the

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.160
fact of like like there's again the book

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.359
is called power reverse force it's

00:46:15.359 --> 00:46:16.880
pretty good they they spend a lot of

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.480
time talking about applied kinesiology

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.160
which is a whole other subject which you

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.000
know i don't really care about that much

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:22.960
but

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:24.400
they start talking about the invisible

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:25.599
universe and in terms of the power

00:46:25.599 --> 00:46:27.760
versus force model it's like you know

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.359
there's things that we didn't know

00:46:29.359 --> 00:46:31.839
existed that just exert their power like

00:46:31.839 --> 00:46:34.000
gravity gravity was around it was

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.319
keeping us tight held to the planet that

00:46:36.319 --> 00:46:38.240
doesn't gravity doesn't have to like you

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.359
know like

00:46:39.359 --> 00:46:41.599
exert itself it's it's a complete entity

00:46:41.599 --> 00:46:43.040
it's a power it's something that you

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.079
know it's something that is in you know

00:46:44.079 --> 00:46:45.599
what they call the invisible universe

00:46:45.599 --> 00:46:47.040
like you know we discovered that oh okay

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.640
that's a thing you know there's bacteria

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:49.920
germs all this stuff they're all they

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.440
were all previously part of an invisible

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.040
universe they were there but they were

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.400
outside of our perception so i always

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.720
tell people like you know there's so

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.160
many things that we've like that we

00:46:58.160 --> 00:46:59.839
didn't know that we've discovered and

00:46:59.839 --> 00:47:01.680
you just see them as like these like

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:03.680
eternal forces that just emanate

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.440
naturally in the universe

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:06.880
and then you can boil that down to the

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.800
human level where it's like uh this

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:09.839
would be an example of it like say

00:47:09.839 --> 00:47:10.880
you're in a relationship with someone

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.000
and there's stuff they're doing that you

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000
kind of don't like you know you what can

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.440
you do you can scream at them that's

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:16.640
being forceful and that's just going to

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:17.599
create them to become kind of

00:47:17.599 --> 00:47:19.760
recalcitrant and kind of resistant or

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:21.359
you can try to openly communicate with

00:47:21.359 --> 00:47:22.800
them from a place of love and say hey

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.720
like this is what this brings up to me

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.880
when you do this hear them out and then

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.079
it's up to them if they want to not do

00:47:28.079 --> 00:47:29.680
that or not and then rather than kind of

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.079
like forcing your agenda on other people

00:47:32.079 --> 00:47:33.280
you could practice the you know

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.960
acceptance like well let me remove the

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:37.359
desire from me for this person to act in

00:47:37.359 --> 00:47:38.640
a way that i don't like because what you

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.920
don't have much of this is just my own

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.920
weird [ __ ] so you know that was kind of

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.920
a meander but really it's like letting

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:45.359
people acknowledge like dude there's so

00:47:45.359 --> 00:47:47.359
much more to the universe like we didn't

00:47:47.359 --> 00:47:49.200
we laugh at people in medieval times

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.040
that was you know it was what a couple

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:53.280
hundred years ago another conception of

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.119
the universe to think that we all of a

00:47:55.119 --> 00:47:57.040
sudden nailed it now

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.800
is just falling in line with all of the

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.079
other people who thought they nailed it

00:48:00.079 --> 00:48:02.480
who were all wildly wrong so it's like

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:03.760
just be open to the fact that there's

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.119
more stuff that exists outside of

00:48:05.119 --> 00:48:07.200
yourself and the the spiritual way of

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.720
being is like you know you hit a

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:10.559
crossroad where you say all right i'm

00:48:10.559 --> 00:48:11.760
definitely alive i'm definitely in the

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:12.800
universe

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.119
is the universe like am i part of like

00:48:15.119 --> 00:48:17.359
some form of eternal and unchanging

00:48:17.359 --> 00:48:19.280
thing or is the universe basically this

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.359
kind of indifferent and cold thing that

00:48:21.359 --> 00:48:23.839
doesn't care at all about life in any

00:48:23.839 --> 00:48:25.040
capacity

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.800
and you just choose to say i choose to

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.079
think it does

00:48:28.079 --> 00:48:29.359
you know and it's like and there's so

00:48:29.359 --> 00:48:31.680
many benefits to doing that versus being

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.040
like [ __ ] that i don't believe it and

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.400
then you know you go with the scientific

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.000
model which is just predicated on

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.160
doubting everything constantly which

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.000
works again for making medicines it's

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
awesome but for the human mind i think

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.839
it starts to create a pretty shitty

00:48:43.839 --> 00:48:45.599
state in like a pretty meaningless state

00:48:45.599 --> 00:48:47.119
so it's like i just choose to live in

00:48:47.119 --> 00:48:48.720
the cooler version of it and then you

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.480
know and i still like the scientific

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:51.760
model and it's like well i'll take both

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:53.280
dude you can have both that's what i'm

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:54.400
saying like you can have both you can

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:56.079
have the mental security of like just

00:48:56.079 --> 00:48:57.680
acknowledging the possibility that their

00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:59.680
the universe is wildly more complex than

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.440
you can conceive of and that it

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.079
ultimately cares about you on some level

00:49:04.079 --> 00:49:05.119
and

00:49:05.119 --> 00:49:06.559
yeah you just go with that and there's

00:49:06.559 --> 00:49:08.720
for me again from all like my mission

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:10.000
with the psych and all stuff is to bring

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.440
people tools to increase their mental

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.440
well-being and it's like here's one and

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.040
nobody talks about it and it's like you

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.880
know it's a personal choice it's funny

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.559
that religion and spirituality now is a

00:49:18.559 --> 00:49:20.319
taboo which is like it's pretty funny

00:49:20.319 --> 00:49:21.920
but yeah so that's it dude that's pretty

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.119
much it thanks for having me on here i

00:49:23.119 --> 00:49:25.280
