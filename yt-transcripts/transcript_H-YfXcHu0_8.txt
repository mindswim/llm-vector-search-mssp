this show

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.240

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.080
canceled on a very public level

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.160
which i'm sure you're [ __ ] tired of

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.520

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.679

00:17:45.679 --> 00:17:46.880
if we get into it

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.559

00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:51.520
montreal yes uh and it was really good

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.120
seeing you up on stage because you were

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.960
the only comic

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.360
and you really [ __ ] murdered though

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.200

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.120
i'm like wow this is the right place in

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.440
time so i kind of assumed something

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.720
would happen for you um and then so what

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.200

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.160
lot but

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.400
it was like no that's fine it's like

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.360

[Laughter]

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.080
you know i it actually i think we

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.919

that we deleted most of the old episodes

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
so i was like i'm definitely fine

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.320

00:33:16.399 --> 00:33:19.360
and i was like oh i'm way off then i

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.159
think you'll be fine

00:33:20.159 --> 00:33:21.679
it'll be your fans they don't care

00:33:21.679 --> 00:33:24.000
because i know you a lot of [ __ ]

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.840
like stan hope and you know a bunch of

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.919
people play that showing porn in the 40s

00:33:27.919 --> 00:33:31.120
look at this bush we weren't allowed to

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.880
show ankles last week

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:37.120
that's crazy just stuck stepmom

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.880
what they probably don't believe in

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.039
kovid so it's going to be a pretty good

00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:41.679
turnout

00:33:41.679 --> 00:33:42.320
that'd be good

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.760
[Laughter]

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:46.799
there's some people in new york that

00:33:46.799 --> 00:33:48.640
apparently don't believe it either you

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.240
gotta walk past them on the way here

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.679
oh the ones that are people don't

00:33:51.679 --> 00:33:54.480
believe it yeah it's political

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.600
it is politicized yeah i mean i believe

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.640
in it it's just

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.240
only in certain areas you know like

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.919
trains yeah and

00:34:01.919 --> 00:34:05.039
yeah and then it stops tranny's vomiting

00:34:05.039 --> 00:34:06.720
yeah i feel like that could i literally

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.480
change my i turned around put my mask

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.919
back on i didn't know where you went

00:34:09.919 --> 00:34:12.079
i walked into the store where did he go

00:34:12.079 --> 00:34:13.280
and then i walked down here just down

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:13.839
the block

00:34:13.839 --> 00:34:15.440
yeah dude and i was downwind and then

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.280
another one who had an even worse

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.440
haircut it looked like a squirrel's nest

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.879
and she's just like you got a dollar and

00:34:20.879 --> 00:34:24.159
i'm like i know that's just

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:25.760
it just kept shifting from all the

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.079
violence

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:29.760
i'm guessing lie down further and

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.520
further i'm guessing fentanyl either

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.159
kills you or just makes you vomit

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:35.679
it's like depends on how it hits how

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:37.599
active were they were they moving quick

00:34:37.599 --> 00:34:39.280
no she was not if you were throwing up

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.879
off fennel i think you'd be moving

00:34:40.879 --> 00:34:43.919
pretty slow yeah she was yeah she just

00:34:43.919 --> 00:34:45.440
hurt her just her head and then every

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.480
now and then she'll go like this and

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.200
just slide her

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.440
back up but she was like yeah she was

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.280
like the speed of fart like i got

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.000
dropped like

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.159
and then after she vomited though she

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:55.599
was a little bit more with it yeah she

00:34:55.599 --> 00:34:57.440
got back up

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.800
the dude behind her was just like

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.720
staring at her then he started i thought

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.640
he was quick he was just watching her

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.040
yeah

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.520
they were together yeah well i think

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.040
that was her pimp

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.480
no he was [ __ ] up because by the time

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.160
he got to the corner it hit him a little

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.079
harder and he was just

00:35:12.079 --> 00:35:13.359
his tongue was out and just staring

00:35:13.359 --> 00:35:15.440
right that would be a good pimp

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.839
though if you could sell me that yeah

00:35:17.839 --> 00:35:18.960
see that [ __ ] it's like

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.240
what they do in the shadows kind of

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.640
thing it's like this since covid

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.480
it's just it's run amok they just do

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.839
everything that typically would

00:35:25.839 --> 00:35:27.119
they'd wait for the sun to come down and

00:35:27.119 --> 00:35:28.720
now it's just a [ __ ] it's a

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.640
playground for animals yeah it is

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.079

the people that stayed here and [ __ ]

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:49.119

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.839
going to stop blaming them for things

00:36:01.839 --> 00:36:03.040

are you guys doing something i think

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.359
they're building

00:46:39.359 --> 00:46:41.359
they're moving in someone are you sure

00:46:41.359 --> 00:46:42.400
because i heard a girl

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:46.000
girl crying over there the other day

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.400
for real yeah that [ __ ] was going like

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.440
this

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.560
that's what they're moving in like a

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:53.839
waiting room live girls sweet

00:46:53.839 --> 00:46:55.920
wasn't weren't we to tear down the wall

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.680
and expand the studio

00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:01.920
until we realize the network has no hope

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.119
too is that where we're at no we're good

00:47:05.119 --> 00:47:06.319

00:47:06.319 --> 00:47:09.119
shockingly good yeah no it's cool

00:47:09.119 --> 00:47:09.440
because

well at least i'm on the flagship

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.920
because we can throw everything else

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:12.720
overboard

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:16.480

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:40.079
like a year ago almost exactly

00:47:40.079 --> 00:47:43.359

00:47:47.119 --> 00:47:48.319
nervous because i was like there's no

00:47:48.319 --> 00:47:49.920
way i'll get this i never thought i

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.040
would get snl or like

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:53.200
really since like fifth grade wanted to

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.160
get it

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.800
you know uh because i just i just

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:57.920
figured i never would

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:01.599
and then i was in the green room like

00:48:01.599 --> 00:48:02.720
i'm not going to get this

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.000
this sucks you just sit there for like

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.440
three hours four hours waiting and then

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:08.960
but then when it's time to audition you

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.400
actually walk into the main room and

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.920

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.599
it's like oh [ __ ] now i'm nervous

00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:16.319

00:48:16.319 --> 00:48:18.000
well seeing that room has

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.839
i mean i saw it on a tour once and i was

00:48:19.839 --> 00:48:21.599
like holy [ __ ] yeah it was cool it was

00:48:21.599 --> 00:48:22.720
cool to see

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:26.000
um and then yeah and then i just figured

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.400
it that was it i figured i was too

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:29.680
nervous and then i ran into

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:32.880
che that night and he was like no that

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:33.200
was

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.200
you were the least nervous i was like oh

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.839
wow was it i started directors like

00:48:37.839 --> 00:48:39.920
improv guys it was a lot of improv guys

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:41.359
who were you comedians

00:48:41.359 --> 00:48:44.079
were you in front of oh like the

00:48:44.079 --> 00:48:45.520
producer like lauren

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.119
oh so it wasn't just like one person it

00:48:47.119 --> 00:48:48.960
was like it was like a couple

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:50.160
head writers and then like lauren

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.000
michaels it was probably like 10 people

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.280
you're just like a couple guys guys like

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:57.200
yeah dude well i was told no one was

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.720
going to laugh so then once i heard

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.720
it was so funny dude so there's a camera

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:01.680
dead in front of you and you're supposed

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.960
to pretend like

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:06.079
don't pretend like the audience is full

00:49:06.079 --> 00:49:08.559
like don't like ignore everybody ignore

00:49:08.559 --> 00:49:09.280
the table

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.800
don't talk to the table talk to the

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.800
crowd so it's like all comedy now

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:13.599
totally empty

00:49:13.599 --> 00:49:15.760
yeah warranty comedy yeah and then uh i

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.040
would tell a joke and then they would

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.760
laugh and i'd be like

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:23.680
they'd start laughing i'd be like

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:26.559
it was just instinctual yeah they'd

00:49:26.559 --> 00:49:28.480
laugh and i'd be like nice nice yeah

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:29.920
well improv dudes can ignore that

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:31.599
because they're used to doing shows like

00:49:31.599 --> 00:49:35.680
parents yeah your audition as a tree was

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:36.480
fantastic

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:39.040
yeah so did you just do your act you

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.559
weren't doing characters or anything

00:49:40.559 --> 00:49:42.800
i just did my act okay yeah you saw

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.160
trump in there

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:47.200
uh i don't think yeah i must have yeah

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.720
cause the last joke i did was

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:52.000
yeah i genuinely don't it was like

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.079
it was so much like uh adrenaline from

00:49:54.079 --> 00:49:56.640
that like i kind of forgot the actual

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:57.920
set the only thing i remember was my

00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.319
hand was shaking so i had to put the

00:50:00.319 --> 00:50:02.800
mic against my chin you ever do that

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:03.440
yeah of course

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:05.760
yeah that was the first time that it

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.359
happened in years

00:50:07.359 --> 00:50:09.119
yeah that's a weird thing it was an

00:50:09.119 --> 00:50:10.559
empty room what

00:50:10.559 --> 00:50:13.839
just like one more than the empty room

00:50:13.839 --> 00:50:15.119
it's a camera in front of you and

00:50:15.119 --> 00:50:17.040
they're like all right three

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:19.280
go and you just gotta [ __ ] do five

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.240
minutes to no

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.839
silence basically yeah it's brutal it

00:50:21.839 --> 00:50:23.920
was weird oh that's crazy

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.160
but that's all it really took were you

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.680
that's incredible so when were you

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.280
called back

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.640
a couple days later they were like we

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:31.760
want you to come back in to meet

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:32.400
everybody

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.000
all right then you do this like tour

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.520
type thing where you meet all the staff

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.640
and [ __ ]

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.559
but then the three people i was with

00:50:38.559 --> 00:50:39.839
also doing that

00:50:39.839 --> 00:50:42.960
left they lauren sees you individually

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.160
so that he talked to all of them

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.599
individually and then they kept me

00:50:45.599 --> 00:50:47.119
another like hour and a half

00:50:47.119 --> 00:50:48.960
just in the waiting room with his

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.079
assistants and i was like all right i

00:50:50.079 --> 00:50:51.520
think i might have got this

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:52.880
yeah that's always a good sign when

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:54.800
you're there let me in last

00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:57.520
and then uh yeah he was like probably

00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:59.599
we're gonna use you so

00:50:59.599 --> 00:51:01.119
we'll figure out what if that's writing

00:51:01.119 --> 00:51:03.119
or cast and he called me a couple days

00:51:03.119 --> 00:51:05.359
later and was like alright it's cast

00:51:05.359 --> 00:51:06.720
and we're gonna announce tomorrow and

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.640

your fourth or fifth least favorite

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.079
night of life

00:51:29.839 --> 00:51:31.280
911s

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:34.000
that was genuinely one of the best 911's

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:34.400
i remember

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:37.440

we had to go to church and pray and they

00:51:48.559 --> 00:51:50.400

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:51.119
high school

00:51:51.119 --> 00:51:54.480

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.760

like it's not a pilot

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:06.640

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.960
as [ __ ]

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.559
man that pilot's a real [ __ ] idiot

00:52:10.559 --> 00:52:12.240
yeah that's right right that was my

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.960
first honestly

00:52:15.839 --> 00:52:18.559
i wasn't even around then it's just

00:52:18.559 --> 00:52:19.839
that's what i assumed

00:52:19.839 --> 00:52:21.200
sound like that chick who's like if you

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.040
weren't here in quarantine then you

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:23.920
don't understand

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.599
i had a flight to paris that day at 3

00:52:25.599 --> 00:52:27.200
30. i was supposed to go to paris with

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:28.559
my girlfriend and 9 11

00:52:28.559 --> 00:52:31.760
11. so wow that is all about you came

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.440
nowhere near getting attacked

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:34.640
yeah it would have been nicer if you

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:35.920
were in the air when it happened yeah i

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.040
had to circle back

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:39.280
bring me down there's like detroit i bet

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.800
you would have [ __ ]

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:42.880
taken on one of the box cutter guys or

00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:44.400
just my girlfriend and acted like how

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.040
she was

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:49.119
she was risk yeah this girl

00:52:49.119 --> 00:52:50.480
started it yeah what do you want some

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.240
irish sunglasses get over here

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.480
shove her at the guy just to get stabbed

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.800
just use a human shield

00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:00.079
that would work yeah when

00:53:00.079 --> 00:53:01.119
you'd like to think you would mark

00:53:01.119 --> 00:53:03.280
wahlberg out yeah yeah exactly and be

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:03.680
like

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.240
no i would have prevented 911. yeah but

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:07.119
also like

00:53:07.119 --> 00:53:08.240
now you might because you're like

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.160
there's no way that this is

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:12.559
yeah yeah going down peacefully that's

00:53:12.559 --> 00:53:13.760
the only reason i think a lot of these

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:14.160
things

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.280
you know that's why it happened yeah

00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:17.200
that's why i think like flight 93 found

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.800
out about what else was going on there

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.720
alright well we got to [ __ ] this up yeah

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:21.760
the other people were like all right

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:22.160
this will

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.280
end peacefully and they're like oh we're

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.359
getting awfully low yeah because i think

00:53:25.359 --> 00:53:26.559
one dude's on the phone was daddy's like

00:53:26.559 --> 00:53:28.880

like delta force is their only like idea

00:53:31.599 --> 00:53:33.119
of a hijacking so they're like look

00:53:33.119 --> 00:53:34.400
we'll probably just land in the middle

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:34.800
east

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:43.839

my name's shane gillis and i'm not a

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:21.440
part of this you did nothing wrong

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:23.119
you're just simply saying that you had

00:56:23.119 --> 00:56:25.520
it people get up to modern day 911 this

00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:27.440
is my least favorite monday 9 11

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.119
911 is getting funnier by the day by the

00:56:29.119 --> 00:56:30.559
way oh it's all right

00:56:30.559 --> 00:56:32.400
every day since it's been closer to

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:33.680
being funnier yeah

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:35.920
uh the aids this is my least favorite

00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.760
thing about online [ __ ] is when i'll say

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:38.880
stuff like that like

00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:40.319
i'll make a [ __ ] up joke and then be

00:56:40.319 --> 00:56:42.799
like yo i was just [ __ ] around there

00:56:42.799 --> 00:56:44.400
dudes online he's such a [ __ ] he's

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.160
trying to save his ass now

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:48.400
dude i'm joking again always by being

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.359
like yo

00:56:49.359 --> 00:56:51.040
i would never say something like i just

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.599
said well i mean this with all

00:56:53.599 --> 00:56:55.920
with all due respect you lost the job

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:57.680
yeah i'm not trying to keep it

00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:58.720
that's what they keep saying they're

00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:00.640
like oh he's trying to kiss ass again

00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:01.920
it's like dude i know i'm not getting

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.520
back on that thing he should let you

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:04.079
back on

00:57:04.079 --> 00:57:05.920
he should i mean she's gonna be back on

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.319
i'm sorry about what i said earlier

00:57:08.319 --> 00:57:09.920
i think you should be let back on i

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:12.160
think it's [ __ ] absurd well i don't

00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:15.440
look obviously i would take the job yes

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.200
and it would be funny if i if he offered

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.960
it again that would be genuinely funny

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.160
to see

00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:24.319
the [ __ ] storm that would happen um

00:57:24.319 --> 00:57:27.440
but bo and yang wouldn't care for it he

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:29.680
he seemed like a nice guy yeah he's he

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:31.119
seemed to defend you a bit

00:57:31.119 --> 00:57:32.559
yeah he kind of did until he found out i

00:57:32.559 --> 00:57:34.480
was definitely out he was when he was a

00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:35.040
little more

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.240
that i'm allowed to call this guy a

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:38.720
piece of [ __ ]

00:57:38.839 --> 00:57:41.839
um

00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:48.270
[Laughter]

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:53.920
they're your friend till they're not

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:55.200
improv 101 dude

00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:57.280
yeah this is it oh what's he learning

00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:59.200
from would you see an improv guy

00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.880
i guess i don't know i think he did some

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:02.400
stand up yeah cause i know there's a lot

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:02.720
of

00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:04.799
i know they do a lot of ucb guys through

00:58:04.799 --> 00:58:06.799
there yeah it's mostly

00:58:06.799 --> 00:58:08.640
yeah that's why it attracts such [ __ ]

00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:10.400
dorks that

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:13.119
look up your past oh yeah these [ __ ]

00:58:13.119 --> 00:58:14.480
weird improv people

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:16.240
it's so odd though because growing up

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.680
when you look at like sandler

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:20.559
and uh dennis miller and david spade and

00:58:20.559 --> 00:58:22.480
farley and like even bill murray and

00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:23.119
[ __ ]

00:58:23.119 --> 00:58:24.799
yeah but they were all more of the cool

00:58:24.799 --> 00:58:26.500
guys

00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:28.400
[Music]

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:30.960
yeah around that time yeah because like

00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:32.640
uh poster will ferrell

00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:34.319
second city old school was like they

00:58:34.319 --> 00:58:37.119
were like party guys the part i started

00:58:37.119 --> 00:58:39.280
yeah even the main stage when i started

00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:40.240
was [ __ ]

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.400
all party guys yeah it wasn't like nerdy

00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:43.440
to get everything

00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:46.960
tim robinson was uh on snl

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.720
yeah yeah and he's he was a detroit guy

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.240
who was that second city when i was

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:50.640
there

00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:52.240
and dude his sketch show's [ __ ]

00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:54.400
hilarious on netflix

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:56.559
and uh i remember that yeah he got moved

00:58:56.559 --> 00:58:58.799
down to writer i think because of how he

00:58:58.799 --> 00:58:59.760
looks

00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:02.480
yeah yeah yeah which you know that

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.680
doesn't bode well for me

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:05.760
right which like but i guess if they're

00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:07.520
docking you for being ugly right and i

00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.119
guess andy sandberg was like

00:59:09.119 --> 00:59:11.040
we'll give you i'm gonna put my name out

00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:12.400
there so you will give you your show

00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:14.240
detroiters which was really funny but it

00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:15.839
was too like a niche market

00:59:15.839 --> 00:59:17.760
yeah but now his show on netflix

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.440
nobody's like really watches it that

00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:21.599
when i talk to him and it's so goddamn

00:59:21.599 --> 00:59:22.559
good

00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:24.640
it's one of the best yeah it's it's

00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:25.599
fantastic

00:59:25.599 --> 00:59:26.960
but yeah they definitely find the right

00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:29.359
people sometimes so when

00:59:29.359 --> 00:59:31.119
so you met him in his office which i

00:59:31.119 --> 00:59:33.040
imagine is that's pretty cool

00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.559
that's gotta be crazy that was really

00:59:34.559 --> 00:59:35.920
cool especially because like i said

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:37.599
everybody had left it was so late

00:59:37.599 --> 00:59:39.839
they made me stay like extra late and

00:59:39.839 --> 00:59:40.640
then yeah

00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:42.240
i think i had to cancel like a show or

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.160
something bummer there's a cool reason

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:45.040
to tell them why

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:47.359
it sucks oh you were supposed to be at

00:59:47.359 --> 00:59:49.599
the stand i was on your show then really

00:59:49.599 --> 00:59:51.520
yes nice yeah yeah because you invited

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.119
me to do your show and then

00:59:53.119 --> 00:59:55.040
yeah you uh it was oh yeah and i wasn't

00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:56.559
gonna make it it was a thursday

00:59:56.559 --> 00:59:59.280
and she's like it's a really big reason

00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.319
and i kind of heard through the

01:00:00.319 --> 01:00:00.960
grapevine

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.359
yeah i was like oh okay it was good to

01:00:03.359 --> 01:00:05.280
be happy for like one week of my life

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:07.680
yeah that was [ __ ] sick everybody was

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.240
like damn shit's gonna work out

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:14.880
[ __ ] just exploded on 9 12.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:18.000
i saw that was my worst 9 12.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
you have 9 11. easily my worst nine

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.119
times 9 13 was pretty bad

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:26.839
9 13 things yeah things continued to

01:00:26.839 --> 01:00:29.040
decline 9 11

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.920
best day 14th continued the long streak

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.480
of not

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:35.839
not going great so were you you

01:00:35.839 --> 01:00:37.280
i think everybody got i don't know you

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.599
were in limbo for how long

01:00:39.599 --> 01:00:42.640
like a week no like four or four or five

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.200
days

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.520
that's it of when i got announced and

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.359
when they fired me yeah it was probably

01:00:47.359 --> 01:00:48.480
four days

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.400
yeah they're so weird when you called me

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.079
i think i was at a bar

01:00:52.079 --> 01:00:54.000
prepping for like uh now we're talking

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.680
like it's 9 11 too

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.920
yeah and then on the tv and there you

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.040
were

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:02.079
called racist by uh strahan

01:01:02.079 --> 01:01:03.839
every newscaster in the country i

01:01:03.839 --> 01:01:05.440
straight hand on good morning america i

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:08.640
just called you a racist

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.880
no he called me it's kind of a win

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:11.920
there's a lot of wins

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.520
there's a lot of wins every single

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.359
celebrity talk [ __ ] about you yes yes

01:01:15.359 --> 01:01:16.559
there's a lot of wins

01:01:16.559 --> 01:01:17.760
and then over the next year i've got to

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.599
watch most of them fall apart

01:01:19.599 --> 01:01:21.599
yeah everybody gets you know everybody

01:01:21.599 --> 01:01:22.880
that's super liberal trying to take

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.160
everybody down you're gonna get starting

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.599
to blow up dude

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:27.200
this bubble's gonna blow up the left are

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.880
eating the left where were you

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:32.559
uh doing drywall with these guys

01:01:32.559 --> 01:01:34.559
no i was by myself so like you called

01:01:34.559 --> 01:01:35.920
you're like uh

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.960
i got it and i was like like i remember

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:41.040
where i was exactly and i was like

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.280
holy what and then i had to go back in

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:44.960
the bar like like a father who just

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.319
learned his son got and the boy's gonna

01:01:46.319 --> 01:01:46.960
be like

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:50.000
you guys said you gotta hear this a very

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.119
envious father

01:01:51.119 --> 01:01:54.000
i wasn't yeah and very envious i wanted

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.880
to go to college very secretly angry

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.400
i would have probably been better at

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.799
college

01:02:01.119 --> 01:02:04.799
uh no i remember not being too excited

01:02:04.799 --> 01:02:06.640
when i got it though really yeah i had a

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.559
good feeling that was gonna happen

01:02:08.559 --> 01:02:11.119
the cancellation yeah i had a good

01:02:11.119 --> 01:02:12.079
feeling i was gonna get

01:02:12.079 --> 01:02:13.440
i don't know it was just surreal maybe i

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:14.880
was just didn't know how to be excited

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.079
about something

01:02:16.079 --> 01:02:18.319
well i think that's uh good cynicism and

01:02:18.319 --> 01:02:20.799
there's a comic and a good comic

01:02:20.799 --> 01:02:22.799
you're kind of born with that yeah so i

01:02:22.799 --> 01:02:24.799
wasn't like devastated when i didn't get

01:02:24.799 --> 01:02:26.240
the job because again even

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.000
after i got even after i knew i was

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.240
getting it i still it still seemed

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:34.400
not real yeah you felt something was off

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:38.160
yeah i knew i was [ __ ] dude i was like

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.839
the pr people called me like the day

01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:41.760
before so they had they really only had

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.119
24 hours to vet me

01:02:43.119 --> 01:02:45.119
well how come these your own people

01:02:45.119 --> 01:02:46.880
couldn't find this one clip if it was so

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.160
easy to find and just

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:51.440
take a few minutes um they may have

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.000
i knew it was there i don't know i

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.520
forgot it was there i had enough [ __ ]

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.599
out there that was just like

01:02:57.599 --> 01:03:00.960
yeah well for a decade or 12 years

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.520
if you can just go back and take any

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:04.720
quote from a podcast

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.720
yeah right i'd be like yo i got no shots

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.559
you just assumed the road trip

01:03:08.559 --> 01:03:11.200
oh we well if you put anything in the

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:11.839
context

01:03:11.839 --> 01:03:14.160
you need to destroy somebody it doesn't

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.799
take it out of the context yeah yeah

01:03:16.799 --> 01:03:18.799
but there was also too much for me to

01:03:18.799 --> 01:03:19.839
delete

01:03:19.839 --> 01:03:23.760
or hide i'd done enough shows

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.359
there's too much dude there's too much

01:03:25.359 --> 01:03:26.960
crime like a pyramid

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.640
part was there were parts all over the

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:30.160
pyramids you ran a pyramid scheme of

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.599
offensive [ __ ] you're like yeah it was

01:03:31.599 --> 01:03:33.200
there's too many side covers of ponzi

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.839
scheme dude

01:03:36.799 --> 01:03:39.520
you're like sorry everyone ever yeah

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.200
there's any files to burn let's just see

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.240
if it works out

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.319
but that's what's so odd [ __ ] all right

01:03:44.319 --> 01:03:46.799
you guys want to hire me

01:03:46.799 --> 01:03:48.559
yeah this would be sweet it's just so

01:03:48.559 --> 01:03:50.480
odd to me that everybody's guilty of

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:51.680
something like that where

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:53.440
we're all guilty of insensitivity

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:54.880
especially if you're a comic we've all

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:55.839
said [ __ ] that

01:03:55.839 --> 01:03:57.440
i don't even say that we regret we've

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.359
all said it in the context of comedy

01:03:59.359 --> 01:04:00.160
folks yeah

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:03.440
so why i just don't understand why

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.599
take each other down this whole idea of

01:04:05.599 --> 01:04:07.280
comics taking each other down

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.960
or as you called it earlier this like

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.559
dramedy [ __ ]

01:04:10.559 --> 01:04:13.359
i just don't i don't understand it today

01:04:13.359 --> 01:04:15.280
i cannot wrap my head around business

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.280
the people that are canceling are

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.400
non-factors

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.119
in in the business the pariah [ __ ]

01:04:21.119 --> 01:04:22.079
mentality that

01:04:22.079 --> 01:04:23.359
you're gonna take down someone that's

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:25.839
successful from afar and you're not even

01:04:25.839 --> 01:04:28.079
gonna benefit you other than clicks

01:04:28.079 --> 01:04:30.160
that's [ __ ] insane yeah it's pretty

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:32.079
weird that's an insane mentality that

01:04:32.079 --> 01:04:33.440
would happen in no other industry well

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:33.760
just

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.599
even when i heard he had it i'm like oh

01:04:35.599 --> 01:04:37.839
yeah he was in montreal like i was happy

01:04:37.839 --> 01:04:38.880
i know him

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.039
the idea that your first thought would

01:04:41.039 --> 01:04:43.200
be well i have to destroy this person

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.880
yeah it just shows that you're a piece

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:45.119
of

01:04:45.119 --> 01:04:46.880
[ __ ] dude like there's no connective

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:48.880
tissue the only thing is he had

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.640
something you wanted

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.160
yeah i i guess it just he picked me off

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.160
and i yelled about it on this program i

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.119
appreciate it i

01:04:57.119 --> 01:04:58.880
seriously mean it though i appreciate it

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.079
yeah and i always you know i love

01:05:00.079 --> 01:05:01.839
compound i was never trying to distance

01:05:01.839 --> 01:05:03.200
myself at all from this beautiful

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:03.760
network

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.920
you don't have to lie no i'm joking i

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.559
understand i'm trying to distance

01:05:08.559 --> 01:05:11.440
myself from a place like this ever once

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.200
i would never do something like that

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.680
right now

01:05:17.839 --> 01:05:20.640
no i love it [ __ ] i'm back they canceled

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.400
me god damn it

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:24.960
he's trying to get out of this back here

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:28.400
[Laughter]

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.839
he's doing it again he's trying to

01:05:29.839 --> 01:05:32.160
backpedal

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:35.119
so when you how did you know you got

01:05:35.119 --> 01:05:36.240
this video

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.960
hey somebody go over there and open the

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:39.520
door

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:42.720
in there god damn it chad

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.480
it's your manager do not say another

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:46.799
word you guys kick down this hear that

01:05:46.799 --> 01:05:50.960
we still got a chance i'm listening to

01:05:55.130 --> 01:06:00.670
[Laughter]

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.200
think what gets scary is when you think

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.200
about all the things you might have ever

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.880
said oh my god

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:10.240
on these things and then you're like

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.720
damn if they bring that one up

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:13.920
because then you start playing back in

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.440
your head like all the like it's like

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:18.559
dude you thought me saying [ __ ] was bad

01:06:18.559 --> 01:06:22.799
oh boy like there's

01:06:22.799 --> 01:06:24.720
i'll be in trouble oh they pulled out

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:27.039
this clip anthony i did and put it on

01:06:27.039 --> 01:06:28.640
and darren crowder tweeted it saying how

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.319
hilarious it was it was just us talking

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:32.079
about tom selleck doing the

01:06:32.079 --> 01:06:34.640
[ __ ] reverse mortgages and like yeah

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:35.680
we say the word

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:37.760
like black woman punching a guy in the

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.680
face an old folks home because that's

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:42.079
the video you see yeah you know it but

01:06:42.079 --> 01:06:43.359
that could easily be taken out of

01:06:43.359 --> 01:06:45.280
context and piss people off but at this

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.000
point

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.839
i think i just have to stand by the fact

01:06:47.839 --> 01:06:49.440
that you're joking

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:51.280
if there's anything that comes out of

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.640
this that seems real

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:54.960
yeah if you're if you're a comic it's a

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:57.440
[ __ ] joke unless you say something

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.520
so deliberate it's what i thought was so

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.200
odd about yours is i figured they could

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.359
at least defend the context

01:07:03.359 --> 01:07:06.799
yeah i think yeah

01:07:06.799 --> 01:07:09.839
i think they i think i i think lorne did

01:07:09.839 --> 01:07:11.200
too like i think lauren michaels was

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.319
like

there's literally nobody's upset from

01:09:12.159 --> 01:09:13.920
this and that's what

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.279
that's the most frustrating thing is

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:16.960
it's just a bunch of people

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.679
telling you you hurt people and no one

01:09:19.679 --> 01:09:21.120
hurt

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.440
that's what it is it's it's [ __ ] you

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.040
know a hundred people on twitter being

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:36.400

something's drawing them in we're

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.560
awfully big buildings you ever

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:28.560
just notice it now when you see them in

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.640
shows you're like they really aren't

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.560
they're like two big targets you just

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.080

i got a little older i did a little more

01:12:54.159 --> 01:12:55.679
reading the whole thing was rigged with

01:12:55.679 --> 01:12:57.040
dynamite it makes sense i mean if you

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.480
hit a building with a plane it's not

01:12:58.480 --> 01:12:59.199

01:13:01.679 --> 01:13:03.120
tough one to defend though

what you said

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:25.199
this really isn't helping me say sorry

01:30:25.199 --> 01:30:27.760
to me now

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.880
yeah never never ran into anybody in

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:32.400
person that was like

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:34.080
that was [ __ ] up but didn't that [ __ ]

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.679
with your head a bit i mean in all

01:30:35.679 --> 01:30:36.400
honesty

01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:37.679
it [ __ ] me up when i was doing

01:30:37.679 --> 01:30:39.600
stand-up afterwards which i did right

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:40.480
away

01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:42.719
like i didn't stop doing stand-up so

01:30:42.719 --> 01:30:44.960
like i would go do shows and be like

01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:46.639
i'd get on stage and i'd see people

01:30:46.639 --> 01:30:48.480
start to like a couple people would

01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:49.920
start to whisper

01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:51.280
like ah they didn't know how did you

01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:53.199
guys not know did you think it was a

01:30:53.199 --> 01:30:55.679
bitty or paranoia at first yeah sure

01:30:55.679 --> 01:30:57.199
yeah and then you realize

01:30:57.199 --> 01:31:00.080
first off half the half the people in a

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:02.000
comedy club don't know

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.480
that story or who i am because like you

01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:06.400
said there was one picture of me

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:10.719
so you know no one remembers and then

01:31:10.719 --> 01:31:12.239
yeah you can't like i would dwell on it

01:31:12.239 --> 01:31:15.199
kind of yeah on stage

01:31:15.199 --> 01:31:16.800
everywhere though i mean it was in every

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:18.560
[ __ ] article every

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:20.320
my favorite one most also what's funny

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:22.960
about i got cancelled and i was poor

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:25.840
i was the first one to do that really so

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:26.800
i was still like

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:29.520
taking the subway i was taking the

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:30.000
subway

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.120
from 30 rock back to my queen's smoking

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.000
closet

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.159
after getting fired and then i i

01:31:36.159 --> 01:31:38.400
remember i was on the subway and i saw a

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.880
dude like look at me like

01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:42.639
is that that [ __ ] guy then i watched

01:31:42.639 --> 01:31:44.639
him look at his phone and google me

01:31:44.639 --> 01:31:48.000
and then he looks back up and i was like

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:52.239
getting canceled and having to use

01:31:52.239 --> 01:31:54.239
public transportation

01:31:54.239 --> 01:31:56.800
sucks tough one yeah it's just i guess

01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:58.400
it's so odd to me because when you see

01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:00.159
what everybody's canceled for and some

01:32:00.159 --> 01:32:01.600
of the things people were canceled for

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:02.719
that they got away with because they're

01:32:02.719 --> 01:32:04.239
connected enough

01:32:04.239 --> 01:32:08.000
um yours is something that i guess just

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.120
never made sense

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:11.120
i guess it was because you were new to

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:13.120
it yeah and it couldn't be

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:15.120
everybody could prove that i was funny

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:16.159
yeah like you weren't

01:32:16.159 --> 01:32:18.480
in the spotlight yet which is a shitty

01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:20.320
place to be

01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:23.520
when you have something land on you yeah

01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:24.800
yeah if you have an album out or

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:26.400
something even something like something

01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:27.120
simple

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:28.880
actually what he does i'm actually funny

01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.480
but no they couldn't nobody

01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:32.239

going to go wet yeah what is that

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:41.920
yeah that smells the only thing you can

01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:43.679
tell a lay person

01:32:43.679 --> 01:32:46.480
you do that doesn't know comedy where

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:48.080
you're like no i do uh

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:50.719

even if they asked yeah i'm not sure

01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:10.560
i'm not sure if any of those do they do

01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:12.239
stand up on those things

01:33:12.239 --> 01:33:14.400
yeah still i think yeah you can find

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:15.440
some good stuff

01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:20.239
on fallon yeah there's some real killers

01:33:20.239 --> 01:33:21.679
[ __ ] killer sets walk through the

01:33:21.679 --> 01:33:24.400
door yeah i've seen a lot of really good

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:26.400
women give uh

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:29.120
give that crowd the business really on

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:29.440
some

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:32.880
actually ian laura did it you know ian

he's funny he's from here he's a new

01:33:34.639 --> 01:33:36.719
york guy chad daniels is killer

01:33:36.719 --> 01:33:38.480
whenever he does late night he's funny

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:39.600
he's [ __ ] fantastic yeah obviously

01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:40.000
there's

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.120
yeah there's a bunch of people that do

01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.719
it that are great yeah that's why the

01:33:42.719 --> 01:33:44.560
turret will slip through

01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:48.159
but conan it's tough to it's tough to

01:33:48.159 --> 01:33:49.840
i'm sure it's i've never done it but i'm

01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:51.520
sure monologues [ __ ] they're a

01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:52.719
late night so it's got to be very

01:33:52.719 --> 01:33:55.040
difficult yes you guys stand there

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:56.960
there's no mic

01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:59.040
even five minutes it's been changed for

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:00.239
you on a regular

01:34:00.239 --> 01:34:03.520
show is tough that's what's odd to me

01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:04.000
though

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.320
is like with with that you have

01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:07.840
monologue material that's never been

01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:08.400
tested

01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:11.040
yeah and then you have uh whatever game

01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:12.960
they play that's never been tested

01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:16.480
or desk bit then you have the interviews

01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:18.400
that have not been tested yeah and then

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:19.920
you have the comic who's done his

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:22.320
material a million times that has been

01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:24.080
tested in every audience

01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:25.600
and that's the thing they [ __ ] with to

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:27.520
put you on tv yeah

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:29.280
it's such a bizarre now you have to

01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:30.639
enter all your uh

01:34:30.639 --> 01:34:32.400
word for word every joke so they can

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:34.560
move it no they'll

01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:36.400
they'll switch everything around yeah

01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:38.560
jesus christ because that's how i got

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:41.119
conan and then i didn't get conan

01:34:41.119 --> 01:34:43.360
because of

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:45.600
basically asking why are you being a

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:46.639
dick

01:34:46.639 --> 01:34:49.199
oh really really well it six months went

01:34:49.199 --> 01:34:50.639
by and everybody's like well yeah it's

01:34:50.639 --> 01:34:51.840
usually how long it takes

01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:55.440
i'm like why i'm like that's absurd i

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:57.679
i've i i'm going out i'm changing the

01:34:57.679 --> 01:34:59.280
set to the exact thing it should be

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:03.280
i got approved and then i just wait

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:04.800
and then he said we don't have to do

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:06.400
this if you don't want like he got kind

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:07.040
of

01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:10.320
shitty with me and i

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:12.880
got shitty back i mean i regret it it's

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:13.520
kinda

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:15.600
but at the same time i was just saying

01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:17.199
it would have been cool to do but

01:35:17.199 --> 01:35:19.520
i also don't how long ago was that years

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:21.760
ago uh maybe back then it mattered

01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:22.960
i don't even think then it really

01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:24.960
doesn't matter that much anymore no i

01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:25.760
have

01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:28.080
a lot of middles some that is somebody

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:29.520
that has never done it

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:32.000
something they would say yeah that's why

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:32.639
if i me

01:35:32.639 --> 01:35:34.480
never having done it being like doesn't

01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:35.920
even matter

01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:38.159
people just assume i've done it and i'm

01:35:38.159 --> 01:35:39.199
like no i never

01:35:39.199 --> 01:35:41.199
i like i got it i got the tonight show

01:35:41.199 --> 01:35:42.960
and then they canceled the booker

01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:44.719
and then eddie brill was gonna book man

01:35:44.719 --> 01:35:46.480
letterman and he got fired

01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:47.760
i remember like he was talking about

01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:49.520
that on this show early

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:51.280
early on like 10 years ago probably and

01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:52.719
he was like it doesn't matter if we get

01:35:52.719 --> 01:35:53.199
a

01:35:53.199 --> 01:35:54.880
if we get a comic that has like five

01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:56.239
late night sets they're still not going

01:35:56.239 --> 01:35:57.679
to sell a ticket unless it just

01:35:57.679 --> 01:36:00.560
it matters to you it validates your hard

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:00.960
work

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:02.800
like and and i think it's just a cool

01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.639
video and yeah like to think it's

01:36:04.639 --> 01:36:06.080
worthless is not true

01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:08.639
right but but i think it's more an ego

01:36:08.639 --> 01:36:10.000
boost to yourself then

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.480
uh i don't what does sell tickets now

01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:14.239
right i can't uh

01:36:14.239 --> 01:36:17.440
being famous online yeah

01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:20.719
being like youtube and podcasting

01:36:20.719 --> 01:36:23.040
yes yeah yeah i would say andrew schultz

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:25.520
is a guy who took it into his own hands

01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:26.000
and

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
became wildly successful because the

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.360
industry wasn't giving him what he

01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:30.320
wanted

01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:32.400
i'm sure you're selling tickets based on

01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:34.159
the fact that all these people sided

01:36:34.159 --> 01:36:36.159
with you yeah it's nice to sell tickets

01:36:36.159 --> 01:36:37.520
to half

01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:39.119
audiences right now be like yeah all

01:36:39.119 --> 01:36:40.800
four sold out in rhode island

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:43.360
yeah yeah crazy crazy i'm a draw in

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:44.239
providence

01:36:44.239 --> 01:36:46.480
i'm just like there's uh 60 tickets a

01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:47.920
night

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:49.520
so we should cancel the late show and

01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:52.639
put them on the first one

01:36:52.639 --> 01:36:55.119
god damn i'm dude i think the minnesota

01:36:55.119 --> 01:36:56.960
one's in the mall of america

01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:59.360
that one's crazy have you been in it no

01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:00.239
it's [ __ ]

01:37:00.239 --> 01:37:03.920
huge it's huge man

01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:06.719
yeah but it was one of those where i i

01:37:06.719 --> 01:37:08.000
was playing the other club in town

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.199
hanging with the other comic

01:37:09.199 --> 01:37:11.600
this is years ago and i walked in and

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:13.600
patrice was headlining

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:16.480
and it was like she wasn't even full at

01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:17.119
all

01:37:17.119 --> 01:37:19.440
and it was just because it's so [ __ ]

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:20.880
big it's like the comedy castle in

01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:23.679
detroit it's like can you sell 350 seats

01:37:23.679 --> 01:37:26.000
because they just pull the half curtain

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.199
so it at least still

01:37:27.199 --> 01:37:30.000
feels full but if you can get that draw

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.360
they'll open it up

01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:33.199
but it's very hard to sell three hard

01:37:33.199 --> 01:37:34.880
lines curtain does that like

01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:36.719
a bit like that yeah a bit like that but

01:37:36.719 --> 01:37:38.480
yeah it's 350 seats and it's also

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:40.320
cavernous which is also how the mall of

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:41.760
america one is yeah that's how my

01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.119
goobies kind of is though

01:37:43.119 --> 01:37:45.119
goobies yeah if you don't if you don't

01:37:45.119 --> 01:37:46.719
sell well at mcgoobies that's a tough

01:37:46.719 --> 01:37:48.480
it feels a bit like it it can be yeah

01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:50.320
because that the ceiling is [ __ ]

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:52.159

01:37:52.159 --> 01:37:54.400

01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:36.080
when i was featuring i would be

01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:37.920
inappropriate as a feature

01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:41.119
i guess you mean good

01:39:41.119 --> 01:39:42.719

01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:40.960
consistent theme for all comics you want

people fall regular people fall is

01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:29.280
better than any stand-up you'll ever see

and especially you never see two worlds

01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:33.040
collide like that just seeing a comic

01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:34.719

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.280
complaining about having to leave

01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:38.880

01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:40.239
beer yeah

01:53:40.239 --> 01:53:41.679
yeah it's very annoying to listen to the

01:53:41.679 --> 01:53:43.840
audience demand their money back for

01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:45.040
that

01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:48.400

idea what they just witnessed harshly

01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:56.159
i'd have the heart to realize that

01:53:56.159 --> 01:53:57.760
maybe i shouldn't ask for my money back

01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:00.320

01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:46.159
and then he does the worst they go crazy

01:56:46.159 --> 01:56:47.360
for him by the way they couldn't be

01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:48.400
happier

01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:52.000
he then does the worst set i have ever

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.119
seen

01:56:53.119 --> 01:56:55.920
by any level of a professional comedian

01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:56.400
yeah

01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:58.320
what he does is he takes his cocktail

01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:01.520
sword and he's pretending to swashbuckle

01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:04.480
ghosts he's like i was in the army and

01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:05.679
we go up against

01:57:05.679 --> 01:57:08.119
a haunted army and then he starts like

01:57:08.119 --> 01:57:09.280
swashbuckling

01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:10.639
like a kid would do with a kitty

01:57:10.639 --> 01:57:13.040
cocktail well he was new at stand up

01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:15.119
he was right he should have known he's

01:57:15.119 --> 01:57:16.719
gotten into it and then said yeah

01:57:16.719 --> 01:57:18.880
yeah yeah he should have known better

01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:21.040
though and uh

01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:23.119
and they [ __ ] hit that year two

01:57:23.119 --> 01:57:24.159
n-word stage that

01:57:24.159 --> 01:57:26.560
all comics yeah we all yeah when you

01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:27.440
tell people that

01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:29.119
they should have a pitchfork in their

01:57:29.119 --> 01:57:31.360
ass oh

01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:33.599
and uh he oh my god he then proceeds to

01:57:33.599 --> 01:57:34.719
eat [ __ ] so bad

01:57:34.719 --> 01:57:37.760
he barely gets an applause i run up to

01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:39.360
shake his hand again

01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:40.880
and then he kind of like taps my

01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:42.719
shoulder and like walks off and i was

01:57:42.719 --> 01:57:43.360
like

01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:45.840
wasn't that great everybody aren't we

01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:47.360
all happy we got to see mrs

01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:49.280

01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:50.880
went on and [ __ ] killed

01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:54.000
so it was just fun to watch him yeah

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.199
and then a week later i uh no well it

01:57:57.199 --> 01:57:59.280
was like a week maybe two weeks later

01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:01.360
i turn on the tv at the laugh factory

01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:02.719
and there's old michael richards

01:58:02.719 --> 01:58:04.159
screaming the n-word

01:58:04.159 --> 01:58:06.480
so he transitioned from swashbuckling

01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:07.920
it's your favorite race

01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:10.639
because you shook his hand dude i hope i

01:58:10.639 --> 01:58:11.280
caused it

01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:14.639
yeah dude he's [ __ ] worst person

01:58:14.639 --> 01:58:16.800
and then jeff garland has a great story

01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:18.320
about dex he said uh

01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:19.920
michael richards walks back he's like

do you know what you've done yeah dude

01:58:25.119 --> 01:58:26.719
that's a warped sense of reality when

01:58:26.719 --> 01:58:28.239
you're so successful like this yeah he's

01:58:28.239 --> 01:58:29.360
a famous he doesn't know

01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:30.960
he was famous and never did stand up

01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:33.440
also he got he got [ __ ] with flip

phones back then

01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:35.920
oh yeah that was like the first camera

01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:37.920
video that might have been the first

01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:38.560
video

01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:40.639
yeah i think yeah it was early in camera

01:58:40.639 --> 01:58:42.960
from dave what was the first video

01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:44.800

01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:05.199
i've heard it all changed i was young

01:59:05.199 --> 01:59:07.440
and i was like sad about it

01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:09.280
about losing him i was like kramer was

01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:10.960
the only guy i liked on that show when i

01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:12.080
was younger

01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:15.679
and then yeah and then

01:59:15.679 --> 01:59:17.920
you know i didn't understand that's the

01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:19.520
funnest part about doing like

01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:21.280
being like a host and feature clubs like

01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:23.520
locally like you start to meet all these

01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:25.199
there's known celebrities and actors and

01:59:25.199 --> 01:59:26.239
you're just like oh they're just a

01:59:26.239 --> 01:59:27.280
regular [ __ ] they're

01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:29.440
they most of them stink whether it's not

01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:30.480
on stage but like

01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:32.800
as people and then there was this one

01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:34.480
dude i forgot i can't even say his name

01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:35.199
but like

01:59:35.199 --> 01:59:37.360
he bombed so hard all week he just drank

01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:38.560
whiskey and like i don't know if i could

01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:39.920
do this anymore tom

01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:42.000
and then i was like dude you're great he

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:43.840
and then he was in a [ __ ] blockbuster

01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:44.719
movie like

01:59:44.719 --> 01:59:46.560
two months later like that's how they

01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:47.760
think because they want to be that

01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:48.480
character

01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:50.159
actor and then they go on stage and do

01:59:50.159 --> 01:59:51.679
stand-up they're like i don't know if i

01:59:51.679 --> 01:59:53.199
have it in me to continue

01:59:53.199 --> 01:59:55.679
i find the great ones are usually good

01:59:55.679 --> 01:59:56.639
people though yeah

01:59:56.639 --> 01:59:59.360
rarely sure that amazing stand-up comics

01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:00.080

02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:02.719
you know like outside like richard lewis

02:00:02.719 --> 02:00:04.000
asking the host to pick him up at his

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:04.480
hotel

02:00:10.239 --> 02:00:10.960
