00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.719
emotion

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:51.840
i think when i was growing up and maybe

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.120
it's the same because we're around the

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.920
same age you needed kids you needed kids

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.120
because you would drink and do drugs

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.879
until you were about 30 or you were

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.719
tired of it and you were like you know

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.640
what let's have kids now it's time to

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.640
settle down and have kids

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.159
but now you don't need kids because

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.320
there's the internet

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.320
and i'll be the one to say it the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.360
internet is better than kids

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.280
i used to teach kids all my friends have

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.720
kids i'm not impressed with kids

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.920

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.600

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.360
little boy just took his first steps you

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.119

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.159
he's amazing

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.079
he walks out of the sea probably better

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.159

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.479
on the bonfire the whole peyronie's ad

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:43.759

gay humor and all the [ __ ] that we do so

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.720
fantastically funny and i think it's i

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.400
think it's not that you don't work hard

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.120
but uh naturally funny very organic

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.440
funny and funny yeah so we're happy to

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.880
have him on the podcast how are you

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.479
buddy i'm i'm excited to be here and

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.240
you're right i do it was easy to slide

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.160
right in because i hate gay people and

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.840
that was pretty much the talk barbecue

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.880
it was like

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.560
how shitty are gay people it's like they

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.960
suck yeah wow those are like one of us i

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.160
don't think you're catching the tone of

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.919
this i think it was

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.000
we're all so tolerant and we celebrated

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.280
yeah this is it we're tolerant you're

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.880
doing the opposite of celebrating the

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.840
gays we're bi what is it non-binary

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.759
we're gender fluid would you guys seem

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.840
very binary we're better no no we're

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.919
non-binary no i'll touch it i'll touch

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.840
mike's penis right now wait i'm gonna

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.840
spill my water don't touch my you would

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.000
touch his penis as a joke

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.520
because actually you guys think being

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.520
gay is funny right right which is sick

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.199
because being gay is a joke and it's

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.479
funny

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.320
shane's going hard he's going on you're

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.680

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.080
podcast your thoughts on that where you

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.960

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.639

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.160
and poor but i spent so much time making

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.000
fun of people that dress nice and cared

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.840
about themselves yeah that now that i

on the planet how is this happening oh

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.240
because of the cocaine we do at the

00:15:12.639 --> 00:15:14.160
elfreth's alley let me tell you

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.120
something when you have a little lisp

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.199
when you talk i get you're no there's a

00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:19.120
th hey why don't you slow down dude i

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.160
know but he's

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.760
been we just met and things are going

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.399
well try to short guy me tall guy me

00:15:24.399 --> 00:15:25.519
i think that's and this is going to be

00:15:25.519 --> 00:15:26.880
very disrespectful

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.800
yo what up shout out to the show but uh

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.000
i think that's why you and me have such

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.199
awkward hugs because of the heights

00:15:37.199 --> 00:15:38.959
yeah it's like i hug you and your head

00:15:38.959 --> 00:15:40.720
goes straight yeah because you inferred

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.079
that it's because i'm emotionally

00:15:42.079 --> 00:15:43.199
stunted

00:15:43.199 --> 00:15:44.560
in some way because i'm not my father

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.000
was it's because you're physically

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.320
stunted can i get a horn on that [ __ ]

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.880
say because i'm

00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:54.160
continue i was physically stunted i was

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.000
physically stunted no i come in for the

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.160
hugs and you're right it is weird but

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.680
it's weird because of a physical thing

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.600
that i can't control by the way so it's

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.720
like you're making fun of me for

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.000
something i can't control i'm already

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.839
sensitive about it right and you know

00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:07.680
that i didn't know that you try to push

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.160
me down even more no you're too low

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.639
already i want to push you you know i'm

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:14.480
low as well but i embrace it like i like

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.240
when a guy like shane cause i want to

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.839
just cuz he up in between these like

00:16:17.839 --> 00:16:19.360
tits yeah i get in there i'm like i

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.199
don't i love it like when dan soda gives

00:16:21.199 --> 00:16:23.440
me i'm like ah my big bear friends yeah

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.440
but i think it's because and this is no

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.199
disrespect

00:16:27.199 --> 00:16:29.279
to you i mean that was a great there's

00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:31.360
no disrespect to you justin i think you

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.279
have enough

00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:34.560
one more time let's get that timing

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.560
right podcast one more time justin this

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.079
is of no disrespect to you

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.959
that's great fantastic that's fantastic

00:16:42.959 --> 00:16:44.639
but but you have a lot of other things

00:16:44.639 --> 00:16:46.800
going on beside your height sure now you

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.639
have a lot of other distractions i

00:16:48.639 --> 00:16:50.480
didn't want to i didn't say problems you

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.079
said problems i'm not going after you in

00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:53.120
that respect the way they change them

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.279
after me i'm not going to go after you i

00:16:55.279 --> 00:16:56.720
consider it a friend we don't attack on

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.000
this side of this i consider it a

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.279
friendship i consider a friend but you

00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:01.360
have a lot of ancillary things that are

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.880
kind of going on in your life so the

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.559

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:33.080
these podcasts

they're table with all their assortments

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.600
of gums

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.440
i'd like to address what you just said

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.440
okay what you just said it sounded

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.480
you're very you're a professional

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.000
comedian so you put that together very

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.760
nicely beautifully but it's really a

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.919
series of coincidences i do the bear

00:24:55.919 --> 00:24:57.840
crawl workout to work my core with the

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.679
sun i just grabbed yours in a very

00:24:59.679 --> 00:25:02.240
non-threatening non-homosexual way yeah

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.640
but i do bear calls to strengthen my

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.039
core i got a thing which your

00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:09.760
friend tommy pope our friend tommy pope

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.279
your roommate does he goes to the

00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:12.720
crossfit across the street i do the

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.279
crossfit in my apartment and if there

00:25:15.279 --> 00:25:17.760
happens to be a gigantic painting of me

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.679
as i'm doing that then that's the way

00:25:19.679 --> 00:25:21.200
that which i would commend you for doing

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.960
crossfit at home by yourself because

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.360
it's less douchey but when you're doing

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.000
it in an abandoned apartment with a

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
painting of yourself on the wall

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
that's like [ __ ] psychotic you know

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.520
what let me let's it's actually

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.120
terrifying behavior let's think when you

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.559
really think about it which is more

00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:38.960
douchey shannon doing doing crossfit at

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.360
a crossfit at a crossfit

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.679
or doing crossfit in your apartment

00:25:43.679 --> 00:25:45.279
alone in front of a painting of yourself

00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:47.760
which is weirder a weirder douchey is

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.600
different okay well let's get both in in

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.159
the crossfit is douchey

00:25:52.159 --> 00:25:53.840
in the house with in front of the

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.520
painting it's a little non-ironic

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.039
painting by the way

00:25:57.039 --> 00:25:58.559
it's not like it's this is a funny thing

00:25:58.559 --> 00:26:00.000
where he's like napoleon or something

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.919
like on a horse this is a genuine no no

00:26:01.919 --> 00:26:04.000
no no it's portrait serious it's a very

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.600
serious pain he's looking like serious

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.279
people i know the painting yeah can i

00:26:07.279 --> 00:26:08.960
have the painting i don't want to give

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.559
you the painting i love the paint how

00:26:10.559 --> 00:26:12.080
much would you say that painting's worth

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.480
it's [ __ ] worth a lot negative 20.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.840
no the painting is going to be worth you

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.240
pay someone to get rid of that

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.679
can we get the horn on some of these can

00:26:19.679 --> 00:26:21.039
i say something

00:26:21.039 --> 00:26:22.480
the painting is not worth nothing

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.159
because you could always take the canvas

00:26:24.159 --> 00:26:25.600
and paint over it and then you have the

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.039
value of the canvas so it's at least

00:26:27.039 --> 00:26:28.320
worthwhile would you like to stop

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.600

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.360
the painting why would you have the

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.559
pictures what if people came over they

00:26:50.559 --> 00:26:51.760
were like who's that i'm like that's a

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.440
that's a painting of mike vecchio that's

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.200
not weird then i'll do crossfit in front

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.240
of it

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.080

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.600
just point to the painting i sit and i

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.520
ponder a lot i've seen people come over

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.440
yeah and i haven't seen you do that if

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.080
they ask me i don't just point it out i

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.840

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:10.799
very

00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:12.720
it's it's out it's huge it's pointing

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.559
itself out can i say something

00:27:14.559 --> 00:27:16.240
what if you and i made a painting of dan

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.000
in a row with this [ __ ] there's nothing

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.599
for you to be upset about

00:39:57.599 --> 00:39:58.960
i think you're full of [ __ ] and i think

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.160
shannon's not giving me any straight

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.839
answers which is rare because she's

00:40:01.839 --> 00:40:02.720
usually

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.680
um too tired to lie talk to shannon

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.839
shannon

00:40:07.839 --> 00:40:09.040
what's going on

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.720
i don't know i don't know what you're

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:12.400
really do you have some kind of like

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.319
extraneous relationship with justin that

00:40:14.319 --> 00:40:15.920
i don't know about look there are times

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.520
when when you and i talk on the phone

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.200
about the show and text aside from

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.520
justin there's times when justin and i

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.880
you know will talk or have a beer or

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.800
whatever i'm sick of being [ __ ] put

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.560
on the goddamn those occasions have been

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:27.920
very limited

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.079
we're usually on a group text but now

00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:32.240
i'm finding out actually let me see both

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.280
of your phones

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.920
100 no oh yeah because you have nothing

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:39.000
to hide

00:40:39.599 --> 00:40:40.960
i shouldn't have to do that i think you

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.800
should trust us mike oh should i trust

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.480
you were you guys making all these

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.240
ancillary jokes to each other do you

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.640
want oh yeah i don't know oh oh let me

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.000
sit there it's like i don't know it

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.720
can't it's not good for the lighting

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.240
so that you're in [ __ ] eye range look

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.000
at each other it's not good

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.839
eyes that you guys are making i sit here

00:40:57.839 --> 00:40:59.839
[ __ ] guys this is my seat this is my

00:40:59.839 --> 00:41:01.839
seat i sit here why is that because

00:41:01.839 --> 00:41:03.440
shannon arranged it that way let me ask

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.640
you something what do you not want

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.319
shannon to be happy i want shannon to be

00:41:06.319 --> 00:41:08.000
happy i don't know what you guys like me

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.400
comes in a [ __ ] stallion like shane

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.880
comes in and the dynamic of the podcast

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.400
is thrown off because you feel

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.000
threatened i didn't say i feel

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.359
threatened no you didn't say it i can

00:41:17.359 --> 00:41:19.440
see it yeah you know what you're reading

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.800
wait i'm not [ __ ] reading into

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.720
anything no i think i know what i know i

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:23.599
don't know

00:41:23.599 --> 00:41:25.280
what that glass is not protecting you

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.640
from the chemistry what would happen

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.000
that's right my chemistry goes through

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.920
the [ __ ] glass let me it's like a

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.680
diamond it cuts it's like a diamond it

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.119
cuts through there

00:41:33.119 --> 00:41:34.960
it's making sense now because shannon's

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.880
so instrumental in the shot caller it's

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:39.280
like she gets off by shocking you it's

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.920
the weirdest challenge

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:43.839
but that is [ __ ] true shannon you

00:41:43.839 --> 00:41:45.839
doing true not that you enjoy shocking i

00:41:45.839 --> 00:41:46.960
really want to make justin a better

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.040
person see that is that why really

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.800
because she wants a well-rounded man how

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.640
does that feel how does it feel see i

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.079
know something yeah i'm going rogue on

00:41:54.079 --> 00:41:55.839
the [ __ ] podcast i do what i do i

00:41:55.839 --> 00:41:57.440
spread my seed where i want to spread it

00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:00.400
you spread your seeds

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.000
shane spikes it in the [ __ ] hotel

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.680
room i spread it all over the goddamn

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.680
podcast shane is honest about a sexual

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:08.079
exploits he doesn't [ __ ]

00:42:08.079 --> 00:42:10.720
hook up with a podcast mate and then

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.960

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.640
hard how long is it gonna take me to run

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.319
through this tunnel you know what i

00:45:58.319 --> 00:46:00.720
don't this i didn't realize she's really

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.240
got it you gotta really you've got to

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:03.440
give her like the coordinates of the

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.040
whole thing yeah let's assume it's what

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.960
how many yards shane help us with this

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.640
how long is the time

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.640
to get to somebody

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:13.119
how is this like let's say oh 50 yards

00:46:13.119 --> 00:46:14.960
50 last time

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.480
50 yards that's a tough one i would say

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.160
20. i was going to go short well we're

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.920
going to stay like 10 yards all right so

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.040
let's split the difference in the middle

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.680
so it's let's say 20. it's 20 yards 20

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.079
yards i honestly don't know and this is

00:46:26.079 --> 00:46:28.160
a real life answer if i could physically

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.920
make myself do it

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.280
i don't think i can get through this so

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.640
all right but if you did run you would

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.480
go [ __ ] first

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.079
because the rocks

00:46:36.079 --> 00:46:37.760
i'm sorry guys all right

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.359
this one is from like

00:46:39.359 --> 00:46:40.839
talk to people like

00:46:40.839 --> 00:46:43.839
yeah all right mike uh justin you wonder

00:46:43.839 --> 00:46:46.480
why your hugs aren't authentic

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.480
mike justin got made on your podcast to

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:49.920
ingratiate himself to your italian

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.440
listeners would you consider getting bar

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.200
mitzvahed on the podcast to ingratiate

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.800
yourself to the jewish listeners that's

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.520
from rabbi rigatoni 34. yes i would

00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:59.200
actually even though

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.440
even though jews repulse me and i don't

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.839
care for the traditions i would do that

00:47:03.839 --> 00:47:04.960
i would actually if it's going to make

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.920
us a stronger more honest podcast

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.079
shannon it's gonna make us a stronger

00:47:10.079 --> 00:47:11.920
more unified honest podcast i would do

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:13.280

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:29.599
today's monday uh sometimes i have to

00:47:29.599 --> 00:47:31.200
laugh to break the tension there's no

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.200
tension i love i love having shane here

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:35.280

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:39.520
is going rogue this is going wrong

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:40.960
you're really going rogue a lot on this

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.559
episode what do you mean i think the

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:43.760
episode should be called going rope

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.040
maybe you and shannon should talk about

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:47.440
it on your own site mike i feel like

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:49.280
you're really pushing us away at this

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:52.880
point yeah because uh i'm not uh [ __ ]

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:55.359
big secrets guy

00:47:55.359 --> 00:47:57.680

00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:58.880
justin you have to shave your head

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.359
indefinitely or lose one of your feet

00:48:01.359 --> 00:48:04.480
choose that's from ultimate ultimatum

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.559
uh i would lose one of my feet

00:48:06.559 --> 00:48:09.119
are you serious 100 is that actually a

00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:10.960
serious answer look me right in the eyes

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:13.119
right now i am asking questions

00:48:13.119 --> 00:48:15.119
ask me the question gorgeous would you

00:48:15.119 --> 00:48:17.040
shave your head or lose a foot

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:20.240
but uh i can let me tell you why i have

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.480
no foot right i get one of those cool

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:23.520
like uh

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.599
those like ski looking feet that they

00:48:25.599 --> 00:48:26.960

there's no shoe for your head

00:48:33.599 --> 00:48:36.160
well a wig or a hat yeah i think a hat i

so you have a chance of losing your hair

00:48:43.119 --> 00:48:45.040
anyway and you would go with your foot

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.319
being cut off

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.680
be that i feel like like even like just

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:52.000
around the six range is sufficient all

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.720
right slow down jesus wow

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.000
it could be a little smaller a little

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.119
bigger

00:51:57.119 --> 00:51:58.880
could be a little smaller it could be

00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:00.559
it's okay why just put a tampon in and

00:52:00.559 --> 00:52:02.640

with it yes

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.079
that's a [ __ ] thing but especially if

00:52:12.079 --> 00:52:13.760
there's a lot of ancillary violence and

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:15.680
choking going on yeah a little smack

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:17.040

anymore no go ahead go ahead i really

00:56:42.559 --> 00:56:44.079
like womanhood you have contributed so

00:56:44.079 --> 00:56:45.520
much to american culture like britney

00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.599
spears sports illustrated swimsuit

00:56:47.599 --> 00:56:51.119
edition and vagina what do you think

00:56:51.119 --> 00:56:53.359
your contribution to america has been as

00:56:53.359 --> 00:56:55.920
a woman

00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.799
i feel like maybe just like my boobs i

00:56:58.799 --> 00:57:00.000
made them better i feel like it makes

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.680
everybody happier

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:03.599
see and you get upset with the about the

00:57:03.599 --> 00:57:05.040
boobs on the positive reward system and

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:06.400
that's your answer that was just when

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.240
jessica asked me specifically so when a

00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:09.760
woman comes in you lie but the truth is

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.280
that you feel comfortable with the boobs

00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:13.040
i'm just thinking that that's i think

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:15.760
overall makes people happy so when i

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.520
made that as your symbol that's what you

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:19.040
think is the center i would like if they

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:21.680
had maybe like a like a bikini top over

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:22.880
them or something okay so it's not the

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:24.400
boobs that upset you it's the way the

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.319
boobs are portrayed that's too vulgar

00:57:26.319 --> 00:57:27.920
wait do you have nice boobs you're gonna

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:30.160

my dick version of boobs really she

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:37.119
doesn't care for any of that politeness

00:57:37.119 --> 00:57:39.119
by the way yeah she doesn't care

00:57:39.119 --> 00:57:40.960
i was staring at your tits as soon as i

00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:42.240

shane i really love irish people you

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:53.839
have contributed so much to american

00:57:53.839 --> 00:57:55.760
culture like this person really is

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:58.160
unimaginative i really love irish people

00:57:58.160 --> 00:57:59.599
you have contributed so much to american

00:57:59.599 --> 00:58:02.160
culture like sunscreen u2 and belgium

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:04.079
and bar fighting what do you think your

00:58:04.079 --> 00:58:05.920
contribution to america has been as an

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:10.000
irish person me yeah yeah no

00:58:10.319 --> 00:58:12.319
i go to i go to notre dame games and i

00:58:12.319 --> 00:58:14.400
cheer for the fighting irish no [ __ ] you

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.319
know what i mean i support them how's it

00:58:16.319 --> 00:58:17.680
feel to lose every year and not end up

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.920
in a bowl 2-0 right now dude

00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:22.319
justin question to you yes i really love

00:58:22.319 --> 00:58:24.559
jewish people you've contributed so much

00:58:24.559 --> 00:58:26.960
to american culture like claritin b

00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:29.200
lawsuits and harvey weinstein

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:30.960
what do you think your contribution to

00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:33.359
america has been as a jewish person

00:58:33.359 --> 00:58:34.640
that's a very good question my

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:36.960
contribution is how unju-y i am so i

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.559
think i bridge the gap between like the

00:58:38.559 --> 00:58:40.000
jews and the rest of the people you're

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.119
helping your people you know what i'm

00:58:41.119 --> 00:58:43.200
saying by being otherwise we're stuck i

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:44.559

special little creature well this week

00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:47.280
was a tight tight race this was yeah i

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:49.119
gotta say

00:59:49.119 --> 00:59:50.960
um i'm i'm opting out of this one i

00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:52.400
don't think that i brought my a game on

00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.880
this episode um it's between you and

00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:57.280
shannon again like it was last week i

00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:00.160
don't know i think that um

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.640
i i have to you know i i would like to

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.119
give i like to nominate myself but i

01:00:05.119 --> 01:00:07.359
really think that um

01:00:07.359 --> 01:00:08.960
shannon had a great podcast i don't know

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.960
if it was the sexual attraction to shane

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.440
that motivated her but she was really on

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.720
her game

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.640
and so i nominate shannon for another i

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.640
mean it this is not about equality

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.799
obviously but uh i think shannon is

01:00:20.799 --> 01:00:23.599
kicking ass and uh how is the producer

01:00:23.599 --> 01:00:25.280
of the show getting the most she is

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.960
having she had a [ __ ] great episode

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.200
she's [ __ ] crushing it so well i

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.200
think it goes shannon all right shannon

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.760
she was so on point with the horns

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.319
and uh she ruffled chains feathers in

01:00:36.319 --> 01:00:37.760
here i mean i've never seen this guy

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.520
yeah he's all five inches are boning up

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:40.559
down there

01:00:40.559 --> 01:00:42.079
all four and a half inches are boning up

01:00:42.079 --> 01:00:43.680
down there you can't see it but you know

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.640

fast and funny he was even faster and

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.760
funnier because of the motivation of one

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.119
