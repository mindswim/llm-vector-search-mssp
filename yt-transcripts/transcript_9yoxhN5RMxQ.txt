00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:30.879
after the fact um so what we're going to

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:32.560

the screen so it doesn't have my arm

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.360
twice in one [ __ ] shot doing a weird

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.800
thing because my [ __ ] team would

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.880
obviously know to do that obviously but

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.240
i don't have to point that out because

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.839
it's just an obvious

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:47.760
[ __ ] thing

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.000

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.560
frame it to where i stare my shoulder

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.399
on bobby's side here and think louis is

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:56.240
being annoying but then bobby responded

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.880
with it's not possible not even like we

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.000
can't do that but it's not possible like

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.640
no one in the world could possibly frame

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.880

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.480
look at in order to shame it properly

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.800

first off lewis is there footage of this

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.919
game

00:17:41.919 --> 00:17:43.039

00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:44.640
have he said he has it we have

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.320
everything okay so i'll pull up the lies

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.559
that jay tells on the scr show the

00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:51.120
blatant lies that's my lewis's blood if

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.720
he beat you because i got to be honest

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.480
that is such

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.240
unuh there's no way unless he's not

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.440
gonna hit

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.880
he'd have to hit never let's say he's

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.080
hitting twos we'll call them ones and

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.240
twos god forbid i say everything's worth

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.200
a point

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.200
it's a wrap because he's shooting deep

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.280
[ __ ] wild uh three times right so

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.039
those are two points that's how he ended

00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:10.640
up winning the game the ten we played

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.480
because he hit three of those no he

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.679
actually hit one layup that was just

00:18:13.679 --> 00:18:15.120
like i literally thought he was gonna

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.640
bail on it too and he just [ __ ] like

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.080
shot because he went

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.919
around which was look at the cockiness

00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:21.520
on his [ __ ] face

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.720
it's making me he sucks so [ __ ] bad

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.540
at basketball look at his face

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:32.780
[Laughter]

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.679
this is my uh burning up with jim rome

00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:39.039

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.240
that is a real laid-back look

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.799
let me lay it out for you ralphie

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:54.240
i know ralph does nothing about sports

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.559
so i have to explain a lot here

00:18:56.559 --> 00:18:57.760
god just pull it back you don't really

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.039
see his face when he's explaining it

00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:00.490
it's that freeze for him

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:02.720
[Laughter]

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.799
really look at his face here watch play

00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:07.039
no way unless he's not gonna hit

00:19:07.039 --> 00:19:09.840
he'd have to hit that right

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.880
doing some light math

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.799
ralph to answer your question concisely

00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:16.200
i'm going to do a little head math here

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.480
[Laughter]

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.960
he's so confident he's so bad at

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.960
basketball

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.840
the game the 10 we played because he hit

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.679
three of those no he actually hit one

00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:29.200
layup that was just like i literally

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.480
thought he was going to bail on him i

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.520
really did

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.440
yeah yeah that's smarmy

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.160
that is smarmy smarmy [ __ ] cut face

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.760
indefensibly smarmy

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:40.960
look at all those drinks ralph's giving

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.200
me crap because he's shooting deep

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.200
[ __ ] wild uh three times right so

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.039
those are two points that's how he ended

00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:48.559
up winning the game the 10 we played

00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:50.480
because he hit three of those no he

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.600
actually hit one layup that was just

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.039
like i literally thought he was gonna

00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:54.640
bail on it too and he just [ __ ] like

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.320
shot because he won the second round

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.799
which was you were playing one 64. i

00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:00.640
made four i made four uh i made four

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.240
shots and he

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.400
hit three uh

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.960
three wild like deep ones

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.480
and uh and look they're all hitting

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.320
backboard or whatever it's all over the

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.240
place is that what i want to swish or

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.120
something

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.200
is that going to be your big thing no it

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:15.919
i

00:20:15.919 --> 00:20:18.080
keep on going i beat you game 211 but i

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.080
think the first thing i will do for sure

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.600
because i did it for six days earlier

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.000
this month is uh stop smoking that week

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.520
for sure at least that week he has to

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.440
make major lifestyle changes in order to

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.360
beat me in basketball no i got to go

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.679
practice two times good

00:20:31.679 --> 00:20:33.840
and [ __ ] yeah good by the way while

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.679
mine's gonna be endurance well mine is

00:20:35.679 --> 00:20:36.799
there's everything for your thing but if

00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:38.000
i just stop smoking that week and

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.240
literally go out two times

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.919
boom by myself consistently and shoot

00:20:41.919 --> 00:20:43.360
around just like run around and just

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.559
shut the lights

00:20:44.559 --> 00:20:45.679
out yeah

00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:47.600
i'll get it it'll be fine i'll tell you

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.480
that's the other thing i would have

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.559
again it was going to ask you to me

00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:52.240
it looked like you weren't you hadn't

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.600
played in a while am i right with that

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.360
as such not since we played at uh

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.320
scratch

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.520
like i'm surprised you didn't at least

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.000
go out once but i should have it's time

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.840
we literally made the bet on monday and

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.440
thursday morning we played and it's

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.440
funny soda special was that we ryan

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.039
showed up late uh you know brian was one

00:21:07.039 --> 00:21:08.240
of the producers here he showed up like

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.679
10 minutes late he's like when is this

00:21:09.679 --> 00:21:10.960
getting started like no it's over ready

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.559
it's a three minute video it's it's over

00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:14.720
super quick and by the way and lewis

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.240
said this yesterday we talked on the

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.320
phone before the thing happened which

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.159
was funny to say that uh

00:21:20.159 --> 00:21:21.840
we both acknowledge i go the only way

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.679
this is truly funny

00:21:23.679 --> 00:21:26.720
is somebody pauses to get this prepared

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.320
someone pointed out laney looking like

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.120
uh

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.080
the witch from american horror story

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.840
and dude if you bring those up side by

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.000
side it is hilarious

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.679
when lainey's wearing when he's wearing

00:21:37.679 --> 00:21:39.520
her crazy glasses and how does big j

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.390
look like the bully from hocus pocus

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:45.529
[Music]

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.679
where people start going like oh dude

00:21:47.679 --> 00:21:50.960
this might happen jay might score 19 or

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.559
one nothing yeah and so it was the

00:21:52.559 --> 00:21:53.760
funniest thing i understood that from

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.360
the get-go i still hate it i do hate

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.280
losing they're absolutely and also

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.720
i didn't want to [ __ ] just bail on it

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.720
but i was just like dude i'm literally

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.400
done like i'm i'm defeated because i

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.840
lost the game in general

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.000
what's the lie we're just watching the

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.919
sdr the lie is that i just we're just

00:22:13.919 --> 00:22:15.760
watching the sdr show and no one wants

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.559
to do that the lie is that you said

00:22:18.559 --> 00:22:20.559
you said you landed more shots than me

00:22:20.559 --> 00:22:22.400
and i banked three because i i won

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.240

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.240
getting serious he turned his hat around

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.480
backwards there he goes

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.080

look my own rebound and then boom

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.279

no it's that's lewis's first layer no no

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.640
but he i remember another layup in the

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.840
game he does from the side

00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:33.039
i'm back i'm not trying so i mean i'm

00:25:33.039 --> 00:25:35.440
not trying i can't try

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.360
i'm not letting lewis win i don't want

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.679
him to

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.120
go here we go yeah that's right that's

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.480
right i wasn't getting double points i

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.559
had to score five before you scored 10.

00:25:46.559 --> 00:25:48.080
yes that was it

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:48.880
mm-hmm

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.120
yeah and i beat you 5-4 absolutely

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.799
illegal to bet on the game and then pick

00:25:52.799 --> 00:25:54.880
the referee like i did yeah but it

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.799
wasn't a game where we were both had an

00:25:56.799 --> 00:25:59.120
evil stake and what we had to do i still

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.640
had to accomplish more it doesn't matter

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.400
but you didn't you didn't say you won't

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.840
but who's arguing what if you would have

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.080
beat me if i would have beat you five to

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.159
nine your argument that lewis you kind

00:26:08.159 --> 00:26:11.039
of jog on your tippy toes

00:26:11.039 --> 00:26:12.559

00:26:12.559 --> 00:26:14.159
athletic dude but i'll still beat jay in

00:26:14.159 --> 00:26:15.919
basketball oh this is my favorite louis

00:26:15.919 --> 00:26:18.159
moves

00:26:18.559 --> 00:26:20.880
the the pivot to the hook shot is my

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.480
favorite

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.840
no my point is yeah if you would have

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.919
beat me nine to four or b if i would

00:26:25.919 --> 00:26:28.320
beat you five to nine right and it would

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.960
be nine to five yeah no no i i get the

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.320
point you're making lose what did jay

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.880
lie about exactly he lied that the only

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.159
reason that i won was because of my

00:26:36.159 --> 00:26:37.600
handicap

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.679
well it will never know like you got to

00:26:39.679 --> 00:26:41.760
the handicap before i got past it so we

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.360
don't you know what i'm saying

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.840
you're right if you if you won i scored

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.240
nine you scored five this looks like two

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.880
walmart

[Laughter]

00:28:07.039 --> 00:28:08.799

basketball no no i beat him at the game

00:28:10.399 --> 00:28:12.640
of basketball yeah that's fine

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.000
but your argument is wrong it's not a

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:14.799
lie

00:28:14.799 --> 00:28:16.320
what you're saying you're wrong about

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.679
what you're saying no i'm not you beat

00:28:17.679 --> 00:28:19.120
me you beat me six to four because you

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.240
were shooting the two point but you're

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.600
saying like you got to you didn't have

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.720
to get to

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.799
eleven point five to four i believe or

00:28:24.799 --> 00:28:26.399
no maybe it was six to four can we just

00:28:26.399 --> 00:28:28.240
fast forward to what the final score is

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.600
to get to the bottom of this you can

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.360
just tell us what was the final started

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.279
game of basketball

00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:34.559
five to four five to four this is

00:28:34.559 --> 00:28:36.320
something guys the answer is obvious

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.080
that you should both be embarrassed by

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.760
this game

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.360

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.360
boat with a gun yeah you know what i'm

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.640
not sure what lewis you think i'm trying

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.399
to hold on to here honestly he really

00:28:46.399 --> 00:28:48.240
wants to twist the knife he never wins

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.679
and he loves it when he does twist the

00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:51.919
gun

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.039
jay does make a good point he's kind of

00:28:55.039 --> 00:28:57.279
paid for this game yeah

00:28:57.279 --> 00:29:00.240
well it's uh the problem is jason also

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.760
made a good point blood will uh

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.080
coagulate and just so we can't bring in

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.159
a cup of blood we have to suck it right

00:29:06.159 --> 00:29:07.440
out of each other

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.039
that's not true we have the blood let

00:29:09.039 --> 00:29:10.559
right here blood's not gonna coagulate

00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:12.080
if you get it in a uh you could put it

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.200
in an airtight you can do the airtight

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.760

transferring blood for hundreds of years

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.640

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.919

gaffney's son maybe i let you win so i

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.880
was feeling here's the problem jay this

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.240

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.320

than lewis i haven't denied that here's

00:30:33.679 --> 00:30:35.840
the problem is that in one on one if

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.760
lewis is already beating you through the

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.840
first five points

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.600
the second five points is where he's

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.720
going to have the advantage because

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.880
lewis is now once i saw he jumps for

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.399

00:30:57.679 --> 00:30:59.679
times

00:30:59.679 --> 00:31:01.120
what do you mean if we both have to hit

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.120
the same amount of shots so just relax

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.720

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.000

little like a little pink out of the out

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.120

uh

00:32:23.519 --> 00:32:25.200
yeah it's probably breaking news going

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.799
about it happening literally the most

00:32:26.799 --> 00:32:28.960

00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:37.600
they find it not the manslaughter but

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.480

well how can you prove it

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.919
how can you prove it doesn't even matter

00:32:49.919 --> 00:32:51.279
it doesn't matter if it's that it'll

00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:52.480
still be he'll still go away from

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.320
manslaughter his life's [ __ ] no you're

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.919
not going away from manslaughter for

00:32:55.919 --> 00:32:57.519
[ __ ] a chick to death if it's like a

00:32:57.519 --> 00:32:59.120
girl he didn't [ __ ] her to death he

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.640
choked her to take he [ __ ] her to

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.600
death dude louis he's a beast

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:07.120
you don't understand stuff at all huh

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.880
i mean every rape murder is like the

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.559
same setup where it's like there's gonna

00:33:10.559 --> 00:33:12.880
be his dna all up inside her and his

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.720
like finger marks on her neck you know i

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.159
mean it's yeah but i don't think how

00:33:16.159 --> 00:33:17.279
they're gonna be able to prove that they

00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:18.960
were just [ __ ] around well yeah i

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.880
mean like right so there's no no one's

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.880
arguing that he wasn't [ __ ] the chick

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.480
it's just what happened

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.039
before she died that's why i say always

00:33:27.039 --> 00:33:28.880
choke him with their belt is it a

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.039
foregone conclusion that a man goes to

00:33:31.039 --> 00:33:33.039
jail if a girl

00:33:33.039 --> 00:33:34.559
if he if they're having rough sex that

00:33:34.559 --> 00:33:37.440
he's choking her and she if she dies

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.799
no i think you could prove that they

00:33:38.799 --> 00:33:40.320
were having rough sex i don't know if

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.919
you have if you could prove it but you

00:33:41.919 --> 00:33:43.840
could win at trial like you could be

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.200
like they can't really think of all the

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.799
things this evidence dead girl

00:33:46.799 --> 00:33:51.279
strangulation marks just [ __ ] roughly

00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:52.640
what do you guys think it is probably

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.640
just some fun rough sex go home

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.039
the the defense's opening statement is

00:33:57.039 --> 00:33:59.039
okay it looks bad

00:33:59.039 --> 00:34:01.200
but

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.360
hear me out

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.279
i talked to this guy for an hour

00:34:05.279 --> 00:34:06.799
he seems like an alright dude his dad's

00:34:06.799 --> 00:34:08.879
a comic

00:34:08.879 --> 00:34:09.599
book

00:34:09.599 --> 00:34:11.200
if you check their spotify they were

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.639
listening to deangelo

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.480
the only thing that could get him off

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:22.000
would be like choking a girl apparently

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.240
[ __ ]

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.119
his lawyer during the trial would have

00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:29.520
to pull out a book she wrote

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.000
austin powers joke style like

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.919
choke [ __ ] this sort of thing is my

00:34:33.919 --> 00:34:35.679
bag baby

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:37.520
written by that's the only thing that

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.919
could get her him off um yeah her making

00:34:39.919 --> 00:34:41.919
like youtube video professions of how

00:34:41.919 --> 00:34:43.119
much she loves to be chuckling yeah

00:34:43.119 --> 00:34:45.280
she's like to the brink of death really

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.679
i mean push the limbs you know what i

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:49.359
mean

00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:51.200
i mean you really think about it like

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.679
if you rape and murder a girl via choke

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:55.280
it's gonna seem like

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.440
it's gonna look very close to just rough

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.079
sex yeah yeah

00:35:00.079 --> 00:35:01.200
you already feel like you have that plea

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.680
in the back pocket huh

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.480
she liked it rough baby girl

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.920
i mean how would you get what would be

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:10.079
that how would you possibly prove it

00:35:10.079 --> 00:35:11.760
you go to jail for a while and hope to

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.839
god you just get manslaughter but the

00:35:13.839 --> 00:35:16.400
the moment the moment after must have

manslaughter after you allegedly pop

00:36:27.839 --> 00:36:29.760
pills and rough sex with a woman after a

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.920
halloween party on friday night maybe

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.160
it's the pills it's like lev go

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.240

she was 19. ah

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.480
garcia was found dead in her car

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.960
at a parking garage she was like

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.119
been at a loud halloween party at the

00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:52.960

her death she was seen leaving the party

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.320
at some point with michael t gaffney 21

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.359
after he told the police they had taken

00:36:57.359 --> 00:36:59.920

how how could you

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.559
because the way it works is you just see

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:33.839
where they settle out this time of

01:03:33.839 --> 01:03:35.839
discussion he picked her up

01:03:35.839 --> 01:03:38.000

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:41.359
100

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:45.480

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.359
come on now y'all look at this

01:03:53.359 --> 01:03:55.119

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.720

true

01:05:59.599 --> 01:06:01.359

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.440
up clenching and

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.039

us who's the referee

01:06:37.119 --> 01:06:38.079

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.079
somebody who's seen dave beat lewis at

01:06:44.079 --> 01:06:46.400
hand versus lewis a lot which is one of

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:49.599
my favorite games of all time

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.920
hand versus lewis is one of the funniest

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.200
games i wish they would demonstrate it

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.599
for you right now

01:06:55.599 --> 01:06:57.680
versus lewis is the funny it's literally

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.359
like dave playing with a cat with a

01:06:59.359 --> 01:07:01.359
laser pointer you want to watch one of

01:07:01.359 --> 01:07:03.200
the funniest things ever yeah dude lewis

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.000
versus hand do it

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.760
every time we had a meeting to write a

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.760
script for legion of skanks

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.000
i would i would i would organize

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.599
i would organize a lewis versus hand

01:07:13.599 --> 01:07:15.119
because it made me laugh until i went to

01:07:15.119 --> 01:07:17.760
bed that night

01:07:18.079 --> 01:07:20.000
what is it david can we switch seats and

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.920
you do hand versus louis please we gotta

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:24.400
stay okay okay do it behind us then yeah

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.480
it's slap boxing there's a lot of room a

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:29.760
lot of our fans have left

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.280
everyone's walked out of this show it

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:34.240
was basically a game to train lewis that

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.480
lewis thought he could take on like he

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:38.559
has to hit my hand but and then i have

01:07:38.559 --> 01:07:40.160
to move it out of the way and then my

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.000
hand can slap

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.920
but we just can't slap dave but it's

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.680
impossible to win this game lewis is

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.920
just doing something impossible

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:50.000
so it's just but he would always want to

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.440
play this game like lewis would always

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:54.000
be like lewis versus hand was lewis's

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.480
favorite game he's over a hundred on

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:59.599
louis versus hand

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:14.719
and then went out and i just like stood

01:30:14.719 --> 01:30:15.840
there and i guess it was just from

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:17.360
waiting so long i was just like like

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:19.120
wait a minute

01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:20.880
things like that are the entire reason

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:23.840
i'm in a relationship yeah i know but i

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:25.440
you're mad that but it didn't make any

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:26.960
difference to you

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:29.360
i just was i think now now two people

01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:30.639
are right in front of you instead of one

01:30:30.639 --> 01:30:32.719
no but is it but that's what i'm asking

01:30:32.719 --> 01:30:35.280
sort of did she let him take her place

01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:36.880
and that was that she might have dropped

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:39.120
too and that's what i kind of josh josh

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:40.480
you don't know i gave him two

01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:42.080
opportunities to say that she stayed

01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:44.159
yeah and he said she might have so i

01:30:44.159 --> 01:30:45.360
know she's

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:47.600
she stayed in the line josh you're in a

01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:49.280
dangerous place where lewis thinks

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:51.600
you're acting unreasonable

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:54.159
she stayed in the line and then this is

01:30:54.159 --> 01:30:56.080
[ __ ] unprecedented and crazy right

01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:57.920
now i started jaw with the guy and i was

01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:59.360
just like what the [ __ ] dude you got

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:00.639
your [ __ ] girl waiting for you you

01:31:00.639 --> 01:31:02.320
little [ __ ] and the dude's like dude

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:03.760
just chill out man we're like i'm just

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:05.600
dropping a class like she held my place

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:07.040
and i was like [ __ ] you man he was

01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:08.639
totally this guy

01:31:08.639 --> 01:31:11.520
this guy is 100 right so far

01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:13.040
by the way i like that louis is judging

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:14.480
you lewis in the corner of this block

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:16.000
one time i saw go over he had limited

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.679
time to eat and snapping at loudly at

01:31:19.679 --> 01:31:22.320
the truck the food truck and the people

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:24.239
in line at the acknowledgement that

01:31:24.239 --> 01:31:25.840
people are waiting for their food to be

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:27.679
made and also in this line

01:31:27.679 --> 01:31:29.600
now there's [ __ ] lines and [ __ ]

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:32.000
food truck and he was furious so i don't

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.760

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.920
don't know but hearing it yes you do

01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:36.960
hearing it

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:38.719

01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:59.600

and then he he just charges me and then

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:06.639
we just start fighting and then we scrap

01:33:06.639 --> 01:33:07.520
