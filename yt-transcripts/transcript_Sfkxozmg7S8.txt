he's what I don't know though they've

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.000
been pretty defensive about it ever

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.530
since like I brought it up and they were

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.020
like you talked about in our podcast no

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.400

that's for you it's not homophobic this

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.280
is a valid concern if you're going to

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.930
stay on a compound in the middle of

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.640
nowhere and then do to start kissing

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.690
each other that's something you should

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:32.090
know yes you're like I wish I knew that

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:33.190

jealous so the sick ass moves I'm making

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.920
the only way you can deal with it is by

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.660
you know accusing me of being some sort

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.949

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:14.420
cool things are you trying to accuse me

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.480
of being a victim I think you got

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.350

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:24.860
cuz you're jacked it up true that's true

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.870
most people would show your somebody

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:28.670
punch a in his face I mean their whole

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:30.380
arm would shatter your head your bones

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:33.490
are so thick in your face

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:50.260
[Laughter]

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.730
direct line into Lewis's consciousness

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:02.970
like shades head looks strong looks very

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:07.170
strong it's hard to punch these dog

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:17.040
bones are dog so yeah she made it till

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.660
about four so she she hit the methadone

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.520
for a while probably partied on a little

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.470
bit of xanax

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.820
now she was just a methadone at night

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.710
dude and she it was these little orange

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.930
bottles and she would [ __ ] slip him

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:33.150
down and then look owner bedroom and she

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:36.030
fall asleep with cigarettes and burn her

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:41.310
bed and yeah yeah so she I think give

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:42.660
her credit it's like when people say

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.690
they're sober but they still smoke weed

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:49.920
so do you remember her not like that no

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.510
there was never a time where my mom was

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:53.340
not on heroin or methadone since I've

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.170
been alive really

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:59.840

I had a I had to go so Brittany had to

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.360
go to the doctor recently for like a

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.980
checkup so she went in I'm not no one

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:17.340
else can go in with her and the doctor

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.750
some lady there's all the ladies to do

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:20.460
like baby doctor stuff usually are all

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:22.530
the doctors usually are ladies and they

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:23.730
were asking about like how we're gonna

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:25.470
have sex so like what birth control

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:27.480
we're gonna use and I got the FaceTime

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.310
into this lady you know I like earnestly

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:31.260
asked her I'm like what about using like

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:40.260
a prosthetic and she goes I'm sorry

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:42.420
prosthetic for what like instead so she

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.860
was saying like what kind of will form

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:44.910
of birth control are you going to use

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:46.790
and I kept being like probably apps I

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:51.840
was like what about a prosthetic yes

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.940
you're not trying to [ __ ] no I am but

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:55.560
they're saying like after a woman has a

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:58.530
baby they're highly fertile so that they

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:00.060
like they give you a talk before you

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.230
leave they're like you better you know

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:02.880
you shouldn't get it pregnant like ready

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.380
yet afterwards it's like kind of risky

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.900
for the lady oh right okay so that's

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:07.770
what you're worried about

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:11.550
I'm not he was making a good joke that I

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:13.590
wasn't paying attention to and I missed

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:16.050
it I'm sorry it was fun it was funny -

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:16.750
it's funny

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:19.440
ask a medical doctor about the strap-ons

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.940
get a prosthetic she was asking how

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:24.460
we're gonna like like practice Bert like

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.140
birth control and I was like I'll just I

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:27.570
was like I mean I was like what are the

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:29.770
what's the literature on prosthetics and

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:31.150
she was just like the lady likes face

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:34.210
was like wait what would you like they

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:35.710
say six weeks is the amount of time

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:43.810
before you're sort of saying I have a

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:46.210
child I remember was six weeks they say

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:47.800
six weeks you gotta wait and then but

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.870
they said in order to have another kid

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:51.790
you shouldn't have another kid before

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:53.860
two years oh so you can get put on Irish

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:57.670
true thing you can get pregnant but they

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.800
said like it's riskier closer you are

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.530
between like the two kids it's risky

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:05.560
yeah I I remember the first time we

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:10.710
[ __ ] after she had the kid pretty nice

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.650
yeah I mean it was you know vagina

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:17.530
that's rarely not true but the first

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:20.950
time it definitely had not gained back

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:22.840
the elasticity the same way

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.520
there were ago Keynes way like not the

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.860
first time the first time I was like oh

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.420
[ __ ] like this thing feels like it'd

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:33.340
been [ __ ] you talk to you like a war

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:37.030
vet do you you were single-handedly SS

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:39.760
hold on let him let him let him flush

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.540
that out so uh you're your son's

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:45.670
mother's [ __ ] was like a war vet was

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:52.590
going what do you mean it was uh it was

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:57.910
angry and was addicted to drugs did you

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:59.320
try any kinds of when you're out of my

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.720
neighborhood when you hop back in you

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.870
notice I believe it's you were in a war

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:06.100
when you notice the shift in the terrain

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:09.630
did you try any different moves to like

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:17.660
[Laughter]

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.830
you see a lot of like 50 year old

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:24.880
Vietnam vets these days okay buddy

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.160
where'd you get that [ __ ] jacket yeah

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.020
yeah I hear you on that a lot of stolen

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:30.290
valor but

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:32.780
good for the that dude I'd be stealing

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:35.180
Balor the first time I went back in now

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:36.890
yeah was definitely looser for sure

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:38.780
what'd you do what'd you do any kind of

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:41.360
I'm asking you like did you any

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.470
different moves and you do otherwise

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:43.790
usually if you're in this might decide

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:47.290
I'm saying ring the dinner bell

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:52.260
[Laughter]

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:56.900
we're in there first damn dude

00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:04.940
yeah whoa Oh Louis chill that's far yeah

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:12.410
so how would you think matter than ever

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:12.980
I love it

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.890
yeah well it was great honestly I mean

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:18.020
I've had sex with women who were like 40

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.790
you know in their upper 40s with who've

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:21.410
had multiple kids and that having kids

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:23.720
isn't the issue because it gets tighter

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:27.380
it gets better I was back it goes like a

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:35.920
lizard's tail go back to its original

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.650
status you know it's like then we get a

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:41.420
design like do you want the [ __ ] is

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:49.700
always you in a best-case scenario we'll

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:52.820
get back to 80 to 90% of its elasticity

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:59.900
right that's what I feel now who has a

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:03.110
stomach score a woman who has who's lost

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:05.470
20% of all SSC in her [ __ ]

00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:08.240
neither bother me dude yeah I didn't

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.460

01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:18.980
numbers okay so you thought of a number

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:20.600
one to ten doubled it

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:23.000

subtract the original number that you

01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:32.600
started with the original number you

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:36.230
started with from that number okay we

01:20:36.230 --> 01:20:37.610
have a whole new number in your head now

01:20:37.610 --> 01:20:39.380

so 4 is a 1 b 2 c 3 d 4 E 5 and so on

01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:15.020
yeah I can think of the letter of the

01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:17.150
alphabet okay you guys should have a

01:21:17.150 --> 01:21:18.230
letter of the alphabet well I have a

01:21:18.230 --> 01:21:23.600
decimal in my number so I don't think

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:24.680
you should have a decimal you're not

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:26.600
word you said due to any it's infinite

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:28.940
what exists between 1 and 10 decimals

01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:30.290
exists between 1 and 10 you can fall

01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:36.020
it's fair to use them yeah mine's D the

01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:38.260
