00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.920

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.879

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.319
ah gordon was in a tube dude

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.959
he's just a big canadian guy but wait

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.640
what was his did he ever

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.720
just to be out of the tube but then like

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.319
war happened and the only way he could

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.159
stay alive was to go into the tube

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.720
because remember so you know the the the

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.840
cannon dude i love the cannon

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.879

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.560
pre-rangers or do you train the rangers

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.000
then go back to the tube he never

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.680
actually trains anybody he's just he's

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.440
just like their all-knowing guy he's

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.959
like they're uh

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.000
he's like yoda kinda gotcha where like

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.440
he just knows what's up

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.799
and they're like oh i guess we gotta do

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.879
what he says was he kind of like a fat

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.599
faced white guy

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.239
it was steve from jerry springer it

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.519
really it looked like buzz

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.959
from a [ __ ] home alone yeah i wonder

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.120
if it was the same actress

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.959
i think it was a it was just like uh

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.159
some big white guy

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.519
did you ever [ __ ] with rita

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.159
like did they have a past i think there

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.799
was some

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.239
there was some intermingling but i don't

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.439
think they had like a relationship with

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:02.239
the maybe gotcha

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.560
maybe though was she the bad the super

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.360
villain the whole time

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.360
i think zordon smashed and rita was just

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.599
like

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.840
yeah well zordon grabs her face at a

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.840
party

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.959
i think zordon [ __ ] yeah might have

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:21.919
crabbed face

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.520
why else i can't believe dude did you

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.280
see kumo cuomo whatever his name is

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.919
brothers [ __ ] sold him out no did you

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.440
see his brother sold him out well he was

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.880
just kind of like it's a conflict of

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.440
interest

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.040
basically he tried to be like hey man i

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.400
got nothing to do with this it's like

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.759
damn dude

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.160
damn his brother was getting in trouble

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.840
for like touching the small of women's

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.960
backs

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.560
that's what cuomo is in trouble for yeah

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.000
bro he was that he well there's a

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.680
picture though i think he like

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.440
put hand he put a hand on the back of it

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.720
the lady was wearing he's so nice

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.919
putting your hand on the small of a

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:50.320
woman's

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.240
back first of all that is i will say

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.800
that is sexual harassment

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.400
and she was wearing one of those dresses

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.360
that like her whole back was showing oh

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.880
so it was like a dream he couldn't keep

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.639
his hands off that how could you

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.199
if you felt like you had the green light

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.400
to do that you would do it well here's

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.759
the problem he also he

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.000
again he was going he thought he was all

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.520
above board he was going to young women

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.800
and telling them he would go

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.960
just so you know i'm fully open to

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.400
having relationships with women in their

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.960
20s

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.560
which i didn't know you had to say out

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.840
loud because i thought that was assumed

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.960
every [ __ ]

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.199
powerful man was doing that but yeah he

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:24.800
was going around like touching the swa

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.720
small of women's backs and being like

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.400
i [ __ ] you guys in case you're wondering

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.560
that if you're young and hot

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.880
i will [ __ ] you and then he at one point

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.759
he's like that's

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:35.600
he grabbed the ladies he like the lady

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.280
was like yo man get off my back and he

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.680
was like

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.720
i thought you were being kind of

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.639
aggressive i'm being honest and then i

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.479
grabbed her face according to this oh he

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:43.199
face grabbed

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.800
gave a double face grab and i think was

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.380
like kiss me and she's like no

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.720
[Laughter]

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.199
cuomo what the the face crab is is

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.280
there's a picture of the face crab

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.360
but then people are saying someone was

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.479
there with a camera

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.960

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.360

i've been a drunk this whole time i

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.560
thought about that before if i like

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:18.959
while

00:10:18.959 --> 00:10:20.800

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.880
drug opiate addiction

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.720

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.519
[ __ ] eight might pull up

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:37.279
i told you my friend drank an eight

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:39.200
basically i think it's a half a point

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.360
or a pint is like eight ounces of syrup

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.800
my friend drank a whole

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.320
he was holding my syrup but i bought a

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.600
bunch of it i was i was gonna be the

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.240
juice man

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.720
yeah and he uh my friend [ __ ] was

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.640
holding at the spot and he drank it all

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.079
and he [ __ ] drove into a hill

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.079
they crashed through the hill right out

00:10:56.079 --> 00:10:57.760
front of my parents house i'm like how'd

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.959
you crash in front of the hill and i'm

00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:00.320
like where's my syrup and he's like oh i

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.640
drank it bro

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.320
wait did he drink it before he left yeah

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.600
he just drank all my scissors

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.440
dude syrup is a crazy thing it doesn't

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.040
really do much to you if you just drink

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:11.519
really

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:13.600
yeah it's expensive as [ __ ] and you

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.800
drink like

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.959
i think it's like 30 bucks for an ounce

00:11:16.959 --> 00:11:17.920
and you drink it

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.920
and it's like if you take pills with it

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.279
it [ __ ] you up you have to drink a lot

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:22.320
of it and then you're just like you

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.120
could just you know

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.200
would you just get tired yeah you get

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.399
chopped and screwed

00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:28.240
yeah i know the chopped and screwed part

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.839
but they didn't get chopped

00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:31.200
so you just if you drank like if you

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.519
poured if you poured up before a foe

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:35.600
you'd be kind of chopped and screwed but

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.120
like if you just gotta sit my friends i

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:37.600
just need

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.440
paul wall if you i just need the

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.720
people's champ i'd be like yeah

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.640
just watching paul wall youtube videos

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.640
the problem is is when you buy

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.000
syrup people cut it with karo syrup

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.600
so then if you're if you're buying syrup

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.040
you got to twist the cap because if the

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:53.920
caps crusted

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.519
that means someone cut you with cairo

00:11:55.519 --> 00:11:56.880
and then you got like that x-axis you

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.399
got sugar on the top

00:11:58.399 --> 00:11:59.760
i don't think anyone's sipping syrup

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.360
anymore but like that was a big thing

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.720
you get caught you like [ __ ]

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.959

you're saying different but yeah he was

00:16:56.959 --> 00:16:57.460
trying

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:00.880
[Laughter]

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.480
but was this guy wearing like a sweater

did they go like did they do like a hal

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.240
stella there's always like the good

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.600
if you watch like how stella's got a

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.799
groove back or anything tyler perry

00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:10.000
movie there's like the

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.600
good archetypal black dude who has like

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.919
a sick record wears sweaters and glasses

00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:14.559
he's like

00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:16.480
i'm just trying to really work is it was

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.480
it like he was a cop

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.760
which also made me laugh because they

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.520
were like very pro police a couple times

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.480
in this movie

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.839
like she's talking to her sister and

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.280
she's like you're so strong you're like

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.480
a police officer you know

00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:30.960
this movie came out a year before they

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.400
realized that would be a problem

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.160
that's hilarious but there's one part

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.240
where the ladies in bed and then the

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.240
the jacks black dude best friend comes

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.840
in to be like are you all right and he

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.559
his body

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:43.760
is so absurd it's like it's comical like

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.600
his tricep is out like a foot

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.720
it's like sticking out and then she gets

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.840
she gets a bunch of money from the

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.760
settlement with her ex and this is my

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.039
favorite part because then she's like

00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:54.799
i set up a college fund for your

00:17:54.799 --> 00:17:56.799
daughter and then her and the black

00:17:56.799 --> 00:17:58.400
people celebrate she's saving the black

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.000
family of course also there's no

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
no mention in this movie of how this

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.919
incred not incredibly ugly

00:18:03.919 --> 00:18:07.039
but ugly woman for a billionaire that

00:18:07.039 --> 00:18:07.760
invents

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:13.120
invisibility like what what is she doing

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.200
yeah why is he like punching her yeah it

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.160
makes no sense

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.320
the whole thing makes no sense but yeah

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.919
i could cast that lady

00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:21.919
i'm not sure i swear to god it was every

00:18:21.919 --> 00:18:23.520
woman's fantasy and then it's like just

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.120
the idea of like every

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.559
they've never lost a fight they've just

00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:28.480
been manipulated yeah

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.720
he was he was such a [ __ ] i can't

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.400
wait to watch it i was gaslit

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.320
so many times it's like no you lost

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.600
arguments yeah

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.600
stop trying to make weird excuses after

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.120
the fact you're just losing arguments

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.640
it'd be funny to have like in the middle

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.679
of that when they finally i don't know

00:18:41.679 --> 00:18:42.880
if you can tell i've been accused of

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.440
this before

00:18:45.919 --> 00:18:47.039
i'd be sick if they had like a

00:18:47.039 --> 00:18:48.799
passionate love scene when she finally

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:49.360
like

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.720
lets her guard down around her new

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.480
boyfriend and like the camera just

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.919
reveals they're both naked but he has

00:18:53.919 --> 00:18:56.640
boots on

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.700
[Laughter]

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.640
it's the whole time just imagining like

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.720
a disgruntled boyfriend going through

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.400
he was like living in the attic of the

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.280
black guy's house it's like why is this

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.120
but then i was also laughing about him

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.640
he's invisible he only [ __ ] with her

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.320
like occasionally so then that means

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.840
most of the time he's just invisible

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.440
like going around town

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.799
just chilling and he's like oh [ __ ] i

00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:22.799
gotta go [ __ ] with that [ __ ]

00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:26.000
he goes and like rips her covers off him

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.760
that's so funny that'll be sick at the

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.400
very end he records the sex scene and

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.000
then the end of it's just him uploading

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:32.799
it to like

00:19:32.799 --> 00:19:37.760
pornhub just like bbc destroys mature

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.120
a floating cell phone the invisible man

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.960
and then all like

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.760
yeah and then there's a real plot twist

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.320
when it

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.600
it's revealed she's pregnant recently

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.720
which means the invisible man [ __ ] her

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.120
and creampied her asleep hold on the

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:55.919
invisible man

00:19:55.919 --> 00:19:57.440
and he would have had to have taken his

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.440
dick out of the suit

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.799
so that means there was just a dick

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:03.360
floating in her room one night a hard

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:03.679
dick

00:20:03.679 --> 00:20:05.520
which is a solid five and three quarters

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.720
just floating

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.799
so damn [ __ ] that's gotta be crazy to

00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:10.080
be a jack black guy and wake up and

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.280

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:49.520
uh

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.720
the hidden hidden persuaders from the

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.159
adam curtis documentary it's a dog

00:22:54.159 --> 00:22:55.280

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.080
no no all right stop dude no i know it's

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.120
just a funny thing to call

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.799
hidden persuaders dog whistle is just a

00:23:02.799 --> 00:23:04.159
thing for people who come up with

00:23:04.159 --> 00:23:06.240
oh that's your dog yeah yeah no no i

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.840
just came up with a funny slur

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.440
you know that might control the media in

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.480
my school they would do that they're

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.919
like you know when trump talks about

00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:17.520
teen pregnancy he really means these are

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.480
old white ladies

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.320
he really means pregnant black and

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.159
latino teenagers and i was honestly like

00:23:22.159 --> 00:23:23.360
i never once

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.640
made that yeah yeah it's like if you

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.919
watch teen mom there's a ton of like

00:23:25.919 --> 00:23:27.520
white trash ladies

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.120
but the uh yeah they're like he's

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.480
clearly dog whistling like i'm pretty

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.240
sure you think of black teenagers when

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.679
you think of teen mom because i don't

00:23:33.679 --> 00:23:35.120
think that's what they're talking about

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.200
but they're talking about yeah because

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.039
the term dog whistling means it's a

00:23:39.039 --> 00:23:40.480
cadence that normal people can't

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:40.960
perceive

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.919
as racist but you'd if you were racist

00:23:43.919 --> 00:23:45.600
you'd be like yes

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.760
exactly so if you're you know if you're

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.039
like that's a dog whistle it's like how

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:50.960
do you know exactly you can hear that

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.440
you can hear how do you hear the pitch i

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.120
can't i have a phd in social work i

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:55.520
studied

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.760
i studied judith butler oh he dodged it

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.210
again

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:00.640
[Laughter]

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.880
finally dude the book it was from the

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.080
curtis documentary about how they

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.440
started using

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.760
psychoanalysis in marketing to like [ __ ]

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.559
with people

00:24:08.559 --> 00:24:10.320
but the one study they did and this is

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.679
before they had like the algorithm

00:24:11.679 --> 00:24:13.600
basically to study us all in real time

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.039
due to one study they were talking about

00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:16.720
how this was in the 50s

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.799
how they figured out that women and i

00:24:18.799 --> 00:24:20.000
don't want to talk about this during you

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.320
know

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.320
women's month but they were saying it's

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.480
women's month right now in march but

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.960
they were saying i wish i didn't know

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.559
that they were saying that i wish i

00:24:28.559 --> 00:24:30.640
hadn't just heard that right now

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.760
why would they have a whatever so

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.880
they one study figure like you know they

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.159
did a bunch of these but the one study

00:24:38.159 --> 00:24:39.440
figured out that

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.760
there's uh mental changes that accompany

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.120
women's menstrual cycle and they were

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.159
allowed to like you know run these

00:24:44.159 --> 00:24:45.279
studies in the 50s

00:24:45.279 --> 00:24:46.640
so they're saying they had to figure out

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.080
how to sell products because they were

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:48.960
like women

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.799
two weeks out of the month have this

00:24:50.799 --> 00:24:52.640
like go-getter capacity like

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.240
i want to take something on i want to do

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.440
i want to do something new i'm going to

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.039
go on an adventure

00:24:57.039 --> 00:24:58.559
the second half what's worse than that

00:24:58.559 --> 00:25:00.559
the second half i want to do something

00:25:00.559 --> 00:25:01.919
second half of the month this is what

00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:03.840
marketers figured out the 50s the second

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:04.880
half of the month

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.320
it's like i don't want to be stressed

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.919
i'm overwhelmed i need like attention

00:25:07.919 --> 00:25:08.640
and care

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.159
so the marketers in the 50s would have

00:25:10.159 --> 00:25:12.080
to advertise like big things like

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.840
it would have to be like a quick easy

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.600
thing but also like try a new thing and

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.120
they'd have to advertise both at once

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:17.840
because they didn't

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.799
know where women would be on their

00:25:18.799 --> 00:25:20.320
cycles that way there's recipes on the

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.520
back of like

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.919
boxes and [ __ ] definitely yeah dudes

00:25:23.919 --> 00:25:25.520
goddamn yeah i saw that one where they

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.760
you had to add an egg to the

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.279
betty crocker or whatever that was the

00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:31.440
cake because women needed to feel like

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.799
they were contributing

00:25:32.799 --> 00:25:33.919
say they did the same thing i was like

00:25:33.919 --> 00:25:35.760

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.360
like that matters

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.200

a big

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.840
thing in you know in those countries so

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.200
like it was seen as like you would be

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.240
and this is the whole thing they're

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:48.880
selling like

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.320
it's not just soup you're being a good

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.559
mother but if you did like instant soup

in america like we're like whatever who

00:25:54.159 --> 00:25:54.640
cares

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.120
in latin america it's like oh i'm a bad

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.480
mother because i should be making like

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.159
the good soup so they just

00:26:00.159 --> 00:26:02.240
sold campbell's soup in latin america as

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.600
a soup base

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.880
so that they could chop their carrots

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.880
and be like i've done it don't you

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.039

00:26:26.159 --> 00:26:27.520
that's why the concern i knew the

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.919
concern was like have i been saying that

00:26:29.919 --> 00:26:31.200
wrong

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.600
i didn't know i used to i used to bring

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.960
up potatoes all grating and people like

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.080
that's so funny yeah

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:36.960
like that and i was like i thought

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.960
that's how you say it i know you say i

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.480
thought it was all gratitude i heard you

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.080
say it and i took it

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.159
i was like are these potatoes all great

00:26:44.159 --> 00:26:45.440
and people are like are you [ __ ]

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.960
[ __ ]

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.799
i was trying to produce a baked potato i

00:26:48.799 --> 00:26:50.240
was like i don't know what alcohol team

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:50.880
is

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.080
i think it's just cheesy i think it's

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.159
just when you make cheesy potatoes

00:26:54.159 --> 00:26:55.600
when you cut a potato and bake them and

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.880
then put cheese it's like macaroni and

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:57.840
cheese but instead of

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.520
macaroni you put potatoes it sounds

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.960
great yeah that's

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.120
they are delicious how do you say it

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.320
correctly i think it's potatoes all

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.840
groton but i used to call it potatoes

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.919
all gratin because it was a foreign word

00:27:07.919 --> 00:27:09.279
so i had to like pronounce everything

00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:10.799
you did i think you did the right thing

00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:12.080
i think i think i'm right

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.159
but someone was like yo that's so funny

00:27:14.159 --> 00:27:16.080
and i was like yeah

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.399
yeah yeah you i remember one time you

00:27:18.399 --> 00:27:20.399

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.840
old ad the old adage

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.320
yeah you know how the old adage goes

00:27:29.279 --> 00:27:31.039
yeah it's because you're reading fool

00:27:31.039 --> 00:27:32.320
you're reading all these books i read

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.080

because there's a robot saying it yep

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.240
it's like i don't know how to

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.840
enunciate the way this thing does it

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.120
can't be in the middle of a conversation

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:53.760
and be like

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.470

to be like exactly they're just like

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:25.840
yeah whatever

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.840
i guess it's omega i guess it's al

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.679
gratin

00:28:31.679 --> 00:28:33.600

[ __ ] this is not

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.240
i watched it the whole the whole way

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.760
from start to finish that movie i was

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.720
like this is

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.320
where'd you watch it every woman's fan

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.760

00:28:44.399 --> 00:28:45.360
white lover

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.960

[ __ ] i'm a poor lover

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.679
but yeah any i was just laughing at the

00:28:55.679 --> 00:28:58.399
idea of every single woman who's ever

00:28:58.399 --> 00:28:59.840
lost an argument has been like he's a

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:00.720
manipulative

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.880
piece of [ __ ] he's like no you just

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:03.840
can't debate

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.720
yeah obviously the other one the one on

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.399
netflix that just came out with the

00:29:08.399 --> 00:29:11.679
lady uh roseman pike or whatever

00:29:11.679 --> 00:29:14.000
it's called i care a lot no it's like

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.799
this white lady

00:29:14.799 --> 00:29:16.640
she's like this evil person and she's

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.240
just bad the whole time

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.080
and life just gets better for her for

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.760
being like an evil white lady

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.039
what i like that takes over the world

00:29:25.039 --> 00:29:26.320
i always wanted to make that movie where

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.080
someone instead of problems happening

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.840
gets sweeter it just gets better and

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.799
better yeah

00:29:30.799 --> 00:29:32.000
everything is better so this lady just

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.520
keeps being worse and it gets better

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.200
it's worse and worse and then she goes

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.120
up a level like she's just like rich by

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.080
the end of the movie

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.919
sounds good yeah it sounds like exactly

00:29:39.919 --> 00:29:42.320
how life works

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.880
i'm not sure you gotta get a little

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:45.520
closer

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.600
coming of age tail we gotta get these

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:36.320
the coach yeah this guy was the

00:30:45.279 --> 00:30:46.559
over and over and over to where he's

00:30:46.559 --> 00:30:47.919

assault though you know a little

00:31:13.279 --> 00:31:14.960

[Laughter]

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.240
but yeah killing yourself and being

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.320
confident like like hitler

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.560

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.560
the soviets are here you got to come out

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.280
no i don't think it's time for you to

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.359
face justice

00:34:15.359 --> 00:34:16.399
i bet you i don't that's why killing

00:34:16.399 --> 00:34:18.399
yourself is illegal yeah you're not

00:34:18.399 --> 00:34:20.000
allowed to do it because

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.679
if on the case that you've committed an

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.520
atrocity

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.879
legally speaking you're supposed to be

00:34:24.879 --> 00:34:26.480
brought to justice yeah so that's what

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.040
that was

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.000
i was telling you that's what i was the

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.760
most appalled about the fact that he

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:30.720
skipped court

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:34.159
yeah via suicide yeah

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.480
his legacy it's already bad enough with

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.879
the child molestation rape and that

00:34:40.879 --> 00:34:42.399
somehow sexual trafficking i don't know

00:34:42.399 --> 00:34:44.159
how there's i don't know how the [ __ ]

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:46.000
guys from uh

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.919
the nexium got sexual i i still don't

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:48.960
understand how they got sex trafficking

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.240
i think you just bring somebody to a

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.280
different state

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.760
okay so if you bring someone out of town

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.320
and then

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.159
because the next year they were adults

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:57.680
yeah who got like tricked into a pyramid

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.720
scheme and like we're gonna burn your

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.000
[ __ ] and they're like

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.599
sure master and i was like well you're

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:03.359

00:35:03.359 --> 00:35:04.800
you got a trick yeah it's kind of like

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.920
well they they tricked us with

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.200
psychology it's like

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.119
yeah that's what tricking us every

00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:11.119
single time but when you have like 14

00:35:11.119 --> 00:35:11.920
year olds you're like

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.760

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.560
yeah dude my question is

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:22.560
here's another great impression this is

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.000
japan oh boy

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.839
calling the united states not knowing we

00:35:25.839 --> 00:35:27.760
have nukes

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.760
during world war ii we were never

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.119
surrendered

00:35:31.119 --> 00:35:34.000
yeah i bet you actually do i bet you end

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:34.720
up surrendering

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.000
i bet you call me tomorrow and say sorry

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.960
what what do you know we'll see let's

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.800
watch the news watch the news tomorrow

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.079
see what happens yeah africa yes

00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:48.000
the you know how there's been like ufo

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.760
sightings around like nuclear silos and

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.440
[ __ ] and people like think the aliens

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.400
are coming back to be like

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.480
don't nuke each other that means they

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.240
turned a blind eye for japan

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.920
that means even the aliens we knew when

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.359
we nuked them the aliens knew we had

00:35:59.359 --> 00:36:00.079
nukes

00:36:00.079 --> 00:36:01.760
wait so there was aliens all right go

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.119
ahead wait

00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:05.920
no i'm saying nowadays yeah there's been

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.680
a lot of like ufo sightings around

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:08.640
nuclear

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.960
testing sites nuclear silos like there's

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.480
one there's a show i think it's on

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.920
netflix or amazon where they're like

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.560
a ufo hovered above the the base and

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.240
like shut off all the equipment for like

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.440
10 minutes

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.280
and they they believe it's like aliens

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.520
being like chill with the news

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.040
but that means when we were like we're

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.160
going to nuke japan the aliens were like

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.160
all right get one and get one and these

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.640
guys are out of control go ahead

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.079
that would be funny because again we've

00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:35.760
been in the mainstream news flirting

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.880
with like

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.400
every now and again they're like aliens

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.400
you're like yeah now this year they've

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.520
been hitting this with aliens

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.520
that would be funny if we made contact

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:45.680
and they came out and said like

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.520
de facto like we think and they

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.720
translate it and like they actually

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.440
certainly think asian accents are funny

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.040
and then some white lady has to be like

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.040
do like a science thing like actually

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:57.440
uh the aliens are wrong they just

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.800
vaporize her

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.079
like oh they're right they're right

00:37:00.079 --> 00:37:01.920
they're like i bet you were right

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.839
what if martian sounded asian like

00:37:05.839 --> 00:37:07.040
i'll be honest there's a very good

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.280
chance there's almost

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.680
no chance they don't you think so oh

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:15.359
we're coming to so much a piece for you

00:37:15.599 --> 00:37:17.119
there's so much a piece here they come

00:37:17.119 --> 00:37:18.960
they're looking around just kidding

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:23.839
yeah oh we like their group

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.320
anyway white people rule

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.680
white people were right this whole time

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.880
they come to speak to trump no phil

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:38.240
where is david duke

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.280
what

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:46.800
[ __ ] these guys from saturn suck

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.000
and then another alien thing shows i was

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.119
like those were the races

00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:55.200
they're bad [ __ ] well we listened to

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.200
them they flew

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.960
it would be fun we did what they said we

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.640
killed them it would be good

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.720
if we made contact and their technology

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.040
sucks they just like crash in the ocean

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.440
they're like [ __ ]

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.000
yeah they hand us like one an ipod like

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.720
we heard you guys had weed

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.520
yeah we have weed

00:38:15.839 --> 00:38:17.680
what are your secrets but you don't know

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:21.040
we don't know how this [ __ ] works

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.599
if everyone assumes they're like way

00:38:23.599 --> 00:38:24.960
advanced that'd be funny if they're like

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:25.359
oh

00:38:25.359 --> 00:38:27.280
dude yeah i don't know it'd be like us

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.640
be like us driving a car

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.800
yeah and driving somewhere and then like

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.720
how does this work it's like

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.599
i don't know i don't want to have land

00:38:35.599 --> 00:38:36.800
they're the drunk driving

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.400
the drunk drivers of aliens like they

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.079
weren't supposed to damn that's true

00:38:40.079 --> 00:38:41.440
it's a good theory yeah

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.800
all the alien sightings they're just

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.839
[ __ ] up on ketamine you're like oh

00:38:45.839 --> 00:38:48.560
yeah they abducted a meth farmer they

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.480
abducted you know they abduct some guy

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.200
who

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.240
you know works as a you know he's up

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.000
there

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.680
he's he's a farmer that likes me oh dude

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.040
i was singing lumberjack that was the

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.320
word that was eluding me you know

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.680
there's probably

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.359
just uh there's probably a lot of

00:39:05.359 --> 00:39:07.200
farmers right now who are tweaking on

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.079
that map

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:09.760
yeah because you're like kind of sitting

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.160
around you know on some larry nassar i

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.000
would take adderall if i was a farmer

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.200
i think a lot of them all did freaked

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.200
out bro because you got to like that the

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.599
harvest comes in and you're just like

00:39:19.599 --> 00:39:21.680
sun up to sun pumped you'd be just

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.599
jacked on amphetamines just driving just

00:39:23.599 --> 00:39:24.800
like the problem is

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:29.839
let's go you fall asleep

00:39:35.119 --> 00:39:36.640
yeah but then at night time dude you'd

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.920
be coming out thinking everyone's

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.720
[ __ ] with your [ __ ]

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.800
scarecrow painted just face painted on a

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.200
stick just like

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.800
you'd be the scarecrow yeah you'd

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.560
probably fight your own scarecrow every

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:51.040
night

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.079
there's that son of a [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah

00:39:54.079 --> 00:39:55.040
man

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.480
the problem is you start doing the math

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.079
you crush it for a couple weeks you're

00:39:58.079 --> 00:39:58.800
[ __ ]

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.800
i'm [ __ ] i've been up for three days

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.320
and then the

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.240
lack of sleep psychosis kicks in you're

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.560
like actually everybody's out to get me

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.480
and then the car is screaming at you and

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.000
then you fall asleep for like four

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.520
days and you wake up and like all your

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.800
apples are kind of [ __ ] and you're

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:13.119
like

00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:15.599
oh [ __ ] and that's probably how every

00:40:15.599 --> 00:40:17.200
crop circle has happened

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.960
like a farmer just took meth for a week

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.319
and then built it and then

00:40:20.319 --> 00:40:24.960
woke up the next day like it's

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.400
that is funny the guys always a lot of

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.920
the guys i should say i want to you know

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.920
smite everyone who claims alien

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.280
but they're always like yeah they [ __ ]

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.280
my ass it's like i think you're [ __ ]

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.079
with your ass bro

00:40:36.079 --> 00:40:38.560
yeah no no well if you find anything up

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:39.440
there that was the aliens

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.960
that's a part of it the aliens are like

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.599
give me meth or i'll probe your [ __ ]

00:40:43.599 --> 00:40:46.079
they probably take meth and [ __ ] guys in

00:40:46.079 --> 00:40:49.520
the ass they're just invisible man

00:40:50.839 --> 00:40:53.839
farmers

00:40:53.839 --> 00:40:55.839
yeah i wonder if aliens are funny if

00:40:55.839 --> 00:40:57.040
they have a sense of humor they have to

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.319
be funny because if they're funny they'd

00:40:58.319 --> 00:40:59.599
be [ __ ] with farmers

00:40:59.599 --> 00:41:03.200
quite a bit i'd be destroying pharmacy

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.800
if i was invisible man

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.720
yeah he's actually abducting [ __ ]

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.040
throwing it [ __ ] yeah just tossing a cow

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.319
across the point there's some guy

00:41:12.319 --> 00:41:14.800
sitting there watching

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.760
some god-fearing man by himself he's

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:20.160
coming down be like i'm god and then

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.520
giving him a mission

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:24.079
but kill your family yeah oh [ __ ] oh

00:41:24.079 --> 00:41:25.680
[ __ ] he's doing it oh it's a test it's

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:26.960
test

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.720
yeah man dude we're gonna have to

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.520
contend with the uh

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.119
did you watch you watch the whole curtis

00:41:33.119 --> 00:41:34.560
thing right yes

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.160
and when they talk about the algorithm

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.680
yes how it's it has

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.520
all of our information but doesn't have

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:40.960
it doesn't tell itself stories so it

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.480
just kind of thinks differently

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.400
we're about to come full face with we're

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.160
gonna have to shift our human brains

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.480
around how to deal with basically like a

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.319
hyper-crafted version of all of

00:41:50.319 --> 00:41:51.119
ourselves

00:41:51.119 --> 00:41:52.560
that doesn't think like us yeah and

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:53.520
that's what we're going to be upping

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:55.440
that attributes no meaning to anything

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:55.760
yeah

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.520
dude yeah that's going to be crazy to

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.640
have to do i mean i'm thinking about

00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.200
aliens

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.880
because i thought about it before they

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.119
could be my one theory of like how

00:42:03.119 --> 00:42:05.119
everything is could be the fact that

00:42:05.119 --> 00:42:06.880
ai's gotten us to this point where it

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.319
was like you know maybe i stole a little

00:42:08.319 --> 00:42:09.280
bit of this from the hundred

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.040
but it's like you get to the point where

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.480
you're like hey figure out how to save

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.520
us and they're like oh

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.119
we'll shut it down and contract the

00:42:15.119 --> 00:42:16.720
universe into a big bang and it

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.560
re-exploded on the same thing that it

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:19.200
comes

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.240
basically we'll just do a restart the

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.760
problem with ai

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.079
is that ai i'm excited to hear this ai

00:42:26.079 --> 00:42:27.920
is doing a bunch of simple things

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:31.280
yeah uh a i can't do complex tasks

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.599
yeah like people we can think but ai

00:42:33.599 --> 00:42:35.520
doesn't think ai knows how to go

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.280
one plus one equals two and therefore

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.960
since two is this number

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.119
this needs to happen because it's two

00:42:41.119 --> 00:42:42.640
yeah do you know what i mean yeah that's

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.119
how

00:42:43.119 --> 00:42:46.480
we're we're just like you know like so

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.079
the problem with ai is it doesn't think

00:42:48.079 --> 00:42:49.599
it's not there's no like it's not on

00:42:49.599 --> 00:42:50.160
your level

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:52.800
it's not going to the y empowering it's

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.680
not on p

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.760
it's like ai is really good at certain

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.960
things

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.839
like uh like uh like computations ai's

00:42:59.839 --> 00:43:00.640
real good at

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.560
figuring out like manual tasks like

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.400
labor work ai is really good at but

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.680
things like uh

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.440
deciding whether to give a loan to a

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.200
family ai is not really good at that

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.480
yeah but the problem is in terms of

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.319
predicting behavior i think

00:43:12.319 --> 00:43:13.599
they're not perfect at it but i think

00:43:13.599 --> 00:43:14.960
that's a problem so you can have them

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:15.359
get

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:17.119
have so much information that they can

00:43:17.119 --> 00:43:18.560
start predicting behavior pretty good

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.079
and then you send that to a human

00:43:20.079 --> 00:43:23.680
human goes yeah hmm yeah i'm gonna start

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.640
a gymnastics job then i'm going to kill

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.119
myself

00:43:27.119 --> 00:43:29.280
yeah how did like he get there he was

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.680
like oh oh your ankle let me get let me

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.440
i think i mean again these were little

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.280
girls so he'd be like you know he'd i

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.560
don't i gotta loosen you up

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.560
i think i think he would like you seem

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.760
stressed i think you would be like i

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.040
think you dislocated your pelvis and

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.560
start doing this and as a doctor you can

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:43.200
go

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.160
i'm gonna have to check something

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.880
internally and then it would just finger

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:50.160
which is like dude how pumped are you on

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.839
fingering

00:43:51.839 --> 00:43:54.079
so you're 45. yeah he was living every

00:43:54.079 --> 00:43:55.839
single [ __ ] every seventh graders

00:43:55.839 --> 00:43:57.280
every seventh graders dreams true he

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.640
might have been stuck i just wanted a

00:43:58.640 --> 00:43:59.520
[ __ ] finger

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:00.880
he went back to their school i want to

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.800
finger so bad yeah he was in the recess

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:03.760
yard just like

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.160

saves it for the ladies you see his

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.040
right hand he might have been like the

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.160
dude that might have been his

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:26.800
[ __ ] uh what you gonna call it anakin

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.240
nassar might have been he might have

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.680
talked he might have taken him out

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.520
he was already a good coach he's like i

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:32.880
just want to win the medal and he was

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:33.200
like

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:36.240
i can show you how yeah this

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.839
use the power of rape what was the guy

00:44:39.839 --> 00:44:41.599
what was the coach who was sending him

00:44:41.599 --> 00:44:42.880
to larry nassar

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.960
getting out of it would he get to like

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.160
watch or something like what the [ __ ]

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.599
how was he involved in it i don't know

00:44:47.599 --> 00:44:48.560
apparently he was

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:52.079
doing it also what yeah

00:44:52.079 --> 00:44:54.079
[ __ ] so he was hopping on it

00:44:54.079 --> 00:44:55.920
yeah man they're tag teaming he'll never

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.119
be here to be able to tell his side of

00:44:57.119 --> 00:44:57.680
the story

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.319
so he can only assume i mean yeah the

00:45:00.319 --> 00:45:00.960
fact that he

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.720
was got killed dude or suicide or

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.000
whatever that

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.920
is like you have epstein dies and that

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.520
was crit that people still are like yeah

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.119
that was clearly some sort of thing

00:45:09.119 --> 00:45:10.319
where it's like yeah

00:45:10.319 --> 00:45:12.160
they like the cameras didn't work and

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.760
the guards weren't there it's like all

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.440
right guys

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.720
that should be there there should be

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:17.920
should have a room i'm pretty sure if i

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:19.200
wanted someone not to kill themselves i

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.319
could devise a room

00:45:20.319 --> 00:45:22.000
and set up a thing for like two days i

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.200
could be like i'm pretty sure i can make

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:23.760

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.359

downward curve just no one i've never

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.040

hook i've seen upwards but i've never

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:52.000
seen a downward curve i mean you really

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.520
can't do it you could only do the oil

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:54.800
rig if that's your case you mean like a

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:55.760
pirate hand

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.800

00:48:04.839 --> 00:48:06.720
mm-hmm

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.319
but if you have a [ __ ] reverse ram's

00:48:08.319 --> 00:48:10.000
horn i don't think i don't know what

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.040
you're getting done with that other than

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:11.599
reverse

00:48:11.599 --> 00:48:13.839
doggy you'd have to like do doggy from

behind and just kind of toss it back

00:48:15.599 --> 00:48:18.079
yeah you could reverse cowgirl her true

00:48:18.079 --> 00:48:19.119
you could sit on top

00:48:19.119 --> 00:48:21.359
and ride it ride it i think that's just

00:48:21.359 --> 00:48:23.200
the captain hook

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.319
you might have to now you're talking

00:48:24.319 --> 00:48:26.160
you'd have your own sex position that

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.640
you could only do

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:30.160
yeah and you'd have to be in pretty good

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.440
shape to pull it off you need a decent

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.480
amount of dick if you're coming if

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:35.359

so you have a downward facing dick so

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.800
you need to approach women

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:45.839

be like okay

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.240
he would die there'd be no part of him

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:28.720
that would be like

00:54:29.119 --> 00:54:33.359
i just squished a frog oh cool

00:54:33.359 --> 00:54:35.920

it's [ __ ] up yeah

00:54:49.359 --> 00:54:50.640
that's actually exactly what you would

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.520
imagine would happen yep it's [ __ ] up

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.880
they just like puked their entire

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:56.240
innertube everything i mean the sheer

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:59.280
force of a human being against a frog

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.000

00:55:02.559 --> 00:55:03.920
you were blowing them up too weren't you

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:05.520

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:06.880
catch catfish and put

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:09.440
m80s in their gills and they'd just

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:10.559
literally explode

tie like yeah fireworks to fish and just

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:19.200

that's just genetic because like my

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:24.480

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:36.079
some kids don't get a complete boyhood

00:55:36.079 --> 00:55:37.440

00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.319
trapped

00:55:38.319 --> 00:55:39.520

like it was like that size

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:40.960
yeah you had a big rock wait so where

00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:41.599
were you wait

00:56:41.599 --> 00:56:42.960
you must have been in waiting then yeah

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:44.960
i was in detroit with my brother and my

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:46.720
cousin we're staying out back because

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:49.280
we're just out back and then like i

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:52.160
picked up this rock and there was a bird

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:54.480
and i just dropped the rock and they hit

00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.400
the burner bay went square

00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:59.200

just saw the bird in trouble

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.799
it's so hard to sneak up on a bird and

00:57:08.799 --> 00:57:10.480
drop a rock but i don't think they the

00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.079
one thing they don't anticipate is like

00:57:12.079 --> 00:57:13.359
the acme anvil

00:57:13.359 --> 00:57:15.040

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.960
it was probably a city bird a pigeon

00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:24.640

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:26.079
that just walks out of the way when you

00:57:26.079 --> 00:57:27.760
walk near it you can easily crush it

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:30.079

but then we kind of we have these

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:39.680
constructs where we

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.240

think i got an adulterous body

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.400
no way dude i've surrendered the parts

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.920
of myself like that desire

01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:58.400
surrendered impossible dad to surrender

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.640
it dude

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:02.560
that's low low frequency stuff you

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.080
desire you just surrender it

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:05.520
it's a mechanism i mean i'm not going to

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:06.640
talk about that right now but what

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.320
having sex with people no the mechanism

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:09.520
of surrender

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:10.640
you work your way up the levels of

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:12.159
consciousness and surrender the lower

01:14:12.159 --> 01:14:13.760
levels so that all that trapped energy

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.040
can be put it towards other things at

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.159
the higher level

01:14:16.159 --> 01:14:20.400
so like you know i think apathy

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:21.760
well anger is a little higher up is

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:23.440
right below courage but yeah dude it's

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:24.560
you know you start surrendering all

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.400
those things and your whole experience

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.080
changes pretty crazy but

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:29.520
because you're what you experience is

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:31.280
coming from your your level

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:32.880
of vibration you're you know operating

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.719
on when you surrender like

01:14:34.719 --> 01:14:38.400
shame guilt anger pride

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.080
then from there you go to courage and

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:41.440
then that's when things start to change

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:42.080
and you know

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.840
you can work your way all the way up you

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.400
know how you test it

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:49.440
tell me please tell us first you have to

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:51.280
you have to surrender first what do i

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:53.199
have to surrender the lower levels

01:14:53.199 --> 01:14:56.560
notice when you notice the lower

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.920
if you're angry at something someone

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:00.320
else does it's just triggering a thing

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.760
inside of yourself

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:04.560
that you have to surrender that and then

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:05.920
you know they'll do what they do but

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:06.400
it's

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.600
triggering something obviously if

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:08.480
they're not like if they're holding you

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:09.840
down and like [ __ ] your ass that's

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:10.480
different

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:11.679
yeah but if you see something that's

01:15:11.679 --> 01:15:13.280
bothering you that's something you have

01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:14.560
to surrender within yourself

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.920
and then the energy you spend getting

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.679
[ __ ] up about that thing all right but

01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:18.480
then what happens

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.719
if i surrender all that you start to

01:15:20.719 --> 01:15:22.080
reach higher levels of consciousness and

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:25.760
your outer experience starts to change

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:29.040
pretty nuts pretty cool

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:31.199
pretty cool pretty tight are you the

i'm never going to tell anyone who it

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.159

if i told them who it was it makes it

01:17:54.239 --> 01:17:55.760
even funnier

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:58.560

your dream where you were just like

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:13.920
what never said the second half the

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.360
second half of the dream was me publicly

yeah it's really just there's like

01:18:32.239 --> 01:18:33.520
archetypal parts of your brain that

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:34.640
you're just dealing with that you're you

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:35.679
know the only way you can express

01:18:35.679 --> 01:18:36.480
through you know

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:40.640

did you feel that's the thing

01:18:44.159 --> 01:18:45.600
the symbology people get hung up on what

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:46.800

close to an accusation

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:26.960
do you think so yes i don't think

yeah but it has to the only way i mean

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:36.400
no i'm not saying he's doing it i'm

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:36.960
saying oh

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:38.880
[ __ ] young white chicks in college as

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.639
a black dude that's working security is

01:23:40.639 --> 01:23:41.600
a

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:44.400
major risk as far as getting accused of

01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:46.400
something so because in order to get the

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.400
the in order to kind of like stoke the

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:49.840
ire of cancel culture you need to have

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:50.800
power

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:52.159
so if you don't have any power no i

01:23:52.159 --> 01:23:53.360
don't think you'd be canceled i'm just

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:53.920
saying

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:56.320
accusations of rape the guy is also in a

01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:58.480
position of perceived power

01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:00.480
but they would be like your honor anyone

01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:02.080
on a mountain like 15

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:04.560
hours in perceived power he did mold her

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:06.800
[ __ ] you have no power yeah

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.320

i don't know that they can uh

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:31.040
i don't know they would do that because

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:33.520
right now they're getting like cuomo

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:35.280

01:24:42.639 --> 01:24:44.080
chicks it's become kind of

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:46.080
uh out of fashion against black dudes of

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:48.000
rape i don't think they do it they were

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.840
they were big on it for a while

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:51.040
i think they're not doing it so much

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.940
anymore uh trump's going it'll be back

01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:55.520

because abe lincoln did a speech and was

01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:59.520
like no black man should be

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:02.800
enslaved or so he's like that's it

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:04.639

he shot the president in the back of the

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:15.280
head

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:16.880
he kind of [ __ ] ruled he walked

01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:18.080
straight up to him i was like i actually

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:20.719
disagree with your policies

01:29:20.719 --> 01:29:23.040
yeah that was the thing to push him over

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.800
the edge he was like

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:27.280
that was he was like i think slavery

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:28.960
thing's actually pretty good

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:30.880
i i i'm sure it was more than that i

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:32.320
mean it was the he

01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:34.800
he it was the war it was the whole war

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:36.400
yeah it was after the war he was he was

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:37.199
ticked

01:29:37.199 --> 01:29:39.120
yeah he was ticked with how things went

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:41.199
he was a gay actor a bunch of black guys

01:29:41.199 --> 01:29:42.800
in the field listening to the president

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:45.920
yeah he was ticked and he was he was a

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:46.880
gay actor

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:48.639
oh was he yeah he was an actor john

01:29:48.639 --> 01:29:50.840
wilkes booth was gay he was a actor so

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:52.480
yes fair enough

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:54.320
especially but he did do something that

01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:55.600
was very not gay

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:57.120
which is shooter president in the back

01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:58.880
of the head kind of the most ballin

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:01.360
wait did he one of the suicide guys too

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:02.400
john wilkes

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.320
i'm not going to court uh i think they

01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:05.920
might have shot him up i forget i think

01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:07.120
he was like hiding in a barn and they

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:08.800
lit it on fire

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:11.040
yeah wait they smoked him out i think

01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:12.080
they tried to smoke him out and they're

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:13.600
like get out here he's like i bet you i

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:16.159

like you need to face justice no i don't

01:30:19.199 --> 01:30:21.199
no

01:30:21.199 --> 01:30:23.120
yeah i wonder i wonder what that was

01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:24.159
it'd also be funny knowing you're going

01:30:24.159 --> 01:30:25.600
to kill someone and then hearing them

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:26.800
say something like

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:28.560
lincoln being like i'll see you after

01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:30.239
the play and then john walks with like i

01:30:30.239 --> 01:30:31.280
bet you how much do you want to bet he

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:32.639
doesn't

01:30:32.639 --> 01:30:34.320
i bet he doesn't see you i mean how hard

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:35.440
is your heart pounding before you about

01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:36.560
to shoot the president in the back of

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:37.120
the head

01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:39.440
in a public space yeah that'd be

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:40.800
nerve-wracking and then jump out of the

01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:42.719
balcony he jumped off the balcony onto

01:30:42.719 --> 01:30:44.719
the stage break his leg he broke his leg

01:30:44.719 --> 01:30:46.960
he yelled like [ __ ] tyrants yeah that is

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:48.400
