00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.400
yeah worked against you know allegedly

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.080
no no no it was totally true

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.759
yeah so they got no it's been leaked so

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:17.840
they no the emails were there that the

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.880
dnc was like

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.880
we got to get rid of this guy yeah so

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.479
that was real all right i'm very i'm no

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:24.479
one's aware of that everyone's highly

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:26.160
profitable that one's real but because

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.840
russia found it it doesn't count

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.479
is that how it worked yeah the yeah they

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:30.880
were like

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.639
the left was like well who cares about

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.639
that yeah what matters is who

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:38.000
found this email and we think it was the

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.639
russians

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:40.639
so that's who we need to focus on not

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:42.000
the fact that

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.360
we're not even listening to voters we're

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.039
just picking who we want well it's also

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:46.400
it is funny which i think actually they

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.280
can do

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.000
what uh i think a political party can

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.039
just be like no this is who we're

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:52.479
running oh for sure i don't know

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:53.759
i mean that's what they did no they

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:54.960
can't it's but it's like a magic trick

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.240
it has to have everyone has to be

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.680
convinced that like they did it they're

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.960
like yeah this is yeah

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.199
yeah well that's what they did this year

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:02.000
where they had

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.319
all the other major like mainstream

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:05.120
candidates drop

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.199
out the same day yeah so that everybody

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:09.120
voted for biden versus

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.360
yeah i noticed i noticed how they all

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.639
were like i'm the person and all of a

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:13.840
sudden they're like nah i'm cool yeah

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.360
all of us are gonna drop out at the same

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.080

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:34.800

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.160
he was yellow to covet

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.120
he was like i shouldn't have been at

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.520
that party kovit's very real

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.039

it's very serious you kiss the ring dude

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.680

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.199
he talks [ __ ] until he gets [ __ ]

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:55.199

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:59.199
is like i'm with whoever just beat me

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:02.080
he's like a stray dog he is he's just

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.960
loyal to his abuser

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.800
yeah now he worships covet now he's out

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.080
campaigning for kobe

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.039
is he a republican yeah i think he's a

00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:13.599
mole

00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:14.800
i think it's pretty clearly he's working

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.120
for the team he's clearly working for

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.520
covent

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:22.639

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:25.280
dare make fun of my disease

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.360

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.400
governor dude true

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.560

yeah yeah jersey i'm telling you i uh oh

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:36.080
wait hold on now before i forget now

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.440
that we're talking politics i do have to

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.719
retract

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:43.039
my affinity for comey on showtime

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.160
let me explain as i just criticized them

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.519
for being yellow

00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:48.959
and turning on their own opinions this

00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:51.360
is a true opinion i was hungover

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.399
laid up laid up in beezer's lair so i

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:58.080
wasn't exactly all there i was emotional

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.440
and i thought it was pretty good and

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.800
then i got home my

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.200
my roommates were watching in new york

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.560
and i just sat there and i was like oh

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.320
[ __ ] i was way wrong about this

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.519
but it was too late i couldn't get my

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:11.279
opinion back out true i couldn't be like

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:13.360
look i made a mistake two hours ago

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.320
i had to wait a full week to be like yo

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.720
that [ __ ] sucked i apologize

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.080
i was i was enjoying seeing trump

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.399
even but then i watched a regular trump

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:25.680
interview and i was like oh yeah trump's

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.480
not this

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.000
yeah like it was brennan gleason's

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.800
version of him was like

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:34.320
like very like evil and then i saw a

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.680
trump clip and i'm like oh yeah i forgot

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.800
i thought he's great

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.920
so you saw the real deal and you're like

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.279
this is the least racist person in the

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:41.040
room as soon as i saw him say he was the

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.560
least racist person in the room i was

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:42.880
like

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.240
what was i thinking that's such a wild

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.200
[ __ ] take

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.200
it is funny though cause like if you do

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.800
get accused of racism like that you

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.480
can't there's nothing you can say

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.320
there's nothing you can point to and be

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.760
like no i'm not i know

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.440
you can all you can do is trump out and

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.040
be like i'm literally the least racist

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.160
person here

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.680
i mean dude it's a sick i'm the least

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.440
racist person i know i'll tell you the

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.120
least racist person i know right now is

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.160
chelsea handler

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.920
true do you see her little thing with 50

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.560
cent no but i remember seeing her

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.640
show at least racist person she did a

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.600
whole show about like

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.640
confronting her white guilt okay so

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.360
dude she goes to it she goes to a spoken

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.240
word like a

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.720
poet jam and then asks to speak at the

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.760
end

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.279
and he's like i just want you to know

00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:29.279
that i'm sorry it's a bunch of black

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:30.160
people like

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.480
what the [ __ ] uh i think somebody even

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.160
criticizes her on that which is good for

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.839
them she's like oh yes thank you yes is

00:10:35.839 --> 00:10:36.320
that true

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.320
this is actually true speaking of love

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.240
being admonished and whipped dude

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.920
well she apparently must be i guess her

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.680
her white privilege special

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.440
gave her the necessary powers to remind

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.040
50 cent that he's black and should vote

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:47.760
democrat

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.600
oh she did that publicly yeah he was

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.040
like [ __ ] this dude sixty percent

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.720
i'm not paying [ __ ] this is [ __ ] and

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.240
she was like i had to remind 50 cent he

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.279
was black which

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:56.560
you know maybe she's kidding but it's

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.360
like no one on earth needs to remind

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.200
50 cent that he's black dude

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.680
that's literally like if if you wanted

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.440
to pick the blackest dude on earth

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.839
maybe it's 50 cent fully made and

00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:10.720
they're they're

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.079
naturally they're at odds mayweather and

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:13.920
50 center they're boys but they beef

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.880
they're highlanders dude

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.160
they want to be there only can be one

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.000
blackest person on earth so they hate

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.440
each other mayweather's

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.079
the [ __ ] man dude both of them do

00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:22.959
rule

00:11:22.959 --> 00:11:24.560
yeah but that was the uh except i think

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.399
mayweather like occasionally tags up a

00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:27.680
lady that he's with

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.839
everyone's wife you can't toss a couple

00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:30.880
you can't turn it off

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.720
we'll toss a couple comments but well in

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.240
his defense he's a counter puncher so

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.040
she obviously

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.760
first true he is a counter never even

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.640
thought of that

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.839
she probably came in he was just

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:51.560
[Laughter]

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.120
he's so quick before he even knows what

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.120
he does she's like i don't want this

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:55.440
card

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.839
and he's like he's like a werewolf like

00:11:57.839 --> 00:11:59.120
you know werewolf movies where they're

00:11:59.120 --> 00:11:59.920
like go go

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.320
run get out of here i'm gonna he's

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.440
probably like don't

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.120
don't even try it and if you throw

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.079
anything at him he's just

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.440
getting hit with a four piece

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.600
but yeah i'd love the footage of that

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.360
just mayweather getting screamed at by a

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.680
lady

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.680
just in his own house

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.560
probably in like pajamas oh my god

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.040
[ __ ] well yeah there's no way you can

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.160
temper like a

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.160
settle down calm down like a woman

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.519
beating mode i think

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:36.720
the way he throws is like full fury

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.440
so it's got to be like he's small does

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:39.920
does he

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.200
make true this is like the greatest

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.200
boxer i'm being real now

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.120

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.280
come out and be like i kind of like his

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.720
economic power it's got you know you

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.120
probably go

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.960
you probably start trending but numbers

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.960
wise well i don't know if it was true

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.200
i think just the thing like the proposed

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.039
tax plan of anybody that makes over four

00:19:15.039 --> 00:19:16.720
hundred thousand dollars gets taxed

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.360
62 yeah so of course everybody that

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.799
makes over four hundred thousand dollars

00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:22.640
was like

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.760
i gotta lose 60 percent of my

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.600
that's that's insane yeah nobody's gonna

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.760
vote for that yeah that's wild

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.440
yeah i've seen stuff about that before

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.200
how that like the tax plan gets kind of

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.480
like misquoted and it's like i think

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.120
that's probably

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.720
this much is technically uh you know

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.400
blah blah but you would imagine that's

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.360
the case

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.799
i'd hope you know it's a tough that

00:19:40.799 --> 00:19:42.559
means this is clean we're in the middle

00:19:42.559 --> 00:19:43.919
of a you know political war these are

00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:45.679
classic tactics be like oh you don't by

00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:46.960
the way he's going to take all of your

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.600
money

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.840
you're like [ __ ] that yeah you know the

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.200
other guy's racist

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.880
but i think it is actually you know what

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.120
actually i want to say i think it's uh

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.480
i think there are proposing stuff like

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.960
that in california that is like 60

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.240
yeah that was the other thing that only

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.760
everybody in texas was talking about was

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:02.240
just the

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.480
exodus of californians yeah out of

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.400
california and into texas

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.840
i think there's legitimately like

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.039
something in california that they're

00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:10.240
they haven't passed it yet that's a

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.480
thing but they are proposing like a 60

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.600
it is a from what i've seen it seems

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.240
like a

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.440
hellscape california it's just like

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.880
high taxes tick tock and fires

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.679
right now like truly hell true

00:20:25.679 --> 00:20:27.520
restaurants are pretty good

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.480
beaches oh yeah you're right i'm so cal

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:30.960
bro

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.960
matt ranks cali over texas by the way

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.400
listeners matt thinks california's

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.360
cooler than texas

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.960
i say i enjoy it more i don't know if i

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.559
don't know if it's cooler

00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:40.400
yeah i'm a beach man dude you are a

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.080
beach bum dude i love the beach i'm more

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.520
of an atlantic ocean guys

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.720
pacific's got nothing for me yeah i'm

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.799
more op ocean pacific i need i kind of

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:47.520
you know i kind of like to have a

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.080
wetsuit on you know

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.559
i'm an enemy of a wetsuit the wetsuit is

00:20:52.559 --> 00:20:55.280
the enemy of all fats

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.840
award if i wore wetsuits i'd be

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.640
devastated

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.960
i'd look like lena duncan i would

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.280
atlantic ocean is track one i thought so

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.360
too man pacific i had a big i had a big

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.640
i liked the pacific last time i was in

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.760
it because you can go to the pacific

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.200
ocean i mean they do this the polar bear

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.400
plunge in the atlantic

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.840
but you can hit the pacific ocean when

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.400
it's like 50 degrees out but the water

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:20.880
is like

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.679
[ __ ] 45 freeze you know i'm a i'm i

00:21:23.679 --> 00:21:25.280
like taking cold plunges

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.799
but that idea of going the atlantic

00:21:26.799 --> 00:21:28.400
ocean was like 10 degrees out and like

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.360
going in like

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.120
you know 35 degree water i'm like that's

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.799
just crazy that's crazy that's that's

00:21:32.799 --> 00:21:33.600
too much that's

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.520
nuts i do have a shower i do in the

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.520
exercise exercise i do in the shower

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.720
right now

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.640
heavy meditative exercise dude if i turn

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.320
the water like all the way i jack it all

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.600
the goal which i always did

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.039
but i always would kind of like like

00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:46.799
cringe and kind of fight it yeah

00:21:46.799 --> 00:21:49.039
and now it's pretty tight you turn it

00:21:49.039 --> 00:21:50.559
all the way cold just full blast you're

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:52.080
just [ __ ] give it to yourself

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.240
and has did you ever do that before yes

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.200
it's almost like you can't breathe

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:55.919
you're like

00:21:55.919 --> 00:21:58.960
it kind of takes your breath away i just

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.799
tran not trance out but i just noticed

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:02.240
the fact that the water's cold while not

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.600
reacting to it

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.360
pretty sick nice see how long i can hold

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.960
that for it's pretty tough i have a

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.320
dual nozzle so when i get out i turn the

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.520
hot off first

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.360
and then hold it and see how long i can

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.919
handle the cold

00:22:16.159 --> 00:22:17.919
i do that often well you can't not

00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:19.120
that's the other thing too i like i was

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:19.679
like

00:22:19.679 --> 00:22:21.280
like this is cold water i'm like all

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.039
right i think i'm not flinching

00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:24.799

00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:27.440

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.440
exercise it just [ __ ] flies out of

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.960
you dude it's a very energizing thing to

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.000
hit cold water

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.200

patreon things are gonna get very scary

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.159
it's gonna be a

00:23:18.159 --> 00:23:20.880
very scary episode it's not a bad idea

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.200
you think you're gonna get you thinking

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.320

yeah that's so fun immediately forgot it

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.080
actually i'm curious about this i have a

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.240
uh speaking of my bae

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.120
do you so if your bae was like we have

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:35.679
to share

00:23:35.679 --> 00:23:39.039
our location never you won't do it no

00:23:39.039 --> 00:23:41.840
see i do do it because it's like at

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.919
first i was bitterly opposed to it then

00:23:43.919 --> 00:23:46.480
i'm dude you want you want big sister

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.760

existed for sure you want big sister

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.360
look at this

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.520
here's the trade-off though nah again

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.720
it's well first of all

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.320
you know keeps your boy honest because

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.679
it's like there's literally it's like

00:23:57.679 --> 00:23:58.400
you can't

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.640
you don't do anything like i know shady

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.919
exactly but i'm also

00:24:01.919 --> 00:24:03.520
i'm basically like a uyghur right now

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.440
dude [ __ ] there's a full i have full

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.720
surveillance i literally yeah you're in

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.000
a surveillance state it'd be easy it

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.039
would be easily like

00:24:09.039 --> 00:24:10.320
because they're old things like i get so

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.360
nervous i need to know where people at

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.480
blah blah blah i was like whatever

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.679
so i thought about it first i was like

00:24:13.679 --> 00:24:15.120
absolutely that's a psyop by the way go

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:15.919
ahead

00:24:15.919 --> 00:24:17.679
you were thinking that's a bad trick i

00:24:17.679 --> 00:24:19.520
guess yeah but it's the other thing

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.080
the other thing too here's what no no

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.039

00:24:23.039 --> 00:24:23.840
tricked

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.000
no look here's what it's good for when

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.039

oh for food like dude oh it's just think

00:24:40.159 --> 00:24:42.159
of the risk we ran every time we fapped

00:24:42.159 --> 00:24:43.679
as young men being like

00:24:43.679 --> 00:24:45.360

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.440
weird if not not like weird like oh you

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.039
shouldn't do that it was like

00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:40.399
functionally i was like i'm gonna [ __ ]

00:29:40.399 --> 00:29:41.919
something i'm gonna [ __ ] my ass up yeah

00:29:41.919 --> 00:29:43.200

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.159
ass up for this

00:29:44.159 --> 00:29:45.600

[Music]

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.880
here's the rule of thumb if you go

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:13.679
without

00:30:13.679 --> 00:30:15.279
a significant other and i'm not

00:30:15.279 --> 00:30:16.720
imagining you guys situations if you go

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.080
without a significant other for

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.679
three years you automatically play with

00:30:19.679 --> 00:30:20.720
your ass at some point in those three

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.360
years

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.480
just happens no man chants a dry spell

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.080
for that that's

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.679

00:30:27.679 --> 00:30:29.760
touching your ass maybe a 23

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.640

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.640
her lip-syncing donald trump on

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.480

and then just being like let's make a

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.440
whole industry out of this one shitty

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.320

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.079
it's just no it's just a lemon

00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:32.480
they do they see a thing gaining like

some sort of critical mass

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.440
and then like these people you know

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.119
people in the industry just go

00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:38.800
yeah to a human being and they just

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.320
squeeze a bunch of money out of them and

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.200
then they're like all right

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.480
and they're like yeah we're gonna we're

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.079

like you know long

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.040
long term plot it's just kind of like

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.400
but hers is here's the thing that's

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.440

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.079
professional massage

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:24.720
step two we're gonna start making phone

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.119
calls

00:41:25.119 --> 00:41:28.079
try to get out of this i'm gonna start

00:41:28.079 --> 00:41:29.280
making some phone calls we're gonna

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.960
start moving money around

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:34.000
i need to be somewhere

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.520
i do think it was like one of those

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.520
unemployment cards that like he

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.119

00:41:39.119 --> 00:41:40.880
his last and he's like i'm obviously

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.079
going to get a professional massage with

00:41:42.079 --> 00:41:43.680
this then this one probably this should

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.400
kick in

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.400
by the time i need it and then i try to

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.319
swipe it

00:41:48.319 --> 00:41:51.440
[ __ ] oh man i wonder if the

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.720
professional masseuse got paid i could

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.240
have been a [ __ ]

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.319
i think i think they must they have to

00:41:58.319 --> 00:41:59.680
it could have been a common run

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.280
like what is that called like foursquare

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.720
or what's that thing called

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.000
it's like that oh do you think they get

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.160
paid they have to get paid

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.599
it'll tell you right away but if your

00:42:07.599 --> 00:42:08.720
card i wonder if you went to a

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.079
professional masseuse and you were just

00:42:10.079 --> 00:42:11.359
kind of like

00:42:11.359 --> 00:42:12.480
they must make you pay up front i

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.000
believe they have to because everyone's

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:14.400
positive

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.280
if you're going to professional

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.440
masseuses you're also the type of guy

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.720
who would

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.920
take off true and run yeah i would say

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.319
it's about 10 post nut

00:42:24.319 --> 00:42:26.319
yeah what a feeling that must be just

00:42:26.319 --> 00:42:27.920
running down a street

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.680
having just come and ripped off a

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.440
[ __ ] masseuse oh that must be

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.240
crazy i mean it's got to be tough you'll

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.079
get stabbed very quickly oh yeah some

00:42:36.079 --> 00:42:37.599
actually a city worker just uh

00:42:37.599 --> 00:42:41.040
shot a sex worker male sex worker

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.960
yeah a city worker a city employee who

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.640
worked for the da's office

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.720
just you know ha the story the official

i don't besmirch this man

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.119
but apparently the official story is

00:42:55.119 --> 00:42:57.520
just there was a d.a worker

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.040
the guy who worked in the da's office

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.960
and there was a you know a male

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.480

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.839
maybe he's not in it i'm just talking

00:49:55.839 --> 00:49:57.200
that's your pink elephant

00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:01.040
yeah you're just like louie's back

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.359
it's a lighthouse i'm you know i'm lost

00:50:03.359 --> 00:50:04.880
at sea dude i see a beacon of light i'm

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:05.520
like yes

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:08.000
yes there's a chance out of this it's

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.599
also funny too you're in a drunk fevered

00:50:09.599 --> 00:50:11.200
state you're just kind of like oh god i

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.079
feel hard oh

00:50:12.079 --> 00:50:14.000
louie this is like a [ __ ] mystical

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.839
vision yeah

00:50:15.839 --> 00:50:17.599
i'm happy when i see the guy you go back

00:50:17.599 --> 00:50:19.119
out like i saw louie on the show

00:50:19.119 --> 00:50:20.720
like shane and he didn't wasn't on show

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:23.920
i saw him i could have sworn

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.839
it's about a special yeah

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.240
coming around dude i'm telling you once

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:33.040
they this is my prediction you know hold

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:33.920
me to it

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.640
i think the democrats will take power

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:37.520
and then they'll

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:38.960
cancel cancel culture in their own way

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.079
they'll make a look guys this is getting

00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:40.800
ridiculous

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:42.400
yeah that's my prediction that's what i

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.079
think is going to happen that's just my

00:50:44.079 --> 00:50:44.880
prediction

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:48.000
i can't go on disagree you think so i

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.599
think it'll go on for a while

00:50:49.599 --> 00:50:51.680
i think we got another we got a couple

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:53.200
years we got a long time

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:56.559
yeah maybe a decade more of just

00:50:56.559 --> 00:50:59.599
well non-stop [ __ ] like

00:50:59.599 --> 00:51:02.720
what perhaps i don't know we'll see

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:05.119
because here's the thing the left if the

00:51:05.119 --> 00:51:06.640
democrats win the left won't consider

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.000
that a victory

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.680
the leftists like the people that are

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:11.440
like hardcore [ __ ] like

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:12.880
yeah will vote for biden because he's

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:14.559
better than trump but we need more than

00:51:14.559 --> 00:51:15.200
what he's doing

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.240
people that won't say out loud they

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.920
support law and order they will they

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.040
refuse to do it yeah

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.720
antifa is an idea law and order i'm not

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.319
gonna say it yeah that

00:51:22.319 --> 00:51:23.760
like further than that like people that

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.119
want the green new deal [ __ ] like that

00:51:25.119 --> 00:51:25.520
yeah

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:27.119
dude how about how about biden saying

00:51:27.119 --> 00:51:29.359
he's gonna shut down oil

00:51:29.359 --> 00:51:31.200
dude i mean trump was just like ooh

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.800
repeat that what do you say

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.960
that's [ __ ] hilarious to just be like

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.480
that was big everybody let's stop the

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.760
debate

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:38.720
people were like yeah we're gonna stop

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.160
doing oil and do all renewable energy

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:42.319
i'm like [ __ ] yeah that's [ __ ] sweet

00:51:42.319 --> 00:51:43.839
but it's like yeah but it's just not

00:51:43.839 --> 00:51:45.200
feasible that's what i'm saying exactly

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.160
it's the same thing with immigration

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.680
it's like we should let everybody like

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.040
in my head if you ask me i'm like yeah

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.240
we should just like

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.680
yeah we shouldn't even let everybody in

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.040
let's let everybody in you know it's

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:53.280
like

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.960
that sounds good that sounds great to me

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:56.800
but yeah as i got older i'm like

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.079
you see the videos about there's like

00:51:58.079 --> 00:51:59.599
billions of people who are starving i

00:51:59.599 --> 00:52:01.200
mean i've said this before and it's

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.280
just not feasible dude it's like having

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:04.240
a party it's like in

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.839
planning a wedding and you're just kind

00:52:05.839 --> 00:52:07.520
of like i

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:08.880
i should invite my whole name it's like

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:09.839
planning a wedding and then all of a

00:52:09.839 --> 00:52:11.440
sudden like a bunch of mexicans want to

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.640
come

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:16.240
and you're like uh no it's like

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.280
even when you're playing a wedding

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:19.280
there's like your own like people who

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.040
might be attached to your family in some

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.319
way and you're like

00:52:22.319 --> 00:52:23.440
you gotta build the world based only

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:25.200
fits as many people i only have this

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.400
much money and it's like

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.880
well you should invite 300 more people

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.839
and you're like

00:52:29.839 --> 00:52:31.440
that's economically completely

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.440
infeasible you're [ __ ] up and it's

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:34.400
like

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:36.400
how do i put this yeah yeah exactly so

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:37.520
you know true

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.280
i'd be all for it i'm all down for it

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.880
people like yo and the other thing too

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:42.160
is like

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.160
the fair thing to do would be like if

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.839
you're if you were like you know like

00:52:45.839 --> 00:52:47.440
100 percent knocked down the wall

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:48.960
which big right well you you have to

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.880
like what does not foster but like what

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.240
is it called when you when you like take

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.640
in like a foreign exchange student

00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:56.319
host i think it's called a host you

00:52:56.319 --> 00:52:57.680
should have to host a foreign family

00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:59.359
that's totally fair i would be like all

00:52:59.359 --> 00:53:00.800
right that's cool if what

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.079
if you're like yeah we should you know

00:53:02.079 --> 00:53:04.559
if you want to go like full bore against

00:53:04.559 --> 00:53:06.000
immigrant anti-immigrant any kind of

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.440
immigration laws like you know no one's

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.720
illegal it's like okay that's cool it's

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.319
fine cool we won't do that

00:53:10.319 --> 00:53:12.079
uh but if here sign this little thing

00:53:12.079 --> 00:53:14.079
saying you can host a family that's

00:53:14.079 --> 00:53:15.440
all that's all i'm saying it's an

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.440
interesting take yeah i think i think

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:19.200
djt actually did hit people really i

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:20.400
think what he sent he was like all right

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.160
you guys want to be a safe haven states

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.040
no problem

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.319
yeah send anyone over we'll send

00:53:24.319 --> 00:53:25.760
everyone over to you guys so i liked i

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.200
liked watching the media pretend

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.119
trump didn't absolutely dominate that

00:53:29.119 --> 00:53:30.720
debate yeah

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.319
it was fun to watch immediately after

00:53:32.319 --> 00:53:33.920
them being like well

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:35.760
that debate probably didn't sway anybody

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.119
either way

00:53:37.119 --> 00:53:39.839
it's like nah dude i watched it that was

00:53:39.839 --> 00:53:40.480
yeah

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.960
that was a guy who could kind of think

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:44.640
versus a guy who literally was just up

00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:45.599
there like

00:53:45.599 --> 00:53:47.920
it's a fair assessment i mean at the one

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:49.280
point that actually was like but he

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:50.480
would make fun of him and bind would be

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.640
like

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:54.800
it's kind of hard to watch at one point

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.720
my favorite play of biden's i think this

00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.000
is uh this probably will win him the

00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.280
election is when he looks directly at

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:00.000
the camera goes

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.680
come on guys you know what i you know i

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:03.760
love tools and hammers and belts in

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:04.720
delaware

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:09.760
and reading text 8442 to democrats

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:11.839
yeah if there was ever like a talk i'm

00:54:11.839 --> 00:54:13.040
like oh my god he's speaking if there's

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:14.160
a tough part he's like

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:16.800
yeah i'm talking to the camera you you

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:17.839
know me

00:54:17.839 --> 00:54:19.760
damn and trump ethered him on that oh

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:21.760
that was that was like

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.119
yeah that was a rough one it's like you

00:54:23.119 --> 00:54:25.200
know what i love about the suburbs

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:29.040
delaware come on

00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:31.280
come on and then trump goes like will

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.559
you stop with that

00:54:32.559 --> 00:54:34.000
he's like that that's what won him in

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.440
the election in 2016. that's what he

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:36.799
said i hate all these guys these guys

00:54:36.799 --> 00:54:38.240
are politicians i'm not that's what he

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:39.839
literally said during that he was like

00:54:39.839 --> 00:54:41.200
here they are [ __ ] oh they're trying

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.040
to shut me down that is this is

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:47.599
this is vote stuff i guarantee it what

00:54:47.599 --> 00:54:48.640
yeah they won't even talk to their

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:49.920
[ __ ] guy they're afraid i had to take

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:50.960
that they figured

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.400
i tried to take another call last time

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:53.760
same thing they're just people who call

00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:55.040
you who just don't answer the phone it's

00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:55.920
like

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:58.000
yeah i don't even think that's a person

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.040
no i don't even know what that

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.480
what's happening what's going on sorry

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:01.920
about that but yeah that was that was

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.920
the point in the debate when uh

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.240
when trump got his he regained his

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:08.160
stability because the last debate trump

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:10.319
sucked blew it he i would say he lost

00:55:10.319 --> 00:55:12.160
people people say he did he was just so

00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:13.520
[ __ ] annoying and it was like dude

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.760
this guy sucks if you can't definitively

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:16.640
beat him that

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.240
biden and debate you officially well he

00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:20.160
just i mean he just needed to shut the

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:21.040
[ __ ] up yeah

00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:22.480
so then they implemented that mute

00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:24.720
button and it was like oh [ __ ] trump's

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.319
way better at this

00:55:26.319 --> 00:55:27.920
when he's not allowed to just [ __ ]

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:29.839
scream the whole time

00:55:29.839 --> 00:55:32.799
he just wouldn't shut the [ __ ] up yeah i

00:55:32.799 --> 00:55:33.359
mean

00:55:33.359 --> 00:55:35.839
think about this like if you had seen

00:55:35.839 --> 00:55:38.000
this is a this is a fair

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.520
uh let's say a fair question

00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:43.119
that was like unthinkable during like

00:55:43.119 --> 00:55:45.280
when obama was running against whoever

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:47.920
if obama was i just started thought

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.440
about you running in a room while

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:52.640
jerking off it's like a mental patient

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:55.040
getting like held down by like orderlies

00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:59.280
no no i'm wearing like an eagle city

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:02.160
yeah imagine if obama was doing that

00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:03.440
like the whole time like

00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:06.160
uh uh uh uh oh dude he would have gotten

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:06.799
[ __ ]

00:56:06.799 --> 00:56:08.559
he's yeah you're right eviscerate for

00:56:08.559 --> 00:56:10.319
sure so that is a fair point

00:56:10.319 --> 00:56:13.599
it is although he was he against hillary

00:56:13.599 --> 00:56:16.400
yes like dude imagine the back when it

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:17.839
was obama versus hillary this was my

00:56:17.839 --> 00:56:19.200
original point when this obama verse

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:19.920
hillary

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:21.200
you know i just spit out like symphonies

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:22.400
dude that's kind of i'm just you know

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:23.760
did you see the kanye joe

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:28.240
i was drunk and so i threw it on

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:31.280
i was playing fifa and i put on spotify

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:31.760
on my

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:34.799
xbox one put it on i was playing the new

00:56:34.799 --> 00:56:35.680
fifa

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:38.640
and so i just put on the rogan episode

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.640
with kanye and it was like

00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:44.000
i was like am i [ __ ] hammered i was

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:44.240
like

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:45.839
i genuinely i listened to it for like an

00:56:45.839 --> 00:56:48.160
hour yeah and i was like

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:50.079
i must be [ __ ] up because i don't

00:56:50.079 --> 00:56:51.599
underst i don't know what

00:56:51.599 --> 00:56:52.960
if you're drunk no no that's not your

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:54.319
fault and then i yeah and then i

00:56:54.319 --> 00:56:56.000
listened to it sober the next day like

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.280
all right this was

00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:00.000
incoherent this is if you're drunk it

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.359
must be the most torturous thing

00:57:01.359 --> 00:57:02.880
that was crazy i watched it on a plane i

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:04.480
total undivided attention

00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:07.280
so i was like i i hear you know there's

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:10.079
like an overarching larger point

00:57:10.079 --> 00:57:12.000
there's an overarching elbow [ __ ]

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.680
chair dude you pick green i gave you the

00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:16.000
option that's cause green is

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.760
i know dude i seriously i wanted the

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:20.319
green um but yeah i watch it also i'm

00:57:20.319 --> 00:57:22.400
very i'm really really pulling for kanye

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.559
to not be like totally nuts so i'm

00:57:24.559 --> 00:57:25.680
worried i remember

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:28.160
we had somewhat of a heated debate on

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:29.440
this out on this one

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:30.960
debate was spotted well i was like no

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.119
kanye is a [ __ ]

00:57:33.119 --> 00:57:35.520
crazy dude he is crazy he's he's a

00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:36.799
different thinker i'm also

00:57:36.799 --> 00:57:38.200
you know i don't i'm not like a full

00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:40.160
anti-psychiatrist but i do different

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:41.119
thinker

00:57:41.119 --> 00:57:42.240
things a little different thinker dude i

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:44.240
mean the thing that was disappointing

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:45.680
it's a funny way to describe like

00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:47.760
[ __ ] people come on come on

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:49.280
no way dude i don't mean like that bunch

00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:50.559
of a different thinker well this here's

00:57:50.559 --> 00:57:50.799
the

00:57:50.799 --> 00:57:53.119
here's the thing you have to ask you

00:57:53.119 --> 00:57:54.480
have to ask does he

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:56.160
is he legitimately a billionaire because

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:57.760
that's like a that's a thing that like

00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:58.960
really kind of he's like well i'm a

00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:00.559
billionaire and you're like all right

00:58:00.559 --> 00:58:02.000
that's the old rule like you know people

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:02.640
who are

00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:03.839
billionaires aren't crazy they're just

00:58:03.839 --> 00:58:05.680
eccentric so it's like

00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:07.359
pulling together that guy he does say he

00:58:07.359 --> 00:58:09.359
brings in 30 million dollars a year

00:58:09.359 --> 00:58:11.520
so it's like is that a millionaire like

00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:12.880
you know to me i'm like how are you

00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:14.880
how are you a billionaire yeah but

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:15.920
apparently if you i think it's like if

00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:17.359
you add up all the assets all this all

00:58:17.359 --> 00:58:18.640
the stock all this blah blah blah so

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:20.160
it's like all right maybe so

00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:22.400
um but yeah he does that whole thing

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.000
kind of i did find a little bit annoying

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.839
when he'd be like that's just a symphony

00:58:25.839 --> 00:58:28.400
it's like yeah scattered i do that i

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.040
just it's

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.480
scattered well it's just weird to hear

00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:33.119
like he's a self-proclaimed genius

00:58:33.119 --> 00:58:35.119
yeah that's very annoying and it's like

00:58:35.119 --> 00:58:36.319
you're a music producer

00:58:36.319 --> 00:58:39.760
that designed like crocs for adidas

00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:42.559
like true he put people in like matrix

00:58:42.559 --> 00:58:43.119
outfits

00:58:43.119 --> 00:58:46.799
like torn ups minimalist obviously torn

00:58:46.799 --> 00:58:48.559
up like future clothes

00:58:48.559 --> 00:58:50.960
yes and crocs and was like i'm a [ __ ]

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:51.680
genius

00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:55.520
i'm walt disney yeah it's like shut up

00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:57.359
dude well that's the thing

00:58:57.359 --> 00:58:58.799
i like his mix i've never listened to

00:58:58.799 --> 00:59:00.559
any other music producer and been like

00:59:00.559 --> 00:59:04.319
genius like i'm never like dj khaled

00:59:04.319 --> 00:59:07.040
genius can i be fair all walt disney did

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:09.440
was draw a [ __ ] mouse

00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:11.280
music is harder than drawing a mouse

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:12.880
okay

00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:14.799
yeah you think changi is more talented

00:59:14.799 --> 00:59:15.920
than

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:19.040
walt disney yeah disney hasn't done [ __ ]

00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:19.599
you're right

00:59:19.599 --> 00:59:21.440
other than control the entire united

00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:23.599
states he didn't do that bob igor does

00:59:23.599 --> 00:59:25.520
that well kanye's about to

00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.599
he's trying he's trying to do that i

00:59:27.599 --> 00:59:28.720
hate no i hear what you're saying that's

00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:30.160
a fair that's a fair point

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:31.599
but there are there is that thing too my

00:59:31.599 --> 00:59:33.200
my point is you know wait you're going

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.160
to you're going to

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:35.680
i don't give i don't know enough about

00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:37.440
walt disney but i bet he did more than

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.200
draw a mouse he hated the jews

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:40.880
i do remember that which is kind of why

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:43.680
i'm standing up for

00:59:44.319 --> 00:59:45.599
no the mayor's point is not that it's

00:59:45.599 --> 00:59:47.040
just like you can almost break down

00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:48.240
anyone's thing

00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:49.599
into being like well what you're just

00:59:49.599 --> 00:59:51.599
doing this like you're saying like a

00:59:51.599 --> 00:59:52.799
comedic genius like

00:59:52.799 --> 00:59:54.720
well going around joking i would say

00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:56.480
comedic genius is fine

00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:01.040
yeah if you are a comedic comedic

01:00:03.119 --> 01:00:04.319
that's true that's that's one of the

01:00:04.319 --> 01:00:05.920
things that kind of is the rub with him

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.760
is that he's constantly calling himself

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.280
i remember watching like a [ __ ] like

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.119
mtv cribs episode or something with him

01:00:11.119 --> 01:00:12.480
and it was like a painting and he was

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:12.880
like

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.760
this is how i see music a lot of people

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.040
hear it i can see it

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.240
he sees colors and it's just like all

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.240
right dude yeah

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.559
take it easy no well the thing that kind

01:00:22.559 --> 01:00:23.920
of go ahead

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.920
it's called synesthesia it's a thing

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.280
yeah it's a thing yeah sure

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.040
i have it a little bit but yeah it is

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.799
what it is and yeah i can see it

01:00:30.799 --> 01:00:33.440
i see i can see the words come out i

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:34.799
have a very low i sort of gotta have a

01:00:34.799 --> 01:00:36.480
very low grade form of synesthesia where

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:37.839
if i stare at a thing it just the world

01:00:37.839 --> 01:00:38.799
goes black and white

01:00:38.799 --> 01:00:40.240
so it's the opposite i'd all color

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:41.520
vacate and like it happened to me at

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.119
church when i'd be doing dog eyes

01:00:43.119 --> 01:00:45.280
i get dog eyes dude yeah i literally did

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.640
i started werewolf out when i'd be in

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.000
church i'd stare if i stared at the

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.040
freeze for long enough

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.960
the priest would be in color everything

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.319
else goes in black and white and i just

01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:52.799
go

01:00:52.799 --> 01:00:54.400
and eventually i like go like that so it

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.839
goes like schindler's list like the girl

01:00:55.839 --> 01:00:56.720
with the red jacket

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.640
yeah kind of that's always but it hasn't

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.400
happened i've i've been stared at a

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.520
priest for a while so it hasn't happened

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.160
but like dude

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:03.200
they used to freak me out when i was in

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.440
church yeah everything would go black

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.640
and white i remember constantly being

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.160
like [ __ ] i might be a priest

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.799
[ __ ] this [ __ ] yes oh you thought like

01:01:10.799 --> 01:01:11.839
that was your calling that was your

01:01:11.839 --> 01:01:12.400
vocation

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.400
because they told us the vocation is

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.520
that [ __ ] you up

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:16.960
when you go to catholic school forever

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:19.440
they explain what like the calling is

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.559
that priests get

01:01:20.559 --> 01:01:22.880
you're a [ __ ] kid you're sitting

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.480
there like am i getting called

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.559
that's like you literally still believe

01:01:26.559 --> 01:01:27.599
in santa

01:01:27.599 --> 01:01:29.440
and like all that [ __ ] and then they're

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.040
like also god's magic

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.559
and he's gonna tell you when he wants

01:01:32.559 --> 01:01:34.400
you to work for him yep so you're like

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.000
in your head you're like i'm special god

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.680
would want me to talk in first grade

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.119
yeah it's wild bugged me the [ __ ] out

01:01:39.119 --> 01:01:39.440
yeah

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.920
i remember just thinking literally it

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.920
went way too long before

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:45.520
yeah i'm like that's just my thoughts

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.280
i'd be like in first grade like i don't

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:47.599
know

01:01:47.599 --> 01:01:50.480
yeah legitimately at that point was like

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.359
you know if i'm

01:01:51.359 --> 01:01:53.839
being bad god's watching me at that

01:01:53.839 --> 01:01:55.440
point in my life i was like you know

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.359
first being like a first second third

yeah that's that's that's a tough one to

01:03:36.079 --> 01:03:37.440
try which was tough because i had just

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:39.920
gotten off a very serious god kick

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.640
i was like reading the bible hold on i

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.400
loved god so you're religious at first

you were super religious

01:03:45.599 --> 01:03:47.119

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.440
about your religious period

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.280

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.839
you still you're very pious

01:04:07.839 --> 01:04:09.200
not like not a bad way like very

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.960
non-mystical like very straightforward

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:11.680
religious like

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:15.280
i was a [ __ ] traditional casualty

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.599
an old bishop yeah god that's so funny i

01:04:17.599 --> 01:04:18.640

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.960
i mean dude it it is tight if you know

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.640
if you can keep that alive long enough

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:24.160
being super religious sixth grade i

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.839

01:04:25.839 --> 01:04:27.440
before plays

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.200
in my mind like sitting there praying

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:30.480
before everything how good did you do

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.160

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.680
division one athlete eventually but

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:34.720
that's what i'm saying probably through

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.079
the power of christ

01:04:36.079 --> 01:04:39.119

for sure except like a hardcore

01:04:55.359 --> 01:04:56.799
christian comic that's like violently

01:04:56.799 --> 01:04:59.599
anti-semitic

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:02.319

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.000
missionary work

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.799
so this is sorry i don't mind so this is

01:06:38.799 --> 01:06:40.720
the uh the thing i liked about the kanye

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:41.520
interview

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:44.000

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.520
fully going

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:48.079
new traditional regime or new religion

01:06:48.079 --> 01:06:48.720
regime

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.640
of being like you know we're all going

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:51.680
to we're all going to get super

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:52.559
religious

01:06:52.559 --> 01:06:54.079
okay here's the idea of having a thirty

01:06:54.079 --> 01:06:55.839
thousand person not religious like that

01:06:55.839 --> 01:06:56.480
but like

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.559
uh thousand person states stadium

01:06:58.559 --> 01:07:00.240
singing gospel music

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.079
having people have i mean it's the ideas

01:07:02.079 --> 01:07:04.720
are how good is our god

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.160
yeah it's pretty like that kind of

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.559
[ __ ] rules yeah his idea of kind of

01:07:08.559 --> 01:07:09.280
like

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.720
cutting through like material culture

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.160
and like we got to learn how to start

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.520
like growing [ __ ] we got to start doing

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:14.720
this all that stuff like this

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:18.880
[ __ ] stuff is sick but then again

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.160
the problem is you're hearing these

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.079
ideas you're like this is sick and then

01:07:22.079 --> 01:07:23.119
like

01:07:23.119 --> 01:07:24.640
the thing that i found disappointing was

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:25.760
that like rogan would ask him

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:26.799
straightforward questions like how do

01:07:26.799 --> 01:07:28.079
you structure your day and he would just

01:07:28.079 --> 01:07:30.400
be like

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:32.400
you know a funny thing about me being a

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:33.760
genius and it'll just like go off on a

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:34.079
thing

01:07:34.079 --> 01:07:35.920

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.240
you have no idea no he's not talking

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:51.680
jack dorsey

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.599

i will i will say have you retracted

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.960
some of your statements on yay

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.960
because after seeing that interview i

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.240

be wrong right i stand

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.359
correct you stand on firmer ground than

01:08:19.359 --> 01:08:20.799
before that when i said he was

01:08:20.799 --> 01:08:23.359
he seems kind of just like a bit of a

01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:24.159
balloon

01:08:24.159 --> 01:08:27.199
yeah i mean again he's great i like his

01:08:27.199 --> 01:08:29.120
music i love his music

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.560
no no and i'm cheering for him and i

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:31.839
like to see him do well it makes me

01:08:31.839 --> 01:08:33.359
happy it makes me laugh when he does

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:33.679
well

01:08:33.679 --> 01:08:37.279
me too but the thing that i am

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.359
i think this is where i'm hung up on

01:08:39.359 --> 01:08:40.799
them yeah there's the things you watch

01:08:40.799 --> 01:08:42.239
you're like god this is so disappointing

01:08:42.239 --> 01:08:42.960
like i hate

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:44.080
just hearing someone refer to themselves

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.920
as a genius is weird not being able to

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:47.040
answer straightforward it doesn't look

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.400
like he like was evading

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:50.480
like he didn't want to but he'll just

01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:52.159
like how do you structure your day and

01:08:52.159 --> 01:08:52.799
he'll just

01:08:52.799 --> 01:08:54.239
start going but i think he's on this

01:08:54.239 --> 01:08:56.080
thing where like whatever comes to his

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.600
mind he has to say

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.960
because he's in like pretty serious

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.719
communications with god in his head he's

01:09:00.719 --> 01:09:02.159
like you know he's like

01:09:02.159 --> 01:09:04.239
i said god make me never feel pain my

01:09:04.239 --> 01:09:05.600
mom died right after

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.880
so this dude's pretty convinced that

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.319
like you know he's on like some like old

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:09.839
testament prophet level

01:09:09.839 --> 01:09:11.359
yeah which is i'm like that's cool i

01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:12.880
kind of do enjoy that damn you're gonna

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:13.679
love

01:09:13.679 --> 01:09:16.480
[ __ ] uh good lord bird oh yeah you're

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:17.839
gonna love it dude that's exactly what

01:09:17.839 --> 01:09:20.319
it is i kind of enjoy that it's [ __ ]

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:23.759
uh john brown just completely like

01:09:23.759 --> 01:09:26.480
i'm here from god yeah and just willing

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:27.279
it's it is

01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:29.040
it's exciting for him to watch that it's

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.400
like you know for a guy to go out and be

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:31.520
like you know maybe we shouldn't like

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.880
when he calls like abortion culture like

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:33.600
we shouldn't like

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:34.960
totally be celebrating that in my head

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:37.040
i'm like all right it's kind of sweet

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.480
yeah but yeah when again when you watch

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.759
a dude you're like is this guy just

01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:41.199
ignoring the question on purpose is he

01:09:41.199 --> 01:09:42.560
not

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.319
it was it was tough i was pulling for

01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:46.159
him and i was like i do get the

01:09:46.159 --> 01:09:48.719
overarching thing he's trying to say for

01:09:48.719 --> 01:09:50.080
the most part but it was just kind of

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:50.799
like

01:09:50.799 --> 01:09:52.960
yeah yeah that was that was a sigh on

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.080
the plane i was just i'll tell you what

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:54.880
i didn't like

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:58.080
to say what i didn't like about it was

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.239
defending him what just now that's what

01:10:00.239 --> 01:10:02.640
i didn't like about the kanye interview

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:05.440
lemare being like i think he's a genius

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:05.920
do you think

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:09.040
well then if you think he's a genius

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:12.480
who else is a genius in music that like

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.920
if that's what you're saying because if

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:15.679
you're if maybe we just have different

01:10:15.679 --> 01:10:17.600
standards for genius

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:20.239
because if he's a bieber's a genius no

01:10:20.239 --> 01:10:21.600
bieber doesn't be

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:23.280
so you have to produce to be a genius

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:25.199
you have to produce so dj khaled

01:10:25.199 --> 01:10:26.960
but he doesn't genius he doesn't rap or

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.480
anything he

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:31.199
he can sometimes he did once he's got

01:10:31.199 --> 01:10:32.239
he's got one hot bar

01:10:32.239 --> 01:10:34.080
yeah so you need to produce a rapper you

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:35.840
got to be like you got to do everything

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:39.440
like he there's nothing he can't not do

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:42.640
well no he can't do a podcast candy's

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.880
class was pretty lit

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:48.480
no i hear he's well he can't speak

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:52.960
he again i was watching it being like

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.560
you know i was following it i'm rooting

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.560
for the guy i know a lot of it i was

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.080
kind of it was that it was a little more

01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:59.520
discombobulated than i'd hoped for and

01:10:59.520 --> 01:10:59.840
then

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.280
you know when especially when they

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.159
started being like here's another

01:11:02.159 --> 01:11:03.440
symphony for you it's like

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:04.960
dude it's called not knowing what you're

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.400
talking about i'm the king of it i do it

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.040
all the time

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:08.480
yeah well it's like you know when you

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.640
just speak all disorganized and be like

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.159
nah dude that's just like who says i

01:11:12.159 --> 01:11:13.840
can't talk about one topic at once it's

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:14.080
like

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:15.360
you can talk about as many topics as you

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.600
want but for like functional coherence

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:18.480
and understanding

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:21.600
we tend to try to speak linearly like

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.760
we all can understand it helps um so

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:25.440
yeah it does kind of suck that you know

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:26.000
but again

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.520
it's like the thing that i i find

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.280
encouraging is that he'll be like

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:31.280
he'll she says he checks his own ego he

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:32.960
uses god now instead of having to feel

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.719
everything throws through so

01:11:34.719 --> 01:11:35.920
fueling his whole like things through

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:37.520
his ego and all of his actions he's like

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:38.880
seems like he's on a different type of

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.080
path so i'm kind of excited

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:41.600
that's cool genuinely i'm excited but

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.440
then jesus is king ruled

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.360
he had the music he makes is great the

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.880
last couple of things

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.480
are awesome yeah and in terms of being a

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.000
genius yeah they're i think

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.840
they're lyrically not a genius at all

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.080
lyrically

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:57.120
he is pretty bad he's he's

01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:59.360
there's songs like the one [ __ ]

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:01.280
father whatever it's like it's the most

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.640
beautiful music ever and then

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.800
he comes on he's like if i [ __ ] this

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:06.560
model and she just bleach

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.880
her [ __ ] and i get bleach on my

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:09.920
t-shirt

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:12.320
i'm gonna feel like an [ __ ] yeah and

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:13.120
people like yeah

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.520
true genius well to be like no that's a

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:16.800
[ __ ] guy screaming over an

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.800
incredible beat that he made

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:21.920
beautiful beat it's tough i mean i don't

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:22.880
think people are supposed to be called

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.880
geniuses until after they're dead

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:25.760
because you know because it's kind of

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.600
one of those things where it's a boss

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:28.560
true

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.560
excuse me you know because it's like you

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:32.159
know i would say louie's a genius

01:12:32.159 --> 01:12:34.880
stand-up comedian at comedy yeah yeah so

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.159
it's like you know but i'm not if i were

01:12:36.159 --> 01:12:37.120
that into music i

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.480
you know if i were i'd have more of a

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.400
different radar for like who's a genius

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:41.520
that i think i think that was a little

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:43.760
marriage yeah um

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.400
but yeah the kanye thing i was torn i

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:47.920
like enjoyed watching and i'm glad he

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:48.800
got the spins

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:51.360
glad rogan was kind of like i mean

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:52.560
that's the other thing too like

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:54.480
the guy's kind of weird but like that's

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:56.080
the thing if you're that weird

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.840
and you're also making you know say 30

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.199
million dollars a year and all this

01:12:59.199 --> 01:12:59.760
other stuff

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:02.320
if you know given all that's true it's

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.199
like

01:13:03.199 --> 01:13:04.880
should someone be medicated that was a

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.159
big question rogan kept trying to get

01:13:06.159 --> 01:13:07.440
answered like should you be medicated

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.400
out of that

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.880
so you know but i the one thing i don't

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.080
think he should be medic well

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.760
i don't know no i don't sound like a lot

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:15.520
of people did want to help him out when

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:16.840
he was wiling

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:19.920
yeah um for sure the thing i get caught

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:20.480
up on

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.719
i'm a utopianist so i i get and dude

01:13:22.719 --> 01:13:23.840
it's a fool's errand

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.199
it's an absolute fool's errands that's

01:13:25.199 --> 01:13:27.600
like what the communists want yeah yeah

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.320
some in some ways you're cali boy you're

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:30.960
callie boy

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:33.520
justin i'm more with texan true true i'm

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:35.040
utopianist but the um

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.480
that dude that booked the denial of

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.719
death i just finished finally following

01:13:38.719 --> 01:13:39.520
yesterday

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.040
he came he basically knocked some sense

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.640
into me talks about utopianists and how

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:43.520
it's like

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.120
you know we're we're basically dealing

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.600
with billions of years of just i think

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.360
they say like

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:51.840
like fibrous material being munched

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:52.719
between molars

01:13:52.719 --> 01:13:55.120
flesh being eaten and excreted with foul

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.159
the gases most

01:13:56.159 --> 01:13:58.159
foul or the stench most fouls basically

01:13:58.159 --> 01:14:00.640
like billions when was this book written

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:03.520
i think in the 70s maybe 60s 60s 50s it

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:04.719
was written old enough to be like

01:14:04.719 --> 01:14:06.080
homosexuals or perverts

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:07.600
yeah that was great that clips and it

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.280
wanted pulitzer so you got our enemies

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:11.040
yeah so it did like it was it has that

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.360
kind of language all of our enemies are

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.730
perverts sex perverts

01:14:14.730 --> 01:14:16.640
[Laughter]

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:18.320
but the uh it talked about utopianist

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.840
how it's like dude if you really look at

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.440
what's going on we've been we're part of

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:22.080
a

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.920
process of just life that's just like

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.440
not even like you were like my life you

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:26.159
know whether it's

01:14:26.159 --> 01:14:28.320
my life just yeah exactly not even my

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:29.199
just being like

01:14:29.199 --> 01:14:30.960
there's this life force within your life

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:32.560
dude it's now or not

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.480
true well that's that's the you know

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.320
that's the old like copy of a copy that

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:37.679
we've gotten to but he's talking about

01:14:37.679 --> 01:14:38.320
like

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.320
there was just cells that like inhibit

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:41.520
inhabited like

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.840
[ __ ] like unlivable gases that were

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:44.560
like

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.640
like squeezed through that into like

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.320
fish eventually that were in like the

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.159
prehistoric ocean that just

01:14:50.159 --> 01:14:52.000
eaten each other [ __ ] each other out

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.199
and then eventually there was like you

01:14:53.199 --> 01:14:53.920
know

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.080
dinosaurs if you believe in that woolly

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.840
mammoth humanoids

01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:59.760
and then so there's like this pulse

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.360
forward of just like uh

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.199
limitless expansion life you know

01:15:03.199 --> 01:15:05.440
whatever dominating your environment and

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:06.880
now we're humans and we're self-aware

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:07.520
and it's like

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:09.120
so the whole point is if you're that's

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.159
sorry it's a symphony but the whole

01:15:10.159 --> 01:15:11.360
point is if you build

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:14.560
a utopia there's that life force within

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.600
us that's you know we've

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:16.960
inherited from billions of years of

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.560
evolution that someone's going to try to

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:19.360
be like

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:22.000
wow and like just win the whole thing in

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.600
court and it's like you can't there's no

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:24.480
way around it

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.920
so there's like your life quote unquote

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.040
like my life's good or bad but there's

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.640
like a real life force inside of all of

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.320
us that's just like

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:31.920
like propelling us towards [ __ ] and it's

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.679
like it's it's kind of i think that's a

01:15:33.679 --> 01:15:34.880
genesis idea like

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:36.640
here's paradise oops here's a snake

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:38.560
unavoidable you can't get out of it

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.080
so that's that's you know that's when

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.600
kanye starts doing his utopia stuff

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:42.880
that's how i get hooked into it that's

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:43.840
the whole point i'm like

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.199
yes and then you know obviously read the

01:15:45.199 --> 01:15:46.960
denial of death and it's like i need to

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.080
be more stoic dude

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.840
true it's all you can do in the face of

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:51.440
this that's that's the end of the

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.640
bookstore

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.239
again it really is our you know what

01:15:54.239 --> 01:15:55.440
you've said before whatever the last

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.800
thing we read we're like this this is

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.159
obviously how we feel well it's track

01:15:58.159 --> 01:15:58.880
one every time

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:00.320
it is dude and that's that's what that

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:01.600
was kind of the whole point of it it was

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:02.960
just like dude

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:06.320
we're dealing with a horrible terrifying

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:09.120
scary shitty reality and anything that

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:10.560
makes you feel good about that

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.719
we we don't even know why we're here or

01:16:12.719 --> 01:16:13.840
why there is life

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:15.360
so like the only way it can be dealt

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:16.719
with he was saying the only way it can

01:16:16.719 --> 01:16:18.080
be contained is some like irrational

01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:19.520
kind of belief system which to some

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:20.000
level whether

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.679
we're like the biggest science head

01:16:21.679 --> 01:16:23.280
being like no man's going to cure all of

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:24.560
our own problems and everything's going

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:24.880
to be

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.640
just another version of like that whole

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:27.920
like salvation thing

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:30.239
so pretty cool yeah that's cool pretty

01:16:30.239 --> 01:16:31.920
good yeah i can't add too much

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.120
the book's [ __ ] the book's sick but

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.400
that would that was sorry that was the

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.920
thing from kanye of like

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:37.679
i was rooting for him so hard that his

01:16:37.679 --> 01:16:38.800
thing of like you know we're gonna

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:40.640
totally redo the way we do everything

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:42.640
which i'm like yeah this [ __ ] rules

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:43.679
but you know i think that was in a

01:16:43.679 --> 01:16:45.440
bukowski book where he was like i'm

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.640
looking at the ocean and being like

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.320
everything's in there just eating and

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:50.159
[ __ ] and [ __ ] mm-hmm

01:16:50.159 --> 01:16:52.239
kind of the exact same yeah that's all

01:16:52.239 --> 01:16:53.360

01:29:07.199 --> 01:29:09.520
well no it's just it's too much what

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:10.639
you're saying people are going to hard

true totally meaningless facts wrote a

01:29:17.199 --> 01:29:18.480

01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:20.159
he like had like intimate diaries and

01:29:20.159 --> 01:29:20.719

01:29:24.239 --> 01:29:24.880
circle

01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:26.639

01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:44.639
tricked

01:32:44.639 --> 01:32:45.920
i wonder if somebody out there was just

01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:47.360
like this would be somebody to just tell

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:48.719
both of them they don't like each other

01:32:48.719 --> 01:32:50.080
that's actually a hilarious thing i know

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:51.360
somebody who's

01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:52.639

behind my back the whole time

01:33:08.159 --> 01:33:09.679
perhaps because you know i tried to

01:33:09.679 --> 01:33:11.600

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:14.400
