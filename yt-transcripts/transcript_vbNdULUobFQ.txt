singing your praises moan when because I

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.360
was I was battling with my [ __ ]

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.400
gay-ass liberal friends in the carton

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.979
mm-hmm and they immediately knew it

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:32.850
wasn't me baby yeah no I mean I've been

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.770
like I don't know I'm keeping my mouth

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.840
shut you know I'm not saying anything

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.820
just watching wait but I've been red

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.229
cold on this [ __ ] virus from the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.810
get-go and then like the thing I turn it

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.460
around for me is cuz like I got a cousin

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.799
that's a nurse she's like an ICU nurse

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.590
in the city and she's like yeah we're

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.420
swamped you don't be masked and I tested

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.979
positive and my boyfriend's real sick

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.299
and I'm like I don't care she's in on it

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.210
roast Ruiz let me know I'll drop them

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.340
off at your house did you [ __ ] you Alex

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.140
Jones me into being if I am I have

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.939
[ __ ] [ __ ] for listening to you I was

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:13.010
arguing the car no but yeah no I'm

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.650
I don't know you're right no you're

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.209
right you got red pill and you're right

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.099
david icke said they're not even tested

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.750
for a cup at 19 they're just tested for

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.459
general coronaviruses so I pretty much

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.569
believe in ya so I need to know yeah I

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.280
mean it's like I said it I've been

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.630
trying to like just preface everything

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.849
like a couple weeks ago I said to Adam

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.860
up here you know I may I might even cite

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.810
on the show is that go be funny if you

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.880
know if they never use any of those beds

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.400
in the Javits Center that that ship the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.560
you know they docked in the harbor or

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.410
whatever the big-ass boat and then and

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.569
then they didn't so I guess there's

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:48.890
maybe like [ __ ] there's like a

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.090
hundred people in the Javits Center

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.299
they're like we need a thousand beds now

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.549
ICU cases they are declining not that

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.650
the the curve is flattening but now

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.140
there's less patients in ICU today than

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.480
there was a day ago which is you know

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.010
there haven't revised all these models

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.840
the models were supposed to account for

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.180
social distancing they said best-case

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.099
scenario we're looking at a hundred

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:11.450
thousand and two hundred and fifty

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.340
thousand people died and that's if we

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.410
observe like strict social distancing

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.910
and then a week later they're like oh

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.829
now you know now it's it's sixty

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.019
thousand it's like I'm sorry what this

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.519
is the whole point of a model that like

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.510
you don't just keep guessing everything

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.160
yeah the original I read an article in

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.150
the Atlantic they were like we're

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.739
guessing between like two million deaths

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.530
and $200,000 you can't give yourself

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.510
that range that's why we did all this

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.590
[ __ ] in the first place because they

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.600
were like 2.2 million Americans are

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.100
gonna die was that [ __ ] Imperial

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.730
College like study its 2.2 million and

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.560
that's if we do all this like social

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.269
distancing [ __ ] and then there were

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.100
additional studies that the users they

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.319
want any [ __ ] in Washington to

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.690
justify lockdowns and what like health

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.519
care professionals should be advising or

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.709
whatever and then that one said it was a

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:58.940
good last week where they said a hundred

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.560
thousand and two hundred and forty

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.510
thousand or something and then everybody

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.769
ran with that now that one's been

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.389
revised and they say it's sixty thousand

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.730
so we need more deaths you're saying you

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.859
don't amp it up no I mean it would be

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.739
funny model to be right yeah yeah I want

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.690
the bottle to be wrong and then I want

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.870
cuz with the funniest outcome is that

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.849
like Democrats have to continue

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:22.070
destroying the economy just to try and

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.140
figure out the best time to exit and

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.060
there will never be a good the only good

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.600
time to

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.320
is after the election I I like that

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.870
statement so much I've said that to

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.700
about eight different people since he

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.340
texted me that and I've passed it off

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.100
like I know anything please do I'm like

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.950
Cuomo is a [ __ ] [ __ ] dude even if it

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.210
was fine he would wait dude and you know

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.130
what you know it's awesome - it's like

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.370
if if if being if we're wrong if the

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.990
models are right and it's just a fluke

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.970
and red states start opening like if

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.800
they [ __ ] like Abbott and Texas

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.300
demands that everything opens back up

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.550
and Texas kills like a million people

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.670
like the response would be like that's

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.330
just part being a cowboy brother you get

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.670
sick sometimes the horse bucks you and

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.260
sometimes you break it and that's just a

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.410
part of life move on this is keep it

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.030
moving and they won't care at all

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.710
there's no negative consequences

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.270
there'll be a tight Dallas buyers club

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.670
reboot coronavirus [ __ ] Dallas buyers

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.400
club guy with this uh the hydro ketamine

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.130
or whatever the [ __ ] it is he's like I

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:37.010
got this club drug I heard about like

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.420
hey man why not yeah what could be bad

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.940
he's like it's not what I don't know

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:50.090
maybe hey you wanna do it there was no

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.590
answer it's like somebody talking you

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.930
into taking mushrooms you're not gonna

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.670
die but I don't know if it helps yeah it

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.620
is like the perfect you know Trump

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.990
moment is like this huge like pandemic

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.850
not pandemic whatever the [ __ ] is going

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.300
on and he's just every morning he's

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.670
playing in his head he's like he's maybe

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.320
listening to somebody and the reporter

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.250
is like what do you have to say he's

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:22.580
like shut up I'm so she oppressed not as

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.410
good as it used to be you're not gonna

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:30.560
go very far in this business he's

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.450
already asking president questions see a

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.230
future for you in journalism

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.080
he's a wartime president dude yeah he

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.030
gave himself the moniker wartime he's

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.950
our [ __ ] a wartime president they always

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:45.850
get reelected

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.550
I guess equal time presidents remain

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.770
elected big Joe Biden will wear gloves

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.170
in a mask in the debate that's its thing

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.150
it's like politicians like maybe maybe

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.100
50% of the time I have the right answer

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.630
and then there can be like disastrous

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.760
outcomes but they're usually like kind

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.400
of articulate you know but Trump is so

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.620
[ __ ] mean elegant and everything he

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.090
says sounds so stupid hit like I mean

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.650
he's just guessing with this [ __ ]

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:12.970
thing and I guess he has some kind of

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.830
like financial stake maybe in the drawer

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.870
who knows who gives a [ __ ] right but it

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.880
sounds so wrong so for him to be so

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.240
wrong but maybe as wrong as like the

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.800
lockdown respond I mean that's yet to be

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.990
[ __ ] seen because it's like these

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.370
models are changing there's not really a

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.800
[ __ ] explanation for it I guess but I

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.880
guess the point is is it like how he can

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.800
be such a good dope in the way he talks

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.410
and if you just did that with like other

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.300
presidents how funny like I mean like

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.940
FDR literally during World War Two was

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.340
like we just did our own Holocaust kinda

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.130
let me try that

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.600
maybe I've thought about it we always do

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.700
a Holocaust it's what we raised doing it

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.000
it's working very well yes the Germans

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.620
are doing it's working well yeah why are

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.210
we give it a shot I mean we could try

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.610
doing a Holocaust also and if that if

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.080
that solves it we'll just put them all

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.790
in jail the people we don't like well

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.620
he's gonna be right he said so much [ __ ]

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.670
they're like at the end of this if it

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.080
doesn't shake out with a million deaths

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.640
you know they told you guys told you

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.190
there's no big deal not even I mean 60

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.080
thousand is like a it's like a bad flu

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.460
season and then the argument is that

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.140
like oh whoa would have been way worse

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.910
if we didn't do social distancing and

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.290
it's like well what's the evidence of

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.470
that yeah only what is the evidence that

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.240
social distancing work because

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.070
everything that social distancing was

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.060
supposed to do that wasn't the outcome

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:34.030
yeah you know any geezers do we have to

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.550
lose how many geezers we got the

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:38.440
developers did millions so many like

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.150
probably like we probably got like 30

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.010
million geezers in this country I mean

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.720
Doody from the like an economy

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.760
standpoint that would have been if we

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.380
lost 30 million geezers that would have

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.200
I don't think old people even give a

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.590

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.760
saying he was like New York's been

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.190
prepared for like you know however many

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:29.450
years when was really bad for all the

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:30.920
murders all the time like this is not

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.180
that big of a deal amount of people

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.290
dying in New York right they're saying

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:34.700
like they're overwhelmed they don't have

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.930
to do with the bodies it's like dude

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.570
people's to die constantly New York not

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.670
that mean people used to die like no not

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.860
like this summertime murder back in like

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.750
this back in like the the deuce dude I

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.580
said during the deuce there was never

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.550
like it wasn't like 1100 a day yeah I

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:58.880
mean like 291 and it was like probably

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.940
like - like 2,100 murders in 91 and I

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.680
think that was really yeah that was like

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.610
the biggest year for New York damn yeah

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:10.700
not the tenth of that now damn that's

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.050
one like the diplomats were coming up

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.300
they were just young boys do they could

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.570
tell you what the 80s were like true I

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.280
think I had kovaydin got over it to be

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:24.770
honest I think no while he had kovat he

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.300
denied having it because he was ashamed

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.030
anyone get thrown a mass grave dude I

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.820
had in February and I'm pretty sure that

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.250
was that was just coronavirus our immune

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.790
systems are on fire do we champed it if

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.020

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.080
around you dude you're fine with credit

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.070

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:44.630
beard you should shave it I'm like mmm

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.950
that sounds like dumb [ __ ] advice

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.870
sounds like some some lady doctor came

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.780
up with she was jealous of penises dude

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.150
[Music]

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.040
maybe because your dumb [ __ ] face can't

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.160
protect you from viruses you can't grow

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.560
a shield yeah isn't that exactly what a

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.110
beard is yeah it is it's quite literally

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.540
why we evolved beards is so I don't get

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.420
every school and get rid of the show

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.819
your work requirement all that [ __ ]

00:16:52.819 --> 00:16:56.480
true your work that everybody he's not

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.220
[ __ ] meaningless yeah man I'm till I

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.769
I'd be curious I think it's something I

00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:05.540
think it was a real virus that came

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.329
through and people saw it and said oh we

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:09.890
can crash the economy with this that's

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.390
my personal - I think that's what

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.839
happened

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:14.390
Trump's economy is ruined right now I

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.490
think people were kind of like [ __ ]

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:17.809
hos economy it was like your immune

00:17:17.809 --> 00:17:21.850
system broke on me and David red-hot

00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:24.919
anyone has any [ __ ] idea I think it's

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:27.260
like I I think it I don't think it was

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.540
even that level of I mean to some degree

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.190
I think maybe like investors were

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.080
probably I mean it would make sense that

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.169
like RIS analysts and like all the big

00:17:36.169 --> 00:17:38.179
money all of the investors Wall Street

00:17:38.179 --> 00:17:40.070
and all that watch the thing forever it

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:42.140
was already priced in they knew there'd

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.179
be some kind of [ __ ] bailout the

00:17:44.179 --> 00:17:45.950
extent that it destroyed the economy it

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.130
took jobs away from

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.590
like tear tickets at the movies here you

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.270
know I mean people that are out of work

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:55.050
or like [ __ ] people Nagas anybody

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.000
that like waiters and waitresses the

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.190
hospitality industry at the end of the

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:01.470
growth and in the financial sector

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.750
probably and so I think - what do you

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.820
think the [ __ ] guy unemployment rate

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:12.380
is consistently um probably like Apple

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:16.950
we're looking at possibly watermelon

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:22.170
percent I'm happy to see waiters [ __ ]

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.720
fall on hard times take a look at this

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.120

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:33.360
ladders it's on an a-frame oh look at

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.880
this that's when you know that's a good

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.800
index of an economy being on fire the

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.390
[ __ ] employment [ __ ] or [ __ ]

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:44.010

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:12.210
the flag immediate six different kind of

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:13.590

00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:00.369
most and it's like you know the numbers

00:26:00.369 --> 00:26:03.389
are there that it is most of course

00:26:03.389 --> 00:26:05.799
it'll probably be like Ovid made my

00:26:05.799 --> 00:26:08.080
voice deeper I'm a trans woman and made

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.210
me sound deeper I never used to talk

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:15.850
like this Byron's ain't all my medicine

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:19.119
in my body you know the extra June in my

00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:22.179
body yeah I'm uh I'm excited I'm excited

00:26:22.179 --> 00:26:23.769
to power through this and come out on

00:26:23.769 --> 00:26:26.799
the other side victorious yeah can't

00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:28.690
wait what's the other side and what is

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:30.489
to victory look like in the context of

00:26:30.489 --> 00:26:32.609
Crona betrayed back to a gigantic crowd

00:26:32.609 --> 00:26:36.489
tons of money spreading it around yeah

00:26:36.489 --> 00:26:40.539
oh yeah like to a country go to a most

00:26:40.539 --> 00:26:41.610
concert whoever

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:44.940
for all of our the comics we don't like

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.220
all of their clubs and dates getting

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.710
cancelled yeah I mean everybody

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:51.540
everybody's days Scott can't I mean

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.520
depending on how long it's like comedy

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.810
clubs might just [ __ ] go out of

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:55.320
business

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:59.610
across the board you know I I talked to

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:00.870
it I talked about before and I think

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.730
you'd be in there are some clubs that I

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.320
think are actually expanding right now

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.450
like the ones that had money they're

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:08.190
just gonna core it's just gonna be like

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:09.690
mom-and-pop shops are closed

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:13.020
yeah like Walmart comedy yeah I love it

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.660
right yeah great so probably suck it's

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.280
gonna be all funny bones that sounds

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.720
great what happened in the [ __ ] 1990s

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.350
it destroyed stand-up comedy yep yeah

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:26.880
well everyone can see the same eight

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.900
comics rotating yep it'll be good whoo I

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.250
can't wait to go back to those days when

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.560
it was one guy that controlled who books

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:40.290
you know 19 rooms in the country yeah

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:43.290
that'll be it but now I mean it is

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:45.210
different we're podcasts have changed

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:47.430
that you can just yeah you know you can

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:48.750
do podcast and just go to a [ __ ]

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.460
theater do you think it's like yeah now

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.960
the podcast blows I mean it's like

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.430
[ __ ] night and day having like an

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:56.640
audio name I mean like I was supposed to

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.010
I go out like once a year now you know

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.020
like a handful of shows which is enough

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.180
but yeah it just felt like a string of

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:04.590
shows lined up it would have been a week

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:06.150
out of my life and then it's all door

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:07.800
deals and you walk away what's like

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.430
[ __ ] $30,000 yeah yeah it's great

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:13.050
what's so funny like our podcast is and

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:15.230
you know on that level but it's like

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:17.760
we've been doing you know we have I'm

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.890
new relatively in the stand-up world

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:23.130
headlining and I have fans yeah there's

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:24.360
so many comics that have been doing this

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.060
headlining for decades yeah with zero

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.950
fans with zero yeah and it's because

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:31.110
they don't know because the podcast

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.360
thing is the [ __ ] answer yeah yeah

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.130
that's awkward dude when you do when you

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.440
do a show I did a I was doing like a

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.510
TopGolf place I went out and it gives

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:41.130
you like a hundred blocks to go do a

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:42.480
show and there's people coming out from

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.220
the podcast like dude you [ __ ] cast

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.170
rules there's no I've been there for a

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:48.540
while doing comedy you know my [ __ ]

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.580
who have been like what is this and I

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.440
was just like it's Casper oh yeah dude

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.360
you drew more at a topical

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.630
then like major headliners draw in like

00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:59.669
comedy clubs yeah it was pretty not like

00:28:59.669 --> 00:29:00.929
major but you know I mean like people

00:29:00.929 --> 00:29:04.409
that like yeah if you do the Late Show

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:06.149
it was more it was a more of a draw than

00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:07.980
if the Late Show for sure it was

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.860
actually pretty funny yeah they would

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.149
have anyone they're comics which is fine

00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:15.330
you focus that is the worst part about

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:19.140
having podcast tell the other comics

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.460
they suck the whole time

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.950
see I was a victory for me though it's

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:23.880
like I don't I kind of want to

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.409
transition not to stand up it's still

00:29:25.409 --> 00:29:26.639
leverage the audience I don't think

00:29:26.639 --> 00:29:30.510
about getting into hate speech my

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:33.570
attention was good going and doing

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:38.450
public hate speech like cameo

00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:40.679
yeah you go onstage stand up except

00:29:40.679 --> 00:29:42.149
there's a podium and you just get rid of

00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:45.750
all the punch slots in sit at the end

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:51.650
you just say no I'm serious no I mean

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:54.139
[Laughter]

00:29:54.139 --> 00:29:57.019
and would you who would you go against

00:29:57.019 --> 00:30:02.130
literally every [ __ ] right there's got

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:03.510
to be something new they're always

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:04.980
coming up with new [ __ ] they hate that's

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.950
how that's how progressives work drill

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:10.559
hmm yeah that'd be pretty cool to go out

00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:12.029
and just like have a bunch of people

00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:13.320
thinking they're gonna see a comedy show

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:18.539

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:34.350
while you would just walk around and

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:36.450
film people mm-hmm like Pete the people

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:37.950

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:40.680
with the camera never say a word so

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.390
people just spaz out and start like he'd

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:44.310
film like a homeless guy that sounds

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.640
vaguely familiar and it's like a smooth

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.360
experiment to be like hey you're being

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.130
watched anyways it's just when it's not

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:52.860

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.410
this guy seems like a real [ __ ] but

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:00.120
at one point he was in Chinatown he just

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.280
walked up he just went into a house and

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:07.680
it was like probably like 15 Chinese

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:13.230
people just playing cards just standing

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:16.290
there with the camera three minutes when

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:18.800
I was like that

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:24.630
and then he went back in and they like

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:28.150
he walked in on a piece they're just

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:32.710
like dude they honestly didn't give a

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:34.510
[ __ ] that this dude walked into their

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:37.410
house yeah what if it was a girl's I

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:39.580
mean maybe it was some sort of card

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.110
thing but it was clearly he was out of

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.320
place

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.840
sure he was filming he's it was in an

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.610
apartment and there were just two tables

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:52.120
of dudes playing war - China has the

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.790
same virus right and we have it and like

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:56.500
to get people to social distance they

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.240
have to make it about the individual

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.830
they have to make it about like you need

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:01.630
to be a hero and like well you know

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:05.320

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:28.660
immediately tased and netted it's just a

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:32.100
list of animals that you're alive II

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.420
oh [ __ ] yeah this is this is our

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:39.119
Normandy Matt you're exactly right yes I

00:35:39.119 --> 00:35:44.010

the hot tub was barely ready on the

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:52.920
first day yeah and even people who are

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.480
losing their jobs are like well we're on

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.800
unemployment and we're getting like a

00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:00.869
bonus so what is that the yeah you gotta

00:36:00.869 --> 00:36:02.160
fill out the census though to get your

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.369
bonus you want to avoid reward you need

00:36:05.369 --> 00:36:06.869
to fill out the census you only 12 hunch

00:36:06.869 --> 00:36:09.480
that kinda makes your yang freedom

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.090
dividend you gotta fill out the census I

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:14.760
do understand you know you gotta prove

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.410
you're a person why are they trying to

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:18.960
count everybody oh wait you could just

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.880
lie on the census though yeah

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.990
so like what it what is that who's kid

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:26.400
who's keeping counting what are they

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.050
doing with it that information goes to

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:32.730
further models you know the disease

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:34.800
right yeah I guess still I collect taxes

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.970
they want to know how many people here

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:39.050
but still it's like what you guys doing

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:41.310
they've been doing that since forever

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:47.940
yes dude since Jesus yeah Wow is now

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.470
like well they were in like Jerusalem

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:52.369
for like the census or some [ __ ] oh

00:36:52.369 --> 00:36:55.290
there was a census back then I probably

00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:57.000
like Herod was trying to find out how

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.230
many boys there were so he could start

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:00.060
killing them yeah it seems a good Roman

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:01.740
thing to do is walk around Bill's house

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:08.369
and count people I think the wops are

00:37:08.369 --> 00:37:09.840
doing what their Italy's having a rough

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:14.359
go right now are they fine though I

00:37:14.359 --> 00:37:16.260
don't know I mean they're still seeing

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.480
like I was like they were having dates

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.240
or 700 people were dying a day and now

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.820
it's in like the 500s

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.770
but I stopped paying attention Italy

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:28.950
once it came over here and you know yeah

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:30.900
now the epicenter or whatever it's like

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.480
okay yeah talk about really who gives a

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.960
[ __ ] gives a [ __ ] about Europe you know

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:40.470
true I mean not me couldn't agree more

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:42.180
they were so they were slightly ranked

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.310
above China for me in the which part I

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:45.370
care about you

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:49.830
you say I look more like them well kinda

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:52.480
you look more like an Italian or Chinese

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.180
I think Chinese I think you look more

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:58.840
Mongolian then yeah - pulls you in both

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:02.410
directions doing well like the

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:04.210
deal-breaker but it actually makes you

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:05.950
look even more Chinese and more

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:11.050
attacking yeah it's it's a good mustache

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:13.750
I'm also growing it out because of dog

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:15.640
brained women tell me it won't work

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:19.930
yeah you fight uh yeah yeah you can't

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:21.100
let the dog brains win this of course

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:21.910
they're trying to make it about

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:24.490
themselves yeah girls no even put on

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:27.460
facial hair choices true yeah true it's

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:30.670
our body yeah my choice and get back on

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:32.710
only fans where you're on a maintenance

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.410
website now with the conversations

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:38.140
happening that is a tight way to free

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:39.490
yourself in the patriarchy just be a

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:41.830
[ __ ] yeah I'm a [ __ ] now that's like

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:43.810
all right back to the bottom now work

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:45.220
your way all the way back up you're just

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:47.050
there at the top of the almost cracking

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:48.790
the patriarchy now you're a common oh

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:53.560
god what are the only things now I would

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.970
pay I'll be tight elizabeth warren's

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:57.850
mm-hmm be hot what do you think her

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:03.850
[ __ ] looks like long drapey you know

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:06.340
things he has a buttery front but a mini

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.680
but no anybody

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.570
tulsi gabbard spy got a mini but he's

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:13.630
drunk and Golden Retriever hair all over

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:17.620
it yes yeah Warren's got a long Dre be

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.810
Hillary Clinton Hill dogs got probably

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:21.910
like it inverted yeah Hill dogs got

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:24.160
something going she says just a [ __ ]

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.960
there's no labia there's no external

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:31.080
appendage it's just a crevice no it's

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.030
just as a whole

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:39.430
yeah she's got a pentagram tattoo so Zig

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:41.320
that that's become like kind of like

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.480
acceptable to just be like oh who the

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.090
Satanist Hillary Clinton it's like

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:47.460
totally acceptable

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:51.070
anyway it's because it's true exactly

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:55.260
that's why because it's the truth

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:58.360
she's dead big heavier like some weird

00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:58.870
cabal

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:01.420
all they all skit I mean it's well

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:03.100
here's the thing it is obviously a cabal

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:05.710
children on Jeffrey Epstein's island

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:08.410
that had a temple a child molesting

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:12.220
temple on it that the poor table you

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.380
call it that or it's just like a station

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:17.980
was that maybe it's because he's Jewish

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.160
[Laughter]

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.530
maybe he needed that temple to be Jewish

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:30.820
in like okay if you say so I mean

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:33.100
obviously obviously it's not but it'd be

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:34.810
funny if it was just like he's like I

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:37.720
think it looks cool like years later it

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.400
just cost them things you ever see who

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:44.670
took Johnny no okay yeah I mean you like

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:48.220
yeah I guess if you missed out it's

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.930
weird it's like talking about Epstein

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:51.400
[ __ ] is like telling somebody to watch

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.100
like you know like it because it's

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:55.570
already dated even though it was only

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:57.970
six months ago yeah it's like what you

00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:00.370
see making a murder yeah yeah exactly it

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:02.860
anyway like how old man you gotta watch

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:09.520
the knick good but yeah like Kuto johnny

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.220
is like we talk Johnny and there's a

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:15.220
book the Franklin cover up it was like

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.050
two books about this I can hear see in

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:20.200
Nebraska but the way they intersect is

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:23.290
like so that the the conspiracy is that

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:25.270
there was this Credit Union in Nebraska

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:27.510
that was like the head of it was

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:31.570
laundering money and he like stole like

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:33.820
just so much money that there was no way

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:35.610
he could have been doing it without like

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:38.470
people above him in the government just

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:41.050
being complicit right so the state

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:42.460
legislature launched this like

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:45.460
investigation and through the

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:47.170
investigation they like stumbled upon

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:49.300
this weird [ __ ] where he had like rent

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.550
boys and was involved in like child

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.620
prostitution but then the child

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.080
prostitution like accusations like grew

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.110
and started implicating like agents in

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:01.990
the local FBI office and the mayor and

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:03.460
like all these people like kind of like

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:06.180
a like like clean local the town mayor

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:09.280
yeah dude like [ __ ] all people and

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.430
they just have like a

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:13.140
modicum of power you get to bone kids

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:14.849
yeah and then point

00:42:14.849 --> 00:42:16.589
yeah well this book was published in

00:42:16.589 --> 00:42:20.309
[ __ ] like 1996 and it also implicated

00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:22.950
like I don't know some [ __ ] Bishop at

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:27.270
this this orphanage you know like this

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:29.010
was before the Catholic scandal or

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:31.200
whatever yes before it was cool yeah

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.790
well it was before people were like of

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:34.470
course that's apt like if you accused a

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.150
Catholic priest now of molesting

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:41.099
children people are like duh you know of

00:42:41.099 --> 00:42:42.599
course you shouldn't go into Church

00:42:42.599 --> 00:42:46.079
idiot that's your fault true I guess I

00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:48.270
guess what were you guys yeah we went to

00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:50.400
the point well then maybe you know

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.680
comment you know don'ts get to a point

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.540
where it's funny to think like if

00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:56.760
because I was a kid obviously when like

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.980
the Catholic Church did that like fell

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:01.260
apart I never remembered a time where

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.089
you couldn't be like I think Catholic

00:43:03.089 --> 00:43:05.609
priests might be raping kids hmm I

00:43:05.609 --> 00:43:07.319
wonder if it'll get that way with

00:43:07.319 --> 00:43:11.190
politicians that'd be funny I mean like

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:12.690
sure it's like in a decade you could be

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:16.740
like yeah of course yeah the epstein

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.270
thing happened you have all these elites

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:20.549
and like it like intersects with the me

00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:22.079
to thing I mean there were like credible

00:43:22.079 --> 00:43:24.119
accusations against Kevin Spacey where

00:43:24.119 --> 00:43:26.190
he was like [ __ ] sexually assaulting

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:29.670
teenage boys with like Bryan Singer and

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:31.950
all these other people and then like I

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:34.770
guess like two of the people accused

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:40.140
Kevin Spacey died they just murdered

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:42.960
them and then Jeffrey Epstein is like

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:49.049
clearly murdered in jail so it's so

00:43:49.049 --> 00:43:53.549
funny it could not be like any more I

00:43:53.549 --> 00:43:57.750
mean it's just [ __ ] whatever I guess

00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:59.910
you know this is all I know you're going

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:01.859
to pass and people are like alright

00:44:01.859 --> 00:44:03.750
that's over it's like dude he's clearly

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:05.849
murdered in jail clearly more in jail

00:44:05.849 --> 00:44:07.710
and now here we all are trapped

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:11.119
permanently in our home communicate

00:44:11.119 --> 00:44:13.290
services that are monitored by the

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:15.030
government and now they've like to push

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:17.940
legislation and and and encryption is

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:21.690
gone yep okay so I can't why I guess you

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:23.789
know that's just sort of the it

00:44:23.789 --> 00:44:26.259
permanent prison world we live in now

00:44:26.259 --> 00:44:28.599
and you know but you know and now they

00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:30.880
need to track people self now it's like

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.440
accepted they tracked your cellphone to

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.849
see where you're at at all times because

00:44:33.849 --> 00:44:34.930
like they're fighting a virus now

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:36.789
they're not yeah yeah Michigan just made

00:44:36.789 --> 00:44:39.869
it illegal to go travel in between homes

00:44:39.869 --> 00:44:42.400
but I mean like maybe it's maybe there's

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:48.069
a cool [ __ ] on qui B do you ever hear

00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:49.599
about the one like guy high up in the

00:44:49.599 --> 00:44:51.430
military who's like a uh wait am I even

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:54.430
gonna be able to drive to Arizona yeah

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:56.229
probably I mean this [ __ ] like that's

00:44:56.229 --> 00:44:58.059
fine yeah once you get out of the

00:44:58.059 --> 00:45:01.089
tri-state area no one's gonna care well

00:45:01.089 --> 00:45:02.829
it's also too it's like that's not in

00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:04.630
Michigan specifically the only place I

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:07.029
know of where it's like you know they're

00:45:07.029 --> 00:45:09.039
now banning like [ __ ] travel from

00:45:09.039 --> 00:45:12.940
home to home in LA I've heard that you

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:14.950
can like there's those stories now where

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:17.380
the LAPD can pull over whoever I thought

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:18.819
that would turn into like a much bigger

00:45:18.819 --> 00:45:21.219
issue than it did but I saw that one

00:45:21.219 --> 00:45:22.989
that la like the mayor of LA was

00:45:22.989 --> 00:45:25.509
offering rewards for snitching dude it's

00:45:25.509 --> 00:45:28.089
[ __ ] ridiculous like that like SS

00:45:28.089 --> 00:45:28.779
[ __ ]

00:45:28.779 --> 00:45:32.049
the LAPD which is like which is is so

00:45:32.049 --> 00:45:34.269
racist and inspired the only American

00:45:34.269 --> 00:45:40.960
hero of the last 150 years with like an

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:42.910
organization so corrupt that it finally

00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:45.700
pushed someone pushed an American to a

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:47.769
breaking point that most Americans will

00:45:47.769 --> 00:45:49.450
never have in their lives which is

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:52.539
taking up arms against the state you

00:45:52.539 --> 00:45:56.109
know and and it's these are the people

00:45:56.109 --> 00:45:57.700
we think should be able to pull over

00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.670
whoever they [ __ ] want for any reason

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:02.170
they're not I think I think I laughed

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:03.309
when you said his name who are you

00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:06.640
talking about this is your Dorner like

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:12.599
black yes we talked about OJ Simpson

00:46:12.809 --> 00:46:16.029
OJ's fine but Chris now what Dorner was

00:46:16.029 --> 00:46:17.920
what was that what was the deal with

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:20.710
that guy yeah if someone said the n-word

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:25.059
at work and then he got the guy and then

00:46:25.059 --> 00:46:26.769
he got like you got a reputation for

00:46:26.769 --> 00:46:29.979
being like the n-word Serpico I guess

00:46:29.979 --> 00:46:33.069
and and you know yeah he would file

00:46:33.069 --> 00:46:35.799
complaints about like racial issues that

00:46:35.799 --> 00:46:37.450
the LAPD does have and

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:40.720
Department does but you know eventually

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.720
he was like [ __ ] this [ __ ] and then he

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:46.599
either left first or after but then he

00:46:46.599 --> 00:46:49.030
was one on a rampage and started it was

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:50.619
like a modern-day nat turner

00:46:50.619 --> 00:46:54.640
uh yeah yeah yeah he just uh just got

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:56.200
killed cops i think he killed some of

00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:57.490
their families or whatever but the LAPD

00:46:57.490 --> 00:47:01.690
could call them how yeah

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:03.730
the LAPD couldn't handle we're just like

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:06.010
lighting up and ours it looked like his

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:07.690
they're like eventually i'd like set

00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:09.490
some cabin on fire i like to think that

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:14.500
he lived on in all of us it's like a

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:17.079
boogeyman story for racists yeah it's

00:47:17.079 --> 00:47:18.700
like they may not say they're [ __ ]

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:23.800
Dorner's common mm-hmm i'd be a fun no

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.869
be a fun like one of those like a WWE

00:47:25.869 --> 00:47:30.700
produced horror movies how far do you

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:40.599
think credit score we say we think how

00:47:40.599 --> 00:47:41.710
far do you think we are from social

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:44.410
credit score what is that like we're

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:46.869
like a black mirror sort of thing

00:47:46.869 --> 00:47:48.550
yeah well china has it where they

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:51.780
monitor like you're I guess like your

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.160
what you look on like in the internet

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.869
and kind of like all the things you do

00:47:55.869 --> 00:47:57.160
do you pay your debts and bottle-blonde

00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.240
according to that you have a certain

00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.470
score that allows you to do certain

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:01.210
things put it this way I already have a

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:03.609
credit score right fine it you that

00:48:03.609 --> 00:48:05.560
already exists which is arguably the

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:08.380
most important aspect to that I'm banned

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:11.200
from Twitter I can't use it so I my

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.690
speech is already limited by one of the

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:15.960
four companies that controls

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.040
interpersonal communication now because

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:20.910
it's illegal to go see each other right

00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:23.589
[ __ ] I have been visited by the FBI

00:48:23.589 --> 00:48:26.530
for making jokes to my immediate family

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:30.369
members so it's like like I don't know

00:48:30.369 --> 00:48:32.200
where you want to combine like because

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:34.510
like we do have that system in piecemeal

00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:37.240
already or at least I experienced that

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.490
and it's not just this unity of the

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:43.329
state imposing it on me nets that's the

00:48:43.329 --> 00:48:43.869
only difference

00:48:43.869 --> 00:48:49.420
fishing China is very funny I mean like

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:50.670
I couldn't yeah

00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:54.330
you see I get talking to I mean it would

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:55.470
be [ __ ] hilarious

00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:57.390
what did the FBI say to you with like

00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:59.670
are you [ __ ] around they were very

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:01.710
like vague and cryptic they didn't

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:03.840
realizing like it was about me even

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:06.000
until after the fact when I put it

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.860
together my grandma's funeral that my

00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:10.650
uncle had called the FBI on me cuz they

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:13.110
they yeah they kept my apartment they

00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:14.670
were like we're looking in the Sun like

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:16.080
they're like they they made it seem like

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:19.320
maybe like there was some like threat

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:21.660
towards me or like I didn't like no like

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:24.900
it didn't you know I had my cuz I didn't

00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.370
do anything you know what I mean so

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:28.410
there was like no because they said

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:29.730
there were specifically like Joint

00:49:29.730 --> 00:49:31.530
Terrorism Task Force cots and there was

00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:33.030
nothing that I had done at the time I

00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:36.890
had own the domain child porn dot sexy

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:40.980
maybe it was because of that but they

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:43.080
were just like [ __ ] ask about you

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:48.660

people that worked on that welcome it

00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:13.109
lost yeah [ __ ] from China it doesn't

00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:15.240
matter yeah you did the work to make the

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:17.010
thing hopefully Adobe paid you for it

00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:18.300
but now it's this thing that can be

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:21.480
duplicated at zero cost infinitely no

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:25.050
you don't get paid again fair enough

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:26.850
yeah China is the people zero it is the

00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:28.859
people's quarter the [ __ ] idea it's

00:52:28.859 --> 00:52:31.410
like all it is is a [ __ ] idea if you

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:33.060
spent the time coming up with an idea

00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:35.250
and then you told someone the idea and

00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:36.480
you're like oh by the way if you tell

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.510
anybody that idea you have to pay me

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:42.780
$600 it's fair nobody that's the whole

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:43.970
[ __ ] concept

00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:47.880
true that's true they have to cut that

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.109
they probably came up with a couple good

00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:51.660
ideas themselves to who the Chinese I'm

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:54.300

00:52:54.300 --> 00:53:00.690
apartments I'm gonna I'm gonna watch a

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:02.310
compilation after this of just Chinese

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:04.890
people getting arrested for Kovan yeah

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:07.560
yeah set up some funny music to that did

00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:09.060
you see the video a couple years ago

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:10.859
that what's really funny I guess they're

00:53:10.859 --> 00:53:12.090
automotive industry kind of turn a

00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:14.190
corner but like they like 10 years ago

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:15.690
they're really trying to like push into

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:17.730
the automotive industry

00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:19.560
and so they were putting out cars but

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:20.609
like they don't know anything about

00:53:20.609 --> 00:53:24.359
safety so the German I German like the

00:53:24.359 --> 00:53:26.310
Germans did all these a crash tests on

00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:27.960
the cars and they're in slow motion and

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.390
it's like a 10 mile per hour collision

00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:36.990
and like the rearview the car is like

00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:41.700
designed to kill you what below is then

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.700
back speed and then like a couple years

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:46.770
ago they had some like 3d rendering of

00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:48.750
this idea they had for mass transit in

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:50.910
cities it's like a bus that's on stilts

00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:56.550
so it can drive over topic it's like not

00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:58.200
even thinking about like what could

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.230
possibly go wrong with the bus on stilts

00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:03.480
the bus on stilts is like one of the you

00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:05.130
know one of the party members [ __ ]

00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:10.980
six-year-old drew a boss can you sue in

00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:12.720
China if you're on like an experimental

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.460
bus and I get it crashes and everyone

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:16.830
dies I don't think you can stay I think

00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:19.410

who's been quarantined I guess in Wuhan

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.310
and she hasn't seen her daughter in like

00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:34.590
four months or something and then she

00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:36.510
comes home and it's her like surprising

00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:39.480
the daughter but it's like she gets in

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.980
and it's like it's like one of those

00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:43.470
like [ __ ] soldier returns from

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:47.100

where it's like they're just moving

00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:20.070
there is a machine there's not like a

00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:21.750
four-year election scramble I mean we

00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:24.120

taxpayer money if they work

00:56:35.370 --> 00:56:36.960

something shot if you app someone if

00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:48.530
they owe you money and you kidnap them

00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:53.420
the police are like well that seems fair

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:57.620
literally allowed to just kidnap people

00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:01.620

you true yeah I mean the police work

00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:11.700

jail and ruin their lives over this

00:57:19.890 --> 00:57:22.560
let's cause six months worth of problems

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.390
for two guys that are just drunk and

00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:27.420
pissed off about something whereas China

00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:29.280

00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:32.630
gonna keep you in a cage in my basement

00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:36.120
if by chance the police find out about

00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:39.300
it my god let's get both sides of the

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:40.670
story

00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:43.950
thirty bucks give him the thirty bucks

00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:46.140
maybe we'll call it 20 because you've

00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:47.780
been drinking your own urine for six

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:49.520
[Laughter]

00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:52.320
maybe you you paid some of that debt

00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:56.660
back and being deprived of precious bat

00:57:57.830 --> 00:58:00.630
bat bat it could there be a funnier

00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:05.910
animal for them to be much never once in

00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:09.360

you is like what's the effective use of

00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:21.690
in that at night you just run around

00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:27.480
blindly until one they you catch them in

00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:29.610
the day when they're sleeping you catch

00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:31.170
them hanging upside down you grab them

00:58:31.170 --> 00:58:33.630
and kick just pick them like free yeah

00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:35.310

00:58:51.690 --> 00:58:53.850
mean that's definitely but like if

00:58:53.850 --> 00:58:55.680
you're gonna it's like mass consumption

00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:57.330
that's gotta mean if it's mass

00:58:57.330 --> 00:58:58.920

the crack of dust go feed the bats for

00:59:19.770 --> 00:59:25.110

there's a bad chef going around the

00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:32.310
staff and it's like following like a

00:59:32.310 --> 00:59:36.990
nonsensical flight pattern around guys

00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:38.760
you ever seen that video that blind

00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:45.120
black kid that developed sonar yeah

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:52.920
and now he's like he's like he's [ __ ]

00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:57.070
it's based on like say he's got sonar

00:59:57.070 --> 00:59:59.590
yeah we find it when black dudes go

00:59:59.590 --> 01:00:01.600

[Laughter]

01:00:28.770 --> 01:00:31.600
let me say see if I can put this I think

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:35.880
you might be able to also let me say oh

01:00:36.090 --> 01:00:39.760

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.530
sonar actually you know what I can find

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:45.820
this right now kid doing sonar yeah he

01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:48.100
like the clicks his tongue did you do

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:52.330
echolocation let me say yeah okay

01:00:52.330 --> 01:01:07.750
like uh oh I guess he's he's got the

01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:09.820
calvinist arms like classroom eyes with

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:12.360
no vision

01:01:14.089 --> 01:01:24.210
so I won't have to spend do this I don't

01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:25.290
think I've ever come across somebody

01:01:25.290 --> 01:01:27.800
like that you know he is quite unique

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:30.630
daddy lost his eyes to cancer but

01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:33.500
unbelievably he's taught himself to see

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:36.020
with sound

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.570
if you choose to go out there and write

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:41.330
that bicycle let him write the bicycle

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:42.800
it's got to be very smart

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.480
somewhere in there it's a little genes

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:55.610
going on Ben has no guide dog and never

01:01:55.610 --> 01:02:03.880
used he's not even using his hands

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:07.400
instead he sees with sound he makes a

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.230
sharp click which bounces back off

01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:13.880
nearby objects amazingly Ben's ears pick

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:15.590
up the echoes and he can precisely

01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:20.630
locate where things are Ben is the only

01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:22.700
person in the world who sees using

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:26.720
nothing but echolocation have you tried

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.750
a few just like a guy on the silent L

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:35.270
world tricked everybody the fact that

01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:39.390
they use the first series they do this

01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:42.429
[Music]

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:45.890
[ __ ] man that's uh it's also funny for

01:02:45.890 --> 01:02:47.300
me to make fun of a guy who's more

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:50.060

oh yeah doom rocks I love it that's one

01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:18.890

video game system I mean I had one for

01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:22.820

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:38.480
at the point where I'm I kind of burned

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:40.640
out on like online [ __ ] no online sucks

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.710
he was talking about war zone and I got

01:11:42.710 --> 01:11:44.750
on war zone it's [ __ ] boring to me

01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:46.400
but everyone likes it so I mean I guess

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:49.970
I'd have liked shit-eating but I never

01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:51.620
that when we were playing call of duty

01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:52.670
call of duty sucks

01:11:52.670 --> 01:11:55.730
- yeah well war zone is part of Call of

01:11:55.730 --> 01:11:59.810
Duty yeah that just isn't it just call

01:11:59.810 --> 01:12:01.910
duty with isn't it just [ __ ]

01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:04.460
fortnight yeah basically the maps are

01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:05.900
huge and it's like going around like

01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:07.640
collecting cash is all these [ __ ]

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.800
objectives and it's like this isn't what

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.020
Call of Duty was I mean it was like Call

01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:14.480
of Duty was like running around with

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:15.980
either an assault rifle or a shotgun

01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:18.350
maybe you know I don't what made Modern

01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:20.870
Warfare fun was like the pacing of it

01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:23.030
and how like close the spaces were and

01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:25.460
then I got like oh you could camp if you

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:27.380
wanted to and then battlefield was fun

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:29.150
because a huge map you can fly plane and

01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:30.470
all that [ __ ] or whatever battlefield

01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:32.180
battlefield one I thought it was great

01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:34.280
yeah and then this is supposed to be

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:36.500
like I guess these like larger style

01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:38.780
maps for people that suck at like

01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:41.810
shooting games to an extent today Guam

01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:43.310
I'm just gonna go around and collect

01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:45.800
money you know it's like well I don't

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.000
this sucks

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.220
yeah I was like being a medic in

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:51.350
battlefield 1 yeah

01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:53.690
like the many I like the rifles the

01:12:53.690 --> 01:12:55.790
rifles is what you need but you know it

01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:56.870
can just going around trying to save

01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:57.380
people

01:12:57.380 --> 01:13:00.650
nah no you're not good at sniping and

01:13:00.650 --> 01:13:02.240
that was that was really fun

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:04.430
what in battlefield one yeah I got good

01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:07.910
at sniping yeah I mean i-i've mostly to

01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:09.320
be honest with you I mostly played as a

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:13.220
medic where I used I first did your

01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:14.060
first was mine

01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:15.950
what plays a sniper but then use like

01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:19.520
the shorter range like yeah and then but

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.870
like because sitting across the map and

01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:23.210
like shooting because it's like would

01:13:23.210 --> 01:13:23.660
you

01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:27.980
what was the that like that would that

01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:30.260
one with those that got a fortress on

01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:32.990
the far and that one was impossible to

01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:35.300
snipe on no I mean you could do it and

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:36.860
that was kind of fun where you just have

01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:40.100
to aim like like [ __ ] like 30 feet

01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:42.320
over somebody's head on the top or in

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.180
the helps the abandoned hangar I like

01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:46.940
that one across the map and why somebody

01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:49.130
get [ __ ] me like get a headshot from

01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:51.410
like you know ten mile that was pretty

01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:53.900
cool but yeah I don't know the planes

01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:56.750
were big for me I loved the planes yeah

01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:58.610
yeah finally figured out what fly those

01:13:58.610 --> 01:14:01.400
the inverted controller really [ __ ] me

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.570
up there's a lot of people that would

01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:04.700
hop in just immediately at 911 that

01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:07.520
thing yeah non-stop just straight into

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.140
the [ __ ] trees yeah I didn't play

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:11.870
much of battlefield 5 but the main

01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:13.910
either planes in that were we're better

01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:16.310
than one the ones the battlefield 5

01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:17.420
though I thought they went more like
