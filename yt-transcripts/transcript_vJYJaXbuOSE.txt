president and we would have been a

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.560
better country and we wouldn't be

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.140

room up the steps and your hair's

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.980
growing and you had the best Quarantine

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.280
haircut that you post it was a time this

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.250
was a real mistake I let Doug Stanhope

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.380
and his friends shave my head while we

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.250
were hammered and uh the hangover guilt

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.980
waking up the next day was oh yeah

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.630
that's right you like one - Doug

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.310
Stanhope house and you actually how was

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.870
it being on a flight people want to know

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:04.190
what it's the country it sounded like a

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.190
great idea until I hit like by day two I

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.350
was like this [ __ ] sucks I'm gonna

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.239

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.430
to drunk dial in drunk text which I

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.110

any time calling but no like we talk a

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.630

wanna come home him because uh I don't

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.919
want to go home because my [ __ ]

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.289
sister has cancer now I think I won the

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:40.880
fight I'd [ __ ] hit her with some body

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.460
jabs she ended up getting breast cancer

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.150

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.450
home and he was just like and I didn't

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.800

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.900
like just come out here and every night

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.099

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:45.870
I'm a Greek kid I carry a lot of fuse in

my life like a brillo pad it's never

00:08:49.139 --> 00:08:55.079
100% clean jeez uh well I don't I don't

00:08:55.079 --> 00:08:58.829
think randomized is real so right now

00:08:58.829 --> 00:08:59.970
okay

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.120
I think it's AI think it's made up dude

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.370
yeah great now I truthfully the real

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.470
answer is obviously yes teach your ass

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.570
no but you're not wrong with the first

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.279
get it the Democrats made it up we've

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:12.570
been saying that on this podcast for two

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.490
months and we'll like you were

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.410
vindicated in your words two years later

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.269
we'll be vindicated what about Democrats

00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:22.920
to get the work just my question to

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.370
piggy back would you do it too if the

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.320
world were to know the truth that the

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.880
coronavirus didn't exist but the only

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.320
way they could get that truth is you had

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.380
to eat my ass could you do it

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.170
yeah I do I just wanted people to know

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.350
you're a warrior for truth yeah I don't

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.850
think that you know there wouldn't be

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.519
anything sexual about it it would just

00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:47.640
be strictly business down there like if

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.170
one of us got hard during it it would

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.720
that would end it I got off a call for

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.149

what's your position on the independence

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.639
of Ireland this is sort of a I guess

00:12:09.639 --> 00:12:12.160

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.029
here and support this position what's

00:12:16.029 --> 00:12:17.980
your position on the independence of

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:24.120
Ireland and why was it such a bad idea

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.630

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.639
the Irish people yeah yeah yeah well I

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:33.100
mean it's not that hard to to say why it

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.309
was a bad idea the Irish you know they

00:12:36.309 --> 00:12:37.899

time I've talked to an Irish person I've

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.350
regretted it it's always just like I let

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.580
I just did the right thing by basically

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.550
committing genocide for a thousand years

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:04.360

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.620
words were bad in Ireland like you would

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.620

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:36.130
as you go you could definitely say that

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.720
in Ireland you could say that anywhere

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.870
until I [ __ ] said it I was the first

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.120

00:17:25.289 --> 00:17:28.169
Joel Osment we got the fume thrower

00:17:28.169 --> 00:17:29.909
maybe Chrissy asked him Scott the fruit

00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:31.830
the next one I want to hear what he's

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.929
got to say okay here we go

00:17:33.929 --> 00:17:35.460
from Scott the fume throw this is your

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.919
last one in round one you are tasked

00:17:37.919 --> 00:17:40.649
with writing a musical about the Pandi

00:17:40.649 --> 00:17:44.090
what is it called and what is the plot

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:49.309
I'm [ __ ] musical yeah yeah a musical

00:17:49.309 --> 00:17:53.279
about the pandemic Shen Yun or what's

00:17:53.279 --> 00:17:57.600

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.880
always see that on the bus on the bus

terminal wheels or trains yeah that's

00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:04.799
actually instead that I think people the

00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:06.630
new conspiracy needs to be instead of 5g

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.519
towers I think those Shen Yun billboards

00:18:08.519 --> 00:18:17.250
are the ones admitting it 100% no one

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.929
knows what that play is that's the

00:18:18.929 --> 00:18:21.179
perfect [ __ ] yeah always gonna play I

00:18:21.179 --> 00:18:22.380
don't know

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.389
no one knows dude it's just emitting

00:18:24.389 --> 00:18:30.389
Kovan yeah you're probably [ __ ] right

00:18:30.389 --> 00:18:33.600

people to start nevermind [ __ ] it that

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.990
was a nice flawless first round what you

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:43.289
say honest I think I think it was this

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:45.000
is shows called no next I think that was

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.149
all nets right there yeah okay so here

00:18:48.149 --> 00:18:52.049
we go round two [ __ ] wild from dead

00:18:52.049 --> 00:18:55.830
from dead like a zombie what are your

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:57.630
current thoughts on the China America

00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.909
situation playing out with Taiwan and

00:18:59.909 --> 00:19:02.929
also with Mike Pompeo and Donald Trump

00:19:02.929 --> 00:19:06.029
Wow I mean this would I mean who the

00:19:06.029 --> 00:19:07.919
[ __ ] it was this Anderson Cooper [ __ ]

00:19:07.919 --> 00:19:08.789
this [ __ ]

00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:11.190
look I've supported Taiwan from day one

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:14.250
uh I was expecting a little more backup

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:18.440
from them when I got in trouble maybe

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.519
here's some Taiwanese with some

00:19:20.519 --> 00:19:22.470
umbrellas out front of [ __ ] 30 rock

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:26.789
that would have helped yeah I think no I

00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:29.399
all of this makes me very happy that

00:19:29.399 --> 00:19:31.289
Trump is president literally every major

00:19:31.289 --> 00:19:32.130
issue

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.149
it makes me

00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:35.580
so hard that a [ __ ] [ __ ] is going to

remember it was like combining let's say

00:25:15.809 --> 00:25:17.280

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.660
would it's funny like what the what the

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.970
podcast did it destroyed my mainstream

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:32.100
career heard her releasing a poem would

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:38.970
destroy my podcast career okay three

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.860
here okay go ahead start off be honest

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.410
it's around 3 this is the keep C wild

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:45.600
these are the questions you know like we

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.480
said feel free to pass on anyone that

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.550
you don't want to answer but you will be

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:53.790
judged okay jayven e she let me sit in

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.170
your lap E while you banned me with a

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.390
strappy you bar again let's get had some

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:59.550
good questions because he got picked

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:03.030
twice what word would you use to refer

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:06.179
to a weak spot in a figurative suit of

00:26:06.179 --> 00:26:09.169
armor and why

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:13.260
so I think the question is that you guys

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.710
are trying to get me sake in the armor

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.790

lesbian rights and end it with the wou

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.530
catchphrase what would they be and why

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:57.450

for King John boom and make him smile or

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:52.320
everyone in comedy dies all right and he

picked you because he loves you he's a

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:57.990
big fan and he said you had to pick

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:01.200
between dance owner or big Jay oakerson

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.590

with big J on that because I'm just

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.260
going off of his offence

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.450
is his affection for Dennis Rodman I

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:26.490
think he likes the piercings and like

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:29.160
