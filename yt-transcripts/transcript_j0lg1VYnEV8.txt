some sort of like these gas ovens and

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.080

their heads in the gas oh yeah yeah yeah

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.120

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.879
public gas away

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.480

want to take that that was that was a

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.000
pretty solid statistic when they were

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.879
like oh people are going to kill

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:27.920
themselves no matter what and they took

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.520

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.840
sylvia plath yeah she rolled the dice on

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.560

gas doesn't pass through

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.400
i think she want to set up a chill or a

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.760
uh what are those which caught with it

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.120
for this town a paper towel just like

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.720

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.680
no

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.680
put a towel on the floor

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.000
so that gas didn't leak out here you

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.440
know o'connor dumped in the green room

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.680
last night oh he is

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.680
a vicious yeah vicious crapper yeah

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.840
and he hit the green room crap which is

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.159
he's it's a rude thing to do that green

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:37.920
room too there's no room for it and

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.840
there's no ventilation in that bathroom

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.280
i've done it yeah

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.120
i've done it sometimes you have to do it

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.040
that's all sort of times o'connor did

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.720
have to do it true what was what was

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.560
going on with the staff bath

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.519
what's that what was wrong with the

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.840
staff back true absolutely true

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.840
oh he was featuring though yeah he

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.200
should have he had a feature he had a

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.519
feature tell me he did he had grumbles a

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:58.560
little feature tommy yeah you should

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.000
have staff bath they should have hit the

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.680
staff bathroom but that does suck

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.200
because usually you get the you get the

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.439
grumblies right like halfway through the

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:07.040
host then you're like how is this you

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.560
know i don't have time

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.720
but he crapped and it lingered for

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.799
over an hour that might be the one place

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.239
you really can't take a [ __ ] and he

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.720
sprayed it

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.040
yeah just febreze with a hint of [ __ ] at

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.720
the end

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.240

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.800

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.320
times of our lives dude yeah i've been

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.240
up i've been up for pretty much two

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.600
straight nights so it's not that hard

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.960
though everyone says the second kid is

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.720
like oh my god i mean so far it's not

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.320
too bad can you just play age of empires

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.080
the whole time could you i can't do

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.160
anything could you get a laptop

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.919
i can't do anything you can't play

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.479
vampires any i literally perform chores

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.400
and just like weird duties all day and

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.320
at the moment i have down time i have to

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.720
sleep because if i don't sleep if i

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.560
don't go to sleep i stay up and a kid

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.680
wakes up and it's like you're just

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.080
locked in for another six hours oh of

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.400
just like the most inane acted like

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.919
repetitive you're just trying to make

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.440
sure it's like a

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.360
a little being doesn't kill themselves

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.560
yeah they're not trying to kill

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.160
themselves but there's no

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.400
yeah they can very easily

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.680
and now i have to make sure a

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.919
two-year-old doesn't kill herself and a

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.440
baby yeah cause they'll just lay on a

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.280
baby's head for like 10 minutes and i'll

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.680
think about it

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.440
cats do that which is kind of funny yeah

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.199
dude it's that's not funny obviously

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.720
when cats

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.160
like no lay on a baby

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.120
will suffocate babies by laying on them

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.400
do they on purpose or just like they're

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.919
just like they go to sleep i don't know

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.600
why i think this is true no i think they

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.120
do it i think it's true dude there's so

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.400
many warnings when you have kids you're

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.520
not supposed to sleep in bed with them

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.800
because like you can just roll over on

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.720
your kids and smush the fresh out it's

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.520

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.199
but someone told me they put those

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.400
warnings on it's just for like drunks

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.919

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.600

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.600
their kids

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.080
wake up it's like the worst hang over oh

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.840
my god that's what did you realize that

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.560
you'd like that would be sitting on it

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.120
just a baby on a chair and you come in

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.580
here like

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.800
[Laughter]

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.400
no

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.560
oh [ __ ]

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.560
it's probably pretty constant yeah you

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.000
know i mean i know gun deaths are a

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.680
pretty bad thing gun doesn't do a lot of

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.039
dude

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:33.440
moms and dads watching kids sitting down

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.600

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.520
look into those numbers too oh yeah they

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.520

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:40.400
also

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.840
i mean there is neither side's really

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.800
offering a viable [ __ ] well you're in

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.800
europe there's less people getting shot

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.199
and they have no guns yeah but but

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:50.479
they're all set up for two years they

00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:51.840
are set up for teams they also did have

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.960
world war ii

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.080
true that was their fault very true

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.360
they had more guns they could have

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.720
stopped true they could have stopped

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.280
they could have stopped the hitler

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.639
stop hitler and all of his boys that

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:04.000

and someone gets compared to hitler i

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:10.479

00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:36.640
day we're always like

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.880
we gotta turn this thing around

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.480
every single time

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.120
we both have such shame about drinking

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.880
yeah i mean it's built into the

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.400
experience the next day it like takes

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.640
such a taxing such a toll on you there's

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.000
nothing else to do but i could feel it

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.360
last night because i was like i was a

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.200
little hungover i wasn't that bad for

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.240
the shows yeah but when we got done

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.520
i was like all right

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.440
well i started drinking again yeah and

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.240
like four or five in i was like nice

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.400
this is awesome i'm online helium rules

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.799
this is so fun and then i i caught

00:23:06.799 --> 00:23:08.159
myself being like this is how it

00:23:08.159 --> 00:23:09.760
happened uh when someone was like you

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.840
want some molly i was like yes

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.200
yeah no

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.039
that's absolutely that's impressive

00:23:15.039 --> 00:23:16.880
that's impressive that's the alcohol my

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.799
critical thinking my like whatever it's

00:23:18.799 --> 00:23:20.559
called my willpower is just out the

00:23:20.559 --> 00:23:22.159
window yeah three drinks dude i'm

00:23:22.159 --> 00:23:24.559
[ __ ] it was if it wasn't so late

00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:26.480
i probably would have yeah

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.760
but it was like it was already like

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.240
midnight see i have i what i tend to do

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.240
when i'm drinking is i i'm out i'm

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.400
getting drunk and i will when i'm like

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.679
having a good when they're going down

00:23:35.679 --> 00:23:38.640
easy they won't stop but that's why i

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.159
keep the edible like an edible on me or

00:23:40.159 --> 00:23:41.679
like a vape and it shuts you down it's

00:23:41.679 --> 00:23:43.440
still it's a full circle because then

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.880
when i get so drunk that i'm like i

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.799
could probably smoke a whole vape in and

00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:49.360
then i almost do that and then it's like

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.880
what are you doing go to bed and i'm

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.240
like yes yeah it's pretty tight

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.600
you need to start vaping hard as [ __ ]

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.960
while you're drunk you might as well

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.440
vaping weed yeah when you're super drunk

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.919
weeds really tight it kills me you cause

00:24:01.919 --> 00:24:03.360
like you can't bug out throw up you

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.679

00:28:16.399 --> 00:28:17.919
interesting fact where did you find that

i googled it yeah because brittany was

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.559
like what are these guys mixed with i'm

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:22.240
like these guys are white guys basically

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.120
white guys

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.000
yeah i think they're basically white

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.440
guys

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.200
they have white in them yeah

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.720
that was that was out you know i had to

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.720
get that in

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.840
the girls can't do the army you know

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.200
these guys are these jacked guys or

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.480
white guys you know the cool guys in

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.440
this

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.799
you know the guys who were dominating

00:28:36.799 --> 00:28:38.240
like actually white

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.760
that's why they're jacked that's i was

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.440
laughing i was like because the dude the

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.679
mongolians in mulan are [ __ ] enormous

00:28:43.679 --> 00:28:45.120
but i was like they must have just like

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.399
been white guys

00:28:46.399 --> 00:28:48.399
yeah you're going through like whenever

00:28:48.399 --> 00:28:49.600
that was

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.120
when they go through uh when the

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.679
mongolians do that genghis khan genghis

00:28:53.679 --> 00:28:55.840
khan gang 12

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.880
100 a.d

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.320
actually that fight song

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.200
strengthens my theory i i uh floated by

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.000
you what's that under the lights when

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.039
you're saying

00:29:13.039 --> 00:29:15.679
notre dame's fight song is our daughter

00:29:15.679 --> 00:29:18.640
sons and daughters yeah go marching

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.360
towards victory it's a war song yeah

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.679
that was my theory oh yes sports come

00:29:23.679 --> 00:29:26.159
from

00:29:26.159 --> 00:29:27.760
yeah i mean football is very war-like

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.679
dude yeah you run a blitz but that's

00:29:29.679 --> 00:29:31.760
what the loss is about that sack

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.200
yeah that's the award that's the

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.279
emotional component of the loss

00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:36.799
it's yeah

00:29:36.799 --> 00:29:39.279
all our [ __ ] daughters and wives are

00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:41.679

[ __ ] heroes and movies are girls or

but yeah other than that dude it's like

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.119
yeah it's just you're you're [ __ ]

00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:40.800
it's like it's so hard to find good kids

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.839
movies

00:37:41.839 --> 00:37:44.000
pixar's sucks when the kid doesn't like

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.200
it

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.520
it sucks like this is my favorite one

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.800
from when i was a kid and they'll just

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.440
be like put on they too paw patrol right

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.599
now this is awesome yeah it's the same

00:37:53.599 --> 00:37:56.079
thing over and over i was watching puppy

00:37:56.079 --> 00:37:57.839
dog pal first it was [ __ ] coco melon

00:37:57.839 --> 00:38:00.320
which is [ __ ] up it's a [ __ ] up show

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.079
it's bad for kids

00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:04.640
it's like it just like floods for some

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.000
reason they advertise it towards like

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.240
babies and like if you're like your

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.599
little kid can watch this but it like

00:38:09.599 --> 00:38:11.359
apparently floods them with like sensory

00:38:11.359 --> 00:38:13.359
overload so they'll produce it's like if

00:38:13.359 --> 00:38:14.880
you gave a kid like a drug like they'll

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.720
start producing like a ton of dopamine

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.920
they're getting like super stimulated

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.280
from all the colors

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.480
and then you turn it off and they

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.880
[ __ ] freak out yeah they'll spas and

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.320
like cry

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.760
they've done they've like starting to

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.520
look into this now of like what babies

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.040
can handle it's like it's unprecedented

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.800
no one ever had like that level of

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.200
animation and like color and detail and

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.560
they have these dudes like studying it

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.079
dude if you turn off what if that's the

00:38:36.079 --> 00:38:38.640
autism

00:38:39.119 --> 00:38:40.000
yeah

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.240
yeah i mean i think i think that's more

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.760
of like people [ __ ] taking advantage

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.400
of the autism what do you mean i don't

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.640
oh no never mind because i yeah no there

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.800
was a uh what's the [ __ ] in

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.960
roundup sorry that was the dollar

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.160
trying to figure out what you meant i

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.920
meant like people just being like just

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.520
seeing that kids are autistic and being

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.000
like we got something nice for them oh i

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.599
don't think it would call us all i think

00:39:01.599 --> 00:39:03.920
there's there they did a study with uh

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:05.280
one of the things that lines up with

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.400
autism pretty good because there's a ton

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.839
of people saying like this is all this

00:39:07.839 --> 00:39:09.839
creates it the uh what's the [ __ ] what's

00:39:09.839 --> 00:39:12.000
it called look it up the uh stuff in

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.599
roundup i forget the name of it but it's

00:39:13.599 --> 00:39:15.680
in like everything we eat

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.280
whereas in every single thing we eat

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:20.240
it's called um glycophase

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.400
that's in literally every all the food

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.920
really and apparently like when they

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.240
introduced glycophages to farming around

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.040
i think the 1940s or so like dude like

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.720
it like it's apparently if you look at a

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.560
graph it just spikes up with it it's

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:33.760
[ __ ] up

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.280
and they they still put it in everything

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.520
yeah it's pretty shitty

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.920
i think yeah we gotta look into that we

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.440
gotta look into that it's pretty bad

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.440
yeah i mean there's like barrels and

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.119
barrels of a weird chemical they don't i

00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:46.800
mean dude it's pretty crazy

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.400
like they set up the world set we're

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.320
rocking on a setup from like

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.079
1920.

00:39:52.079 --> 00:39:54.000
they're like you know i don't know i saw

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.920
an old man griping about like styrofoam

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.560
cups being illegal and i was like

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.079
toxic dude maybe yeah maybe we could

00:40:00.079 --> 00:40:01.680
give a different cup dude we'll be fine

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.359
with different cups

00:40:03.359 --> 00:40:04.880
this is great

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.280
that's good i like boxed water i do too

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:09.040
it makes me feel good i do what people

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.800
do people get really uh

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.160
that's the thing they get the straws

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.160
they go like

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.000
yeah it's like dude what if one day

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.160
there's straws everywhere dude that's

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.760
pretty much what we're charting towards

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.440
yeah straws everywhere yeah there's

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.480
