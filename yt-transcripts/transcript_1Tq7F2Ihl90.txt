Spud then picked everyone right the fuck back up when he revealed that he has surpassed every goal that he set for himself at the beginning of the year, which set the stage for McCusker to get into Psych Naw, his new program designed to provide guidance for dawgs who that wanna level up to unprecedented heights.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.610
thing I can remember Oh

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.530
what do you think in high schools they

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.030
like when they cover history they like

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.980
claim different angles 9/11 you think

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.170
it's just standard narrative I don't

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.520
know sure my kids will find out - can

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.560
you guys hear reggaeton right now I can

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.710
hear through the [ __ ] noise-canceling

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.660
I can't hear it's it say I think you got

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.740
it just course the through your bones

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.070
man those curtains rated for reggaeton

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.360
they're brown in curtains that's it yeah

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.860
that's a I'll get into that in a little

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.670
bit that's it there's a tail behind that

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.690
but yeah I don't know how they're

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.970
teaching 9/11 in schools I think kids

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:03.930
are already getting Internet it up

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.610
though you know what when I was when I

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.500
was last at a public works at a public

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.450
high school they were pretty like troops

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.340
heavy in regards to the interpretation

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.280
of 9/11 so the romanís ation was

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.150
definitely there I said me crazy as a

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.800
teacher like those kids that I didn't

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.090
have access to anything when my teachers

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.010
said anything I was like all right fine

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.330
that's what happened with the internet

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.209
I'd be like [ __ ] dude I had

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.800
textbooks that I refused to look at I

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.150
was like I'll take your word for it but

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.780
I'm not looking if this is an answer on

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.720
a test then maybe I'll find it otherwise

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.880
no that's it this is an ignored text I

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.020
mean you could be a teacher that you

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.190
just pull up the phone and be like nah

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.790
and you're like yeah there's three

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.050
teachers birth of man because nobody

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.730
knew any better it was just like what us

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.560

red from his blood pressure every day

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.680
and it looked like his tongue was trying

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.760
to escape from his mouth he was

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.200

for a guy that was crippled

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:00.860

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.089
school year because she was walking her

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:20.099

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.230
we an eighth grade teacher who again it

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.210
was the same thing it was like there's

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.580
no way they did not know they didn't

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.810
have certifications at all they're just

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:18.670
giving them at a time like 11 bucks an

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:19.930
hour and these teachers were like hell

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.600
yeah we went to a field trip it was just

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.350
Flyers preseason practice oh and it was

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.880
just what we just went there and she was

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.140
just like guy long we're like what are

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.430
we doing here she's like I love the

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:30.970
Flyers

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:35.919
we're like brought to watch the Flyers

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:39.490
precede every lady that's like 50 pounds

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.010
over weight loss hockey I mean oh yeah

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.460
that was definitely the case here we had

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.860
a horribly obese match herbs gym teacher

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.240
she was filling it because I don't know

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.260
what the fire I don't think we could

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.480
afford like a full-time gym teacher so

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.590
at one point one of the kids mom wishes

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.900
very nice big fat lady just volunteered

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.140
to do it and all doing this were not

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:08.090
good classes yeah he was he was but like

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.300
he was like he was not conscious of of

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.480
just how weird it was like he just liked

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.100
it he still loved his momma I guess at

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.780
that point and this was like fourth

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.640
grade so most kids I guess I moved past

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.140
that but like he was still like wow my

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:21.710
mom's here

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.310
dude my my brother used to just beat a

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:26.870
kid up just because just for the sake

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.940
that his mom was a substitute teacher he

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.140
would find him at your mom's some

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.220
student he was beat him up so [ __ ] up

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.990
when I got into high school my entire

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.400
family worked in my high school and the

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.900
guy I was super self-conscious to begin

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.040
with but this made it a thousand times

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.650
worse it's a make matters even worse my

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.170
dad was a janitor and there was one day

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.000
where a kid in my homeroom got super

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.460
high and it was laced with something and

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.840
he was just sweating bullets and he's

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.250
like I gotta throw up before he could

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.810
make the bath just threw up all over the

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.880
classroom oh and I was just praying to

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.800
God saying please don't let my dad to

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.150
clean this up in front of everybody in

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.030
my room man your daddy come in with the

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.610
[ __ ] wood chips no luckily the guy

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:05.960
that they'd actually put on the show he

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.160
threw it back down he's like you guys

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.270
want another bag of wood chips

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:15.200
everybody's like yeah dude I'd go back

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.880
to the fat ladies love it I'm stuck on

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.710
the fat ladies loving hockey thing is it

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.170
because I this is I'm gonna say another

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:22.130
thing right now it's just gonna make

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.160
people will just quit the patreon is it

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.170
because hockey is like the most

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.000
professional Russian the wrestling of

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.270
like the legitimate sports in America

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.760
like gravitate toward it because it's

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.490
like the easiest to just like scream and

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.320
there's like vengeance in the sport

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.080
built into the sport like that anyone

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.690
else I think a part of it is with ice

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.130
hockey they would be playing with fire

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:47.240
if they were actually out there because

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.100
nobody gets a sprained ankle faster than

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.190
their fat lady so they like the mystique

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.960
and the danger of knowing that if it

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.640
were them out there that's usually

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.170
related to walking up or down deck

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:01.490
stairs deck stairs are fat lady

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:04.150
kryptonite

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.320
and then I also think that uh the

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.900
hottest lady fans are probably baseball

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.640
because baseball is the easiest sport -

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.260
just like scroll through a phone without

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:14.610
really missing anything when you're at

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:18.150
the game sure you also think something

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.850
through that the jersey covers more than

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.790
any other Jersey in any other sport so

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.260
if they're wearing a hockey jersey to a

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.290
game I know just just picked her in like

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.960
a [ __ ] aunt barb in a Mamula Jersey

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.240
you know what I mean football's got a

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.920
football it's got a pretty good Jersey

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.150
for family sure anything that you wear

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.760
pads under is great for Fat Lady's sure

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.120
that true that true that love Fat Lady's

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.420
just for the just for the throw that out

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.480
there can I know we know I'm not saying

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:56.130
this to make fun of no I love more than

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:57.960
a love scene fat ladies rep their

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.310
favorite team it's a lot of advertising

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:06.030
space for not much investment can I uh

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.130
can I tell you guys this is this is

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:09.720
bothering me I don't want to turn this

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.150
into like a therapy session but I got it

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.410
I got to tell you guys a bit of a saga

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.330
about this week yeah but is that okay

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.010
with you guys yeah oh yeah

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:18.690
all right I've been I've been trying to

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.550
keep people up to date on this through

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:22.830
jokes but like that place the area I

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.470
live in now is turning into [ __ ] hell

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.050
every day like the the reggaeton is

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.430
getting louder the dirt bikes are

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.760
getting closer the [ __ ] peel outs are

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.560
flaking the Front's of our houses with

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:39.060
just molten rubber and right now the big

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.850
problem is two doors down from me and I

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.260
made a really terrible joke about this

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.800
on Facebook that I deleted but they it's

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.780
they're turning this into like an

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.030
unlivable hellscape like my kids can't

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.380
go outside anymore every day we're just

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.570
like calling rental places in like a

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.610
nicer area and it's like not getting

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:57.930
called back yet and we're like starting

00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:59.250
to panic because it's getting so [ __ ]

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.830
bad and I think what's happening is

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.140
there's there's this nice like

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.930
middle-aged Hispanic couple like two

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:09.180
doors down they seem to care about the

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.910
community when when someone like hit and

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:14.250
ran on my car while it was parked like

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.200
they like did detective work for me

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.760
before I get back so that's that's like

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.420
the backstory

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:22.380
like these are lovely people but they it

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.079
might be to a fault like they they love

00:13:25.079 --> 00:13:27.149
taking people in and like taking care of

00:13:27.149 --> 00:13:30.300
her like distant relatives friends of

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.920
friends that kind of [ __ ] right so it's

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:38.880
like the puerto rican blindside dude

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.040
they are they're spreading what little

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.250
they have every chance they get and

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.529
right now the current batch of dudes are

00:13:46.529 --> 00:13:49.170
like trying to start like a buster black

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:51.120
biker gang like they could they could

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.100
clearly not actually hang in North

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.769
Philly but like right here they're like

00:13:55.769 --> 00:13:57.209

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.139
blow [ __ ] up and like you just peel outs

00:14:01.139 --> 00:14:04.110
at 3:00 in the morning and every time I

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.579
go outside and like the set you can't do

00:14:05.579 --> 00:14:05.880

they're always like my favorite like

00:14:13.199 --> 00:14:15.709

the other night the them and like a

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.579

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.230
I can't even ask anyone stop doing this

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.390
so and this is on top of like you know

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.680
that like I said the motorcycle isn't

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.410
[ __ ] so yesterday my plan was I was

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.300
going to go over to mommy and I was

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.820
gonna be like listen this shit's this is

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.199
this is turning in like a terrible place

00:14:40.199 --> 00:14:42.500
to live I hate this it's like it's

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:46.260
unbearable and I ended up getting sucked

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.850
into something at work and I never got

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.760
around to it and I got home and as I'm

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.130
in the bathroom I'm just hearing crazy

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:55.230
amounts of sirens which not that crazy

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:57.660
in my neighborhood but eventually I'm

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.100
just like this is a lot of [ __ ]

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.690
sirens and then I put up another

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.160
terrible joke on the Internet Mike I'm

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.420
here a lot of sirens and I'm just hoping

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.370
that it's for a dude on a dirt bike

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.769
trapped under a tractor-trailer and I go

00:15:07.769 --> 00:15:09.779
I come out of the bathroom and my wife's

00:15:09.779 --> 00:15:11.640
like mommy's house is on [ __ ] their

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:16.110
house [ __ ] burnt down oh yeah it's

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:18.029
not burnt down but it's the inside of it

00:15:18.029 --> 00:15:19.529
is gone I don't know a row home can't

00:15:19.529 --> 00:15:21.870
really burn down but the inside of it is

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.540
gone it would it be fair to call that P

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:28.410
arson obviously my head I'm like this is

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:30.000
something is on purpose either someone

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.740
threw something on fire through a window

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.260
or one of these dudes got tired of being

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.910
yelled at for being loud and they burnt

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.400
the house down so well yeah so I run

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.870
into mommy and I'm like are you okay is

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.310
everyone okay and she's just like

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.890
completely broken it's like at this

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.840
point the fire department came in broke

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.160
all the windows flooded the house

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.170
neighbor's houses were damaged with

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:52.560
smoke and she she's like this is this is

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.090
my first house I don't have insurance

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.670
like it oh I don't know what we do then

00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:00.720
I was just like damn insurance is a

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.110
killer

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:03.210
oh they're [ __ ] they're [ __ ] but the

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.490
I mean it's like there's 15 contractors

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:07.350
living in the house right now so they're

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:08.790
just gonna lemmings the house and

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:10.710
rebuild it I guess they're already

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:12.210
working on it

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.070
imagine if five hours before that I was

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:15.750
like you make this a terrible place

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.610
everything's bad because of what you

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.410
guys are doing right now and in their

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:20.850
[ __ ] house burns down I'd I would

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:22.530
have to kill myself I wouldn't be able

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.420
to live with that how does she say that

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.640
house burnt down she said that she was

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.110
cooking something and walked away for

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:30.170
five minutes and then the house was

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:32.370
toast that sucks

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.010
I bet it was delicious too oh dude I saw

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.320
the firefighters carried the pan out it

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:56.070
was a stretcher some of the fire workers

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:58.050
are out there chucking fireworks to self

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.280
you haven't wizard battles yeah it's

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.720
pretty weird that that kind of really

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.190
picked up steam right before their house

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:07.860
burned down so uh it's crazy that I was

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.470
like that that morning or the night the

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:12.150
day before I was like man it'd be great

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.620
these people just lost their house and

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:14.790
couldn't live there anymore and then it

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.320
[ __ ] half I sound a lot like an

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.360

happened and I came home oh yeah yeah

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.830

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.930
to keep calling places about everyday

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.640
shout out to the [ __ ] patreon for

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.190
making that easier

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.170
but yeah we can't live here anymore we

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.300
like dirt bike you get a dirt bike in

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.340
this video yeah my loader

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.440
Road Rash I'd be the dude under the

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.220
tractor-trailer plus I don't have you

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.690
ever seen my head in a motorcycle helmet

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.750
it's like I look like NBA Jam big head

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.380
mode it's not a melon dude

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.000
sighs I'll Tim how nice would it be if

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.710
like the day you moved out they were

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:13.590
like 400 motorcycles down the block just

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.360
carrying your [ __ ] to your new place for

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.160
you oh my god there would be a dream

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.380
they might do that for you maybe my I

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.120
mean I did it's it's a complicated

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.120
relationship at this point but uh I'm

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.060
very spicy and then I have my son my my

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.950
three year old outside and like some of

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.300
the ladies were like oh my god he's

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.920
getting so big and they fuss over him

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.560
and stuff and it's just uh for the last

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.660
week it's just been vitriol in my brain

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.710
for these people so I think that with

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:43.080
neighbors that are a perpetual nuisance

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.060
there's nothing that you could ever say

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.620
to them that would get them to reflect

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.120
that yeah you know what I should do that

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.580
anymore I think it's either you're

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:51.990
cursed with bad neighbors or you're

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:53.760
blessed with good neighbors and I think

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.200
if it's a one-time thing maybe a hey

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.670
keep it down like that would work but

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.490
anytime like they're gonna own a pattern

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.110
of just doing shitty things you'll never

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.000
stop it and you only make yourself does

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.490
yeah and here's the problem it's not

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.230
like no one was looking for a fight

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.880
because I I think I look like a pretty

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.830
soft target if I walk outside a

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.170
neighborhood like this but when I go

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:15.420
outside it's like everyone's avoiding

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.980
confrontation they're like ah sorry

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.140
sorry my bad my bad but the one thing I

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.310
noticed is that they'll be like oh or

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.230
the kids sleeping and I'd be like no I

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.540
just don't want to hear I don't want to

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.320
hear reggaeton

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.300
over my television like I want to be

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.740
able to hear the [ __ ] that's in my house

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.950
and I mean you know maybe those days are

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:34.380
over but they're not it's not a great

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.030
not a great dude it's it's like it's

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:38.340
this should feel good not good this

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.930
should feel like a relief but it doesn't

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:41.130
I don't know I'm gonna complicate it

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:42.870
spot right now on its way know me you

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.420
know you're a good person and I don't

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.040
think I don't think it's out of the

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.320
realm of possibility for you to to not

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.570
feel not feel not feel bad

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:53.940
which shitty things happen to shitty

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.670
people ma'am you know and that might be

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.370
a hard thing to like say out loud but

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:01.410
whoo I think because because you're a

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.210
good person you're going to be like it

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:04.350
you're gonna recognize that oh [ __ ]

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:05.580
these people are really dealt with

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.070
something horrific and because you're a

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:11.400
good person that completely puts aside

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.780
all the all the shitty things that

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.300
you've had to deal with all the [ __ ]

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.740
lame assets I don't even know if they're

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.120
micro aggressive but I don't think

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.460
they're doing it to spite you but it's

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:21.810
just [ __ ] that you've had to put up with

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:23.070
that you shouldn't have to put up with

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:25.830
yeah that I think that's kind of but

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:26.850
that's that's the reason I wanted to

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:28.470
talk to you guys about it and I know

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.120
it's obviously [ __ ] gay but like

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.400
after all that and all the like the

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.470
aggression and like anger and like not

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:36.330
being able to like do something more

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:38.880
about it at the end of it it was just

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.290
like oh these people went through a

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:42.000
disaster and it's like all that was left

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.350
was like a little bit of humanity at the

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.880
end it's just it's just been a weird

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.400
experience been a weird week for me you

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.120
know this is this is actually it seems

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.950
like a cathartic way to end like your

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.830
time at your place now because you

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:58.350
because you got to have that emotional

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:00.180
emotional transaction where you could

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.710
just be nice people to one another and

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:03.270
just get through like base level

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:05.340
humanity whereas in a few weeks you're

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:06.960
gonna be out of there so now you don't

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.880
have that animosity toward them this was

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.850
this can be viewed as a gift for you not

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:13.740
to have that animosity for them as you

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.210
move on to bigger and better things

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.480
sure themed dude or just take a picture

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.430
of the house then wherever you move to

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.200
big ya house next door me burnt down

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.720
took logs out to but I saved everybody

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:33.380
[Laughter]

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.460
you should fight reggaeton with

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.280
reggaeton or blast corn louder than I

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:46.770
thought about where the speaker size is

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:50.580
like twelves are a big deal right you

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.350
know so funny is like when we were about

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:54.240
to start this I was like it'd be so fun

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.920
that just had like a terrible corny

00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:02.730
podcast intro or it's just like how much

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:07.200
of a caustic or you thought about

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.610
aggressive inline skating

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:12.760
I have a railing on my front steps just

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.290
grinding down it every day when I leave

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:14.860
the house

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.710
good morning if you start aggressive

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:20.050
blasting Korn aggressive inline skating

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:21.670

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:23.680

please never figure it out yeah I can't

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:17.440
I try to listen it before I go to bed a

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.820
big laying in bed listening to an

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.660
undertaker bed

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.280
stifling a laugh I was probably you guys

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.800

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:37.050
[ __ ] best and it's actually the the

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:39.030
book that that's using for psych naw

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:41.670
right now I got it through audible and

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:43.530
its really it's all I already feel like

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:46.410
a difference in trying to implement this

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:48.780
[ __ ] yeah dude I'm doing the next book

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.850
after that like the newer book and it's

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:54.300
not a friend it's really it's really

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.460
cool stuff man is it from Steven Hayes

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.700
or is it just about the rft it's the new

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.580
Steven Hayes book okay yeah you like ran

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:04.260
it back basically you did that one in

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.510
like 2011 I think they get out of your

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:08.220
mind in your life then he did the other

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.540
one

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.720
Andrews talking about like last year so

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.250
he and me when I talk to him about it he

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:16.050
was like oh please please please read my

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:17.610
new one is he basically backed

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:19.950
everything up that he said and the first

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:21.270
one if I go I think like hundreds of

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:22.860
studies and then you know came up with

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.290
some different new stuff it's you know

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:27.990
it the the more that like I listen to

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:30.090
what it is a man um the name of the hang

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.070
on I remember they my [ __ ] book it's

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:33.390
get out of your mind and into your life

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:36.780
by Steven C Hayes yes and it's a great

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.400
it's a super interesting book but Matt's

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.880
doing a very necessary breakdown of it

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:45.420
on the man Shane patreon for the segment

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:48.030
called psych naw and I'm a total [ __ ]

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:50.309
[ __ ] so it takes me five lessons to

00:25:50.309 --> 00:25:52.710
get through anything any kind of dense

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:54.720
content but Matt breaks it down in such

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.830
a way that I can listen to it that I

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:57.900
listen to that once and I understood the

00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.340
entire first chapter because of how you

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:02.280
broke that down appreciate that yeah I

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.860
mean it's it's fun man I love it cuz I

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.270
always read stuff like that but it's

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:08.010
been fun to like I make the prezi's

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:09.360
making the Prezi slides is like my

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.130
favorite things I get to add my like

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:13.320
high school Microsoft PowerPoint skills

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.000
and like to I can finally [ __ ] muses

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.340
or something and dude I'm telling you

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.960
man I I started listening to that and I

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.620
immediately started just interacting

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.059
with my thoughts differently like from

00:26:24.059 --> 00:26:26.910
the very very like in a nutshell idea of

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:28.559
just kind of gaining like not aligning

00:26:28.559 --> 00:26:30.929
with your thoughts right away not fusing

00:26:30.929 --> 00:26:32.520
with them trying to put space between

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:35.470
you and them and then just instead of

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:37.600
constantly reacting to try to like avoid

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.730
pain and discomfort of just yep like

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:41.200
that's gonna be there no matter what

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.730
supposedly rather than choosing the path

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:44.830
of like I'm gonna try to avoid pain and

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:46.360
discomfort and just amplify it and

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.010
multiply it I'm gonna just do the things

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:49.390
I want because I'm going to eat [ __ ]

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:52.750
anyway no matter what so now like you

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.100
know you align yourself with your values

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.450
and make decisions based on values

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:57.400
rather than like I don't want to feel

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.169
weird I don't want someone making fun of

00:26:59.169 --> 00:27:03.190
me and um you know dude it like boils

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:05.320
down to my day now where like I used to

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.640
come down in the morning and be like oh

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.110
my god look you don't realize how deep

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.700
it goes or I'm like I'm gonna go down I

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.230
get answer emails like I do this oh my

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.570
god it's all gonna go away and now it's

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:15.610
like a first thing I do is like I run I

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:17.140
do you know I make sure I take care of

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.760
all the [ __ ] that I need to take care of

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.679
that should be the whole point of all

00:27:20.679 --> 00:27:22.240
the stuff that I'm doing rather than

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.280
being trapped in that like hamster wheel

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.110
thing of like if I just once I could I

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.880
constantly get out of it and go right

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.320
back into it like if I just do this

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.030
thing then everything's gonna be dude

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:32.860
and then I can relax it never [ __ ]

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.570
happens you know I feel like it's like

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:37.539
level 2 of the program with Wes because

00:27:37.539 --> 00:27:39.640
it's like was just going to say that Wes

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.070
is like okay here's your goals and goals

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.110
are cool and all but I hit all I hit

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:46.750
most of my goals already so now I'm just

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:51.970
not bragging not bragging like alright

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:53.350
I'm gonna focus on values because

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:56.559
actually my last goals are well my

00:27:56.559 --> 00:27:58.240
ongoing goal is be an asset to my

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.340
friends but my other goals were to like

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:02.380
get better with my family and stuff that

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.840
has a lot more to do with values you

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.610
know what I mean and like learning how

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:08.470
to live a values-based life separating

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:09.669
your mind from yourself

00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:11.590
like but early you shouldn't be beating

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.030
yourself up about having weird thoughts

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:14.260
about your neighbors dude you should

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:17.130
hear what goes on in my [ __ ] head

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:21.850
yeah yeah my neighbors are brutal yeah

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:24.789
well I sympathize with you dude you know

00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:25.840
what's funny is I've been I've been

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.700
seeing a not seeing I've been doing a

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.190
conferences with a sports psychology I'm

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:32.020
sorry he's not he's not accredited yet

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.179
he's uh working toward a sport

00:28:34.179 --> 00:28:37.000
psychology certificate degree anyway

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.260
he's one of the strength and

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:42.130
conditioning coaches at hearts and he

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:44.559
like everyone there's a competitor so

00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:46.539
he's just like breaking down like what

00:28:46.539 --> 00:28:48.220
he knows like he's not like treating

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:49.299
anyone but he's

00:28:49.299 --> 00:28:51.159
like here's you know here's the [ __ ]

00:28:51.159 --> 00:28:53.830
scoop and he says a lot of [ __ ] that

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:55.869
lines up a lot of [ __ ] we're saying and

00:28:55.869 --> 00:28:59.169
it [ __ ] rules and one thing he's he's

00:28:59.169 --> 00:29:02.019
been that like people don't know what

00:29:02.019 --> 00:29:04.360
questions to ask so the basically it

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.730
comes down to like I want to compete in

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:08.590
a combat sport and then I get nervous

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:12.340
and I worry I'm gonna do bad and I can't

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:15.159
then I can't actually perform as well

00:29:15.159 --> 00:29:17.440
because of the worry so what he ends up

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.590
breaking down is just like the the

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:22.559
feelings that you experience are all

00:29:22.559 --> 00:29:26.200
like an involuntary muscle you compare

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.809
them to like your feelings

00:29:27.809 --> 00:29:31.529
almost you can't even like trace them to

00:29:31.529 --> 00:29:34.419
any action on your own part like your

00:29:34.419 --> 00:29:37.119
feelings happen to you so instead of

00:29:37.119 --> 00:29:39.100
trying to like avoid ever feeling like

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.039
anxious or avoid ever worrying what you

00:29:42.039 --> 00:29:44.529
have to do is strengthen like your

00:29:44.529 --> 00:29:46.869
reactions to those feelings and then

00:29:46.869 --> 00:29:49.059
instead of avoiding them you can't they

00:29:49.059 --> 00:29:50.590
actually become usable to you because

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:54.039
you can you know adjust your outcomes

00:29:54.039 --> 00:29:58.419
based on how in a healthy way dealing

00:29:58.419 --> 00:30:01.389
with you know your [ __ ] worries that

00:30:01.389 --> 00:30:03.609
definitely ties into especially the

00:30:03.609 --> 00:30:05.470
beginning of this book and where it

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:08.529
talks about how being mindful of your

00:30:08.529 --> 00:30:10.509
thoughts and not just you know it's like

00:30:10.509 --> 00:30:11.679
grabbing on I think they use like a

00:30:11.679 --> 00:30:13.179
train analogy where it's like you're

00:30:13.179 --> 00:30:15.220
riding the train mm-hmm and it's like

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:18.580
you know you get off at any time like

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:19.869
just because like the trains [ __ ]

00:30:19.869 --> 00:30:21.100
going in one direction like you don't

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.109
have to be like okay I guess I'm [ __ ]

00:30:23.109 --> 00:30:24.309
now I guess I got to ride this train

00:30:24.309 --> 00:30:27.029
through it so it's done [ __ ] going

00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:29.559
you know it's it's just being more

00:30:29.559 --> 00:30:30.759
observant of your thoughts and go back

00:30:30.759 --> 00:30:32.470
to what you said spun about be about

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:36.940
making value-based decisions and as as I

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.619
progressed in this book it just became

00:30:38.619 --> 00:30:41.019
more apparent of you know how big of an

00:30:41.019 --> 00:30:44.409
impact the program has had programming

00:30:44.409 --> 00:30:46.539
with Wes and getting his breakdown in

00:30:46.539 --> 00:30:49.090
his version of has had on my life you

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:50.679
know [ __ ] six months into the year

00:30:50.679 --> 00:30:56.080
whereas III can I can say that all I

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.789
could I could probably say that all my

00:30:57.789 --> 00:31:00.929
actions if not 90% of my actions are

00:31:00.929 --> 00:31:03.250
subconsciously directed to earth

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.830
that I value simply by setting that

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:08.290
structure early on in the year and going

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:10.540
on a day-by-day I have my goals posted

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.520
in my office to look at every day but I

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.360
don't even look at them just because

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.850
they're so ingrained in my mind and I

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:18.430
know whether I look with them or not I'm

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:20.380
gonna I'm gonna be working toward at

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:21.850
least some of them throughout the course

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:24.880
of any given day yeah it's more like as

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.220
you're working through them you work you

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.130
work through them with the values yep

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:32.470
know what I mean like it's like trying

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:33.730
to think of a better way to put that

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:35.680
okay you know it does it simplifies a

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.180
lot of your decisions because if you as

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:38.830
long as you it's like guidelines that

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.540
you already agreed upon and if there's

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.540
no second party adjusting them as you go

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.790
along it's like it becomes intrinsic to

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:48.040
your personality and it like I said it's

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.450
a pleasure decisions by the way if

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:50.830
you're not sure what the program is we

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:53.320
keep talking about the program it was a

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.090
patreon episode we later released as

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:58.750
free Matt and his boy Wes sat down with

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:02.680
us and this dude Wes kind of like took a

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.030
lot of the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:05.290
that we're spouting out about not

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:06.970
wanting to be losers anymore and he sort

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:10.210
of formalized that just based on his own

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:12.640
experiences and man it was almost like a

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.550
meditation on just like proceeding

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:19.750
forward as you are but with a healthier

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:23.950
mindset toward you know not not feeling

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:25.930
shitty about who you are if I could

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:28.890
break it down to the simple as possible

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.750
like I was gonna say like oh well me and

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.340
Matt had a cool conversation with my

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:34.990
uncle Charlie who is pretty much like a

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:37.480
wizard and all this stuff and really

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.890
what it's like it's like if you have

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:40.450
feelings that you're a loser

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:43.510
they're only happening inside you you're

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:46.690
more of a place and it's like the mind

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:49.030
is sitting there making up thoughts if

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:51.460
you don't buy into the thoughts like

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.440
they're more like to train that Rainey's

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.150
talking about like you're just watching

00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:56.770
the thoughts go by put the thought on a

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:59.440
leaf and watch you like blow down blow

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.850
in the wind you know what I mean like

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:03.520
you don't have to buy your thoughts your

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.750
thoughts are separate from your mind

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:06.490
when you have feelings they're just

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:08.500
happening in they're happening in a

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.650
place called Tim Tims pissed at the

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:13.750
reggaeton it's only happening inside you

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:16.480
dude you know what I mean

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.390
no one else knows how pissed you are and

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:21.520
your choice if you're gonna buy into

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.620
that if you're gonna attach your if

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.480
you're gonna tell your mind we're having

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.010
these feelings again let's have all

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:28.240
those thoughts we really love about

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.180
ourselves that's on you you can detach

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:33.670
your mind is just basically just another

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:35.170
part of your body you don't have to buy

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:38.500
into it like it's your personality you

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.270
could rename it like you could name your

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:42.490
brain whatever you want I named mine

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:44.500
Chuck I go alright cool cool thanks

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:47.750
Chuck I'll check in with you later man

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:51.750
[Laughter]

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:53.080
lovely

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:56.140
Jesus Cruz there's a ton of this [ __ ]

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:57.370
we're just on the tip of the iceberg

00:33:57.370 --> 00:34:01.660
this is program level to do Matt knows

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:03.820
where we're going with this this is

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.370
gonna this is gonna blow up dude I mean

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:08.020
it's just the only I don't want to see

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:10.300
any other way you know any way forward

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.070
it's like the current picture painted

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:14.560
for most people you know the some people

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.000
kind of like and that's the thing too

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.130
it's like you know you can escape the

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:20.590
doldrums of everyday existence of like

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.050
you know the average person working in

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:24.850
an office or trapped in a job frustrated

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:26.590
by a boss or you know some sort of

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:29.830
circumstance and it's like the current

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:31.450
mode is like I'm gonna do this thing

00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:33.310
that I'm just telling myself sucks that

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:34.540
everyone else around me is like yeah

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.880
life sucks and then you [ __ ] die and

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.350
I'm just gonna get drunk and you know my

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:40.510
that's my life and it's like yeah that's

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:42.040
the life of a person trying to avoid

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.540
their own fears and you know their own

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.890
parts of themselves they're too scared

00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:46.930
to kind of let out there and follow any

00:34:46.930 --> 00:34:48.160
other path so it's like you know I'm

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.750
gonna do the thing that people dictate

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:51.880
to me that has to be done but it's like

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.170
there's so much space in there to [ __ ]

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:54.460
around and play with stuff and if you

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.960
try different things and you know that's

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.340
what he talks about the psychological

00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:59.260
flexibility stuff it's like can you get

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.370
distance between yourself and your

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:05.020
thoughts you know it's like there's even

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.070
like what Rainey's talked about with the

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:07.510
Train there's that the other thing where

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:09.400
it's like you know say like I'm a loser

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.380
I'm so I'm telling myself I'm a loser

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:12.670
and it's like alright so that's deep

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:14.950
thought people form pretty young usually

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:16.900
pretty early on some what happens is

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.340
people tend to let I'll try to become

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.500
workaholics no no no I'm I'm gonna show

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.210
everybody I'm not a loser and it's like

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:24.220
dude even if you succeed at that you're

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:26.350
still a loser to yourself surrounded by

00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:27.580
a bunch of people you're like you

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.140
probably even more insecure about you're

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:30.130
like oh [ __ ] these people are actually

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:30.460
really

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:31.930
doing this I'm just like an impostor or

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:33.970
whatever here's the senior loser you're

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:35.530
just a senior loser so it's like you

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:37.119
know even if you even if you prove

00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:38.710
yourself wrong that you're not a loser

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:40.420
by like you know doing something

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.599
spectacular you still because you're

00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:45.990
still doing that contract like so if you

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:48.339
if you're even debating whether you're a

00:35:48.339 --> 00:35:50.200
loser or telling yourself I'm not a

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.790
loser you're still on the train that

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:53.200
Rainey's talking about you're still on

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.030
the language train it's a completely

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:56.680
distance yourself and the idea that like

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.510
hold on let me pause like you're saying

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:00.609
like alright Chuck what is this now this

00:36:00.609 --> 00:36:02.230
loser concept you're a team this is not

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:04.510
a real thing by any standard whatsoever

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:07.240
you know it's like they're just I mean

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.589
there's been there's so many people to

00:36:08.589 --> 00:36:10.599
who are considered losers who then like

00:36:10.599 --> 00:36:12.820
200 years later are like oh no that guy

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.290
was sorry we were wrong he's like the

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:17.859
best writer ever it's like oh [ __ ] okay

00:36:17.859 --> 00:36:22.450
yeah it was a [ __ ] loser it's like

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:23.740
you know I'm not saying everyone sitting

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:25.630
there like jerking off right now oh yeah

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:28.420
my [ __ ] genius oh yeah it's like it's

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:30.339
just completely I think it's something

00:36:30.339 --> 00:36:32.890
we're gonna get out of like this idea of

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:34.839
torturing ourselves in our minds when

00:36:34.839 --> 00:36:36.880
most of you know I would say almost all

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.760
of us in America for the most part are

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.440
you know pretty secure with food for the

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.780
you know again for the most part secure

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:46.390
with food aren't really like all of our

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:48.369
physical needs that we've been like

00:36:48.369 --> 00:36:51.130
designed to solve like say when you were

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:52.990
like hundred or thousands of years ago

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:55.750
your problems were physical it's like

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:57.609
you were in a village people would just

00:36:57.609 --> 00:36:59.140
rush into your village and just [ __ ]

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:00.490
everybody and you'd be like what the

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:01.060
[ __ ]

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:02.500
so and you're like we got to do

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:03.730
something about this so you'd build a

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:06.250
physical wall and we build all the walls

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:07.660
we figured out how to grow food we

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.430
figured all the [ __ ] out so now that

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:11.050
same problem-solving brain all that

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:16.420
bring us exactly main tool there and you

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:17.710
know what I mean like we don't need it

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:20.380
to keep solving problems that don't

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:22.570
exist well you're you have a thing

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:24.190
that's designed to solve physical

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:25.869
problems that's now dealing with this

00:37:25.869 --> 00:37:28.540
weird kind of like a theory all realms

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:31.210
of like personal feelings and thoughts

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:33.970
and it's like the brains not the brain

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:35.680
is not designed to solve problems about

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.260
itself I don't typically solves problems

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.490
I don't think I've mentioned it on the

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:42.520
podcast before but jujitsu is a really

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:43.840
healthy way to

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:47.710
occupy that party here it really it

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:49.660
really is it's like it's almost like a

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:54.160
creative output on that it's you're

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.570
you're like you're getting close to a

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:56.890
thing that I've been thinking about a

00:37:56.890 --> 00:38:00.640
lot lately and like program level to

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:03.850
stuff and it's like um I mean I don't

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:06.310
have an elegant way to put this but once

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:07.450
once you get some momentum behind

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:09.910
yourself right like you're like okay I

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:12.130
am definitely not a loser just by

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:14.410
recognizing that I don't want to be one

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:16.600
I'm working toward it's like I'm making

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:17.560
better decisions

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:21.910
I'm quieting the dark voices once you

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:23.200
start to get into some momentum once you

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.200
you know spot actually said this plainly

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.640
already he crushed all of his goals for

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.260
the year the only thing that remains is

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.180
getting tighter with his family that's

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:34.480
program level two is and Wes talked

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.850
about this a lot was but he talked more

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:39.460
about how to add it like your success is

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.720
tied into the value provide for other

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.940
people but that's it's external then

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.320
it's like the connections that you form

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.850
with other people the value that you

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:49.270
provide them in life I think Spurs you

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:52.240
on like professionally creatively

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.510
personally here's my here's my example

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:56.650
this is what I wanna talk about this and

00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:58.120
I'm not gonna be specific about this but

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.070
I know people in my life who are

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:02.410
competing in business against other

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:06.510
people and these other people are making

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:10.080
short-term gain decisions that kind of

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:14.590
leave people out in the cold in in

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:16.780
various ways and then I see the people

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:18.910
that I care about competing with them

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:20.980
and they're making these like painful

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.780
long-term decisions where if they could

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.610
just maybe if they just make a couple of

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:27.400
unscrupulous moves they would cash in a

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.650
lot quicker but and I've had

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.120
conversations with them whether they

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.490
realize that like now like the long game

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:36.460
here is the getting under people and

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.830
building value up under them and then

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:40.180
that comes back to you ten I mean this

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:43.380
is all Bible stuff now I'm getting it

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:47.080
it's like myth stuff its hero's journey

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.900
and the hero's journey man is always him

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.600
and his boys dude you never it's never

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.040
you never here in the story about the

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.350
guy that was playing all cut through a

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:57.730
short game [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:59.619
that dude also Jim yeah usually

00:39:59.619 --> 00:40:01.060
something horrible happens to them and

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.230
that when you look at it from like from

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:03.460
like any sort of like mythology

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.570
perspective they never have someone

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:05.619
who's like yeah and this guy just

00:40:05.619 --> 00:40:06.880
totally thought about himself and he

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.960
just kind of crushed it forever and

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.520
everything was pretty cool yeah all

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.200
they're so deep in our consciousness

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.880
well the cool the cool thing to say

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:13.869
about this today so I'm singing about

00:40:13.869 --> 00:40:15.250
that like the you know there was we had

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:16.510
this physical problem solving brain

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:17.770
because all we're dealing with was their

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:19.720
physical environment you know I think it

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.830
goes back to like a hundred thousand

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:21.970
years ago and then there was a point

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:23.650
where like we started to kind of collect

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:25.330
device then we had a new problem so like

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:27.010
weird interpersonal problems the living

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:28.359
with like a thousand people who kind of

00:40:28.359 --> 00:40:29.890
believe different stuff and I think

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:32.380
that's kind of where religion started to

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.750
our brains just started producing this

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:37.359
idea of religion and as a separate and a

00:40:37.359 --> 00:40:39.220
separate problem-solving modality for

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.380
like what about this like weird [ __ ] now

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:42.970
that we can kind of more so comprehend

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:44.950
like our mortality so our brains just

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:46.690
came up with all this other this whole

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:48.070
other mode of solving problems which is

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:49.660
more of like the faith in the wisdom

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.400
traditions which is like you know that

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.720
we kind of like we're like ah [ __ ] this

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.340
is [ __ ] we're gonna go hard into

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:56.619
science and it's like I mean it's now or

00:40:56.619 --> 00:40:58.030
I mean it's like we're solving all kinds

00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:59.260
of crazy problems and doing all this

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.359
[ __ ] but like you know as we as our

00:41:01.359 --> 00:41:03.010
technology keeps advancing more people

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:04.600
keep killing themselves and like

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.730
arguably the best countries to live in

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:09.600
so it's like it's like it's just weird

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.980
something's [ __ ] off the new book

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:13.420
that I'm reading he's talking about

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.730
taking all of the [ __ ] up [ __ ] that

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:18.040
happened to you or [ __ ] up [ __ ] in

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.740
your life and you pivot it and you turn

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:23.230
it into energy like Matt was Matt made

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:25.570
an analogy to the Infinity stone earlier

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:28.090
which I put on my vision board which is

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:31.450
go because it's like what you should be

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:34.600
able to do on program level two is take

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.940
the most [ __ ] up parts of yourself are

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:38.950
just parts of yourself that are showing

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:41.320
you what you want to what your values

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:43.810
are you know what I mean that makes

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:48.030
sense yeah so it's like say you like um

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:50.619
I'm trying to think this is tough for me

00:41:50.619 --> 00:41:52.750
to think about but uh so you got dumped

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:54.640
if you got dumped or betrayed in some

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.130
sense and it's like well you clearly you

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:59.109
know value emotional intimacy and

00:41:59.109 --> 00:42:01.300
honesty and that person betrayed that so

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:02.890
rather people think we'll [ __ ] that then

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:04.450
I [ __ ] hate [ __ ] forever and it's

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:06.340
like oh yeah that's not gonna work for

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.690
you long term that's kind of how many

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:09.220
heroes quest to seek Bay

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:10.380
exactly

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:14.010
I I encountered her Medusa now finding

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:15.720
Bay the infinity stone that thing thing

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.490
is cool because it's like so if you have

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:18.480
like [ __ ] up stuff happened your

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.220
things that like really jostle you

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:22.110
either events or thoughts or you know

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:23.850
things you were made to believe that's

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:24.990
what I was saying with the Steven Hayes

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:27.510
guys like his whole thing of act you

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:29.010
know he came out with rft which is a

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:31.560
relational frame theory and act he was

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.180
having like vicious vicious panic

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:35.130
attacks and rather than giving in to him

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:36.480
he was like no like I'm not gonna do

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.340
that so he had this whatever that force

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:39.870
was like making this dude panic and

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:42.150
freak out in his apartment what that

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:43.500
ended up being that he was like [ __ ]

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.150
this [ __ ] I'm just gonna do live my

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:46.830
life and live according to my values it

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:49.610
blossomed into two like groundbreaking

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:52.110
modalities and therapy so he was holding

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:53.880
all of that inside of him and this weird

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.560
little you know like you were saying the

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.000
Infinity stone if you try to hold on the

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.010
Infinity stone yourself you die it's too

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:01.260
powerful so you have to just like spread

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.270
all that weird energy of yours out into

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:05.190
the world and then you know things come

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:06.270
up of it if you try to keep all that

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:08.280
stuff in it you'll see yourself a lot it

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:12.150
man what you what you realize that the

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:15.270
key the basis of everything is providing

00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:17.190
value to others and there's no way

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:19.530
around that that that that's that set in

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:21.420
stone that's that I think that's an

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.280
undeniable truth once you realize that

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.500
it makes every [ __ ] up thing that

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:26.730
you've ever had to endure and every

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:28.170
other [ __ ] up thing that you're going

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:30.510
to endure easier to process because you

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:32.100
realize you now have a frame of

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.750
reference to help somebody else up

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:35.370
you're gonna see somebody else in that

00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:37.830
point something so now when you you're

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:39.900
operating from from a vantage point of

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.020
being of service to somebody else

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:43.860
anything that you've had the [ __ ] up

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:45.420
to endure it's like okay I've been there

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:47.250
and you're gonna recognize that whereas

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:50.880
you know other people who are were just

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:53.190
stuff lessly based in their operation

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:54.390
they're not gonna see that they'll go

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:55.440
through their day complaining about

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.330
their own [ __ ] said nobody in

00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:58.050
particular

00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:00.810
but if you you don't even have to hear

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:02.400
this person say a word you could pick up

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.530
on okay I know what this person's going

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:06.210
through because I could just [ __ ]

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:09.120
tell hmm and then the true the the the

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.340
the true payback that you're gonna get

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:13.020
out of life is gonna come through that

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.760
service to others because you're gonna

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:16.080
get it back you're made a lot of money

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:21.060
over yeah yes dude that's a values based

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:23.670
lifestyle and if you live if you look at

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.820
all

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:25.530
Western world or whatever everyone

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:27.450
called America all they're trying to do

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:30.660
is fix problems fix people but it's like

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.790
if everybody got fixed who would help

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:35.430
the person that was messed up if you saw

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:37.980
somebody that was having a problem if if

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:39.570
nobody had if everybody's on these

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:42.060
freakin pills and nobody's experience

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.010
anxiety and you see a little kid with an

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:46.080
anxiety attack like what are you gonna

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:52.110
the [ __ ] up thing that happened to you

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:53.580
identify with it and be like well I'm

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:55.230
gonna do what I can to make sure this a

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:56.760
doesn't happen to somebody else or help

00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.290
anyone that's ever happened to because I

00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:00.450
kind of understand that or if you happen

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:01.650
to someone like you know and love or

00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:03.360
whatever yeah you're gonna be more of a

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.950
more motivated more driven and your life

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:06.000
you're just gonna have more purpose

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.080
because it's like we're living in a

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:08.630
world with people that are like

00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:10.710
workaholics or something or your hero

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:11.820
you don't be like all right like how

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:13.980
[ __ ] up dudes are good at being

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:15.870
comedians and stuff like that but if we

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:18.420
all programmed on this level and we all

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.670
could hold Infinity stones dude we would

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:23.280
be elite dogs dude you know what I mean

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.410
we would be on a psychological level we

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:28.250
would be SEAL Team six for sure yeah

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:30.330
this is something that we've been saying

00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:32.310
since day one is that like this is this

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:35.160
has to be decentralized like there's not

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.650
one [ __ ] lighthouse dish and

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:39.599
now like real quick temp can we be SEAL

00:46:39.599 --> 00:46:44.369
team dicks how do you mute someone else

00:46:44.369 --> 00:46:51.000
instead now Mike no but I was thinking

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.010
about naming my brain rainy because it

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:56.819
plays so much why don't you name it

00:46:56.819 --> 00:47:02.549
brainy god yeah man I just like I said I

00:47:02.549 --> 00:47:05.309
think it's uh you know it's really fun

00:47:05.309 --> 00:47:06.720
it's fun breaking balls and [ __ ]

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.880
around people but it's like the whole

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.920
thing of like you know I'm gonna

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.020
insulate myself from my feelings by just

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:14.819
ceaselessly attacking other people it's

00:47:14.819 --> 00:47:16.559
like that's one of those things I see

00:47:16.559 --> 00:47:19.020
people doing anymore dude man brushing

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.779
your boy when you have absolute faith in

00:47:21.779 --> 00:47:24.000
the relationship you have with them is

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.730
so much funnier it's so so much funnier

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:29.430
dude it is fun like that like yeah it

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:31.020
feels good to get like a thumbs up on

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:32.849
just spitting venom on the internet I

00:47:32.849 --> 00:47:35.130
get it I understand that but when you

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:37.020
have a true connection with people and

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:40.260
you demolish each other my god dude

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:42.119
that's like that's that's coming with

00:47:42.119 --> 00:47:46.020
your boy I mean yeah it's it's awesome

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:47.910
and it's also like again it's like the

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:49.500
survival needs are met like what the

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.000
[ __ ] a problem here what's going on

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.380
what's the jam up and it's like

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:53.789
obviously it's just like you know our

00:47:53.789 --> 00:47:55.260
own competitive nature's and then people

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:56.609
start that's what they talk about the

00:47:56.609 --> 00:47:58.650
relational frames it a young age you

00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:02.039
learn better than bigger than faster

00:48:02.039 --> 00:48:06.150
than wealthier than so you start again

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:07.680
this weird compare you learn to start

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:11.940
comparing things weirder than yeah let's

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:16.470
go here then this is like the spark at

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:19.500
the heart of like fat nurses saying must

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.299
be nice when like someone gets a raise

00:48:21.299 --> 00:48:23.940
or something like that yeah oh yeah it's

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:25.260
gets baked into you and then it's like

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:27.480
Here I am I'm comparing myself to

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:30.539
another person most likely based on some

00:48:30.539 --> 00:48:32.670
weird fantasy I have in my head that has

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:34.440
no basis in this person's life I have no

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:35.789
idea what their life's actually like or

00:48:35.789 --> 00:48:36.690
like what they think or how they feel

00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:38.730
like but I saw that they have the

00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:42.660
all-new Dodge Charger I'm like man guys

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:45.180
might that be a great Dodge Charger

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:47.400
commercial just do like I'm so [ __ ]

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:50.460
gay dude he's got a charger what am i

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.019
doing

00:48:52.019 --> 00:48:55.779
so if people stop like right I have like

00:48:55.779 --> 00:48:57.400
all my stuff yeah I got an apartment I

00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.990
know people have better houses and it

00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:00.549
kind of sucks I saw the Drake video or

00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:02.529
he like dances with a mask on kind of

00:49:02.529 --> 00:49:10.990
chat my [ __ ] ass guys a huge house

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:12.519
but otherwise it doesn't really affect

00:49:12.519 --> 00:49:14.529
my life in any other way that me kind of

00:49:14.529 --> 00:49:16.180
torturing myself to my head so it's like

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:18.640
I just I think it'd be sick if people

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.170
got on the like the page where it's like

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:21.609
all right what do I actually want to do

00:49:21.609 --> 00:49:23.109
like if you don't even figure that out

00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:24.730
at all it's like well dude like you got

00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:26.349
a you know figured at least figure

00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:28.509
something like that out at least try and

00:49:28.509 --> 00:49:30.460
then it's like you know you just get

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:32.380
rather than so the other ideas like I'm

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:33.730
just gonna work for as much money as I

00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:35.589
can to just have the coolest things as

00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:36.910
like you know as like a spider web to

00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:39.279
try to attract people into my life it's

00:49:39.279 --> 00:49:40.809
like I just look at money like it's like

00:49:40.809 --> 00:49:42.249
an oxygen tank dude the more money I

00:49:42.249 --> 00:49:43.809
have I'm like sweet I have my freedom

00:49:43.809 --> 00:49:46.660
for you know X amount of days if [ __ ]

00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:48.549
hits the fan I can just I can just be a

00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:50.079
dude in the world that's how that's how

00:49:50.079 --> 00:49:51.069
I've always looked that money it's like

00:49:51.069 --> 00:49:52.720
it's a freedom thing for us like I can

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.460
save up enough to where I'm free from

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.920
the [ __ ] of you know the job I can't

00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:58.480
exist in certain jobs I just I just

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:00.940
[ __ ] I can't do it but it's like so

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:01.989
that's why it's for me it's been

00:50:01.989 --> 00:50:03.279
important to be like when I make money I

00:50:03.279 --> 00:50:04.630
save it all because I'm like look if

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:06.099
this [ __ ] falls apart which in my life

00:50:06.099 --> 00:50:07.599
tends to be the [ __ ] I'm usually

00:50:07.599 --> 00:50:09.640
building sandcastles oh it's like tends

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.769
to be the case yeah so it's like dude

00:50:11.769 --> 00:50:13.119
it's like that's the I think that's the

00:50:13.119 --> 00:50:15.069
way to look at money to like use your

00:50:15.069 --> 00:50:16.450
values to push you through the day and

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:17.859
then money becomes like the scuba tank

00:50:17.859 --> 00:50:18.940
for you to be off on your little

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:20.859
adventures and when it runs out suck a

00:50:20.859 --> 00:50:22.269
dick and go back to work and you know at

00:50:22.269 --> 00:50:23.259
least you got that purpose like I'm

00:50:23.259 --> 00:50:24.460
gonna get the [ __ ] out of here guys I'm

00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:25.930
getting out it's just you know I haven't

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:27.640
planned but if you just pull it behind

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:30.039
to that like full stock of like yeah

00:50:30.039 --> 00:50:32.230
well buying a house out there now it's

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:34.210
got a you know a little more space and

00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:36.369
our other house and then it's like [ __ ]

00:50:36.369 --> 00:50:39.309
man that [ __ ] sucks mmm what you like

00:50:39.309 --> 00:50:41.140
unless you like that but I don't think a

00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:43.089
lot of people do Matt what point did you

00:50:43.089 --> 00:50:47.589
come to that realization uh man well

00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:49.480
that was like a culture I always kind of

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.190
I was more so I wasn't I didn't have it

00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:52.630
really together I was just like bumbling

00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:54.009
around like selling [ __ ] weed and

00:50:54.009 --> 00:50:54.940
[ __ ] when I was younger just like

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:56.799
whatever man I was kind of an idiot

00:50:56.799 --> 00:50:58.900
honestly but I knew I didn't really give

00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:00.519
a [ __ ] about that stuff then when I was

00:51:00.519 --> 00:51:03.039
like when I first married when I was

00:51:03.039 --> 00:51:05.290
first married to my first wife she

00:51:05.290 --> 00:51:08.710
uh yeah I just realized like the [ __ ]

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:10.600
she was trying to sign me up for she was

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.130
trying to sign me up for a life that

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:14.500
like was part of her fantasy life and

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:15.970
had nothing to do with my I didn't have

00:51:15.970 --> 00:51:17.050
time I didn't oh they're my personal

00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:18.370
values I was just like I don't wanna

00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:19.780
[ __ ] do this [ __ ] [ __ ] sucks

00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:21.780
she was trying to sign me up for like

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:23.830
she wanted me to like make a certain

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:25.060
amount of money and like she just wanted

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:27.010
me in a suit all day she wanted me to

00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:28.810
just don draper out and like didn't care

00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:30.340
what I was doing it was an appearance

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:35.380
thing and I was like dude I just want

00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:37.120
you to wear a suit and choke me would

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:37.870
you please

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:40.920
no she wanted me to like be able to like

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.660
financially support a shopping kind of

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:47.260
thing that I was like it's gonna crush

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:49.900
us could you imagine going shopping just

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:54.280
to go shopping oh my god dude dude I was

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.050
strolling around buying socks today I

00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:59.650
need socks yeah but you'd left the house

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:01.960
for the socks though I was doing it

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:04.870
online I was looking at the actually get

00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:06.790
nice socks and I saw that Hanes like 20

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:10.390
pack for like 9 bucks I'm like neighbor

00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:11.260
it's like looking through your window

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:13.270
the same way if you dudes get dodge

00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:19.120
chargers yeah I mean hopefully that

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:21.100
makes sense but I do think it's like you

00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:22.330
know people can start to realize like

00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:23.650
all right dude like you know I guess

00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:25.990
what is the jam about I mean maybe it's

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:29.020
like it's BAE is it like the messages

00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:30.520
people get early on like what what's

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:32.230
what's [ __ ] people up right now I

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:34.300
think a big thing is not having those

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:35.920
kind of role models that are programming

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:38.170
early on in your life mm-hmm because you

00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:39.970
know just on a personal level psyche I

00:52:39.970 --> 00:52:41.440
never saw my parents like working

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.810
towards something so there was no it

00:52:43.810 --> 00:52:45.820
would have never occurred to me to think

00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:47.320
that like oh if I want this I'm gonna

00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:49.120
have to work towards something were like

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:50.440
oh you could better yourself or build

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.630
yourself all I observed was people just

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:55.870
in perpetual states mm-hmm to me that

00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:57.190
was just like you are what you are and

00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:59.650
that's what it is I keep I keep asking

00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:01.150
myself this question cuz like my dad

00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:02.860
always the hardest worker I ever met

00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:05.760
never a complainer in his life right but

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:08.380
it's like I don't know it looked a lot

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:09.910
like bad luck but obviously now I don't

00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:12.520
believe in bad luck so it's like they I

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:14.410
think there's like this culture among

00:53:14.410 --> 00:53:17.920
people who it looks like we all have the

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:18.940
same exact background

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:21.309
in life I'm gonna say but there's this

00:53:21.309 --> 00:53:22.780
culture of like I just got to play

00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:24.700
catch-up until I hit a certain point and

00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:26.170
then once I hit that point then it's

00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:30.220
gonna take off that point is never it's

00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:31.720
an illusion it's the it's the [ __ ]

my life I've been I first of all I fused

00:53:41.559 --> 00:53:43.119

mm-hmm

00:54:01.869 --> 00:54:04.059

good enough you know what I mean I just

00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:58.900
have to start living towards my values

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:01.900
ya know what I mean like my things are

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:04.510
I'm gonna like I'm tired [ __ ] I'm just

00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:05.920

00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:11.319
dudes how are you buddy like yeah dude

00:55:11.319 --> 00:55:12.940
I'm with you on the sofa self-esteem

00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:14.650
[ __ ] dude because I don't think it was

00:55:14.650 --> 00:55:19.809
until maybe maybe about three years ago

00:55:19.809 --> 00:55:21.819
where I started to build self-esteem up

00:55:21.819 --> 00:55:23.260
until that point there was like all

00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:25.270
these instances of like false bravado

00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:27.250
and like trying to just fill my life

00:55:27.250 --> 00:55:28.630
with things if it's like being

00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:30.039
confrontational just for the sake of

00:55:30.039 --> 00:55:31.930
being confrontational and proving that

00:55:31.930 --> 00:55:33.130
to myself

00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:34.450
but it wasn't until a couple of years

00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:35.920
ago I feel like that started to build

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:39.099
and I feel like I'm at a point now where

00:55:39.099 --> 00:55:40.900
like it's no coincidence that shit's

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:43.150
starting to fall in line with my values

00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:45.520
that I have written out because that

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:47.170
self-esteem started to rise and rise and

00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:49.570
rise because I started to value myself

00:55:49.570 --> 00:55:52.119
more and in valuing myself more I

00:55:52.119 --> 00:55:54.760
provide more value on my thoughts my

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:58.210
words and my actions so something's

00:55:58.210 --> 00:56:01.060
[ __ ] me up it's only momentary whereas

00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:04.240
before like I remember like just driving

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.010
around with my face and my neck being

00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:09.010
hot from just being angry at myself for

00:56:09.010 --> 00:56:11.470
no reason in particular we brainy I used

00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:12.760
to have problems with girls when I was

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:15.730
younger like I had such bad problems

00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:18.250
with girls like attachment [ __ ] Matt

00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:20.410
Matt knows about it you know like

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:22.210
because he went to school and stuff but

00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:24.130
like one time I got drunk with my

00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:25.990
girlfriend at a bar she went to the

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:27.820
bathroom and she was there for a little

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:29.380
bit longer than I thought she should be

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:32.290
I got I left the bar and I punched a

00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:35.490
hole like city block of mirrors of cars

00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:37.450
you know what I mean like that's how

00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:47.980
[ __ ] up my head got she's old are your

00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:56.950
hands bleed she's just like the funny

00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:58.839
thing too because it's like so you know

00:56:58.839 --> 00:57:00.130
it's like everyone has different like

00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:01.720
you know you you look at it through your

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:02.950
like you know everyone looks at it

00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:04.839
through their lens and history and like

00:57:04.839 --> 00:57:06.430
the way they perceive the world they

00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:08.109
just kind of assume like I guess this is

00:57:08.109 --> 00:57:09.130
what this person's thinking but it's

00:57:09.130 --> 00:57:10.420
like a grand ears talk about like

00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:12.160
self-esteem stuff it was talking about

00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:15.730
attachment I from I guess like [ __ ] man

00:57:15.730 --> 00:57:17.740
as long as I can remember but definitely

00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:20.470
throughout my 20s I just had like not I

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:21.880
didn't really have a solid sense of

00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:23.500
myself whatsoever at all like I always

00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:25.420
explained to people it's like the movie

00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:27.040
ghost with Patrick Swayze but people

00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:31.359
could see me so I just like hey what do

00:57:31.359 --> 00:57:32.890
you think about this I'm like oh no I

00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:38.260
could see both sides gasps oh yeah gel

00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:41.050
felt like for me that's why that's how I

00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:43.450
came up the felt is like a floating orb

00:57:43.450 --> 00:57:45.670
all the time just like I guess I mean I

00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:46.570
was also in like I

00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:49.180
weird [ __ ] I had a very bizarre 20s

00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:51.820
and uh oh yeah man and it's like this

00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:53.920
scary not scary the cool thing for me

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:55.450
but it was kind of like I'm settling was

00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:58.000
like so you know it's like one one point

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.160
how it was this is forever ago I

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:02.050
remember winning Philly's funniest and

00:58:02.050 --> 00:58:03.580
again and it takes like I'm like mostly

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:05.350
just a ghost it's floating about and

00:58:05.350 --> 00:58:06.970
then I win this thing that can create

00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:08.710
like a concrete thing that was like oh

00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:10.330
you're the winner now I remember it was

00:58:10.330 --> 00:58:12.670
like surreal I was like was it surreal

00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:15.270
because you were hearing the boos yeah

00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:18.160
we're creating the boos I was like me

00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:20.950
this entity that I like inhabit and am

00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:23.380
just won this thing people work late

00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:24.820
just doesn't it just felt fake to the

00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:25.930
point where I'm saying like even if you

00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:28.510
do well I was like I didn't really win

00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:29.770
like in my head I'm like I didn't really

00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:31.570
win this is like just weird you know I'm

00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:33.160
like oh I guess now I have to inhabit

00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:35.230
the life of the winner now and I was

00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:36.490
like trying to think how it was just

00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:38.170
like really bizarre remembered but I

00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:39.310
remember that feeling I felt really good

00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:41.230
about it and then I was working at my

00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:43.330
field placement for school and it was

00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:44.290
like you know it was just me and this

00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:45.670
guy over in an office and like it turned

00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:47.650
out like this guy was like not about to

00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:48.820
get a house he wanted to get it out of

00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:49.960
the place he was it was a [ __ ] up

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.040
neighborhood there's needles everywhere

00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:54.460
he had kids and I [ __ ] did it for me

00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:56.470
dude I did a bunch of [ __ ] with the

00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:58.090
math I finagled a bunch of [ __ ] I worked

00:58:58.090 --> 00:59:00.610
my magic on just like this internship it

00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:01.600
was you know it was just I was just

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.620
sitting there working with guys who got

00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:04.660
a jail and I got this dude it was like a

00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:05.980
two-bedroom apartment in a slightly

00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:08.500
better neighborhood and he was and I was

00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:10.180
like lady called me he was sitting next

00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:12.220
to me ladies like I fine we're gonna let

00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:13.360
him rent it and it was like I don't like

00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:14.680
talking me all that you know it's like

00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:16.690
guy had done an XY and Z and I had

00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:18.400
talked RIT's lady into it and I remember

00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:19.900
that like the guy was looking at me and

00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:21.730
I was like like we did it and it was

00:59:21.730 --> 00:59:23.320
just that feeling is winning me Philly's

00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:24.550
funniest and that's when I was like oh

00:59:24.550 --> 00:59:25.300
okay

00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:27.190
like you just have brain chemicals you

00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:28.300
got a trigger and it's a matter of how

00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:29.380
do you do them and like what are the

00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:30.670
innate ways you can trigger those

00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:32.950
chemicals versus like I'm going to do

00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:34.570
the things that I think have been told

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:36.310
to me that I need to trigger those like

00:59:36.310 --> 00:59:38.500
happiness feelings but in reality if I

00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:39.760
just get a dude in the apartment I'm

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.740
equally as stoked as when he's funny I'm

00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:44.140
not making that up I was like so floored

00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:45.190
I was like holy [ __ ] this is like

00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:46.990
exactly how excited I was by once like

00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:48.310
there's oh there's a maximum two that

00:59:48.310 --> 00:59:50.020
you can only get so excited about [ __ ]

00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:52.210
dude next year you should train him to

00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:54.990
win Philly's funniest

00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:59.099
you back on training them to make really

00:59:59.099 --> 01:00:02.220
good excuses for not winning it this I

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:03.510
know but it was funny because in my

01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:05.640
school everyone would be like yeah I'm

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.650
like a revolutionary social worker and

01:00:07.650 --> 01:00:09.420
like how can we be revolutionary and

01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:11.339
it's like I just I would lie and forge

01:00:11.339 --> 01:00:15.750
people's financial I remember their like

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:17.490
gold like how can we operate within this

01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:18.990
system I was like you guys are free

01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:21.180
interns just fudge like I do I like

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:22.890
fudge the [ __ ] financial [ __ ] and all

01:00:22.890 --> 01:00:24.480
the kinds of stuff and they're like

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.740
would I told my class something I just

01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:27.240
[ __ ] lie on [ __ ] and just get people

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:29.339
apartments and they're like and again it

01:00:29.339 --> 01:00:30.869
was all covered in anything anyway but

01:00:30.869 --> 01:00:33.089
like by you know the agency but they're

01:00:33.089 --> 01:00:34.769
like would even do it if something

01:00:34.769 --> 01:00:36.839
happens I was like I don't give a [ __ ] I

01:00:36.839 --> 01:00:38.460
was like oh I [ __ ] up I'm sorry I'm an

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:40.650
intern I don't get paid they're like how

01:00:40.650 --> 01:00:43.769
can you do that lying is for describing

01:00:43.769 --> 01:00:45.390
everything that's important to you and

01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:46.950
your entire personality on the internet

01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:49.529
not for helping people that was that

01:00:49.529 --> 01:00:50.940
these are people who were like at the

01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:52.440
time was like whatever I'm just doing

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:53.730
this thing but they're like we're agents

01:00:53.730 --> 01:00:56.130
of change we're freedom fighters oh but

01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:57.690
if I fudged you're like an extra pay

01:00:57.690 --> 01:00:59.730
stub on a thing I might get in trouble

01:00:59.730 --> 01:01:00.960
it's like you're you're a revolutionary

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:02.569
you're worried about getting reprimanded

01:01:02.569 --> 01:01:06.150
your job the sidebar but it's like your

01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:16.410
guy train robber you know just I don't

01:01:16.410 --> 01:01:21.299
know I'm saying this like yeah it's like

01:01:21.299 --> 01:01:22.500
I found a guy a two-bedroom apartment

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:27.839
okay just so you know I received that

01:01:27.839 --> 01:01:30.329
that story with the same level of

01:01:30.329 --> 01:01:32.460
enthusiasm as you telling it thank you

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:35.009
yeah that does [ __ ] rule that hits

01:01:35.009 --> 01:01:36.930
hardback because like I've any place

01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:40.500
that I've got to to rent as a home for

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.630
my family has been because they didn't

01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:43.650
run a credit check and they were just

01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:45.990
like yeah I guess we'll do it yeah so

01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:47.460
like that kind of [ __ ] goes a long way

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:49.200
because people people would have to go

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.190
through those experiences get

01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:52.440
butt-fucked relentlessly in a [ __ ]

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.940
takes a toll on you and it wears you the

01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:56.039
[ __ ] down yeah while that there's no

01:01:56.039 --> 01:01:58.170
talk of like the underclass it's like

01:01:58.170 --> 01:01:59.700
you have to hit rock bottom before you

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:02.880
get Social Work you know man knows what

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.309
I'm talking about but it's just like you

01:02:05.309 --> 01:02:07.079
know if you're hovering right above rock

01:02:07.079 --> 01:02:08.040
bottom know

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:10.650
there to help you yeah and then they're

01:02:10.650 --> 01:02:12.090
like why are these people so bitter and

01:02:12.090 --> 01:02:13.440
mad these guys [ __ ] suck and it's

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.030
like well you know because they're

01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:16.860
working and they're watching people live

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:19.140
just as good as them just we're chilling

01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:20.820
it's like none of these guys have Dodge

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:22.440
Chargers do you understand what it feels

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:26.040
like and now it's I mean yeah

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.660
does someone who's like hovered right

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:29.520
above that my entire life like yeah I

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.830
have a lot of I don't know empathy for

01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:33.930
those people but dude who knows maybe

01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:35.550
you know we've had a lot of people reach

01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:37.050
out to us like hey man I'm in recovery

01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:39.480
or hey man like people that haven't

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.220
bottom doubt you like that's our [ __ ]

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:43.980
demographic dude right there like above

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:47.550
the [ __ ] bottom though at least I

01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:49.320
know Matt's killing it but that's me you

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:52.160
know well I mean that's me that's us I

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.450
don't have you I also cards for the

01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:58.700
record that could collapse it yeah yeah

01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:01.830
that's like slowly climbing up on like

01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:04.320
the most rickety [ __ ] scaffolding

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.180
ever he's like this is great up here you

01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:07.830
guys you should start just bolting the

01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:09.630
[ __ ] together dude it's so far I've

01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:12.030
zeroed out so many times where - god man

01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:16.080
it's been five at least five four or

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.060
five times that I've had all my money

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.920
taken from me and what one fell swoop

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:23.220
well it's happened so many I remember my

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:24.960
first weddings probably partly why I

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.760
didn't work out I took all the money

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.950
from the wedding like the gifts and then

01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:31.230
mail wash and say this but either way I

01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:33.300
made a risky investment that involved me

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:34.710
mailing all that money to California in

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:41.160
the postal police took it dude that was

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:42.750
just once I've lost all my money in the

01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:43.800
world before that like four or five

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.170
times right I have $0 and I wake up and

01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:49.350
I'm $0 oh my god what are you gonna do

01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:52.230
it's like psychological flexibility yeah

01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:53.670
dude it was like okay I'm here now and

01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:55.410
I'm working and you know I'm working

01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:57.150
I'll save up I'll get back on top do my

01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:58.950
thing and it's like if you have that

01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:00.300
mentality it makes everything you're

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:02.610
doing so much more fun I love the idea

01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:03.930
of West coastal police pulling over a

01:04:03.930 --> 01:04:06.270
letter it's like you have any idea how

01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:11.250
fast you're going yeah overnight they

01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:14.310
just keep it like you have two days to

01:04:14.310 --> 01:04:15.330
get down here and get this and you're

01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:18.630
like that's a mousetrap I'm gonna [ __ ]

01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:20.650
[Laughter]

01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:23.380
he's gonna send someone is it illegal to

01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:27.069
mail money uh it's yeah it's like you're

01:04:27.069 --> 01:04:28.660
not technically supposed to but if you

01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:30.220
can go down there and back up like why

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:31.660
you're doing it and we're the funds

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:34.329
required well I don't like that yeah so

01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:35.680
yeah you're not supposed to but if you

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:37.150
go down there you're like hey you're

01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:38.650
it's like highly discouraged and I think

01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:40.180
you're not allowed to but if you somehow

01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:41.559
or like way that's mine I can show you

01:04:41.559 --> 01:04:42.880
how to yeah that's my allowance you

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.410
don't spend it on candy get the [ __ ] out

01:04:44.410 --> 01:04:46.990
of my face we I think they needed like

01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:48.609
where's this 1099 bro and you're like

01:04:48.609 --> 01:04:57.430
hmm return to sender oh yeah what was it

01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:58.750
all it wasn't really all mine am i right

01:04:58.750 --> 01:05:00.849
I'm waiting on a couple people they got

01:05:00.849 --> 01:05:02.650
a money sniffing dog it's got a monocle

01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:08.079
and it's gotta be funny to open up and

01:05:08.079 --> 01:05:12.849
be like there is a here it's such a

01:05:12.849 --> 01:05:14.680
stupid move that they should know how

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.180
important the money was to you and just

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:19.510
give it back true like know what money

01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:21.640
would dude like do this or you had

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.140
something I got sold it on an investment

01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:25.089
someone someone promised me a pie in the

01:05:25.089 --> 01:05:26.289
sky I think that sounds like a good idea

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:28.119
you just gotta take everything I own and

01:05:28.119 --> 01:05:29.710
give it to one little thing and hope it

01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:33.279
works out like yeah dude you said it

01:05:33.279 --> 01:05:35.410
yourself about six months ago the pie is

01:05:35.410 --> 01:05:38.829
infinite now for sure for now that's how

01:05:38.829 --> 01:05:40.180
you gotta operate though man it's like

01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:41.740
you know the end of at the end of what I

01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:43.569
learned from losing money all my money

01:05:43.569 --> 01:05:45.309
not even just money all of my money so

01:05:45.309 --> 01:05:47.410
many times is like your day two days the

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:49.359
only thing that matters as long as

01:05:49.359 --> 01:05:50.589
you're dated today you can have your day

01:05:50.589 --> 01:05:52.270
today and somewhat command that or even

01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:53.380
just start out by commanding like

01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:55.359
alright I know I gotta go [ __ ] work I

01:05:55.359 --> 01:05:56.589
gotta drive it now or get there but I

01:05:56.589 --> 01:05:58.569
have a half an hour my day and I'm I'm

01:05:58.569 --> 01:06:00.549
the owner of that half an hour I'm going

01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:01.900
to do something that I want to do and

01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:03.160
something that I think will benefit me

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.750
or spend it in a way that I actually

01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:06.220
like rather than coming home and like

01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:08.260
eating cake and watching TV and then

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.819
further hating myself and then like you

01:06:09.819 --> 01:06:11.980
just spread that little you know doubt

01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:13.750
of time out all right now I got somehow

01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:15.460

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.540
imagine like I said they use that like

01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:41.390
you know if we're sitting it's funny to

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:42.620
think that like right now we're sitting

01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:44.960
with like you know millions of human

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.430
minds they're ready to like solve

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:48.350
complex problems via the internet and

01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:49.970
it's just you've watched YouTube comment

01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:51.950
it's just like Selena Gomez is a [ __ ]

01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:53.960
[ __ ] all right I don't think we're using

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:59.000
this thing right branding topics on

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.850
Twitter sometimes it's horrifying - yeah

01:08:01.850 --> 01:08:04.100
man I'd rather just open random doors in

01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:06.350
a morgue then look at tweets from people

01:08:06.350 --> 01:08:10.820
I don't know I just think like yeah

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:12.320
there's so many people living out there

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.210
and they just live with they just deal

01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:15.770
with their Jam ups and they're like oh

01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:17.990
I'm jammed and they just don't know that

01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:20.510
that's their Infinity stone true you

01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:21.680
know what I mean like if you knew that

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.600
was the deal like [ __ ] man I have

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.150
anxiety I have this I have that and it's

01:08:26.150 --> 01:08:27.740
like if they could learn how to hold it

01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:31.010
like a [ __ ] immortal mm-hmm you know

01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:33.260
what I mean yeah I've never seen

01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:34.940
guardians of galaxy you just probably

01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:37.970
have to see that movie I mean this [ __ ]

01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:39.560
used to get kind of filtered out of us

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.670
like it you know when they had all those

01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:42.140
rites of passages and all that stuff

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:44.030
it's like rites of passage it's like you

01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:45.380
know it was like all right dude you

01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:46.990

01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:50.200
20 days and it's like huh so like [ __ ]

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:51.910
[ __ ] got tramped out of everybody if you

01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:53.110
did if you were like no they're like

01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:54.490
yeah they'd [ __ ] off but now it's like

01:08:54.490 --> 01:08:55.510
you can just kind of float through your

01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:57.100
life yeah you feel a lot of people are

01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:58.690
floating with some real [ __ ] [ __ ] dude

01:08:58.690 --> 01:09:00.490
dude it the other day not you know again

01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:02.170
this was just something I was just kind

01:09:02.170 --> 01:09:03.490
of at my wit's end because I was just

01:09:03.490 --> 01:09:05.170
like you know doing like new baby

01:09:05.170 --> 01:09:07.150
marriage stuff but it's like I just went

01:09:07.150 --> 01:09:09.940
into my bathtub at nighttime killded

01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:11.470
killed the lights and it's laid in a

01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:13.540
dark pool of warm water for like an hour

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:15.400
and it stared into the darkness I'm like

01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:16.900
[ __ ] I would say there being like this

01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:19.150
[ __ ] rolls beam I was like yes as I

01:09:19.150 --> 01:09:20.440
was like this is the [ __ ] people need to

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:22.780
start doing it's going pitch-black and

01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:24.010
it's being like what the [ __ ] am i doing

01:09:24.010 --> 01:09:26.380
that's more dogology [ __ ] I said ah

01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:28.570
what's okay or would you be interested

01:09:28.570 --> 01:09:30.790
in a rite of passage for the Church of

01:09:30.790 --> 01:09:33.550
sacred dogology yeah I'd have to think

01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:36.250
about it though yeah for sure but I

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:38.560
thought I remember when I it's funny

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.720
when I when I taught a comedy class at

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:45.220
fit and got I know so funny by the time

01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:46.360
I didn't have health insurance I had no

01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:48.520
again I was on a zero out period this

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:50.350
one guy's only 30 bucks an hour teach a

01:09:50.350 --> 01:09:54.160
comedy class only okay but the thing I

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.270
used to tell remember I was sitting with

01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:56.710
the class and I was like yeah sometimes

01:09:56.710 --> 01:09:57.850
it's like trying to explain it in like

01:09:57.850 --> 01:09:58.840
different ways I was like I'm not a

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:00.280
naturally like extroverted person I

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:02.020
don't like kind of feel like I don't

01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:03.280
like to dance in public [ __ ] like that

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:05.170
like when I'm driving sometimes I'll

01:10:05.170 --> 01:10:07.000
make myself dance and singing next to

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.350
somebody to like knowing they're like

01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:09.610
I'll think like all they're looking at

01:10:09.610 --> 01:10:12.220
me thinking I'm weird and I for myself -

01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:13.990
that feeling just kind of like so I'm

01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:15.700
not such like a weird crunched in weirdo

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:17.170
and I was telling this to a group of

01:10:17.170 --> 01:10:19.960
those kids and they were like what I was

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.130
like all right never mind guys but I

01:10:21.130 --> 01:10:22.300
think something like that I'm just

01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:25.090
putting yourself vulnerable spot even if

01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:26.320
it's like something dumb just to you

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.970
it's like that's I think that's a right

01:10:27.970 --> 01:10:28.830
of passage

01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:32.170
I like yeah maybe West's idea of taking

01:10:32.170 --> 01:10:33.520
a dance class so that you could go

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:36.090
school somebody

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:41.080
west makes himself vulnerable which

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:44.080
means wound able hilarious yeah and he

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.820
gets strong enough to be like [ __ ] you

01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:48.190
you can't hurt me yeah yeah that's one

01:10:48.190 --> 01:10:49.240
way to do it man

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:51.040
you know what I mean yeah I mean I feel

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.210
like if you just kind of put yourself

01:10:52.210 --> 01:10:54.220
out there it's again this is my I like

01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:55.750
the idea of fear gates it's like there's

01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:57.280
a fear gate like starting the church of

01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:59.320
dogology was a fear gate for mine it was

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.670
something I thought about doing and was

01:11:00.670 --> 01:11:00.910
like

01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:02.470
that's kind of weird I don't want to do

01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:04.390
that then you just kind of Pat the you

01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:06.070
know the first day I did it I'm like

01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:07.780
this is weird I shouldn't do this it's

01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:09.940
gonna go horribly and then I just did it

01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:11.110
and it actually went well and it was

01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:12.400
like oh sick I passed through my fear

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.020
gate now I can actually do that yeah I

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:15.850
have a severe like fear gate with Bayes

01:11:15.850 --> 01:11:16.540
dude

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:18.820
yep you know what I mean but now I'm

01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:26.500
armed with like weapons I got skills

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:30.900
from Matt's like nah I got blue cheese

01:11:31.170 --> 01:11:36.820
[Laughter]

01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:54.190
so if you actually just kind of live out

01:11:54.190 --> 01:11:55.930
like what do I actually value what is

01:11:55.930 --> 01:11:57.340
the parts of myself that are hit you

01:11:57.340 --> 01:11:59.380
know trapped beneath my fear gates if

01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:01.780
they all kind of came into the light I'm

01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:03.520
gonna get my balls broken about X Y & Z

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.140
for a little bit but it's not forever

01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:06.730
saying it's like nobody's gonna follow

01:12:06.730 --> 01:12:08.680
you around forever you're just going to

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.390
the people who would who don't like it

01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:11.530
well this is kind of like MIT you know

01:12:11.530 --> 01:12:13.150
erupt in there weird reaction or

01:12:13.150 --> 01:12:15.640
whatever you triggered in them they and

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.020
then they kind of fall back and you

01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:18.310
either just attract the thing that you

01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:20.620
actually like to do or you just it helps

01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:22.600
you so much that you just are in some

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:24.190
other space entirely where it's like

01:12:24.190 --> 01:12:26.050
that whole act like rumbling echo of

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:27.640
negativity is just so far behind you

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:28.930
you're like what I was even thinking

01:12:28.930 --> 01:12:30.100
about it do you know you might be in the

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:32.410
growing pains of everybody is just gonna

01:12:32.410 --> 01:12:34.510
find out about the infinity stone and if

01:12:34.510 --> 01:12:37.270
everybody starts holding it then we're

01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:39.210
all going to ascend to another density

01:12:39.210 --> 01:12:41.710
with that I'll see I'm telling you this

01:12:41.710 --> 01:12:42.520
is what needs to happen

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:44.230
the Ascension needs to happen Bay time

01:12:44.230 --> 01:12:47.500
who's like you know again what's the

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:48.700
flojet state dude

01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:50.680
what the [ __ ] the problem man like

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:51.940
what did people worried about I mean I

01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:53.020
know there's like severe there are

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:55.180
severe Jam ups but like I didn't I

01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:57.220
couldn't say I had like severe severe

01:12:57.220 --> 01:12:59.740
Jam ups but I was severely jammed up for

01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:02.380
almost a decade did it's knocked loose

01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:03.760

my the deep dives are serious well I I

01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:13.110
don't want to get into the deep

01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:15.540
because like I don't I don't I feel like

01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:18.060
I'd if I started right now the whole

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.650
night would not be long enough to like

01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:22.350
break it down and impress upon people

01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:25.380
how serious it is that's another one man

01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:27.090

01:13:34.139 --> 01:13:35.369
gonna hear this would already kind of

01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:37.230
know but break it down a little well so

01:13:37.230 --> 01:13:38.460
what I so what happened they kind of

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:39.869
started we're like well this is how it

01:13:39.869 --> 01:13:41.040
started kind of actually like got

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:43.080
implemented where I went through our

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:44.250
patreon and there was like people who

01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:45.989
are giving us more than a dollar like

01:13:45.989 --> 01:13:47.310
some people goes five from doing cents

01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:48.750
but give us more so I was like alright I

01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:50.850
want to do extra stuff it may tears the

01:13:50.850 --> 01:13:52.710
people who give us extra money and like

01:13:52.710 --> 01:13:53.969
just do things for people at different

01:13:53.969 --> 01:13:56.130
levels of that letter extra and then you

01:13:56.130 --> 01:13:57.239
know you do stuff like hey I'm gonna

01:13:57.239 --> 01:13:58.560
offer it to these people and your people

01:13:59.909 --> 01:14:02.010
they can get it's like well it's extra

01:14:02.010 --> 01:14:03.300
because they give me extra so I'm giving

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:05.250
them extra it's nothing with you but so

01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:06.960
I wasn't right so for the people who do

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:08.699
10 bucks a month I'm gonna do the Church

01:14:08.699 --> 01:14:10.830
of dogology which is it's not content

01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:12.989
it's just a live stream that happens and

01:14:12.989 --> 01:14:16.469
it's just people I'm gonna lit up it's

01:14:16.469 --> 01:14:18.570
all good yeah so and I'm still figuring

01:14:18.570 --> 01:14:19.770
out what it is but really it's like I

01:14:19.770 --> 01:14:21.239
just want to see if if you can get a

01:14:21.239 --> 01:14:23.159
bunch of people who are properly

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:25.020
intentioned who can just meet in a space

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:28.110
and just help each other in a way that's

01:14:28.110 --> 01:14:30.060
like actually valuable and authentic and

01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:31.590
then see see if you can create a

01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:33.960
positive thing out of just a throw a

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:35.280
bunch of people at the thing who are

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:36.510
properly intentioned and see if you can

01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:38.040
create positivity in everyone's life

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.530
that's that's the that's the goal and

01:14:40.530 --> 01:14:42.690
hypothesis and last week it worked it

01:14:42.690 --> 01:14:44.550
was like oh I felt great everyone left

01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:46.409
it was like yeah that was awesome so and

01:14:46.409 --> 01:14:48.869
the way it works is I have the I have

01:14:48.869 --> 01:14:50.400
the wisdom scroll so it's just a Google

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:51.900
Doc so it's just like questions if

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:53.250
anyone has any questions or things that

01:14:53.250 --> 01:14:54.600
are like deeply gnawing at them

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.699
it's like write it on the Google Doc and

01:14:56.699 --> 01:14:58.469
then there's parts where if like if you

01:14:58.469 --> 01:14:59.880
came up with like an insight you read

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:01.409
something really cool write that into

01:15:01.409 --> 01:15:03.179
the wisdom part for the Google Docs and

01:15:03.179 --> 01:15:05.400
like before Sundays everyone reads to

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.600
Google Doc and like alright here's these

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.699
things people are dealing with I think

01:15:08.699 --> 01:15:10.170
about it do I have thoughts on this cool

01:15:10.170 --> 01:15:12.000
if not no problem and I hear something

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.350
cool I read I'll put it in there so

01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:14.760
eventually after like you know hopefully

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.489
years there'll be this gigantic Google

01:15:17.489 --> 01:15:19.050
Doc that just filled with wisdom and

01:15:19.050 --> 01:15:20.340
then filled with little problems and

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:22.260
afterwards the problems get discussed if

01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:23.369
you come up with something that sounds

01:15:23.369 --> 01:15:24.929
good or works you just write that right

01:15:24.929 --> 01:15:26.130
under the problem add that to the wisdom

01:15:26.130 --> 01:15:26.969
part this is

01:15:26.969 --> 01:15:30.000
the same dude pretty sick that's insane

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.800
but how does it feel how does it feel

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:33.239
just presenting it plainly like that

01:15:33.239 --> 01:15:35.850
it's [ __ ] it's awesome dude again

01:15:35.850 --> 01:15:37.350
it's this kind of stuff like you just

01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:38.910
have to do it like you it's like a seed

01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:40.469
it's an idea in you know yeah it's kind

01:15:40.469 --> 01:15:41.699
of weird and it [ __ ] it I'm just gonna

01:15:41.699 --> 01:15:42.989
do it see what happens

01:15:42.989 --> 01:15:44.190
worst comes to worst everyone's like

01:15:44.190 --> 01:15:46.080
what the [ __ ] was that yeah sorry I did

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:47.969
some weird no not sorry actually I did

01:15:47.969 --> 01:15:50.010
exactly what I wanted to do and true no

01:15:50.010 --> 01:15:51.239
Lauren you know what I mean I actually

01:15:51.239 --> 01:15:52.980
that's what I wanted to ask level well I

01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:54.960
I wanted to ask you is like along the

01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:57.800
way are you seeing ways that you could

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:00.510
kind of like present it or make it like

01:16:00.510 --> 01:16:02.070
something that you've already seen were

01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:03.480
you like well people would understand

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:05.250
that in that context if I made it more

01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:08.520
like that and you're like no nay I must

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:11.400
make it exactly my vision whether or not

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.920
it's you know the cool thing to is like

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:15.630
I'm just doing it for the sake of doing

01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:16.920
it that's the other thing too before I I

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.540
had I have obviously had weed dealer

01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:19.800
brain so I'm always like trying to like

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.300
see if I can make five bucks off FIFO

01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:22.920
like I'm [ __ ] to charge you five and

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:25.680
I pay full three you know so I've been

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:26.730
trying to get out of that and I'm like

01:16:26.730 --> 01:16:28.170
this would be cool just to do a thing

01:16:28.170 --> 01:16:29.940
that's this for the state of the things

01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:32.100
like all my bills are paid I'm chilling

01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:34.020
I don't need to be like and then I can

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.310
do this it's like this is just something

01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:38.280
I can just do and have it provide value

01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.080
and just figure out all the rest later I

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:42.570
don't care if if my circumstances got

01:16:42.570 --> 01:16:44.489
dire maybe I could be like hey I'm

01:16:44.489 --> 01:16:45.960
[ __ ] up right now but I think this is

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:47.250
something I can do record even if I just

01:16:47.250 --> 01:16:49.680
like everything fell away and now I'm

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:50.940
just like working you know I'm down to

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:53.310
the concrete pit I can still do this on

01:16:53.310 --> 01:16:54.840
Sunday so I can never I'll always be

01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:56.580
able to do this oh yeah man I don't

01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:58.380
worry I pay to the concrete pit dude

01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:01.560
what happened to it he's dead who did

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:02.370
who died

01:17:02.370 --> 01:17:04.350
the guy from the concrete pit oh [ __ ]

01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:09.630
really Oh Joe Joe Joe died in jail RIPD

01:17:09.630 --> 01:17:10.940
Joe okay

01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:20.430
supposedly no this is another well the

01:17:20.430 --> 01:17:22.080
other thing too is like I like this idea

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:23.699
of like kind of this ecosystem of

01:17:23.699 --> 01:17:25.170
content now where it's like I have an

01:17:25.170 --> 01:17:27.540
idea for I call it other school where

01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:29.250
it's like so you can get professors from

01:17:29.250 --> 01:17:32.699
like Ivy League universities and be like

01:17:32.699 --> 01:17:34.530
hey man you know you know you're kind of

01:17:34.530 --> 01:17:36.030
have to teach through this institution

01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:38.010
if you could teach a class that you

01:17:38.010 --> 01:17:39.719
could I mean I guess they get to develop

01:17:39.719 --> 01:17:40.800
the curriculum or whatever but

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:43.500
like you can teach a class online to a

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:44.520
bunch of people who would pay you

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:46.260
directly not the institution they'll pay

01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:48.030
you to learn about something they're

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:49.139
interested in you put it out on the

01:17:49.139 --> 01:17:50.909
internet you know for the Ivy League

01:17:50.909 --> 01:17:52.590
professor it could be like you know 500

01:17:52.590 --> 01:17:53.639
bucks to the class but then if you take

01:17:53.639 --> 01:17:55.139
the class and you amass all that

01:17:55.139 --> 01:17:57.150
information you can then teach a class

01:17:57.150 --> 01:17:58.619
on this thing called other school people

01:17:58.619 --> 01:18:00.750
who would be maybe like graduated high

01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:02.400
school that if you you know so it can

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.480
kind of filter you can have information

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.690
kind of penetrate further down into like

01:18:05.690 --> 01:18:07.920
peoples be even able to understand if

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:08.550
that makes sense

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:12.059
guys if do you it's crazy you're talking

01:18:12.059 --> 01:18:15.030
about this as Mike Mike he was I real

01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:17.099
quick Mikey this is his last day in

01:18:17.099 --> 01:18:20.040
school I'm grandpa dude he's doing his

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.659
last assignment in the other year and

01:18:21.659 --> 01:18:24.599
it's about growth mindset the [ __ ] and

01:18:24.599 --> 01:18:26.190
it says growth mindset is a belief that

01:18:26.190 --> 01:18:27.840
despite obstacles and challenges the

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.340
person can develop abilities and achieve

01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:30.690
goes through motivation hard work and

01:18:30.690 --> 01:18:38.940
practice Jesus Grady I'm so the question

01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:40.619
is it's how would someone with the fixed

01:18:40.619 --> 01:18:42.960
mindset fix a specific mistake that's

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:46.949
listed here Wow damn dude minds that's a

01:18:46.949 --> 01:18:47.599
tough one

01:18:47.599 --> 01:18:51.869
so if somebody if somebody shot it isn't

01:18:51.869 --> 01:18:53.250
like flexible and like thinking like

01:18:53.250 --> 01:18:55.320
alright I could change this if somebody

01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:56.610
that's like I'm screwed like I don't

01:18:56.610 --> 01:18:58.650
know how to work my way out of this if

01:18:58.650 --> 01:19:00.179

01:19:00.179 --> 01:19:00.599
would they

01:19:00.599 --> 01:19:04.260
what would they view it as like I'll

01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:18.349

about adding value and I think that's

01:21:31.889 --> 01:21:34.559
that's one thing that war mode a man

01:21:34.559 --> 01:21:37.050
chains you throw through and do it

01:21:37.050 --> 01:21:39.119

01:21:42.209 --> 01:21:43.949
[ __ ] pain in the balls to get through
