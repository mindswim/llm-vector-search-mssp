WEBVTT

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.830
what up bro what's up man not much dude

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.370
I so I was talking a little little

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.290
investing on my podcast and a bunch of

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.300
people jumped in and I'm obviously

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.549
wildly unqualified to speak on such

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.369
things but I I do like I you know I

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.890
maybe I'm disservice to your approach by

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.660
just talking about the [ __ ] about it

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.130
not knowing about it

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.439
you know solidly but fundamentally I

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.210
still do agree with it and you know

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.890
regardless I do like the way you

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.800
approach it so please excuse all you

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.960
read the pushback and you know if you

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.270
could and I know I know you take a

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.860
pretty deep approach to investing but

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.350
hit me hit me with the nutshell yeah

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.070
yeah so so we'll hop into it so I guess

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.620
if yeah I think you're right like I tend

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.600
to take a bit of a philosophical view

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.610
first and then kind of you know develop

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.110
strategy from there and then just to be

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.750
to be clear it is definitely not like my

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.460
model you know I'm not inventing

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.809
anything new so so just to kind of take

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.070
a step back so if we look at investing I

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.860
look at investing like like I do a lot

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.330
of other things like I'd like I join I

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.830
think a lot of people should take a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.830
philosophical view first approach to

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.360
what they're doing like hey you know

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.220
what's your objective why are you doing

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.530
it and what is your best hypothesis to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.619
accomplishing that objective so so I

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.180
apologize for my attire right now I mean

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.860
I'm in workout clothes it's it's

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.930
Saturday so it's a kind of my day to

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.549
come into the office and do some yoga

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.799
ahead of time and and kind of just get

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.890
things done without without much

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.250
distraction

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.869
so anyway you'll have to apologize for

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.600
you're tired you look good and I mean

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.180
it's also I kind of I wish I held myself

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.560
to such a high standard I'm actually

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.570
apologize my tire as well I'm in

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.700
sweatpants I try no you know like a lot

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.560
to go on tangents right yeah oh yeah

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.110
dude whatever you a cool so um so I

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.329
actually funny enough like I want to try

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.270
to make a push eventually to for wearing

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.219
athletic you know performance-based

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.960
clothing into the office like

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.500
you know from like when I worked in New

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.560
York it was all you know suits ties etc

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.440
which is cool I mean that gives a it

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.850
it gives you a certain indication of

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.950
where that person you know is oriented

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.630
in the world roughly but it's a very

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.920
vague

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.470
you know metric and I don't like it I

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.640
think at this point it's kind of

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.800
irrational so I actually like the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.720
Silicon Valley approach of like you know

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.310
Mark Zuckerberg just wearing a hoodie to

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.660
work although I wouldn't go that

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.280
direction only because like hoodies kind

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.630
of constrict me to a certain degree like

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.230
I don't like doing yoga and hoodies yeah

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.670
it's like performance-based bowling I

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.110
like that it's straight up there's like

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.880
even just like Under Armour to get it as

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.760
tight as possible yeah I do like that

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.530
though just the suit and tie it's kind

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.590
of dumb it's it's kind of uh I don't

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.970
know I mean people probably thought they

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.530
look normal back in the day and like

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.360
powdered wigs and like lobster tail

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.520
coats all right like yeah it's kind of

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.780
ridiculous that you'd have to wear that

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.090
anywhere anymore yeah I mean it's it's

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.680
supposed to send a certain signal but

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.390
you know that signal is kind of

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.800
irrelevant like I think a lot of what

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.600
comes down to today is just just

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.520
performance like how do you actually do

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.960
in your career how much do you know I

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.500
don't necessarily my surgeon he is and

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.730
actually that's why I like the sort of

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.410
the uprising of a lot of tech companies

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.420
because most these companies are very

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.540
engineered based so there's like super

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.920
logical so it's like well why would I

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.540
wear a three-piece suit when it's more

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.000
it's it's less comfortable I can't just

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.560
go to the gym right after I can't do

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.180
stretches in that you know during you

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.310
know blah blah etcetera I actually want

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.220
to go in the direction of getting a

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.230
treadmill under my desk because if you

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.320
start to read like health books and this

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.540
I promise all this will be you know will

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.800
be able to be connected full circle in

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.080
my pimp you listen to Charlie Munger who

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.640
was Warren Buffett's partner he's the

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.500
lesser-known partner of Berkshire

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.269
Hathaway and obviously you know Warren

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.670
Buffett being the most successful and

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.260
probably most famous investor of all

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.269
time Charlie Munger his is less famous

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.730
counterpart but he lives by something

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.459
called mental models and he says that he

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.200
grew up in a household where it was the

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.090
moral obligation for everybody to become

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.120
hold on I have to banish my dog indoors

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.500
yeah I try I try to be nice and let them

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.570
hang they always [ __ ] me every single

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.820
time start fighting with each other man

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.380
sweet-talking Charlie you're talking

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.790
monger well you're like everyone knows

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.650
Buffett and you're saying Munger takes

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.300
he's more what he'd be more like the

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.920
takes more than philosophical approach

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.390
well he's just more so his main

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.700
philosophies go out and become an expert

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.440
in many different areas which is kind of

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.240
counter to the Oh you know many people

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.220
will counteract that and say you know

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.570
jack of all trades master of none and

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.640
Charlie comes back says yeah but um I'm

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.140
one of the richest men in the world and

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.500
the way that I did that was by becoming

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.630
very knowledgeable in multiple domains

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.550
and then you people from what he calls

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.740
you figure out the main data points from

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.780
all of those domains and then eventually

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.430
they start to dovetail and you need to

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.350
put those in a framework in your mind he

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.480
calls it a mental lattice work so that

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.919
you can very easily reference those

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.540
things and then draw conclusions and

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.850
solve problems very quickly cuz

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.530
oftentimes in life in conversation like

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.450
you know we're talking about you know

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.730
seconds being able to decipher you know

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.440
about one thing one direction or other

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.419
and give adequate feedback so Charlie

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.010
Charlie Munger is said by Warren

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.470
Buffett's who have the the quickest 30

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.390
second mind and I thought that was just

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.090
a phenomenal way of putting it so that

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.580
being said you know with anything in

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.290
life at least in my opinion I try to

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.370
take more of a philosophical approach

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.290
first and develop develop okay what's my

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.050
North Star goal and how do I why do I

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.250
want to accomplish that why is it

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.630
important to me and why is it important

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.610
to me over multiple time horizons so

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.200
short term medium term long term and

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.780
then legacy etc and then from there

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.669
because that will filter out a lot so

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.130
like I said in Prior conversations the

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.210
OMERS I'm bringing this stuff is not to

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.040
sound weird but I do what's called men's

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.630
physique bodybuilding competing and it's

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.100
just a little hobby of mine in an

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.470
amateur level and I don't say that for

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.850
reason of like all pounding my chest I

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.320
say that because I think it's important

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.479
for all people to compete at something

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:22.300
to really be put through a microcosm of

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.750
very a very severe let's say let's say

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.700
very concrete and severe consequences

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.870
for something now when I say severe I

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.430
mean it's like it's it's very obvious

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.840
like you know when you step on a

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.860
bodybuilding stage

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.260
you either appropriately prepared or you

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.160
didn't

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.680
and that's it like there's no getting

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.510
around that now you can kind of fudge it

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.950
a little bit if you take steroids etc

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.660
how bad is it yet has anyone ever show

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.280
up and it's just like fattish it and

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.000
you're like ah [ __ ] oh dude so I've I've

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.610
done six competitions now at this point

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.640
and I actually give a lot of credit to

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.590
those P there are like there's probably

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.620
been three people that I've seen in the

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.900
six and there's you know hundreds of you

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.540
know bodybuilders they're probably seen

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.500
six total where where it was just like

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.230
you know like I don't even have it I

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.660
mean these people were overweight and

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.370
very clearly overweight now you don't

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.050
know what maybe they lost 100 pounds

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.760
prior to that but anyway I give them

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.350
more credit than anybody anybody else

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:21.610
stepping on stage because it's either

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.610
like a they like are on a journey that

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.710
they lost 100 pounds and this is just a

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.510
milestone of the journey that's awesome

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.300
or be they signed up for this thing and

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.970
they completely ruined it right but they

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.220
still follow through of showing up like

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.510
that says a lot about somebody's

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.520
character dude like cuz I'll tell you

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.440
man like you know this was one of my top

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.270
like you know going in front of hundreds

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.490
of people under spotlights and then

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.410
getting judgment and then you have to

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.000
sit there imposing for in front of

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.070
people and then they place you like in

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.600
front of each other like Oh number you

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.000
know number 42 move next to number four

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.890
right and then and then you know where

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.080
you're falling off it's it's a wild ride

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.780
really water it's weirdly nerve-wracking

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.610
I say that seems worse than doing

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.340
stand-up I would say yeah I think it's

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.870
probably different like I would I would

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.700
say we'd probably both mirror each

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.350
other's opinions of this like I'd

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.000
probably say it's harder to do what

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.830
you've done and maybe you're like you

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.930
just said oh it's hard to do you know we

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.480
probably both are on opposite sides of

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.919
the fence like just because we have been

00:08:20.919 --> 00:08:23.380
exposed to it but I'm saying just from a

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.570
you know having a small flaccid penis

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.870
perspective that has to be tough I'm

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.540
just like I'm I get conscious I get like

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.979
self-conscious in yoga when like my

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:34.719
Birds kind of flapping up if I did that

00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:38.469
yeah yeah I see that would be I mean it

00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:39.880
sounds funny but like dude that would I

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.410
would mind [ __ ] me if I was to anything

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:43.900
will expand X well no here's the thing

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.640
so that's that's Trish an old body

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.120
building what I do is men's physique

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.839
bodybuilding I just say body button

00:08:49.839 --> 00:08:50.160
because

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.600
that's what most people would notice so

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.160
men's physique is a subsection so you

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.019
wear board shorts so that probably takes

00:08:55.019 --> 00:08:56.850
a lot of the fear that you're referring

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:06.480
to yes does yeah I don't know no sweat

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.180
so and it kind of over - on that topic

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.959
it's a fascinating view you'd like with

00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:14.759
that being said when you go into let's

00:09:14.759 --> 00:09:16.139
say like any competition but I'll to

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:17.509
speak from a bodybuilding standpoint

00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:21.540
when you go into that I just so you know

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.089
men's physique bodybuilding is not is

00:09:24.089 --> 00:09:26.160
not trying to get as large as humanly

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.540
possible it's all about like symmetry

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.579
and and trying to get a v-taper from

00:09:29.579 --> 00:09:31.470
your backs you're not trying to be 275

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.269
pounds of pure muscle you're trying to

00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:35.189
manage the balance basically like like

00:09:35.189 --> 00:09:36.269
you would like to look at a beach that's

00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:37.439
how they came up with like you know

00:09:37.439 --> 00:09:39.389
men's aesthetic how could you look like

00:09:39.389 --> 00:09:41.720
healthy and like an athlete so anyway

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.430
but so I went out and I hired what I

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:45.870
thought to be the best coach I literally

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.040
considered him to be the best coach

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.740
probably in the world because sort of

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.269
the epicenter of men's physique

00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:53.910
competing is California so you have a

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:58.019
concentration of outstanding coaches in

00:09:58.019 --> 00:10:00.899
common California and the United States

00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:03.600
in general but it's really cool to see

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.600
to see this as a microcosm of human

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.029
behavior so I signed up and we had we

00:10:09.029 --> 00:10:10.410
have a bunch of guys on our team this

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.689
guy my coaches literally train that I I

00:10:12.689 --> 00:10:15.420
think it's in the thousands at minimum

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.730
hundreds of athletes going through the

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.029
entire prep they call it so I joined

00:10:21.029 --> 00:10:23.399
them with a few other guys and it's very

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:26.850
fascinating so so we paid this expert to

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.560
teach us and he get and I love him

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.480
because he's like this is exactly what

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.670
you do no if ands or buts about it and I

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:33.720
love what he said he's like don't even

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.120
ask me questions outside of this mm-hmm

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.350
I've been doing this for long enough and

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.360
I this is this is very very predictable

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.240
if you actually work the plan so I'm

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.189
like super neurotic and it's like if I'm

00:10:44.189 --> 00:10:45.779
gonna do it like I'm gonna do it so I

00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:47.430
did it and I literally followed it to a

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.160
tee didn't miss one aspect of it I think

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.379
in one competition I ate I ate like one

00:10:52.379 --> 00:10:54.149
piece of two pieces of chocolate that

00:10:54.149 --> 00:10:56.129
was it out of like I think it was like

00:10:56.129 --> 00:10:58.829
17 weeks you know but other than that it

00:10:58.829 --> 00:11:00.329
was just like spot-on

00:11:00.329 --> 00:11:01.949
you know like for four or five that's

00:11:01.949 --> 00:11:03.630
five months like half a

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.790
oh yeah it was intense it was super

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:08.190
intense that's a hole that could be a

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:09.930
whole other topic of not how do you oh

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:10.440
yeah

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.270
yeah we can go into that sometime for

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.280
sure yeah here's the thing and and I'm

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.780
not saying oh that's because I'm so

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.310
great it's like no it's like anybody

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.800
could do that and anybody could could

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.170
hit the marks that I did now just to be

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.510
transparent so so I've gotten

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:28.050
bodybuilding trophies in every single

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.910
place except for first place that's that

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.830
my next my next goal is first place so

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:33.090
I've gotten second a bunch of times

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.030
third a bunch of times and so on so and

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.800
that doesn't speak to me that speaks to

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.660
my coach like it's very very specific

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.950
and it's like hey man if you want to win

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.710
this is how you do it right so so the

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.450
interesting part about it was we had

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.760
other guys on our team and I would call

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.930
them up through like different intervals

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:50.610
like of this of this you know multi

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.530
month training period and say I remember

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.030
this very clearly talked to several of

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:55.410
them saying like hey man like I'm super

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:56.490
struggling especially for our first

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:58.410
competition I was like I'm suit like

00:11:58.410 --> 00:11:59.880
this is hard man it's way harder than I

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.680
thought it would be like we know like

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.690
and I one question I had to one of these

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:07.170
guys was like dude like I can barely you

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:09.210
know as we're deep into the prep I can

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:11.490
barely walk on this treadmill anymore

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:12.570
because you had to do it I think it was

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.820
like ten and a half or eleven incline at

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.430
three and a half speed which is

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.900
significant for it for an hour yes a

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.700
brisk walk alone but if you have that on

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.730
the incline what's the max incline I

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:26.700
don't know too many find any incline at

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.190
all I'm like as a challenge at all you

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:31.260
know yeah yeah I mean it's nothing so

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.390
the speed is actually on purpose it's

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.490
meant to be just below when you start

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.260
jogging and the whole concept there is

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.540
like a slow a slow burn so it burns more

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.250
fat and again this so this is where

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:42.630
we're gonna start to get into because I

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:43.920
guarantee you as people hear that like

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.480
oh well no actually hit cardio works

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.490
best it's like now we start getting into

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:51.570
like the minutia right so so my my point

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.790
here is like when I train with these

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.040
guys there is actually a decent math

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.750
amount of them who didn't have good

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:00.660
results at all like almost you barely

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.460
even tell whether they're working out

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.530
and the reason was because along the

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.600
path of the journey they started like

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.820
debating little bits of minutia and

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.320
saying oh well no I heard on this

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.120
article at this and like I want to try

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.950
Kido and so on it's like you know and

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.960
they would ask me about it yeah they

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.490
said like well why don't you know

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.200
so little fat we were only eating 30

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.529
almonds a day you know so then so these

00:13:22.529 --> 00:13:24.029
guys who would go through it and they

00:13:24.029 --> 00:13:25.620
debate the minutiae all the way it

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.779
forced them into this weird dabbling

00:13:27.779 --> 00:13:28.830
pattern yeah

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.390
like like they want to be able to go to

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.279
Starbucks and like debate on like oh

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:34.290
well like you know keto / like carb

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.450
cycling carbs are bad or carbs are good

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.390
and so on and it's like look like so

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.339
what I told them is like the point I

00:13:41.339 --> 00:13:43.830
don't know like I have to outsource my

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:46.080
trust to this individual coach for a

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.180
while until I have my own data but I'm

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.740
gonna try it like I'm gonna do I'm gonna

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.290
try it all out so that's that's a good

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.029
that's a that's a good thing to kind of

00:13:54.029 --> 00:13:55.920
so you're talking about like there's

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.230
doing stuff then there's like the kind

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.029
of the you know the Monday morning khwab

00:14:00.029 --> 00:14:01.560
all about things yeah

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.209
I this is I swear to god this was the

00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:04.770
only family policy I can't grab my baby

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.390
real quick outside yeah I don't know

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.160
where's buddy two seconds all right

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.100
we're good to go baby's in you have peed

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.339
we're all good yes yeah I mean drinking

00:14:14.339 --> 00:14:16.470
like that's so much water and green

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.120
drink and all this stuff which we could

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.860
even kind of talk about that if you want

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.550
to um so so the point now I've got to

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.740
make this disclaimer

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.510
so man I tried this a little a little

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.130
earlier and we had some internet

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.050
difficulties so I made the disclaimers

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.579
back on on that recording but not on

00:14:32.579 --> 00:14:34.610
this one so just so everybody knows like

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.050
I've got a I've got licenses that I have

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:39.180
to comply with from a financial

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.640
standpoint so so this is just a

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.410
conversation between Matt and I like

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:44.670
over coffee sort of things does not

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.350
recommendations for anybody do any of

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:47.190
this I could have to say that as a

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.779
professional I'd have to know like the

00:14:48.779 --> 00:14:50.520
individual situation and so on so we're

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.589
talking more of a strategic and

00:14:52.589 --> 00:14:54.360
philosophical level like I have no idea

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.130
what anybody who anybody listening I

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.810
have no idea who you are I have no idea

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:00.360
about your individual circumstances so

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.850
we're talking in at a very high level so

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.550
please please please this is not me if I

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:08.490
mention a company or a fund or an ETF or

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.350
an index fund anything any investment

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:12.300
here I'm not saying go out and do that

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.940
to go out and buy that so anyway that's

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.310
the that's my Barry that's my disclaimer

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:20.850
for the day so anyway I kind of forget

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:22.350
where we were where were we going down

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:26.040
oh the body money story yeah so so yeah

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.150
I agree with what I think whether you're

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:29.910
about to say it's like it's like go you

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.160
know create your goals create

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.019
objective and then why you want that and

00:15:33.019 --> 00:15:35.000
then map that over different time

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.769
horizons because in my opinion all of

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.870
your goals should be coherent over those

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.850
different time horizons like you like

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:42.829
I'm trying to I try to be very careful

00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:44.329
about setting goals that are gonna be in

00:15:44.329 --> 00:15:46.670
direct conflict you know a year from now

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:49.279
than just my current desires if that

00:15:49.279 --> 00:15:53.360
makes sense you know so so it's one of

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.920
the reasons that I don't drink I'm not

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.480
saying that other people shouldn't drink

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.250
but for me I don't do I don't do any I

00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:59.209
don't drink I don't do anything like

00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:02.000
that only because like I've got I've got

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.529
certain goals in health and fitness and

00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:05.269
especially longevity and I just don't

00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:06.740
want any of those kind of like clashing

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.370
together so sorry so so setting goals

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.019
and then picking a methodology to

00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:13.370
achieve those goals I think is very

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:15.829
important but once you do once you

00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:17.839
educate yourself on saying hey I want to

00:16:17.839 --> 00:16:20.120
accomplish this goal how do I best do

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.040
that and and I've got a methodology for

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.439
doing that and it consists of of number

00:16:24.439 --> 00:16:25.759
one if you can go and study under

00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:27.110
another person who's done it or a group

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:28.970
of people but like reading the top books

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:31.040
and so on and then and then doing your

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.509
own math behind it the cool thing about

00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:33.829
finances there's a bunch of numbers

00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:35.660
behind it so you can kind of you can see

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:36.949
patterns and things and there's

00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:39.110
historical data so anyway that being

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:41.329
said when I was going through the body

00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:43.399
but in promos it was funny like because

00:16:43.399 --> 00:16:45.589
you got to see human dynamic play out

00:16:45.589 --> 00:16:48.230
right and how much people like to debate

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:50.089
minutiae even to the detriment of their

00:16:50.089 --> 00:16:53.329
own progress so on our team I remember

00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:54.800
showing up for competition day and was

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.139
really interesting because let's say

00:16:57.139 --> 00:16:59.269
let's say 3/4 of our guys on our team

00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:03.050
were ready but 25% of them were not and

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:05.360
it was so funny man like you know and

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.919
again I'm not pounding my chest but

00:17:06.919 --> 00:17:08.089
let's say there was a group of us there

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:09.530
was there was a group of us who were

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.539
just completely shredded you know so

00:17:11.539 --> 00:17:14.240
[ __ ] sick no disclaimers before that

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.169
at all which that must have felt good

00:17:18.169 --> 00:17:19.990
showing up and you were just [ __ ]

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:22.280
absolutely that's pretty cool that's a

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.929
crazy environment of you and just a

00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:26.000
bunch of really shredded [ __ ] dudes

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.520
it's it's definitely different and the

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.080
funny thing is like I approach a lot of

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.360
things like a robot so it's like it's

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.070
just it's it's inch or like an alien

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.210
almost it's like you're plugged into

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:36.890
this world and a lot of these these

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.570
people that's their life like that's

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:39.080
what they do

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.330
yeah so it's really fast and it's really

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:42.799
cool it's like you know when you go in

00:17:42.799 --> 00:17:44.169
not judgmental

00:17:44.169 --> 00:17:45.879
and like you see all these guys like you

00:17:45.879 --> 00:17:48.429
know like like alt and up and like just

00:17:48.429 --> 00:17:50.200
super jacked and shredded and they've

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.460
got like coaches all around them and

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.499
they're posing and all this stuff you

00:17:53.499 --> 00:17:55.179
know an outsider obviously too many

00:17:55.179 --> 00:17:56.710
people they would be like aw man that's

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:58.359
super you know why would you do that so

00:17:58.359 --> 00:18:00.429
stupid it's like no like it's kind of

00:18:00.429 --> 00:18:02.109
beautiful like anything else of effort

00:18:02.109 --> 00:18:04.359
is it's like these guys and women are

00:18:04.359 --> 00:18:06.369
actually playing the game they're not

00:18:06.369 --> 00:18:08.409
the commentators around the game just

00:18:08.409 --> 00:18:10.570
like throwing stones it's like you know

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.399
you and I grew up in Philadelphia the

00:18:12.399 --> 00:18:14.739
amount of times you go to you know a

00:18:14.739 --> 00:18:17.169
Super Bowl party and like you know Uncle

00:18:17.169 --> 00:18:19.059
Buck over there who's never played who

00:18:19.059 --> 00:18:20.559
played football maybe in like you know

00:18:20.559 --> 00:18:22.299
peewee leagues was just a terrible

00:18:22.299 --> 00:18:24.580
athlete he's the first guy is like soon

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.230
as like you know Tom Brady or somebody

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.090
throws an interception I go my gods guys

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.669
trash like it's like I you know is he

00:18:30.669 --> 00:18:32.320
trash or is he just like much better

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.330
than you do in this particular domain

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:35.950
and you're kind of like subconsciously

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.690
resentful of that and you feel like

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:40.029
calling him trash somehow equalizes that

00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:43.480
delta you know so so that's kind of one

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.669
thing is like it's that whole man in the

00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:47.200
arena quote i which i think is

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.159
absolutely phenomenal

00:18:48.159 --> 00:18:49.809
you know there's so many there's so many

00:18:49.809 --> 00:18:51.279
people in the stands who are willing to

00:18:51.279 --> 00:18:52.809
comment on things but it's like oh well

00:18:52.809 --> 00:18:54.399
why don't you go out and do it now but

00:18:54.399 --> 00:18:56.769
now even even those athletes were on the

00:18:56.769 --> 00:18:57.460
field they're gonna have different

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.259
disciplines you know like we talked

00:18:59.259 --> 00:19:00.489
about earlier like if you look at the

00:19:00.489 --> 00:19:02.320
UFC one of the things I love about the

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.059
UFC and I'm not a big fan by any means

00:19:04.059 --> 00:19:06.700
but I can I've seen enough of it to know

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.100
that like before the UFC was created

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.330
there was a whole bunch of disciplines

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.489
out there in the world that were like

00:19:12.489 --> 00:19:14.169
pretty wild you know that like you know

00:19:14.169 --> 00:19:17.200
I I don't know all the defenders would

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.149
say there's a monkey claw what is that

00:19:19.149 --> 00:19:21.460
one exactly just when you get ready like

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:25.149
that what you know as funny as that

00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:27.159
sounds right like probably growing up

00:19:27.159 --> 00:19:30.399
we've all seen videos of like some some

00:19:30.399 --> 00:19:33.129
Asian guy who's like 5,000 years old

00:19:33.129 --> 00:19:35.139
right and then like he just touches

00:19:35.139 --> 00:19:36.429
somebody in their chest and they like

00:19:36.429 --> 00:19:39.190
fly ten feet back you know and you can

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:42.070
create a really compelling narrative

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.559
around that to where like you could even

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:46.210
get the most rational person and be like

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.669
well I guess I don't know everything and

00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:50.230
like yeah he eats this herb that's only

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.509
like you know grows off of the cliff of

00:19:52.509 --> 00:19:53.889
like you know the same cliff that they

00:19:53.889 --> 00:19:55.840
you know filmed like Karate Kid at with

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.399
mr. Miyagi found that little you know

00:19:57.399 --> 00:19:57.880
when

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.740
you know it even create a really

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.120
compelling narrative around a lot of

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.130
things but then eventually it's like

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:05.080
okay well let's create a competition

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.420
where you hit this thing called UFC and

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.490
everybody including the monkey claw guy

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.500
can come in like we're gonna go in the

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.360
arena and see what wins and then all of

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.090
a sudden you collapse you know it's not

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:17.890
a hundred and fifty disciplines that are

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:19.150
really effective right you you

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.610
eventually find out it's like five more

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.200
ten and then that's the first

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.730
competition then you then you do keep

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.110
these competitions over a period time

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.820
and you find out it's you know it's

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.410
really only five or ten and I felt I

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:30.820
feel that life kind of works out that

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.550
way you know we might have differences

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:36.070
on let's say you know diet but the

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.620
reality is like like it's not gonna be

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.240
150 different diets like you know

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.470
somebody might say oh well I

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:43.480
I eat plants and meat and another guy

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.980
might say well I eat plant like you're

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.930
not gonna get the crazy diets even

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.280
though funny thing is like some people

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.920
follow this stuff the crazy diets now

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.660
it's at a certain point because we've

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.030
become so educated as a society should

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.580
basically be laughed out of the room you

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.500
know so would like to get back to the

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.030
bodybuilding story like for instance

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.320
like we had guys who showed up and

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.430
they're just completely shredded it's

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:04.660
like they worked the plan they did

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.670
exactly what the coach said now the

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:08.560
coaches are using one discipline maybe

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.000
there's there's a few others out there

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.980
I'm sure there are well I can tell you

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.500
for sure there are so right now like my

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.660
coach what he does is carb cycling just

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.370
incredibly if like in my opinion and

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:19.930
from my experience and my teammates

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:21.790
experience incredibly effective like

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:23.530
does exactly what we were trying to

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:26.680
accomplish and for me it was like it was

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.190
a very it was so much easier following

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:33.490
that type of diet rather than a typical

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.850
let's say Bo bulk

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:39.880
shred caloric deficit straight through

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.920
like a seven week period with one refeed

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.600
meal like I know that might sound like

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.340
gibberish to some people it's come super

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.690
nerdy but those are let's say two

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:48.810
different ways of accomplishing

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.430
accomplishing a similar maybe the same

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.830
end goal right mm-hmm one of those

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.800
methodologies I hate like it was it was

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.810
excruciating like I've done the caloric

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.550
deficit for an extended period of time

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:02.110
and it was just terrible

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:04.300
right like I did not like the journey at

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.160
all and I would not have longevity in

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.170
that space if that makes sense that

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.090
makes sense yeah of just like I'm not

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:11.200
going to eat I'm gonna work

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.149
while I'm hungry that we'll lose weight

00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:14.679
but this [ __ ] sucks I'm miserable

00:22:14.679 --> 00:22:18.159
yeah and to a certain extent like some

00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:19.659
people want to do that because it almost

00:22:19.659 --> 00:22:22.120
gives like this Rocky Balboa montage

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.710
type of feeling Lee I'm just gonna grind

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:25.750
it out right and it's like it's like the

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:27.460
harder it has to be like that's the more

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:28.659
effective and that's just wrong or at

00:22:28.659 --> 00:22:29.830
least it or at least in their head it

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.510
might create a better narrative so like

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:34.929
we now know that like you can you can

00:22:34.929 --> 00:22:37.360
shred down to like crazy levels of body

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.480
fat like 6% body fat 5% body fat etc and

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.220
you can still eat chocolate you can

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.750
still have Donuts like you can still do

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.330
that like you know now you can't do it

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:47.919
all the time and it's not like a

00:22:47.919 --> 00:22:49.870
commercial where you're like you know an

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.429
ad on YouTube where the guy says like

00:22:51.429 --> 00:22:53.440
hey like I got this six-pack and I eat I

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.059
eat doughnuts and pizza and all that sup

00:22:55.059 --> 00:22:56.889
that's probably that actually can be

00:22:56.889 --> 00:22:59.440
true but it's not what people think it

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.659
is it's not the implied message there

00:23:01.659 --> 00:23:03.850
almost is like I eat this stuff all the

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:05.740
time right it's like no that guy's

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.480
probably eating if it is true which

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.279
there's probably a great probability

00:23:09.279 --> 00:23:10.330
it's not true he's just kind of

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:13.090
fabricating but I can tell you I've

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:15.190
gotten a 5% 6% body fat and I've had

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:17.350
pizza I've had cookies you know no I

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:19.299
didn't do it every day but like in the

00:23:19.299 --> 00:23:21.010
cohort of when I was prepping let's just

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.299
say now for the bodybuilding competition

00:23:22.299 --> 00:23:24.010
but in other times in my life I've done

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:26.350
it you know so but the point is you

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.870
don't have to be a certain way like

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:30.429
certain bodybuilders will only say like

00:23:30.429 --> 00:23:32.230
I'm just gonna eat chicken and rice and

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:34.059
broccoli and that's it

00:23:34.059 --> 00:23:36.669
well yeah well sorry my phone just rang

00:23:36.669 --> 00:23:39.519
um yeah you could do that but you might

00:23:39.519 --> 00:23:42.429
really hate the journey so much to the

00:23:42.429 --> 00:23:45.130
point where you stop right and that's

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:46.510
where I really like that Tim Ferriss

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:47.769
quote I think it was from him where he

00:23:47.769 --> 00:23:49.840
says the good plan that you follow is

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.220
better than the great plan that you

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.440
don't mmm-hmm but the funny thing is

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.899
like oftentimes you can still get the

00:23:55.899 --> 00:23:58.029
same result with a much more desirable

00:23:58.029 --> 00:24:00.610
path if that makes sense so anyway you

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:02.679
don't keep you and make sense yeah so

00:24:02.679 --> 00:24:04.450
anyway but once you picked the path like

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:06.250
you have to give it adequate testing so

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:08.169
the guys who I was saying who showed up

00:24:08.169 --> 00:24:09.519
to the bodybuilding competition who were

00:24:09.519 --> 00:24:11.950
not prepared the common theme that I

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:14.080
noticed for these guys who came in with

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.940
like a little bit of a belly pouch you

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.049
know like a little bit of fat under

00:24:17.049 --> 00:24:18.519
their belly button right like which

00:24:18.519 --> 00:24:21.549
which in the general population is like

00:24:21.549 --> 00:24:22.809
is awesome like if you're at that level

00:24:22.809 --> 00:24:24.190
body fat were the only fat you have

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:25.030
which is like around

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.860
little lower abs and a little bit on the

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.690
back that's great like you look like

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:31.810
Superman but on a bodybuilding stage

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:34.060
where the sole objective is to compete

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.980
against others and be judged for it by

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.120
judges who have been doing this for

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.390
decades that is like the kiss of death

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:41.620
ran like that that is you that is you

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.090
like literally they define it is out of

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:43.480
shape

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.740
like you are out of shape if you're

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:45.670
stepping on the bodybuilding stage

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:46.630
looking like that

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.910
like they literally want to see and then

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:50.230
actually the really telltale sign is

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:51.970
like if you turn the athlete around they

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.700
do a back those you have to see where

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.080
the spine right the spine the

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.550
musculature around the spine separates

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:59.320
from the gluts like there's this little

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.210
V right towards like the top of your

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:03.280
butt and if you don't have that you're

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.860
smoked you're done right like instantly

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:07.930
you're out right you know so it's a very

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:11.530
very very precise measure and there's

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.420
very little room for error now the funny

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.820
thing is the group of guys that was not

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.190
prepared there was one common theme with

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:19.540
them because I communicated with them

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.240
throughout the the prep and this happens

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.340
every single competition the common

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.460
theme is they get stuck in two in two

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.710
legs either number one they just didn't

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:32.200
do the work right it didn't do it right

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.730
like they they took away too many they

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.410
did they did cheat meals on the side et

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:39.040
cetera or right they dabble because they

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.560
chased gold shiny objects along the way

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.050
so they had this like one foot in one

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:45.760
foot out mentality and the reason they

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.980
chase gold shiny objects is because they

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.260
got distracted by other narratives like

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:51.880
literally like I would have people call

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.040
me and they said like dude like you know

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.570
like I'm gonna try Kido I know coach

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:57.940
said this but you know like I just read

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.040
this awesome article on Kido and for

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.360
like whatever blah blah blah I'm not

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.410
gonna name names because there's very

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:06.040
obvious names in that space and like you

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.330
know I read this book on it and it's

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:10.060
like I believe it and it's like okay but

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.560
then and then and then two weeks later

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.390
they'd read about another thing or they

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:14.950
talk to another person all of a sudden

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:16.720
they're try they're dabbling in all

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.970
these things and the results are just

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:20.410
complete [ __ ] like that they're just

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:23.110
terrible terrible results so the main

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.090
point here is number one like if you're

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:26.020
gonna have an opinion on something like

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.190
go and do it for an extended period of

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.080
time and then you'll start to learn the

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.700
little nuances and you want to pick a

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.110
discipline that works well for you

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:33.880
whether that's investing or bodybuilding

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.350
or general nutrition or health or

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:36.940
whatever pick something that works

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.030
within you that still has the bend

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.560
Grahame of workable within your life and

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.910
but it's still gonna meet the objective

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:43.530
you know like I was telling you earlier

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:45.060
I had somebody actually call me and say

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.410
like oh I'm doing the cabbage soup diet

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:50.160
like that like there should be no

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.420
circumstances in your life where that's

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.310
workable right like like that should not

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.140
work in your life nor should that be any

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:56.670
goal that you have or I think I don't

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:58.710
I'm just guessing I've never tried the

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:00.120
cabbage soup diet but I don't

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.300
necessarily think I have to now so so

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.820
remove the masses of things that are

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.940
just noise like just just remove that so

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.620
then when you do that just like the UFC

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.870
you will be able to synthesize down to a

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.510
handful of fundamentals and at that

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:16.980
point you can decide which direction you

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.480
want to go in so like let's say when we

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.970
talk about investing one methodology of

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:24.150
investing is is for price fluctuation

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:25.980
okay I want to buy something today and I

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.330
want to sell it at a higher price in

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:29.760
which I bought it now if you think like

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.230
one when Warren Buffett talks about this

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.300
he talks about gold and I'm gonna grab

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:45.030
that book so so this I highly recommend

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:47.880
everybody read this book and it's not

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.040
again this is not like and then you make

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.360
decisions from there but this is a great

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.770
book it's called stocks for the long run

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:55.470
by Jeremy Siegel this is the fifth

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:57.270
edition Jeremy Siegel as a Wharton

00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:58.710
School University of Pennsylvania

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:00.060
Wharton School business finance

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.450
professor so Wharton arguably the top

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:05.370
Business School in the world depending

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:06.780
on what article you read I mean there's

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.370
there's basically general consensus

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:10.170
about that if it's not the top one it's

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:12.600
the top four right something that's good

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.180
it's good yeah yeah Ivy League etcetera

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.880
so anyway when you start to educate

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.220
yourself on this and one mental model

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.930
that Charlie Munger uses and I love

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:24.630
Charlie Charlie Munger's idea of using

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:26.460
mental models which is just like sort of

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.380
like ninja moves to solve problems in a

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:32.580
very quick basis he says what I like is

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.040
is do your own math so the cool thing

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.210
about finance is like you can actually

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:37.590
look into the data and you can actually

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:39.330
say okay like how can I orient myself

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:41.580
around around these things because

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.160
there's there's data to to show it so

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.110
one one example that we're talking about

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:48.570
of a speculative asset is at least how

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.820
Warren Buffett defines it is an asset

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.170
that doesn't produce that doesn't

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:53.330
produce cash

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:56.090
so let's say gold so it's not that

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:58.430
people have not made gold I'm sorry I

00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:59.990
have not made money in gold because I'm

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.750
sure a lot of people have but number one

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:04.370
it's like are those anomalies and is it

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:06.020
sustainable you know that sort of things

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.340
okay let's let's start to educate

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.160
ourselves around the macro view of gold

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.810
and I really like that methodology of

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:13.400
well like educate yourself on the macro

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.510
level first and then you can kind of

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.730
trickle down from to the micro so if you

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:17.990
get this book which again I highly

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:20.020
recommend if you open it up to page

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.940
let's see while you find the page when

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.860
you say macro view of gold you mean like

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:27.290
gold over the long run or just the idea

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:29.570
of owning it what do you mean well just

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:31.640
in general so like any problem you're

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.820
trying to solve you can look at it from

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.850
a macro view so like zoom out and say

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:40.490
what has that thing done over the course

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:43.370
of time got you action and that by the

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:46.070
way that doesn't matter if it's if it's

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:48.530
diet like keto etc like for instance now

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:49.820
I know this is probably gonna catch a

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.560
lot of heat so but just bear with me

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.170
because people get really intense when

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:55.220
they when they have certain like

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.630
ideologies and they want to stick to

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:58.430
them which I which by the way I think a

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:00.620
really solid model for that which came

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.660
out of Silicon Valley is strong opinions

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:05.390
weekly held and I really really like

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:07.580
that so it's like like do so much

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:08.930
research and understand something to the

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:09.890
degree where you have a really strong

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:12.080
conviction around it but don't get so

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.540
religious about it that if you that if

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:17.090
you get new data right that you're not

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:18.800
willing to accept that new data and

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.540
change your opinion like that's it me

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:21.650
working in finance like that's what we

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:23.390
have to do constantly but you don't to

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:25.010
be married to something so for instance

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:27.620
like you know saying something like oh

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.150
bonds or a good investment or a bad

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:31.310
investment that that's it's it's not a

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:32.750
statement that should ever like come out

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:34.490
of my mouth right like it should be is

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:36.050
it workable or not workable within the

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:37.580
doulton in the context of the goal and

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.920
bonds right now are way different than

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.990
bonds in the early 80s I mean we had

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:43.640
interest we'd see these out there

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.650
they're probably producing 15% bonds

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:46.850
right now our different story

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:50.390
so so I have to educate myself on the

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:51.770
macro view of a lot of different things

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:54.040
but I would also say it's just a great

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.810
it's a great practice in life you know

00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:59.120
so for instance if you look at I don't

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.200
know who was the guy who created like

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.590
the the fad diet prior to the keto was

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:07.040
it uh Atkins Atkins right yeah now I

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.200
don't know much about it well it's a con

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.250
one of those things you hear it's like I

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:11.660
don't know like should I be eating bacon

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.400
like yeah it's kind of it sounds counter

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.540
to it and that's the reason it becomes

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.360
so sexy it's like you know there's a

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.460
great quote it was something like you

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:23.390
know people want to hear good news about

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:25.820
their bad habits you know so it's like

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.140
as soon as somebody comes out and tells

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.270
you eat bacon right it's like well see

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:31.610
Rick I told you you know like you know

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:34.130
you don't you don't need much you don't

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:35.780
even need much real evidence to support

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.880
your your bad habit you just you just

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.160
want any shred that's it's in my opinion

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.960
this is why you know wine drinkers right

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.400
it's like oh like you know you should be

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.630
drinking a couple you know 1 2 glasses

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:46.460
of wine at night it's like or maybe just

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:47.810
eat the grapes I don't know you know

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:52.610
yeah so so anyway um I think Atkins

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.140
right didn't he die from like a heart

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.750
attack yeah he died right I I knew it

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:57.860
didn't want to say it I don't want any

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.120
negative heart attack karma but yeah

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.950
ironically he died of a heart attack so

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:04.340
ya know probably look good well yeah I

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.940
don't know it might right admittedly I

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:09.590
don't know the intricacies of that like

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:11.000
did he have a heart attack because of

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.410
clogged such-and-such from his die I

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:14.210
have no idea it just seems a little

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:18.140
ironic right like yeah you know so by

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:19.640
the way there's a there's a great Buddha

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:36.350
hold on hold on what's that I can shut

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:37.640
the door no headbutt through it

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.850
sometimes sorry for talking harshly to

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:45.440
my dog so you know it's a bit ironic but

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.000
if anybody ever wants to read some book

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.210
on dieting I really recommend this book

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:52.460
called how not to die and I you know

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.410
again it's like before you go and

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:56.180
judging you do like a quick level of

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.160
research you just like google dr. Greger

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.810
cuz that's the guy who who wrote the

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.300
book it's like don't just listen to

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.920
opinions about what the guy's saying go

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.540
and read it like go go read the book

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.370
it's several hundred pages so yeah like

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:08.390
you're gonna have to spend some time but

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:10.220
like go read the book so when I tell you

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:11.630
this book like stocks for the long run

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:13.850
you know don't take my word for it like

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:16.790
read the actual book but please do not

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:18.980
let go and comment and like have such a

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:20.690
strong opinion because you know

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:23.540
Tom you know said that you know exit Y&Z

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.860
about stocks or bonds or whatever it's

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:27.050
like no go and collect the data and then

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:28.910
be great like yeah totally like you

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:30.410
should definitely have your own opinion

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:32.150
after that but the opinion should I hope

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:36.260
would we educate it so now stocks for a

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.240
long run one of the one of my favorite

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.190
pages in finance that I've ever read is

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:44.120
actually on page 82 and I'll just show

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.550
the camera and I'll explain it for the

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:48.860
listeners so the camera there's this

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.890
great graph here and it shows asset

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:54.920
classes that they analyzed after

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.680
inflation so they took out inflation

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:01.460
they analyzed it from 1802 to 2012

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:03.680
now I already met asked Matt earlier

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.060
when we tried to give the first shot and

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:06.950
go around to this so Matt if you don't

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:08.150
mind I'm gonna ask you to repeat what

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:09.560
you think you said last time

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.500
yeah so this graph shows okay if I had a

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:16.450
dollar and I invested a dollar in 1802

00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:18.950
what would what would that dollar be

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:24.440
worth in 2012 after inflation I forget

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.720
what I have you just had a dollar yeah

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.190
if you just if you just kept a dollar in

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:29.510
your pocket and back then you can buy

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:31.700
like a pound of sugar for a dollar or

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:33.440
whatever you know probably more yes so

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.690
purchasing power yeah I forget what I

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:37.610
said but let's say I think I said like

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:40.280
50 cents or something I forgot yeah yeah

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.380
so in 2012 it would have been worth a

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.870
nickel right so it lost 95% of its value

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:48.830
because you know of inflation yeah for

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:51.350
people investing gold you would then say

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:52.850
okay well if somebody comes up to you

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:54.380
and says like hey like buy this gold you

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:55.850
should do this because gold always

00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:57.290
increases in value and blah blah blah

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.960
and so on and they'll create a very you

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.360
know large song and dance around it but

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.740
this what I'm saying educate yourself on

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:05.300
the macro first and then you can make

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:06.440
the decision on the micro of what you

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.740
want to do now if you do that if you

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.420
invest that same dollar instead of just

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:12.800
putting your pocket you invested a piece

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.630
of gold however much gold a dollar would

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:16.880
buy you back in the day after inflation

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.560
what would that gold be worth today do

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.540
you remember what you said to $80,000

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:22.400
yep and then do you remember what the

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.170
real answer was

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:27.590
for bucks yeah four dollars and 52 cents

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:29.810
now like that's not your fault right for

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:31.730
not knowing that that's because you know

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:33.530
you going through college finance

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:34.550
courses right like that

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:36.320
you about compound interest in something

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.570
growing etc well that matched with the

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:40.550
narrative of society or you've probably

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:42.440
seen billboards you've heard people talk

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.910
about Eve had relatives or friends

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:45.530
saying like hey Gold's great investment

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:47.450
right why it's well because it's like

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:48.860
hey man if the world goes down like

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.480
Gold's always there like it's a solid

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.100
blah blah blah there's a whole narrative

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:53.990
around that well it's like okay so let's

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:55.880
take a step back and yeah you can have

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.950
that opinion about it for sure but it's

00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:59.390
like let's actually see what happened

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.850
really let's actually look at the real

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:02.450
data

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:04.820
well the real data shows you know unless

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.280
you think like you know unless you think

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.090
that the University of Pennsylvania

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:10.610
Warren School Business is wrong then

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:11.630
that's a different argument but there's

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:12.740
also people out there in the world who

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.390
think the world is flat so it's like

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:16.970
let's let's assume that the data is

00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:19.910
right because at that - yeah yeah right

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:21.650
it's not worth going down it's a very

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:23.480
trackable thing that doesn't seem like

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.250
there would be much room for I mean

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:26.570
there's always room for manipulation but

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:28.820
I don't they don't have incentive

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:32.030
there's incentive right cuz he could

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:33.230
have did like they did the data he

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:35.060
couldn't have named this gold for the

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.850
long run sure like he's not out there he

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:38.810
said he doesn't he doesn't run

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:39.920
investment companies like he's not

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.110
getting paid you know he get called on

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:43.220
it pretty quickly if you're a professor

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:45.110
at University of Penn you're fudging the

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:47.030
numbers you're gonna get caught pretty

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:49.340
quickly yeah oh and and by the way like

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:52.130
he's been he's been out in the light

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:53.990
like he gets interviewed on CNBC and all

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:55.790
these things he's been the top professor

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:57.950
arguably for decades like this is not

00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:59.210
just a guy who came up for one year so

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:00.830
anyway and they have a whole team of

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:01.910
researchers helping to collect this data

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:04.430
anyway so the real answer is four

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:07.340
dollars and 52 cents now knowing that

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.080
you can make a decision off of that

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.460
because you could argue oh well yeah

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:11.990
it's worth four dollars and 52 cents but

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:13.760
there's probably times in that graph

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.020
like if you looked at that graph that

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.370
there's little times where if I would

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:17.870
have if I would have fought it here and

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:19.160
then sold it here I would have made you

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.870
know more that okay great

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:23.240
but then you get into like okay do you

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.830
think you can actually time that over

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:26.320
the over the course of many decades

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.310
right cuz you might be able to get lucky

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:29.510
once and say oh well I bought it here

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:31.370
and I flipped it right but could you do

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:34.100
that 100 times row because with timing

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:37.160
asset prices it's like let's play that

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.510
out right so let's just say you do that

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:41.180
you buy this you buy some asset gold so

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.130
you buy some asset right and it says

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:44.660
it's this little it's this little statue

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:48.410
and you buy it for four you know

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:51.140
thirty thousand dollars and then you

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:53.120
flip it a month later and you sold her

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.120
for fifty thousand okay great well then

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.430
what's next so Matt I'll put you on the

00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:59.930
spot here like then what do you do with

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:02.870
that so now I got an extra twenty G's in

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:05.240
my part in my pocket yep now I'm the guy

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:08.480
I'm gonna buy a house now right so the

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.040
point and then if the goal is to grow

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.170
your portfolio right you then have to

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:13.460
keep on doing it right if your

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:15.590
methodology is flipping it's not just

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:17.270
like oh you made 50 grand because you

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:18.920
can't live off of that in Purdue it like

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.660
forever all right so then you have to go

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.730
and do it again and then it's the same

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:24.590
logic again and again and again and

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:27.020
again and again until that either the

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:28.640
game stops like because you went

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.980
bankrupt or when you're so rich you just

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:32.450
put it all in cash and you live off of

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:35.480
there like that's the extremes of that

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.850
of that explained so when an asset does

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:39.650
not produce you cash like you have to

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:41.750
essentially sell off the asset to

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:43.250
produce the cash that you're looking for

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:46.280
now all all assets you know in my

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.840
opinion and maybe some people call me

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.340
crazy but it's like we're all probably

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:52.340
investing for cash at some point like

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:53.870
either like at some point in the future

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:55.310
like at some point you need to convert

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:58.370
it to to be the resource to serve the

00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:00.890
utility that you need it for now even if

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:02.300
you pass it to children it's the same

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.710
thing right like you are there's a

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:05.300
reason that you're doing it like you're

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.280
doing it so that at some point some

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:10.840
human can benefit from using that cash

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:14.180
right to pay for something food housing

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:17.420
whatever so some people out there to say

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:18.740
hey I want to I want to do I wouldn't

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:20.210
have the flipping methodology right I

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:21.410
want to take what Warren Buffett would

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:22.910
call like a speculative methodology like

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:25.370
I I think that I can predict the price

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:27.200
fluctuation so I can buy low and sell

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:27.560
high

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.090
right that sort of thing and that's

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:31.100
great in urban people have done that now

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:34.130
if in my opinion as best as I can tell

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:36.050
the people have done that repeatedly

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:39.260
like is few and far between right now

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:40.670
you still you still will get like

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:41.930
everyone's look like a lottery winners

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:44.120
Fred for instance right like yeah you

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.440
will hear of a lottery winner but you

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.000
never hear the same lottery one or twice

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.010
mmm and I don't mean to draw the

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:50.360
comparison like because I know somebody

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:52.010
well it's not the same probably like

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:54.500
trust me I'm not confused on that but

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.300
it's just the example right like there's

00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.700
a reason why you've heard of Warren

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:01.340
Buffett for such a long time right now

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:02.210
so his method all

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:04.790
invest in productive assets assets that

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:07.520
actually produce cash now for gold let's

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.440
just get back to the chart here gold is

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.450
worth four dollars and 52 cents if you

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:15.250
invested a dollar in 1802 up to 2012

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:17.870
what do you remember bonds were or what

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:19.130
do you remember you said four bonds oh

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:22.220
man I think like I think I scaled it

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.840
down I got a little more realistic and I

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:28.040
think I said like 800 bucks right so

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:31.250
you're you're close it was is 1778

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:33.470
dollars so now you're starting to

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:35.330
develop like a spectrum right so it's

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:37.790
it's in that chart you can see if I did

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:40.670
it with cash I would have lost 95% of my

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:43.880
value if I would do it with gold I would

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.740
have increased it to four dollars and 52

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:48.500
cents all right if I did it with bonds

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:52.040
then I'd be at 1778 so you're starting

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.740
to get a spectrum right a macro view of

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:56.690
what we're talking about now if you look

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:57.710
at stocks do you remember what the

00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:59.720
number for stocks was so again just one

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.960
dollar invested from 1802 to 2012 yeah I

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.940
said something again III think I said

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:06.260
like 20 million dollars or something

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:09.070
yeah so that number it's actually seven

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:12.080
seven hundred four thousand dollars yeah

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:14.720
right weird all those other ones that

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.000
kind of dwarfed some same thing yeah you

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.850
either lose 95 percent in cash or you

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:21.590
invest in stocks those are the two ends

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:24.320
right you lose so it goes down to a

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:27.680
nickel or seven hundred four thousand no

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.450
that's not me I'm not recommending any

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:30.740
of this I'm just giving you what the

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:34.100
book is saying right so that's one of my

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.390
favorite crafts in finance because that

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:37.220
helps us orient ourselves now there that

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.690
that will not stop gold investors from

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:40.310
ever investing right because they will

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:42.710
still have their valid reason of saying

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:43.970
well maybe I can predict the price

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:46.280
fluctuations and maybe they can I happen

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.130
to not know any right like and I would

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:51.680
probably doubt that that you do either

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.680
right like you know um you know and I

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:56.810
don't know any friends who have who know

00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:59.450
anybody else who has who's created

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:02.000
millions of dollars in value by trading

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.770
gold like I just know that who have a

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:06.680
speculative thing mapped out yeah well

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.710
let's say for gold now like now you can

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:11.510
do this so like well arm Buffett says if

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.700
you purchased all of the gold in the

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:14.390
world

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:17.740
right it would add up to a 67 foot cube

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:20.510
well but then just so your listeners

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:23.390
know what would you then do with it

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:27.720
statue right like yeah like you melt it

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.350
down you make some cool shapes on it

00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:33.240
whatever like but the point is it's not

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.770
going to produce you when is the only

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:36.990
time it produces cash for you when you

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:40.830
sell it exactly right so so and and

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:44.100
along the way you can create I don't

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.540
know a really cool story like you can

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:49.320
tell people that you've got a big block

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.850
of cool and of gold in your basement

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:52.560
right like there's there's some cool

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.150
things and you could you know I don't

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:55.530
know maybe sell tickets today for people

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:56.970
to view that right but but there's not

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:58.980
much that you can really do and I'm

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:00.540
trying to look up the numbers now and

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.520
I'm gonna get them wrong but let me let

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:04.980
me look them up to see if I can find it

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:11.310
for you so in terms of the gold yeah so

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:13.170
I'm gonna I'm gonna get the numbers

00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:15.330
wrong just so we can have you know an

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:17.160
easier conversation here but he

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.470
basically goes through and says okay I

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:21.240
could I could spend all this money buy

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:22.890
all the gold in the world

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:25.620
more I could go and I could buy all of

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:28.140
the farmland in the United States right

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.090
and get access to all of the soybeans

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:32.010
and the chickens and the eggs and the

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:33.450
milk and everything that we're selling

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:36.060
as a result right and I also think he

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:37.830
says 1/3 of the US stock market and like

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:39.780
7 Exxon Mobil's it might be it might

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:41.730
have been like I could buy a third of

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:43.350
the market and 7 Exxon Mobil's or I

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:44.940
could buy all of the all of the farmland

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:45.960
in the world but the point was let's

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.030
just go with the farmland right I could

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:49.980
buy all the gold in the world and have a

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:53.220
67 foot cube in my basement and I could

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:54.990
and then what he says he I could look at

00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:56.520
it and I can fondle it and I could do

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:58.860
all this stuff like but but at the end

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:00.570
of the day like that's all its gonna be

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:02.820
there or I could go and buy all of the

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.950
farmland in the United States all right

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:07.410
let's just say and I get access to all

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:09.300
of the chickens being sold the eggs

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:12.450
being sold the the meat you know the

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:15.390
milk soybeans like everything that farms

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:18.330
produce you know and and then get the

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:19.770
money in return for that get the revenue

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:23.490
that the farm is generating so and then

00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:24.780
I would get that revenue let's say every

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:27.480
every single quarter right so now let's

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:30.390
go out over 20 years which would you

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:33.390
rather have would you rather have this

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:36.420
now in 20 years and Malthus is

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:38.340
hard question right yeah in 20 years

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:42.290
what are you left with with gold gold

00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:44.160
alright you gotta go now you might be

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.230
able to sell it for higher price but in

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:48.990
20 years what would you have gotten from

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:53.730
the farmland oh we've gotten all you

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:55.830
know the value off of all the farms Yeah

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:57.540
right like like all of the revenue

00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.570
generated from the farms now over a 20

00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:02.580
year period do you think you could have

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:06.330
sold that farmland for a higher price

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:09.650
than which you originally bought it

00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:12.390
could you have sold it for a higher

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:13.950
price yeah I would say over 20 years

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:15.630
definitely after 20 years right because

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:17.460
because what what happens right you

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:18.570
probably got increased technology

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:20.610
increased efficiencies or I think all of

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:21.930
these different things I don't know

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:23.130
anything about farmland but I'm going to

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:25.140
assume the methodology and the

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.820
productivity of farms now is

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:28.590
significantly better than it was 20

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:30.660
years ago yeah you know that's my guess

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:32.160
and definitely 40 years ago that that's

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.930
the thing is like compounding over time

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:35.130
like this this stuff couldn't work

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:35.880
pretty dramatically

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.400
yeah nope now with that being said you

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.500
now have a spectrum right so so alarm

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.570
Buffett says is is okay I want

00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:44.550
productive assets so I want assets that

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:46.710
are going to produce cash now for the

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:49.350
farm right like you it's up to the in

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:51.090
bit like this is where we get into

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:53.430
splitting hairs right like do you in my

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:57.510
opinion like what I would rather have is

00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:59.190
I don't want to do the I don't want to

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:00.390
do the gold right I don't want to buy

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:02.400
the gold right I'd rather buy a business

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.470
because a farm is a business I'd rather

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:05.610
buy a business gonna pay me out

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:07.620
repeatedly over time and this is where

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:09.270
Warren Buffett says you know how much

00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:10.470
cash you're gonna get what are you gonna

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:12.750
get and how sure are you well when we

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:14.400
start to measure cash flows and and

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:15.690
whether or not it's cash flows that they

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:17.460
retain in earnings so for instance like

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:19.740
the farm takes the revenue and let's say

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:21.000
they've got a hundred dollars in revenue

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.800
and they they keep 50 of it let's just

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.530
say and to buy you know to buy I don't

00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:27.480
know a different different salt like

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.800
actually funny enough so my buddy is

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.240
consulting for a farm right now and

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.430
they're investing in software to figure

00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:33.810
out how to make the farm more efficient

00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:35.280
which is pretty fascinating so anyway so

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.050
they'll take $50 of that hundred dollar

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:38.580
revenue and they'll give it back to

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:39.750
themselves in the form of retained

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:42.450
earnings there's a obviously at a very

00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:44.460
high level so they take it and they

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:45.780
invest in the software why because

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:47.070
that'll make them more productive next

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:49.329
year okay great you want them doing that

00:46:49.329 --> 00:46:50.619
right but then they'll take the other 50

00:46:50.619 --> 00:46:52.239
let's say they can't optimally utilize

00:46:52.239 --> 00:46:55.119
the other 50 right because there's only

00:46:55.119 --> 00:46:56.769
one piece of software they could buy but

00:46:56.769 --> 00:46:59.259
if they the other software they the

00:46:59.259 --> 00:47:01.089
other 50 dollars there's no good use of

00:47:01.089 --> 00:47:02.950
capital for it okay great so then they

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:04.959
give it to me as the investor well now

00:47:04.959 --> 00:47:06.849
as the investor and let's say it's you

00:47:06.849 --> 00:47:09.249
Matt so the gold didn't give you any

00:47:09.249 --> 00:47:10.779
dollars but now this farmland gives you

00:47:10.779 --> 00:47:12.339
$50 and they kept 50 dollars to

00:47:12.339 --> 00:47:13.719
themselves to make the farm better so be

00:47:13.719 --> 00:47:16.509
more productive next year what can you

00:47:16.509 --> 00:47:18.630
do with the $50

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:21.420
by more of the farm yeah you can buy

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:22.829
another farm you can buy a larger

00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:24.329
percentage share of the farm you could

00:47:24.329 --> 00:47:26.900
you could buy you could buy you know

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:29.069
like what Warren Buffett does he calls

00:47:29.069 --> 00:47:31.049
himself a capital allocator right so

00:47:31.049 --> 00:47:33.509
he'll take that dividend and then he

00:47:33.509 --> 00:47:35.490
will reinvest it and oftentimes you

00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:37.859
invest it into other companies right

00:47:37.859 --> 00:47:39.480
whether it be public or private he also

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:41.549
invests in farmland as well so now you

00:47:41.549 --> 00:47:43.950
as the investor you have the option

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:47.130
right on taking that and and reinvesting

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:48.269
it to buying let's say more of a

00:47:48.269 --> 00:47:50.609
percentage of either the same asset or

00:47:50.609 --> 00:47:52.109
going on buying a different asset and

00:47:52.109 --> 00:47:54.359
that happens let's just say every single

00:47:54.359 --> 00:47:57.059
quarter right yeah here's a quick just

00:47:57.059 --> 00:47:58.980
real quick this is a push back I feel

00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:00.450
like this is where people start to kind

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:03.480
of say like well yeah that only works if

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.190
you're a billionaire or like yeah well

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:07.200
what am I gonna do with my 30 cents like

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:13.289
oh sure okay yeah so so let's get it

00:48:13.289 --> 00:48:15.029
this way so and by the way you can do

00:48:15.029 --> 00:48:17.099
this with with many different asset

00:48:17.099 --> 00:48:20.069
types so real estate for example right

00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:23.220
like you know you you could own a piece

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:26.390
of real estate and rent it out to people

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:28.170
alright so just a very very

00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:29.730
stereotypical like real estate

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:31.799
transaction you have a landlord and rent

00:48:31.799 --> 00:48:34.230
II you know situation okay

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:37.769
well you get $800 a month so now the

00:48:37.769 --> 00:48:39.509
purchase price of the home let's just

00:48:39.509 --> 00:48:42.269
say for instance like give me a give me

00:48:42.269 --> 00:48:44.039
a good purchase price or an average

00:48:44.039 --> 00:48:46.950
purchase price around Philadelphia well

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:48.660
so you got a place for like a hundred

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:50.099
thousand dollars like somewhere that's

00:48:50.099 --> 00:48:51.240
kind of beat up but you could rent it

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:52.559
out you know you could do that and the

00:48:52.559 --> 00:48:54.690
mortgage would probably be about five

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:56.910
hundred bucks a month yeah so let's just

00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:58.950
say how much would you just roughly

00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:00.900
speaking and we're not to get so precise

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:02.609
here but at the end of the year how much

00:49:02.609 --> 00:49:04.230
would you receive in net rental income

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:06.630
so after expenses all right let's make

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:10.109
it a thousand bucks a month so yeah you

00:49:10.109 --> 00:49:12.480
make [ __ ] man put me on the spot to do

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:17.609
mental math let's just do this let's say

00:49:17.609 --> 00:49:19.619
at the end of the year you have two

00:49:19.619 --> 00:49:21.569
thousand dollars of net rent yeah

00:49:21.569 --> 00:49:22.950
because there's so many variables like

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:24.750
you know like how much you put down like

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:26.609
all those things right let's just say

00:49:26.609 --> 00:49:30.509
you got net rent and and actually let's

00:49:30.509 --> 00:49:31.650
even say you're not using leverage

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:32.600
because if something

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:33.860
come back and say oh well yeah but you

00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:35.570
put a debt and all it's okay let's just

00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:37.040
say you bought it for cash right yeah

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.560
let's say you had to fix it up so so net

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:40.760
at the end of the year you had two

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:44.330
thousand dollars net profit right well

00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:45.560
that's two thousand dollars yeah it's

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:46.910
small relative to the hundred thousand

00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:49.460
you put in but that's your first year so

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:51.140
then what can you do with that two

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:54.500
thousand dollars uh you could just set

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:56.150
it aside and start buying a new another

00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:58.250
house eventually right exactly now the

00:49:58.250 --> 00:49:59.390
one of the issues with real estate

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:02.030
especially for not using leverage is the

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:04.040
velocity tends to be typically slow

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.530
because that $2,000 right that you save

00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:08.570
you then have to either save up another

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:10.280
hundred thousand or you save up at least

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:11.630
the amount of the downpayment that you

00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:12.500
could buy another property

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:14.210
what is leverage taking the amount of

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:15.560
the house you own and then borrowing

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:19.220
against it so yeah sorry so somewhere

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:21.110
along the way like finance like in

00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:22.430
finance we just get ultra snobby

00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:24.470
leverage and then we make different

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:26.870
words you know it leverages debt right

00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:29.030
like it's just using debt so and so that

00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:30.320
being exact like you want to get a

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:32.960
mortgage right you that the the origin

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.790
is you are leveraging other people's

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:37.310
funds like in that case the bank's funds

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:39.650
to help you purchase the asset got you

00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:41.360
yeah so that's whenever here leverage

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:43.700
that's what it means okay so so yeah

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.530
like as the investor you can take that

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:47.000
two thousand dollars at the end of the

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.230
year and you can put it in a piggy bank

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:50.240
or a bank and until you get let's say

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:51.530
twenty thousand which would be twenty

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:52.820
percent of the next downpayment that

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:53.930
you're gonna get for the next property

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:55.010
okay great

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:57.140
now the whole idea there is like then

00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:58.340
what you do well then you do it again

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.020
and you do it again and you keep on

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:01.790
doing that and over the course of a time

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:03.200
rise and that's pretty significant right

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.240
it can be pretty significant and the

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.460
funny thing is when you're operate by

00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.560
fundamentals such as this like you

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.030
actually don't have to be an outstanding

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:13.880
investor because like quote like beating

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:15.950
the market and so on like like a lot of

00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:17.330
people like it's that whole quote that

00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:18.470
we talk I think we talked about earlier

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:20.090
like the good plan that you follow is

00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:21.230
better than the great plan that you

00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:23.990
don't and Charlie Munger's version of

00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:25.610
this that has something to do with this

00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:27.620
is like better to be roughly right than

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:30.380
precisely wrong mm-hmm because so for

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:31.490
instance like my grandma doesn't know

00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:33.830
anything about investing like like zero

00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:38.300
right she has an asset in the villus New

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.670
Jersey that has been been producing cash

00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:43.630
for her for decades she knows nothing

00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:46.280
the original purchase price of that

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.020
I think it was like $8,000 there's

00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:49.400
multiple decades it's a small house

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:51.290
write-off right outside of Cape May well

00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:53.840
now she receives this is my grandma yeah

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.370
right like she doesn't have people

00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:57.110
debating her on her philosophy in fact

00:51:57.110 --> 00:51:58.280
if somebody came to her and said like

00:51:58.280 --> 00:51:59.960
hey like what are you doing she like I

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.250
don't know like I don't know go to the

00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:03.050
dollar store every morning and I really

00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:06.740
think like literally right no clue well

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:08.510
they bought that property for $8,000

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:11.240
this she this last so to that at the end

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:12.170
of 2019

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:15.140
she received net ten thousand dollars in

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:17.060
income now that's because she's a

00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:18.560
terrible landlord she has not increased

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:21.410
her rent ever mmm right that's like this

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:21.950
ever naughty

00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:23.600
increase in the rent well and and and

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:26.240
first just so if we really wanted nip

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.890
here so they used the house for their

00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:29.300
own vacation for a long time and then

00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:31.760
eventually start running it out so so

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:34.100
she now gets ten thousand dollars a year

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:36.800
in net income well I'm gonna quiz you

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.150
here again what did she pay for the

00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.660
property

00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:41.450
eight thousand bucks so eight eight

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:43.190
eight thousand yeah

00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:45.500
not eighty no eight no eight thousand

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:48.170
yeah eight thousand so it's ten thousand

00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:50.030
dollars a year in income

00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:53.060
grand-slam that's every single year

00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:56.720
mm-hmm right like she's getting but more

00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:59.030
than a hundred percent of her initial

00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:03.740
cash outlay so yeah maybe you know maybe

00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:06.380
she's this super investment genius that

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:07.790
I just don't know about but I'm pretty

00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:10.280
sure like I don't even think she's and I

00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:12.650
say this respectfully I don't think she

00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:15.200
graduated ninth grade right like you

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:16.640
know cuz back in the day like in poorer

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:17.750
neighborhoods like they didn't finish

00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:20.810
school yeah so is she some genius is she

00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:22.520
trying to time something is she flipping

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:24.920
some no like that's an outstanding and

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:28.280
now the the asset value like she now the

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:30.230
asset value because it's such a strong

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:32.120
cash flow property like what what does

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.770
that do well it increases the value of

00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:35.390
the property and plus the the value the

00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:36.710
property has inherent value in it

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:38.840
because of the location and so on but

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:40.550
investors want to buy the property who

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:42.020
you know it's cuz they go this is it has

00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:43.880
a long-standing tenant banana blah blah

00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:47.570
blah well she now has a value of that

00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:49.070
property it's it's worth hundreds of

00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:51.740
thousands of dollars right so she has an

00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:53.360
asset that's worth hundreds of thousands

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:54.710
of dollars she only paid eight thousand

00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:56.810
but she also gets ten thousand dollars a

00:53:56.810 --> 00:53:59.330
year in again net after expenses in

00:53:59.330 --> 00:53:59.690
rental

00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:02.150
come now what do you think she wants to

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:03.200
do with the property because some

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:04.579
realtor ended up telling her what she

00:54:04.579 --> 00:54:06.200
could sell the problem with yeah she

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.430
wants to sell it but then what does she

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:09.109
have to do well then it gets back to the

00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:10.819
book right she then has to make the

00:54:10.819 --> 00:54:13.040
decision back on this graph right on

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.290
okay well do I put it in cash you know

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:16.730
she's still gonna live for decades more

00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:18.290
do I put it in cash and have a decrease

00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:21.349
in value over time now if she has a goal

00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:22.790
that's very short-term than heck yeah

00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:24.500
like put that Porsche portion in cash

00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:27.859
you know my recommendation and I'm

00:54:27.859 --> 00:54:29.780
really I'm not recommending anything

00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:32.630
let's just say for myself right

00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:35.390
what yeah when I want two to five years

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:39.619
of cash always mm-hmm just always right

00:54:39.619 --> 00:54:41.660
like I'd like so now some people say oh

00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:43.069
yeah that's a terrible investment well

00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:45.230
I'm not looking that that is a an asset

00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:47.599
that is that is for a very specific

00:54:47.599 --> 00:54:50.060
purpose you know so like I bucket eyes

00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:51.560
my asset so I've got short-term assets

00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:53.390
medium term assets long term assets long

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:55.880
legacy assets protective assets and then

00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:57.560
opportunity assets those are the buckets

00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.300
that I look at so depending on what

00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:01.220
bucket we're talking about like like my

00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:02.810
methodology changes but let's just say

00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:03.980
we're talking about long term asset

00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:05.930
investing my grandmom looks like a

00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:08.720
genius right like she's just crushing it

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:12.109
and and and selling her out of that so

00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:14.089
she can get this like payday well then

00:55:14.089 --> 00:55:16.010
she's left with the same problem and

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:17.810
that by the way she'd have to pay taxes

00:55:17.810 --> 00:55:19.520
on it etc pay real it's her fees and all

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.990
that stuff well then she's in a similar

00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:22.609
issue well then you get back to the

00:55:22.609 --> 00:55:25.400
origin of the talk right well she has

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:27.710
that net gain and that that that lump

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:29.930
sum now so what does she do well chances

00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:31.700
are like one of the options is she just

00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:33.589
has to go and buy another property well

00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:34.849
it's like well why would you go and the

00:55:34.849 --> 00:55:36.290
only reason that you would do that is if

00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:38.210
you can on a percentage basis you can

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:40.880
cashflow more right and won't even even

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:42.349
on a flat dollar amount if she if you

00:55:42.349 --> 00:55:43.849
can take that same money which is now

00:55:43.849 --> 00:55:46.250
depleted because you pay taxes right and

00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:48.020
you pay you know you paid realtor fees

00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:49.550
etc and again we're knocking the minutia

00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:52.400
if like you all do like different what

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:53.780
kind of a pot it makes sense it kind of

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:55.640
applies to Bitcoin it's like the chances

00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:57.500
of say like you bought Bitcoin early

00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:59.569
sold it made a boatload of money the

00:55:59.569 --> 00:56:02.210
chances of your grandmom recreating the

00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:04.210
scenario of like a house being worth

00:56:04.210 --> 00:56:06.829
$8,000 and then skyrocketing through the

00:56:06.829 --> 00:56:09.770
dot-com bubble and all you know you're

00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:11.599
left you that's it's a wonky blueprint

00:56:11.599 --> 00:56:13.020
because you were just

00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:15.210
you know you benefited from

00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:16.890
circumstances way outside of your

00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:18.780
control and then it tried to kind of do

00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:20.430
that consistently seems like you know

00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:22.980
bad bet it can be a bad bet well she

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:24.540
would she would be forced to answer the

00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:25.500
same question that you and I are

00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:26.820
exploring right now it's like okay well

00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:28.200
then you're left with this reduced

00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.450
amount well then do I go on do I invest

00:56:30.450 --> 00:56:32.160
in another property that's gonna pay me

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:34.500
out cash flow or do I go and I invest in

00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:37.050
this piece of land that doesn't have a

00:56:37.050 --> 00:56:38.790
rental property on it but like some guys

00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:40.200
telling me it's gonna increase in value

00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:42.240
and I could probably sell that land for

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.610
more next year Yeah right let's just

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:46.200
think of that isn't it or even even

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.030
better I can go buy this piece of metal

00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:50.640
right this gold piece of metal and I can

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.680
flip it for higher next year now I don't

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:54.150
know about you but like I don't want my

00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:57.300
grandmom doing that yeah like my vote

00:56:57.300 --> 00:56:58.860
would be no she keeps the property keeps

00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:01.590
it keeps cash flowing it and if she does

00:57:01.590 --> 00:57:03.300
do something silly like sell it out and

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:04.710
it's like then when she comes and talks

00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:06.390
to me it's like no go and buy something

00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:08.250
similar that is going to produce you

00:57:08.250 --> 00:57:11.130
very predictable cash flow in perpetuity

00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:13.830
yeah again perpetuity just a an

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:16.890
obnoxious word for forever sure I find

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:18.600
it's a finance word for forever so I

00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:20.250
need my grandmom to have very

00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:23.850
predictable cash flow over time now the

00:57:23.850 --> 00:57:25.830
cool thing is my grandmom can choose

00:57:25.830 --> 00:57:29.040
every single month like literally what

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:30.420
it puts a lot of control on her hand

00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:32.730
right every single month she can choose

00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:35.790
what she wants to do with that money she

00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:37.920
can go and buy groceries for it with it

00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:39.660
she can go and buy medical you know I

00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:41.910
don't know you know prescriptions with

00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:45.090
it etc or she can save an account to

00:57:45.090 --> 00:57:46.860
then go and buy another asset with right

00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:49.020
mm-hmm so there's a lot of flexibility

00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:52.890
versus if she just bought the gold right

00:57:52.890 --> 00:57:55.470
what does she have to do like let's like

00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:58.620
for instance if she buys gold if she

00:57:58.620 --> 00:57:59.880
wants to make any money off of it what

00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:02.340
does she have to do so yeah she's got to

00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:04.890
sell the entire thing hmm

00:58:04.890 --> 00:58:06.930
yeah that's true right so it's like well

00:58:06.930 --> 00:58:08.820
what if she only needs the ten thousand

00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:11.340
that she said she net so let's just say

00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:13.140
for ease of numbers she makes $1,000 a

00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:15.930
month in rent yeah well that's great

00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:17.250
because there's a lot of things that she

00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:18.630
can do with that thousand dollars but

00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:20.430
she doesn't need the whole two hundred

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:22.860
thousand got you right does that make

00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:23.220
sense

00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:25.350
yeah because if you have gold you could

00:58:25.350 --> 00:58:26.430
sell pea

00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:29.760
of it can you yeah yeah but let's just

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.050
say my example like you had so yeah

00:58:31.050 --> 00:58:32.819
you're probably chip it off right like

00:58:32.819 --> 00:58:34.800
an you know but for instance like there

00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.960
are now gold it happens that fit that

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.309
example where you could chip pieces off

00:58:38.309 --> 00:58:40.109
but there's other examples like let's

00:58:40.109 --> 00:58:43.650
say for fine art right fine art doesn't

00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:45.359
produce any cash so it's a very similar

00:58:45.359 --> 00:58:47.640
wholly that's all or nothing I got yeah

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:50.400
like you can't even have you saw what is

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:51.839
that even the house and you didn't want

00:58:51.839 --> 00:58:52.890
to rent it yeah you gotta sell the

00:58:52.890 --> 00:58:55.230
entire house yeah exactly so that's

00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:56.640
that's another thing and people probably

00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:58.440
get pretty heated over this like like

00:58:58.440 --> 00:58:59.579
yeah you could definitely flip houses

00:58:59.579 --> 00:59:01.770
for sure like go and watch all those TV

00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:04.140
shows like HDTV where like they buy a

00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:05.730
house for 10 bucks they put a new couch

00:59:05.730 --> 00:59:07.440
in and it put like some paint in there

00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:08.790
and they sell it for 5 million the next

00:59:08.790 --> 00:59:10.890
day obviously I'm about it but it's like

00:59:10.890 --> 00:59:12.900
yeah you could definitely do that for

00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:15.630
sure and and a lot of people do that and

00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:19.020
I can tell you I know a guy who because

00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:20.220
again it's that same thing right like

00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:23.190
you don't just do it one time like you

00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:24.630
gotta then take the profits and then you

00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:26.040
do it again and you do it again and you

00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:27.960
do it again and you do it again and and

00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:29.369
then typically what happens in real life

00:59:29.369 --> 00:59:32.010
because so because you know one of the

00:59:32.010 --> 00:59:33.299
things is like we have to take this from

00:59:33.299 --> 00:59:35.700
the theoretical into the real life cuz

00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:36.900
those are two very different things

00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:37.950
there's a way different thing than

00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:40.319
reading about riding a bike and then

00:59:40.319 --> 00:59:41.940
actually riding a bike and falling off

00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:43.680
for the first time and like being able

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.349
to see like your bone off of the from

00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:48.059
the skin of your knee come up you know

00:59:48.059 --> 00:59:49.200
to me like those are two different

00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:53.010
things so so in the flipping world for

00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:55.319
real estate you have to to put all of

00:59:55.319 --> 00:59:57.000
your money let's just say take this

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.500
example like I actually know a person

00:59:58.500 --> 00:59:59.790
who did this you know and it's a very

00:59:59.790 --> 01:00:01.859
common theme took all his money bought

01:00:01.859 --> 01:00:03.450
his first piece of property right and

01:00:03.450 --> 01:00:07.109
took out debt for it etc then did the

01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:08.910
same thing and then if we really you

01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:10.710
know all this did gray we made 20 grand

01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:12.960
or whatever it was right and oftentimes

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.430
a lot of these people are not really

01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:15.630
giving the real numbers not because

01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:16.619
they're lying but because oftentimes

01:00:16.619 --> 01:00:17.940
they don't know the real numbers right

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:19.200
like there's like there's a lot of

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.089
underlying math and finance that goes on

01:00:21.089 --> 01:00:22.950
into you know larger transactions so

01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:24.990
anyway so he takes that money and then

01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:26.640
he and he flips it into a another

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:27.869
property and then flips into another

01:00:27.869 --> 01:00:30.210
property and another property eventually

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:33.110
he had 27 properties

01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:36.170
okay and counting his own residence well

01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:38.330
at that point again you're still at the

01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:39.530
math where it's like you have to do it

01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:41.570
again right you're kind of on this like

01:00:41.570 --> 01:00:42.710
hamster like you have to keep it going

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:45.680
right until one day that the implicit

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:48.680
exit strategy there is one day just cash

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.180
out everything and then you're like

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:51.800
Midas you're just sitting on this heap

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:55.070
of like you know capital so with this

01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:57.380
particular guy died guy did is he kept

01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:58.520
on doing that so you have to do it over

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.020
a long period of time well guess what

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:02.630
happened 2008 hmm all right what

01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:07.250
happened in 2008 yes what is that this

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:08.690
subprime mortgage crisis there have been

01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:10.430
in my old boss same thing he was oh

01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:12.560
really he was writing himself checks for

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:13.910
like five grand a week he would they

01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:16.460
were killing it building developments

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:18.620
and everything and he like almost got

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:20.150
Candida with him almost getting kicked

01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:22.310
out of his house which is easy to say

01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:23.720
you know I could be like well you know I

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.030
I would do like four of them then I roll

01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:28.670
it into like all rental properties but

01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:29.750
once you're making you're making fifty

01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:32.030
fifty thousand $100,000 it's hard not to

01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:34.160
just do it again ya know and that's a

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.360
great point like yeah at some point you

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.890
could turn from like a speculative asset

01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:39.290
into like definitely but to your point

01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:40.340
it's like yeah this is where the real

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:42.470
world actually meets like theory it's

01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:44.510
like at what point do you do that and

01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:46.310
you don't know and again if you want to

01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:48.890
do it great like go and do it we're just

01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:50.180
giving you stories and it's funny funny

01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:52.460
thing is our stories actually are very

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:54.290
similar the guy that I know had 27

01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:59.030
properties he lost all of them in 2001

01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:00.110
of them now if you were to talk to him

01:02:00.110 --> 01:02:02.480
three months prior he was a genius

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.280
hmm right like you know he's like hey

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.660
man like you you I was like why aren't

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.250
you doing this you need to do this right

01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:09.500
lost everyone of them including his

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.330
primary residence had to move into a

01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:13.160
trailer and lot and got a divorce

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:15.950
yeah that's pretty tough right like you

01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:20.210
know it's so versus my grandmom right

01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:23.900
like you know like you know it's it's

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:25.820
pretty interesting now obviously this is

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:27.410
all anecdotal like I totally get that

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:29.450
but it's like where do I want to sit

01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:32.210
right like I want to sit with assets

01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:34.130
that are going to they're gonna produce

01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:36.080
cash right and they take a portion of

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.760
that cash to grow the business right and

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:38.930
and they give me a portion of cash in

01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:41.210
return now again I don't use that for

01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:42.620
all of my goals like I said short-term

01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:44.690
medium-term long-term etc so this fits a

01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:46.310
very specific niche and very specific

01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:47.030
goals

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:49.400
so now you don't have to do it like just

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:50.540
the stock market with dividend-paying

01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:52.580
stocks is just one example you could do

01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:54.380
it index funds have the same thing it's

01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:56.510
just a pool of you know let's say for

01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:59.230
this conversation a pool of stocks and

01:02:59.230 --> 01:03:01.580
percentage of those inside of those and

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.200
that pool could pay off dividend so for

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.030
instance like you brought up at some

01:03:05.030 --> 01:03:07.280
point like the S&P 500 right the S&P 500

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:10.280
produces dividends so I've got I've got

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:12.440
some data here I've seen let me pause

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.570
that yeah you don't just have to do in

01:03:14.570 --> 01:03:16.510
the stock stock market right like I

01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:18.950
really enjoy Warren Buffett's commentary

01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:20.600
around the stuff because it says hey do

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.420
not approach the stock market like most

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:25.370
people do which is a casino like they

01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:26.780
purchase it and they they look at this

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:28.280
little ticker symbol and though you know

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:29.840
bouncing up and down it's a golf I buy

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.640
low here and I sell it up here and then

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:34.130
I make a bunch of money so no you're

01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:36.110
like you should be in my opinion you

01:03:36.110 --> 01:03:38.270
should I buy these things because of for

01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:40.220
what it is you're buying ownership of

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:43.130
companies so think about it like if you

01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:47.390
were to to want to buy a business right

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:48.560
let's say outside of your own business

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:50.420
you'd go down to the local pizza shop

01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:52.580
because it has great pizza and has great

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:54.140
operations and is super friendly has

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:55.940
been around for decades it's a it's it's

01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:57.950
the thing in the local town okay great

01:03:57.950 --> 01:04:00.260
and let's just say the owner says well

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:01.370
yeah you know it's like I've been doing

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:03.200
this but like I want some sort of

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:05.090
liquidity like you know I'm making good

01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:06.980
money but I want to buy my mom a house

01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:09.170
and I can't I don't just want to sell

01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:10.640
the whole business so hey man like I'll

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:12.470
sell you half of it for a hundred

01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:14.300
thousand dollars and I'd say okay great

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:16.130
so I'll go and do that I'll give you the

01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:17.690
hundred thousand and what I want is I

01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:19.460
want you to give me a certain percentage

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:22.400
of the profits right every quarter right

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.600
and if those are good if there's a good

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:24.980
numbers then hey man like yeah I want to

01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:26.480
do it so like you get your capital that

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.520
you want to go buy your mom a house you

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.110
still run and operate the business and

01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:32.030
you use whatever capital you need to

01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:33.620
keep on growing the business but we have

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:34.880
very predictable revenue because we've

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.280
got decade's worth of data right and I

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.450
just want to deal where you pay me

01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:40.100
someone back back of those of those

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:42.890
profits and by the way if you don't get

01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:44.540
profits I want you along the way like

01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:46.280
with your profit I want you give me some

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.480
of the profit I want to take a small

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.950
percentage of profit and what you put it

01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:50.420
in reserve in case you have are ever up

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:51.770
down yours etc I want you to do that

01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:53.240
every single time and then I want you

01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:54.470
taking a certain percentage and then

01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:56.420
like you know buying more dough and

01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:58.160
looking at other locations to expand all

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.770
those things so I really like that model

01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:04.940
and and I'm comfortable with knowing

01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:06.980
okay I'm gonna get this check every

01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:09.380
single quarter right and if I don't it's

01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:12.200
an anomaly now that does not mean that

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:14.690
all pizza shops are created equal

01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:16.910
yeah right like that's that's a very

01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:18.500
important distinction but I think some

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:20.090
piece of shops might be paying say hey

01:05:20.090 --> 01:05:21.440
man like you know what you're only

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.030
asking for three thousand dollars of

01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:25.250
profit per quarter I'll give you twenty

01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:27.410
thousand right that that is a very

01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:28.670
that's a it's a weird thing like if you

01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:29.900
know pizza shops and you know the

01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:31.340
markets like well that's really weird

01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:33.530
because it's no different than having a

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:35.300
rental like a rental home right like

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:36.680
imagine you're renting out a property

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:38.210
imagine like my grandma right she's

01:05:38.210 --> 01:05:40.250
renting out a property and she says you

01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:41.810
know hey Wes like yeah the last tenant

01:05:41.810 --> 01:05:43.430
moved out and and they pay me ten

01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:44.890
thousand dollars a year let's just say

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:47.180
but this new guy came in and he's

01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:48.530
offering to pay me a hundred thousand

01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:51.050
dollars a year right like what would you

01:05:51.050 --> 01:05:52.850
say to that what's the initial feeling

01:05:52.850 --> 01:05:54.080
that you get as a landlord when that

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:58.130
happens yeah it's too good to be true

01:05:58.130 --> 01:05:59.960
exactly right it's like there's

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:01.490
something they're kind of buying me

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:03.560
somehow is this guy a drug dealer like

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.150
is he it's not like what is what's going

01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:07.460
on here so just like like it's the same

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:08.930
thing with pizza shops just say it's the

01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:10.250
same thing with with stocks it's like

01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:11.600
not all dividend-paying stocks are the

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.520
same right not all pizza shops are the

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.320
same not all rental properties are the

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:16.670
same right not all tenants of this like

01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:19.400
you start to so just taking this general

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.750
and saying oh well that's like that's

01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:22.430
what I do right like it's like no it's

01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:25.910
like analysis needs to be done so so

01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:28.610
anyway so I really like that so for

01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:29.810
instance like if you look up some data

01:06:29.810 --> 01:06:31.340
now you can do this in the stock market

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:33.320
if you want to which is just a it's it's

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:36.200
an easier it's an easier way of buying

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.170
cash flows now so like let's say if you

01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:40.910
look at I pull up some data for you guys

01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:45.910
so if you look at let's say the S&P 500

01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:48.170
actually am i able to share my screen

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:50.540
with you do it I think you good okay

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:53.930
again very annoying disclaimer this is

01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:56.270
not me recommending anything in fact

01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:58.370
like like I'm super hesitant to even say

01:06:58.370 --> 01:06:59.930
like names of investments because I

01:06:59.930 --> 01:07:01.340
think you don't have to do I mean you

01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:03.050
you just staying like kind of

01:07:03.050 --> 01:07:05.600
hypotheticals I don't you joined up okay

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.790
so let me see if I can share this here

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:11.590
for you so

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:16.330
how does one do that okay I think I see

01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:20.230
the bun here okay so the cool thing

01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:21.760
about investing is like you should

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.920
always be looking at the numbers like as

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:26.260
much as many numbers as you can now

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:28.930
like I'm super hesitant to invest in

01:07:28.930 --> 01:07:32.110
anything that I don't have access to the

01:07:32.110 --> 01:07:33.790
numbers does that make sense yeah like

01:07:33.790 --> 01:07:35.020
it's really hard to orient yourself

01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:37.090
what's also funny to do that you're

01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:38.770
saying I get you know a lot I think you

01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:40.360
know I didn't do it to you just like

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:43.000
look on to like an online forum for like

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.920
words that yo this one's good but in

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.270
reality it's like you should just be

01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:48.100
looking at funny you should you or

01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:49.540
someone who knows how to do it just look

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:51.730
at financial statements yeah exactly

01:07:51.730 --> 01:07:54.580
right like something it's like what

01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:55.690
Warren Buffett says he's like you should

01:07:55.690 --> 01:07:58.930
never invest in something unless you're

01:07:58.930 --> 01:08:00.520
able to write like a full page or a

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.200
paragraph about why you're investing in

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.480
it hmm and it can't be just because

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.280
Billy told me you know like that sort of

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.300
thing like that's not an acceptable

01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:10.300
answer okay so I'm gonna let's do a

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:12.100
little exercise here

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:15.660
did I share this with you I don't see it

01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:19.630
okay so I'm gonna high I'm gonna hide

01:08:19.630 --> 01:08:23.380
these columns and then you tell me which

01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:25.510
you would rather invest in to be a good

01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:32.860
exercise okay cool so there it is okay

01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:36.550
so let me move this over okay so you see

01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:39.520
this is just uh this is raw data right

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:42.580
that exported right mm-hmm investment

01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:45.850
detail exported from today or now as of

01:08:45.850 --> 01:08:49.930
229 2020 so you've got Year Zero right

01:08:49.930 --> 01:08:52.510
and then we pulled data all the way down

01:08:52.510 --> 01:08:56.230
through year 44 right mm-hm and then you

01:08:56.230 --> 01:08:58.060
actually have the date so this is not

01:08:58.060 --> 01:08:59.740
hypothetical projection this is what

01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:01.720
actually happened this is the real data

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:06.070
right so so you got August so the so we

01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:08.860
picked a comparable date right the

01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:10.780
earliest date for both of these assets

01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:13.390
that make sense so far this is one asset

01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:16.330
this is - so you actually have one data

01:09:16.330 --> 01:09:18.400
set right here right right and you've

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:21.010
got one data set right here similar

01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:23.380
period in period over yeah and for your

01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:25.030
listeners and washers this is - in the

01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:26.320
in the weeds detail but I thought this

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:26.739
would be help

01:09:26.739 --> 01:09:31.150
cool okay cool so here you have a new

01:09:31.150 --> 01:09:32.520
investment so how much is the new

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:34.870
100,000 bucks right hundred thousand

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:37.870
dollars done in August of 1976 right

01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:40.839
mm-hmm now you've got these both of

01:09:40.839 --> 01:09:43.779
these assets produce cash right

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:48.330
so both these assets produce cash now

01:09:48.330 --> 01:09:50.529
like real estate produces rental income

01:09:50.529 --> 01:09:52.600
but like this is producing cast this is

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:55.090
the actual cash that's distributed right

01:09:55.090 --> 01:09:57.310
mm-hmm and then over here is the quote

01:09:57.310 --> 01:09:59.350
market value does that make sense so you

01:09:59.350 --> 01:10:02.680
see column J and you see column you okay

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:04.810
that's what the stock is worth that's

01:10:04.810 --> 01:10:06.460
what you could have sold it for like you

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:07.780
said hey I want to I want to sell off

01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:10.780
everything right God so what what did

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:12.940
the what did this asset produce in cash

01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:14.590
versus what this asks that produce it

01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:16.750
produced in cash now I also ran the

01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:19.060
cumulative numbers here as well so

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:21.670
that's just adding up okay every time it

01:10:21.670 --> 01:10:23.590
paid cash I'm just calculating how much

01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:25.360
cash is that paid me historically does

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:28.030
that make sense yeah okay so for the

01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:29.830
first year for let's call it asset

01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:32.020
number one right here you invested a

01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:33.700
hundred thousand and it gave you one

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:36.489
thousand two hundred two and 26 cents

01:10:36.489 --> 01:10:38.739
right that was that was the cash that it

01:10:38.739 --> 01:10:40.450
gave you and by the end of that year is

01:10:40.450 --> 01:10:41.680
worth a hundred and five thousand

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:43.239
dollars right one hundred five thousand

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:45.670
three eighty two point two one similarly

01:10:45.670 --> 01:10:46.900
on this asset over here you paid a

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:48.370
hundred thousand dollars in the tow it

01:10:48.370 --> 01:10:49.840
actually did not give you any cash at

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:54.430
that point in time and and the market

01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:57.940
value is 102 607 right so now let's

01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:00.460
fast-forward so you can see right like

01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:02.260
the cumulative starts to you know add up

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:04.930
right let's fast-forward all the way

01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:06.610
down I'll actually let me do it like

01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:08.650
this so that way you guys can easily see

01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:10.900
it so let's freeze it and then we're

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:12.219
going to so you'll still be able to see

01:11:12.219 --> 01:11:16.510
all the title headers okay great so for

01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:19.330
asset number one which were absolutely

01:11:19.330 --> 01:11:24.760
so this is asset number one this is

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:27.820
asset number two

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:29.750
right just got asset number one for

01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:31.580
Sasson or two okay now all we did here

01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:34.639
was we summed up the total amount of

01:11:34.639 --> 01:11:38.150
money right the total reinvested so

01:11:38.150 --> 01:11:39.380
again assuming do not put in your pocket

01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:40.760
you just reinvest if you bought more of

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:43.040
it right we want to solve the total

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.510
amount of cash that was distributed and

01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:45.980
you reinvested so what does that number

01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:49.820
here the one that you owe this so this

01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:51.710
is the total amount you've reinvested

01:11:51.710 --> 01:11:53.659
into the staff yep

01:11:53.659 --> 01:11:55.880
well this this one but is a particular

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:59.300
it's a foe so this is how much money so

01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:01.429
you invested $100,000 originally and

01:12:01.429 --> 01:12:06.350
over so since what 1976 and then all the

01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:08.389
way up until February 2020 how much did

01:12:08.389 --> 01:12:11.239
you total reinvest oh Jesus like nine

01:12:11.239 --> 01:12:14.060
hundred no more than that like no no

01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:15.230
which is what's that number right there

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:18.590
Oh two million dollars and yeah two

01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:19.010
million

01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:21.860
so you invested $100,000 and you were

01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:24.139
able to reinvest two million that so it

01:12:24.139 --> 01:12:25.730
means it dispensed two million dollars

01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:27.920
worth of cash and you reinvested it yeah

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:29.810
now at any point in time let's just say

01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:32.389
for instance oh and by the way if you

01:12:32.389 --> 01:12:34.010
want to sell all the shares what could

01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:38.750
you have sold it for in the final so if

01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:39.800
you were to sell it would have an eight

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.870
million dollars yeah eight point nine

01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:44.659
million dollars right yeah so it's

01:12:44.659 --> 01:12:46.370
pretty well that's substantial now the

01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:48.260
cool thing is like in this type of asset

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:50.659
at any given year right this is where

01:12:50.659 --> 01:12:53.570
like theory meets real life and some

01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:54.980
people might not prefer this so it's

01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:56.989
like maybe you don't want this but for

01:12:56.989 --> 01:12:58.760
instance let's just say let's say you

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:00.170
were the one who invested this universe

01:13:00.170 --> 01:13:02.000
a hundred thousand dollars and in year

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.940
ten Oh for example like in year 10 you

01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:08.270
had a baby right yeah well you don't

01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:12.530
have to reinvest those dollars right you

01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:14.179
can say hey I don't I do not want to

01:13:14.179 --> 01:13:15.560
reinvest my dividends I want all my

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:17.210
dividends dispensed in cash for this

01:13:17.210 --> 01:13:19.639
year right hmm does that make sense

01:13:19.639 --> 01:13:22.760
access to that capital yeah so that goes

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:23.780
back to where you're saying earlier

01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:26.510
about like if you have you know a piece

01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:28.010
of art it's just you gotta sell that

01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:29.360
hole it's all or nothing pretty much

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:31.010
exactly exactly

01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:33.800
yes oh at any given like you can make

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.600
the decisions it puts the control more

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.040
in control on your right now I happen to

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.350
like that control maybe somebody would

01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:41.090
go in like buying an ass

01:13:41.090 --> 01:13:42.770
that we're just gonna increase in value

01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:44.270
and and one day they're gonna sell it

01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:46.489
for a higher price but to me there's a

01:13:46.489 --> 01:13:49.369
lot of utility like when life happens of

01:13:49.369 --> 01:13:51.199
knowing that my ass that's gonna be able

01:13:51.199 --> 01:13:53.780
to produce cash and I'm the one who

01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:55.460
makes the decision along that time

01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:56.989
horizon about whether or not I want to

01:13:56.989 --> 01:13:59.090
invest it right or put it in my pocket

01:13:59.090 --> 01:14:01.989
or pay off medical bills with it etc so

01:14:01.989 --> 01:14:04.670
the cool thing is so in this particular

01:14:04.670 --> 01:14:06.650
asset number one you invested $100,000

01:14:06.650 --> 01:14:10.159
and and and you go all the way down to

01:14:10.159 --> 01:14:13.369
you know to what 44 years and it gave it

01:14:13.369 --> 01:14:15.170
you reinvest the two million dollars at

01:14:15.170 --> 01:14:16.340
any given time you could have said no I

01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:17.510
don't want to take some of that cash I

01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:18.710
want to I want to put in my pockets that

01:14:18.710 --> 01:14:20.150
are like we just talked about and at the

01:14:20.150 --> 01:14:21.349
end of that if you just held it you can

01:14:21.349 --> 01:14:24.170
sell it for 8.9 I tend to think that's a

01:14:24.170 --> 01:14:26.840
really good deal yeah right like I tend

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:29.060
to think so now again we're developing a

01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:32.270
perspective this other asset asset

01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:34.460
number two we do the same exact thing

01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:36.469
right it's over the same exact time

01:14:36.469 --> 01:14:40.040
horizon right yeah that that's that's

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.119
how we ran the data it's like if you

01:14:41.119 --> 01:14:42.380
invested in both these things on the

01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:45.710
same exact day right mm-hmm

01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:46.880
what would you have gotten so a hundred

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.889
thousand dollars now we fast forward all

01:14:48.889 --> 01:14:51.139
the way down how much did you reinvest

01:14:51.139 --> 01:14:51.830
in this one

01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:54.349
damn fifteen basically sixteen million

01:14:54.349 --> 01:14:58.310
sixteen million dollars right what could

01:14:58.310 --> 01:15:01.820
you have sold it for twenty seven twenty

01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:05.330
eight million dollars yeah yeah right to

01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:06.980
get the point it's not that either one

01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:08.050
of these are bad but they're

01:15:08.050 --> 01:15:10.429
dramatically different true

01:15:10.429 --> 01:15:11.989
automatically different that's the thing

01:15:11.989 --> 01:15:13.429
too this is because you know I always go

01:15:13.429 --> 01:15:14.750
back to people who are like yeah well

01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:15.860
that's a hundred thousand dollars I'm

01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:17.300
gonna have even if you're only a teacher

01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:19.760
salary the only thing you have you know

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.590
and again granite you're not like 60

01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:23.150
years old if you're thirty twenty

01:15:23.150 --> 01:15:25.969
something you do have an abundance of

01:15:25.969 --> 01:15:29.420
time that you can use to set yourself up

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:31.340
you know way down the line does that

01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:31.760
make sense

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:34.820
oh do a hundred percent you time allows

01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:36.619
you to start doing this even if you only

01:15:36.619 --> 01:15:37.909
you know if you had started at five

01:15:37.909 --> 01:15:39.889
thousand and every year your it will

01:15:39.889 --> 01:15:41.510
still compound you might not have twenty

01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:43.429
seven million dollars but you'll have

01:15:43.429 --> 01:15:44.750
more than you would have had if you just

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:47.210
kind of jerked off and didn't do

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:49.369
anything at all oh yeah I mean that's

01:15:49.369 --> 01:15:51.170
the that's the thing is that you don't

01:15:51.170 --> 01:15:53.960
have to write like like I just ran a

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:55.099
hundred thousand because it's

01:15:55.099 --> 01:15:58.190
easy number they typically like it's one

01:15:58.190 --> 01:15:59.540
of the numbers that's run you know

01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:00.829
pretty frequently and like this type of

01:16:00.829 --> 01:16:03.020
analysis yeah but yeah I mean you can do

01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:04.280
it with a thousand dollars if you wanted

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.590
to ten thousand like these numbers it's

01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:08.780
just it's just percentages right so so

01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:10.340
it's gonna work in a very similar

01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:11.780
methodology I'll see if I can actually

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:13.280
find some data for you for like what do

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.570
you think of fair numbers I got like a

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:16.699
thousand ten thousand yeah I mean yeah I

01:16:16.699 --> 01:16:18.139
think ten thousand it was like again

01:16:18.139 --> 01:16:20.060
it's like if your the problem with this

01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:21.440
is that you'd a lot of people say like

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:23.360
yeah but I just need more money before I

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.369
can invest yeah but I need that one big

01:16:25.369 --> 01:16:27.409
kill and then I can start to invest it's

01:16:27.409 --> 01:16:30.380
like oh yeah man well do what I could

01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:32.230
say to those people as I came in like

01:16:32.230 --> 01:16:34.730
America one of the reasons America is

01:16:34.730 --> 01:16:37.940
awesome is that yeah you can start super

01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:39.949
small and like I'm saying that now is

01:16:39.949 --> 01:16:42.260
like yeah mitt like I got like I started

01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:43.790
with a couple hundred bucks right you

01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:45.619
know that's the cool thing man it's like

01:16:45.619 --> 01:16:48.139
this is it's a ladder it's not it's it's

01:16:48.139 --> 01:16:49.730
not like you got to jump so high to

01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:50.840
start with hundred thousand no I'm just

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.790
running this for you know just for you I

01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:55.130
think this the reason I think this kind

01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:57.260
of type of thing might kind of set stuff

01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:59.210
off on people and I could be wrong but

01:16:59.210 --> 01:17:00.440
it's like even like when I started like

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:02.260
planning my finances and all this stuff

01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:05.480
you see because like investing without a

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:07.610
goal is just like you know having money

01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:08.900
for the sake of money because someone

01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:10.099
told me you need a bunch of money when

01:17:10.099 --> 01:17:11.929
you're old which is you know I think

01:17:11.929 --> 01:17:13.940
ninety percent of people is why they do

01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:15.199
it like I was told I need a bunch of

01:17:15.199 --> 01:17:16.250
money when I'm old I'm gonna put

01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:17.329
something this fund and not think about

01:17:17.329 --> 01:17:20.570
it but what you're doing is like say

01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:22.639
what you want to do and then you'll see

01:17:22.639 --> 01:17:24.440
the dollar amount necessary to do that

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.150
and then the problem is it puts the onus

01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:29.300
on you the person to go get these funds

01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:31.099
which you know is like [ __ ] I got it you

01:17:31.099 --> 01:17:33.170
know I see the numbers I want to have a

01:17:33.170 --> 01:17:34.880
fat little nest egg when I'm older I

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:36.679
better go start drumming up some money

01:17:36.679 --> 01:17:38.179
and even if you're just at a single job

01:17:38.179 --> 01:17:40.670
it's like well then stop [ __ ] off you

01:17:40.670 --> 01:17:41.000
know

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.860
don't be hungover it'll be [ __ ] up the

01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:44.420
next day if they're not paying you right

01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:46.099
go to another job that'll pay you you

01:17:46.099 --> 01:17:47.300
know and if you can't you can't you're

01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:48.500
just [ __ ] is everything works for

01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:51.020
everybody but it's like it kind of this

01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:53.510
kind of stuff asks for something from

01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:55.130
the individual rather than like sitting

01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:56.420
around a candlestick chart and being

01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:58.340
like BAM sold this got this BAM I'm the

01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:01.310
man but in reality it's like if you keep

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:02.869
going to the crap table bro you're going

01:18:02.869 --> 01:18:03.800
to get you're going to get you're gonna

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:07.099
lose yeah man and I don't good for you

01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:09.060
that's awesome I just I will [ __ ]

01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:10.350
because I've gambled before and I always

01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:13.800
[ __ ] lose right yeah and that's the

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:15.900
thing man it's like uh we want to talk

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:19.110
to people who who it's like who fit

01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:21.240
within if within your scope of like of

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:23.460
your strategy we're like you know yeah

01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:25.230
like if you want to go and do whatever

01:18:25.230 --> 01:18:27.720
sell our to flip gold like do it like

01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:30.030
you know more power to you

01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:31.320
but I'd hate for people listening this

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:32.970
thing like all I need 100 grants like no

01:18:32.970 --> 01:18:34.920
man first of all the number one ask that

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:36.420
you have is actually you it's like it

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:37.980
and I know it sounds cheesy but it's

01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:40.230
it's your ability to earn by because

01:18:40.230 --> 01:18:42.780
humans can become so unbelievably

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:44.880
productive you know it's like you know

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:46.710
and you have a similar story my like I I

01:18:46.710 --> 01:18:49.170
was a janitor at one point and no hate

01:18:49.170 --> 01:18:51.210
on janitors like I was one right you

01:18:51.210 --> 01:18:52.830
know I was a caddy at another point that

01:18:52.830 --> 01:18:55.350
guy I've washed dishes for jobs like you

01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:57.030
know and I'm not bragging I'm saying

01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:59.580
it's like America were so fortunate and

01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:00.690
a lot of other developed countries that

01:19:00.690 --> 01:19:02.520
were so forced to be able fortunate to

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:05.910
be able to our earnings is is o is

01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:09.000
virtually limitless and I know that

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.530
sounds like some sort of corner is sort

01:19:10.530 --> 01:19:11.970
of like corny infomercial but it's just

01:19:11.970 --> 01:19:14.430
true we're like you know it's just it's

01:19:14.430 --> 01:19:16.800
crazy how much we can actually earn um

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:19.320
but over the long run like you were what

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:21.810
you earn is a result of how much value

01:19:21.810 --> 01:19:23.910
you give to others are there anomalies

01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:25.410
of course there are like are there

01:19:25.410 --> 01:19:27.210
people who win the lottery of course but

01:19:27.210 --> 01:19:29.190
like you can't build a plan off of that

01:19:29.190 --> 01:19:31.860
so Matt to your point it's like say what

01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:33.330
you want and then come up with a very

01:19:33.330 --> 01:19:35.790
rational plan of getting there and just

01:19:35.790 --> 01:19:37.590
try not to follow the hype and also like

01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:40.020
try not to get caught up in so much my

01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:41.280
new show where it keeps you from

01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:44.520
actually acting like it's it's just

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:45.750
great like the amount of people that

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:47.070
want to sit there and it's like oh well

01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:48.750
no this is like yeah but what if you do

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:50.700
it this way it's like no man just go to

01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:53.730
the gym for like please don't be like

01:19:53.730 --> 01:19:55.650
you're probably much better off like not

01:19:55.650 --> 01:19:57.990
debating on what type of like cable fly

01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:59.820
you should be doing versus like going to

01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:01.710
the gym like just or start doing

01:20:01.710 --> 01:20:04.200
push-ups like don't tell me about some

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:06.210
like crazy workout that you heard and

01:20:06.210 --> 01:20:08.280
like some like Instagram post that's

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.260
supposed to like you know if you if you

01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:11.970
do it for 10 minutes you're jacked like

01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:13.530
no it's like that's not true

01:20:13.530 --> 01:20:15.090
right and like let's not let's stop

01:20:15.090 --> 01:20:16.950
pretending like it's true and just go do

01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:18.990
the fundamentals and along them along

01:20:18.990 --> 01:20:20.730
the way maybe you maybe you learn about

01:20:20.730 --> 01:20:21.310
different fun

01:20:21.310 --> 01:20:24.460
that's great but like but get started

01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:26.010
right and then come up with your own

01:20:26.010 --> 01:20:29.020
opinion and and if that matches mine or

01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:30.160
matches yours or matches something

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:32.140
else's then great but do it like go and

01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:35.200
actually do it so I might put up some

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:36.730
some data for you I don't know if this

01:20:36.730 --> 01:20:41.290
will help but let's say here so I pulled

01:20:41.290 --> 01:20:42.700
up the ten thousand dollar number your

01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:44.050
phrase is that you think that's more

01:20:44.050 --> 01:20:45.820
helpful yeah I think ten thousand is you

01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:47.560
know just to give a view is that that's

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:48.790
something attainable and again if you're

01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:50.350
like putting ten thousand it's like well

01:20:50.350 --> 01:20:52.300
maybe you should just start saving money

01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:54.460
to get your family out of poverty now if

01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:55.360
that's a that's like a

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.950
multi-generational process to get your

01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:59.080
family out of poverty most times if you

01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:01.180
are just limited to like say you're

01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:03.870
saying a janitor salary you can still

01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:07.110
figure out how to save some money and

01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:09.550
local oh yeah just buying a [ __ ]

01:21:09.550 --> 01:21:11.290
house and establishing headquarters for

01:21:11.290 --> 01:21:13.180
your future generation you [ __ ] did

01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:13.660
it dude

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:18.130
that's a big deal yeah yeah I mean I I

01:21:18.130 --> 01:21:20.470
completely agree with you it's like if

01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:22.900
that's you like I was also there right

01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:25.210
like like and and so and by the way like

01:21:25.210 --> 01:21:26.860
matt has an incredible story as well

01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:30.220
it's it's that's a good thing right like

01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:31.930
I just talk I just talked to somebody we

01:21:31.930 --> 01:21:34.810
went out to lunch yesterday and and his

01:21:34.810 --> 01:21:36.730
this guy is 60 years old and he's got a

01:21:36.730 --> 01:21:39.330
father-in-law who's 94 I believe and

01:21:39.330 --> 01:21:44.890
this guy is from Iran and he his dad

01:21:44.890 --> 01:21:47.290
died when he was three and so that by

01:21:47.290 --> 01:21:49.990
the age of 10 he had to support his

01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:54.040
mother and his uncle financially right

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:57.300
so fast forward would you say now

01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:59.170
exactly right like how do you do that so

01:21:59.170 --> 01:22:00.400
I think it was like you know he started

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:01.780
like selling bread or something like

01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:02.980
like working for the local bread shop

01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:05.250
like just an amazing story like

01:22:05.250 --> 01:22:07.810
unbelievable story like he he ended up

01:22:07.810 --> 01:22:10.750
becoming an attorney and he grad he had

01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:12.790
to graduate college early right because

01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:13.900
like it wasn't about like getting

01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:15.130
certificate for him it was like how do I

01:22:15.130 --> 01:22:16.480
keep on earning more money for his

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:19.930
family so back then in Iran he graduate

01:22:19.930 --> 01:22:22.660
early at 21 after law school you had to

01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:25.810
be 24 to be a practicing attorney he had

01:22:25.810 --> 01:22:28.480
to he had to create a birth certificate

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:31.360
that lied about his age right to become

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:33.670
an attorney that's pretty wild like if

01:22:33.670 --> 01:22:35.060
you think about it that's awesome

01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:36.860
like you know he had to do what he had

01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:39.230
to do to hustle to build up equity for

01:22:39.230 --> 01:22:40.910
his family right to build up funds for

01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:43.340
his family and now you know this guy was

01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:44.630
telling it's actually close friend of

01:22:44.630 --> 01:22:47.390
mine and this is his father-in-law he

01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:48.550
said he's the most successful

01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:50.720
intelligent and kind and humble man

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:53.210
you'll ever meet in your life so it's

01:22:53.210 --> 01:22:54.740
like if that's you if that person that

01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:56.510
you're talking about Matt is like if one

01:22:56.510 --> 01:22:58.280
of you is listening then that's awesome

01:22:58.280 --> 01:22:59.810
like I would actually recommend stop

01:22:59.810 --> 01:23:01.100
debating like this little my new show

01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:02.900
like get out there and work your ass off

01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:04.370
and like go and produce for your family

01:23:04.370 --> 01:23:06.350
and you will be you will be wealthy

01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:08.540
beyond like what you ever could while to

01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:11.180
conceive because you actually are lucky

01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:13.100
just like I was lucky like like you're

01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:14.750
lucky if you have to push against

01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:17.120
something so hard that it makes you

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:19.430
become better right like that's that's

01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:21.670
an it's an awesome life circumstance so

01:23:21.670 --> 01:23:23.840
owning it for those of you who are in

01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:25.520
that category like go and work your face

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:28.190
off and I would say like don't start

01:23:28.190 --> 01:23:30.650
like investing in other assets be other

01:23:30.650 --> 01:23:33.020
than yourself right for the first little

01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:34.430
while where you can get your feet on the

01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:36.230
ground you know and like Matt you and I

01:23:36.230 --> 01:23:38.780
both know somebody who who kind of fits

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:40.520
this mold it's like you know yeah you

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:42.020
might have to live hand-to-mouth for a

01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:44.120
while right in like every dollar that

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:45.860
you make like you every pay make you got

01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:47.630
a save it and like you got to buy you

01:23:47.630 --> 01:23:49.370
know maybe if you're a carpenter like

01:23:49.370 --> 01:23:50.600
you might have to buy another hammer

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:52.010
like yeah keep on doing it because that

01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:53.990
that's an asset right to a carpenter

01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:55.610
hammers an asset so this is this so I

01:23:55.610 --> 01:23:57.200
was saying like we have to take a step

01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:59.600
back it's not like it's not like we're

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.010
saying oh this is the the holy grail

01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:02.330
it's like no depending on where you're

01:24:02.330 --> 01:24:03.590
at in life and what the goal is like

01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:05.890
assets can be different things so anyway

01:24:05.890 --> 01:24:07.820
let's just say for those people who only

01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:09.770
have like let 10,000 or one thing I just

01:24:09.770 --> 01:24:12.680
ran the numbers at I had the data so

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:13.730
it's the same deal right you've got

01:24:13.730 --> 01:24:16.250
portfolio a which we were calling before

01:24:16.250 --> 01:24:17.690
we're calling portfolio portfolio or

01:24:17.690 --> 01:24:19.580
asset number one India you invested

01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:21.350
$10,000 and then what are you left with

01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:24.530
you you reinvested so in let me rephrase

01:24:24.530 --> 01:24:26.890
this you did not put in any extra cash

01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:29.510
like you only put in $10,000 at one

01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:32.570
point right mm-hmm and it reinvested for

01:24:32.570 --> 01:24:35.180
you right the asset itself produced cash

01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:38.180
and bought more of it right for you so

01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:41.080
it reinvested two hundred five thousand

01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:43.190
right there that's only half of a

01:24:43.190 --> 01:24:45.170
$10,000 investment now it's at the end

01:24:45.170 --> 01:24:48.290
your time span I would say that a fifty

01:24:48.290 --> 01:24:48.700
year

01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:51.760
I think it's 44 okay I'm sorry that was

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:54.610
19 okay cool so let's just say your zero

01:24:54.610 --> 01:24:55.990
yeah you're right

01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:58.270
so I'll give you the x here so let's say

01:24:58.270 --> 01:25:02.920
years zero was August of 1976 and you

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:05.170
take it all the way down to February

01:25:05.170 --> 01:25:07.180
2020 so you got 44 time periods there

01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:10.750
right so at the end now again along the

01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:12.520
way if you have anything happen like

01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:14.350
you've got to pay for bills etc you can

01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:15.850
say hey I don't want to reinvest my cash

01:25:15.850 --> 01:25:17.770
it my cash flow from this I want to take

01:25:17.770 --> 01:25:21.310
it out and put in my back right so it

01:25:21.310 --> 01:25:23.770
gives you that utility now let's say you

01:25:23.770 --> 01:25:25.090
didn't do that and you just want to sell

01:25:25.090 --> 01:25:26.800
everything at the end of at the end of

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:28.480
the time right and so what what Matt

01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:30.730
what's that number so yeah like

01:25:30.730 --> 01:25:31.990
basically nine hundred thousand bucks

01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:33.610
yeah nine hundred thousand now again

01:25:33.610 --> 01:25:35.890
this is also kind of more theory because

01:25:35.890 --> 01:25:37.690
it's like no chances are if you invest

01:25:37.690 --> 01:25:39.430
ten thousand dollars in year 0 you're

01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:41.110
gonna keep on investing more every

01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:42.910
single year you're absolutely right so

01:25:42.910 --> 01:25:44.410
if I ran these numbers at ten thousand

01:25:44.410 --> 01:25:46.180
dollars every single year it'd be much

01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:47.650
more dramatic than even the hundred

01:25:47.650 --> 01:25:48.550
thousand number that I showed you

01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:51.820
earlier right left so so now so you

01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:53.260
could do that right that's this is one

01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:54.940
asset that's great like I that's a

01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:56.530
that's a great way of doing it there's

01:25:56.530 --> 01:25:58.420
there's are phenomenal results I would

01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:01.080
argue way better than gold right hmm now

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:04.180
um now if you do that same thing so ten

01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:06.730
thousand dollars only in in portfolio B

01:26:06.730 --> 01:26:09.570
right what would you have reinvested

01:26:09.570 --> 01:26:14.320
seven so seven hundred eighty-two

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:16.270
thousand dollars so would you rather

01:26:16.270 --> 01:26:18.130
reinvested seven hundred eighty-two

01:26:18.130 --> 01:26:21.010
thousand or two hundred and five yeah

01:26:21.010 --> 01:26:24.040
right and in portfolio a you could have

01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:25.330
sold portfolio a for eight hundred

01:26:25.330 --> 01:26:27.940
ninety seven thousand or if you did if

01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:29.410
you the same investment if you had

01:26:29.410 --> 01:26:30.910
portfolio B what could you have sold it

01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:34.870
for damn 1.1 right so like you know now

01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:39.220
again sorry I think it was so you know I

01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:40.540
was in the labor union for just a couple

01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:41.890
years but I remember I'd always talk

01:26:41.890 --> 01:26:43.240
about people their pension the pension

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:44.980
is these guys at work like 30 [ __ ]

01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:47.110
years out in the elements and be like

01:26:47.110 --> 01:26:48.760
you know when I get done I'm gonna have

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:50.050
like four hundred thousand three hundred

01:26:50.050 --> 01:26:52.570
thousand dollars waiting for me hmm what

01:26:52.570 --> 01:26:54.550
it means so it's like their work they're

01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:57.250
like working as hard as you possibly can

01:26:57.250 --> 01:26:58.540
I think you know unless you're just kind

01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:00.010
of even he was sweeping a floor all day

01:27:00.010 --> 01:27:01.030
it's kind of poor man

01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:04.690
yep you know I remember guys saying like

01:27:04.690 --> 01:27:06.489
I'm about to have $300,000 when I get

01:27:06.489 --> 01:27:07.630
out of here and it's like that's what's

01:27:07.630 --> 01:27:09.849
up dude but like you know and they're

01:27:09.849 --> 01:27:11.619
just giving their money over to the fund

01:27:11.619 --> 01:27:13.630
manager of the Union who you know does

01:27:13.630 --> 01:27:15.159
all kinds of things but in reality they

01:27:15.159 --> 01:27:17.110
could invest their own money you know

01:27:17.110 --> 01:27:19.239
and probably done better I don't know

01:27:19.239 --> 01:27:20.260
you know I'm not gonna tell people to

01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:21.190
like pull their pensions out of the

01:27:21.190 --> 01:27:23.559
Union no way but still you know this is

01:27:23.559 --> 01:27:24.789
not a big deal like you know like oh

01:27:24.789 --> 01:27:26.170
we're gonna 10,000 bucks for them it's

01:27:26.170 --> 01:27:27.670
like well dude every person in Union

01:27:27.670 --> 01:27:30.130
works every day as hard as they can or

01:27:30.130 --> 01:27:31.989
you know we're intellectual you just sit

01:27:31.989 --> 01:27:33.190
on a [ __ ] can all day and do nothing

01:27:33.190 --> 01:27:37.030
but the so it's like you know people

01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:38.530
will work 30 years and then if you're

01:27:38.530 --> 01:27:40.599
like I'm gonna give you $200,000 at the

01:27:40.599 --> 01:27:42.159
end of 30 years or whatever I could be

01:27:42.159 --> 01:27:43.510
in the numbers wrong but I remember that

01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:45.960
being something like that yeah that

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:47.889
seems fine but if that's like we'll

01:27:47.889 --> 01:27:49.329
invest it they're like whoa man man

01:27:49.329 --> 01:27:52.239
that's crazy yeah that's I completely

01:27:52.239 --> 01:27:55.000
agree so now now my answer would be do

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.510
both he exactly yeah yeah exactly can

01:27:58.510 --> 01:28:00.340
afford it right like you know that's the

01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:02.139
cool thing is that is that we can now

01:28:02.139 --> 01:28:03.610
take capital and get that's not to be a

01:28:03.610 --> 01:28:05.409
stock market doesn't have to be doesn't

01:28:05.409 --> 01:28:07.239
have to be real estate whatever right

01:28:07.239 --> 01:28:09.760
it's like go and do your own analysis do

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:12.280
your own research and then and then if

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:14.110
you have any money to invest if you

01:28:14.110 --> 01:28:15.969
don't have money to invest then go and

01:28:15.969 --> 01:28:18.070
work so you have you you can eventually

01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:19.780
like reduce your expenses much possible

01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:22.659
and go out there and work you know and

01:28:22.659 --> 01:28:23.920
and by the way I'm saying it's not not

01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:25.780
for my benefit like you know for the

01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:27.250
listeners like you know do it like we

01:28:27.250 --> 01:28:28.989
have such an opportunity like the amount

01:28:28.989 --> 01:28:31.059
of people that would just kill to have

01:28:31.059 --> 01:28:32.800
the opportunity we have here in America

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:35.199
it's crazy and it's just insane like we

01:28:35.199 --> 01:28:37.840
were so blessed and fortunate to be born

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.550
at the time we're born I think the

01:28:39.550 --> 01:28:40.929
probability of living in United States

01:28:40.929 --> 01:28:45.309
are being born is 4% like you know we've

01:28:45.309 --> 01:28:47.800
been given such a strong hand like we

01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:50.889
have to do relatively very little and to

01:28:50.889 --> 01:28:52.539
make ourselves successful now does it

01:28:52.539 --> 01:28:55.179
take time yes it takes time right like

01:28:55.179 --> 01:28:56.920
of course it's going to take time but

01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:59.980
guess what anything worth it does hmm

01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:02.500
you know so so yeah like maybe you don't

01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:03.699
have a hundred thousand maybe you've got

01:29:03.699 --> 01:29:05.139
ten thousand maybe only got 100 right

01:29:05.139 --> 01:29:07.210
you can build on top of that but the

01:29:07.210 --> 01:29:10.690
cool thing is man like you know we can

01:29:10.690 --> 01:29:12.550
research this ourselves like and if you

01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:14.170
don't know all the stuff for time I like

01:29:14.170 --> 01:29:14.890
go and read it like

01:29:14.890 --> 01:29:15.840
the book that I was talking about before

01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:17.740
and then develop your own philosophy

01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:19.420
maybe you say like hey this guy is just

01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:21.670
crazy but he's just not like I'm gonna I

01:29:21.670 --> 01:29:23.800
I do want you know gold or I do want

01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:26.050
Bitcoin I do want one whatever it

01:29:26.050 --> 01:29:26.530
doesn't matter

01:29:26.530 --> 01:29:28.690
right like go go and do it and as long

01:29:28.690 --> 01:29:30.160
as you're doing it for the benefit of

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:32.860
you and your family then hell yeah do it

01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:33.970
what if you're doing if you just want to

01:29:33.970 --> 01:29:35.350
have a debate for the sake of a debate

01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:37.590
right like you know my only fear is that

01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:41.950
when that happens for the people who who

01:29:41.950 --> 01:29:45.220
are well intentioned and they actually

01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:47.440
want to make progress but then somebody

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:49.240
throws them the this thing and it

01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:50.380
confuses them do you know what I mean

01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:52.270
it's confuse them so those people

01:29:52.270 --> 01:29:53.800
actually are well-intentioned who like

01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:55.270
want to lose weight but then all of a

01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:57.760
sudden they saw uh they saw a commercial

01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:00.250
that said no just take this pill cuz Kim

01:30:00.250 --> 01:30:02.050
Kardashian took it you know it's like

01:30:02.050 --> 01:30:04.990
those people who are well-intentioned be

01:30:04.990 --> 01:30:07.390
led astray off of the fundamentals

01:30:07.390 --> 01:30:09.880
because you know because Kim Kardashian

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:12.220
you know obviously making it up but

01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:13.840
right you know how the sponsorship and

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:15.580
now that there are the ones who are left

01:30:15.580 --> 01:30:17.800
like in this weird purgatory and that's

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:20.230
who I'm speaking to now it's like go and

01:30:20.230 --> 01:30:21.580
develop your own philosophy like

01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:22.810
consider what I'm saying consider what a

01:30:22.810 --> 01:30:24.250
lot of people are saying sure but like

01:30:24.250 --> 01:30:26.710
be careful to like be left in this

01:30:26.710 --> 01:30:28.510
purgatory just because a lot of people

01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:30.460
like to debate my new show yeah it mean

01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:32.830
it's like the you know the weirder like

01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:34.000
you're saying you're people you know if

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.080
someone who's out here like I'm trying

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:36.760
to figure out what I want to do and you

01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:39.540
have to kind of wade through this like

01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:42.820
the sea of like passive online criticism

01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:44.710
that's just like they say like if people

01:30:44.710 --> 01:30:48.130
just for some sort of a [ __ ] man I can't

01:30:48.130 --> 01:30:49.270
think of the word cuz I'm on like

01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:50.770
record-breaking levels of sleep

01:30:50.770 --> 01:30:52.540
deprivation I'm sure you are man but

01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:54.280
it's like yeah it's like a catharsis of

01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:55.990
just letting out negative emotion online

01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:57.130
it has nothing to do with what you're

01:30:57.130 --> 01:30:58.690
talking about subject wise it's more or

01:30:58.690 --> 01:31:01.000
less like [ __ ] that yeah that's [ __ ]

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.950
dumb I'd [ __ ] this and it's like yeah

01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:04.900
that bleeds out on I'm like obsessed

01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:06.130
with it I don't want to be a crybaby

01:31:06.130 --> 01:31:08.740
about online comments but like because I

01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:10.390
used to be the biggest [ __ ] of

01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:11.650
all on YouTube I would have seen

01:31:11.650 --> 01:31:13.660
anything and I'd be like [ __ ] I would

01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:15.250
have say something to piss them off and

01:31:15.250 --> 01:31:17.020
it's like I was miserable that's the

01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:18.340
thing I was a miserable person at that

01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:19.960
point in my life and you know and that's

01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:21.700
fine and honestly a lot of times that is

01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:24.190
funny so you know might like moralizing

01:31:24.190 --> 01:31:26.740
or chastising but it is like if you're

01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:28.180
trying to do something and you know

01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:29.410
you're getting kind of lost and that

01:31:29.410 --> 01:31:30.520
like that you know like if you have

01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:32.020
water and people are just injecting ink

01:31:32.020 --> 01:31:33.820
into the water it's like what the [ __ ]

01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:35.800
going on because you know you can rely

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:37.630
on that it's like a beacon to be like is

01:31:37.630 --> 01:31:39.220
what I'm doing a good thing and people

01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:40.600
like yeah it's awesome that people like

01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:42.640
[ __ ] you you're like [ __ ] what's that

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:45.070
about right could be right you could be

01:31:45.070 --> 01:31:46.720
deserving a big [ __ ] you or it's like

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:48.520
you know you gotta really choose between

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:50.740
like especially now our problem is we

01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:52.090
have too much information now it's not

01:31:52.090 --> 01:31:54.490
like we're before the Gutenberg printing

01:31:54.490 --> 01:31:56.560
press people are largely ignorant

01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:58.180
we're flooded with information to the

01:31:58.180 --> 01:32:00.130
point where it can be paralyzing oh yeah

01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:01.660
I like you know this is why you know I

01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:04.030
saw that one thing pop up and it's like

01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:05.620
you know this is the difference between

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:07.660
here's a paragraph on reddit where

01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:09.370
people use a couple technical terms and

01:32:09.370 --> 01:32:10.990
jargon and here and now here's a

01:32:10.990 --> 01:32:12.700
three-hour explanation and are you gonna

01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:13.900
watch three hours or read a paragraph

01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:15.640
it's like and again like you said this

01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:17.230
isn't like a prescription for you know

01:32:17.230 --> 01:32:18.640
this is what you need to do it's like

01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.620
here's one option that's been well

01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:22.810
researched by a person who actually does

01:32:22.810 --> 01:32:25.330
it rather than just some [ __ ] written

01:32:25.330 --> 01:32:28.270
somewhere yeah I mean look we'll look at

01:32:28.270 --> 01:32:30.610
the data I want to go back to the

01:32:30.610 --> 01:32:32.530
hundred thousand just because it's it's

01:32:32.530 --> 01:32:34.090
an example I've got some highlights here

01:32:34.090 --> 01:32:36.430
etc Yeah right like just so you know

01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:38.710
like so right here and then I want to

01:32:38.710 --> 01:32:40.240
get into like naming this stuff and it's

01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:42.370
all literally because like my licenses

01:32:42.370 --> 01:32:43.930
will not allow me to go off it like

01:32:43.930 --> 01:32:45.400
literally if I say like the name of a

01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:47.170
company I'm at risk for saying like oh

01:32:47.170 --> 01:32:48.250
you recommend that's why I make all

01:32:48.250 --> 01:32:50.380
these like very annoying disclosures but

01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:51.970
we can generally talk about the sp500

01:32:51.970 --> 01:32:53.470
market because that's used as a

01:32:53.470 --> 01:32:55.750
benchmark so often times like so for

01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:58.360
listeners it's important to know when a

01:32:58.360 --> 01:32:59.380
lot of people talk about the market

01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:01.150
they'll say like the S&P 500 index right

01:33:01.150 --> 01:33:02.710
like that's because that's a it's a it's

01:33:02.710 --> 01:33:05.740
basically a pool of of the largest

01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:07.450
companies in the stock market so it's

01:33:07.450 --> 01:33:09.190
500 companies let you say so that's it

01:33:09.190 --> 01:33:11.020
it's a very brief description but that's

01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:12.340
what they're oriented that that's what

01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:15.940
it means so okay so great this asset

01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:17.830
right here that's number one is the S&P

01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:20.860
500 index right like that's a great like

01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:21.970
you could definitely do that you put a

01:33:21.970 --> 01:33:23.710
hundred thousand in here like in Year

01:33:23.710 --> 01:33:26.590
Zero and then you you you reinvested two

01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:28.600
million dollars buy after 44 years and

01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:30.070
you could have sold it for 8.9 million

01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:31.750
dollars now some people might say that's

01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:33.850
a small amount I personally don't think

01:33:33.850 --> 01:33:36.160
that's a small amount but I like it like

01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:37.210
for what you got I think that's

01:33:37.210 --> 01:33:38.710
incredible now maybe somebody would say

01:33:38.710 --> 01:33:41.260
well yeah but you know I invested in you

01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:41.679
know

01:33:41.679 --> 01:33:43.630
some company that you know it doesn't

01:33:43.630 --> 01:33:44.860
pay dividends and look at what it's

01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:45.850
worth now and yeah you could find

01:33:45.850 --> 01:33:47.830
examples of that for sure but the other

01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:49.659
thing is like there's also a lot of

01:33:49.659 --> 01:33:50.650
companies that you might not be

01:33:50.650 --> 01:33:52.330
considering it's called survivor bias

01:33:52.330 --> 01:33:54.010
right like you know like yeah you can

01:33:54.010 --> 01:33:55.330
point out the one or two companies that

01:33:55.330 --> 01:33:56.440
just like shot it through the roof and

01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:58.510
maybe they didn't pay dividends etc and

01:33:58.510 --> 01:34:00.460
it's worth like a bajillion now but

01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:02.350
there was 5,000 other companies that

01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:03.280
tried that same thing that you don't

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:05.890
know of now cuz they they died so again

01:34:05.890 --> 01:34:07.120
I'm not saying that this is like the

01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:08.230
Holy Grail like you pick and choose

01:34:08.230 --> 01:34:09.429
whatever but I think it's important you

01:34:09.429 --> 01:34:12.190
look at the data so you know so for here

01:34:12.190 --> 01:34:14.199
it's like yeah you can you can do that

01:34:14.199 --> 01:34:15.909
hundred thousand dollars and you invest

01:34:15.909 --> 01:34:17.380
in the S&P 500 index and you would have

01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:18.940
reinvested two million you could have

01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:20.890
sold it for 8.9 at the very end of that

01:34:20.890 --> 01:34:23.199
or you can take that same hundred

01:34:23.199 --> 01:34:24.820
thousand dollars and you invest in this

01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:27.670
and like this asset number two and you

01:34:27.670 --> 01:34:29.980
would have it reinvested 15 almost 16

01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:32.050
million dollars and it'd be worth almost

01:34:32.050 --> 01:34:34.360
twenty-eight million dollars right like

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.400
this is not hypothesis like this is this

01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:38.260
is actual data downloaded from like

01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:40.480
financial websites like this is I'm not

01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:41.320
a wizard

01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:43.179
I'm not using wizardry to create these

01:34:43.179 --> 01:34:44.620
numbers that this is actually what

01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:46.900
happened yeah this is not hypothesis so

01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:49.120
it's like sure like now either one of

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:51.760
these is fine right like and gold is

01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:53.500
fine I personally would never invest in

01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:54.909
gold and honestly I would invest in

01:34:54.909 --> 01:34:56.830
either one of these two or like you know

01:34:56.830 --> 01:34:58.449
so that's where I'm saying like are we

01:34:58.449 --> 01:34:59.860
getting into the minutiae like I just

01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:01.750
I'm just telling your listeners like go

01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:03.760
out there like make yourself awesome if

01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:05.980
you have extra capital like go invest

01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:07.989
like like start to learn the process but

01:35:07.989 --> 01:35:09.460
make sure you're doing it in a

01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:11.380
fundamental way like read this book that

01:35:11.380 --> 01:35:13.150
I'm telling you stocks for the long run

01:35:13.150 --> 01:35:15.130
is one of the best financial books about

01:35:15.130 --> 01:35:17.320
investing that you could read and if you

01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:19.750
like wanna see even more of a detail on

01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:22.090
this like if you buy the book and I'm

01:35:22.090 --> 01:35:24.310
talking bout the fifth edition and it's

01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:26.890
the actual physical hardcopy book if you

01:35:26.890 --> 01:35:28.750
if you have that book and buy it you go

01:35:28.750 --> 01:35:32.770
to chapter 12 and it outlines in detail

01:35:32.770 --> 01:35:34.600
the chapter is called outperforming the

01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:36.670
market the importance of size dividend

01:35:36.670 --> 01:35:38.800
yields and price earning ratio and just

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:40.090
read that read that chapter it's

01:35:40.090 --> 01:35:43.360
phenomenal now something I also want to

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:45.670
say is like there's a very interesting

01:35:45.670 --> 01:35:47.590
debate around like you know in the

01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:49.630
finance world of like oh do you do you

01:35:49.630 --> 01:35:51.159
like how do you outperform the market I

01:35:51.159 --> 01:35:52.449
actually think it's the wrong it's the

01:35:52.449 --> 01:35:53.920
wrong discussion have like so when they

01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:55.270
say the market like the

01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:56.650
saying okay well if I invest in the

01:35:56.650 --> 01:35:58.630
sp500 versus other assets whether it be

01:35:58.630 --> 01:36:00.130
mutual funds or individual stocks or

01:36:00.130 --> 01:36:03.160
ETFs etc my answer is like again that's

01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:04.810
splitting hairs did like that's gonna

01:36:04.810 --> 01:36:06.160
that's gonna get somebody who's trying

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:07.300
to learn this world and is gonna get

01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:09.370
them to hesitate maybe cuz it's that

01:36:09.370 --> 01:36:10.630
whole quote of like it's hard to be

01:36:10.630 --> 01:36:12.250
aggressive and fast when you're confused

01:36:12.250 --> 01:36:14.530
so it's like no like get started like go

01:36:14.530 --> 01:36:16.270
invest in has to be like if that's the

01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:18.370
decision make do it like go and freakin

01:36:18.370 --> 01:36:21.910
do it but know the numbers behind it so

01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:23.080
if you actually look at the data like

01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:25.420
most investors who invest are actually

01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:26.920
underperforming the market even if they

01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:28.930
own like the city S&P why it's because

01:36:28.930 --> 01:36:30.700
they get in this really weird purgatory

01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:33.070
like though though they'll go in and

01:36:33.070 --> 01:36:34.600
then they'll sell like at the wrong time

01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:35.980
and they treat it as this thing it's

01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:38.650
like no like if you're gonna do it stick

01:36:38.650 --> 01:36:39.910
with it for a certain period of time so

01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:41.650
you actually get to learn the full

01:36:41.650 --> 01:36:43.480
connective tissue inside of that

01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:45.880
mechanism but just please make sure that

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:49.870
before you do that like my vote is you

01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:51.700
know you learn about fundamentals like

01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:54.430
I'm not making a call on Bitcoin I'm not

01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:56.860
making a call on like like you said like

01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:58.510
technical analysis trading when earlier

01:36:58.510 --> 01:36:59.260
Matt when you talk about like

01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:00.730
candlesticks and so on Candlestick

01:37:00.730 --> 01:37:04.600
charts like I I wouldn't do that myself

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:06.400
right like there's certain wind if you

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:08.500
have a weird gut feeling about something

01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:10.690
right whether it be in weight loss or

01:37:10.690 --> 01:37:12.490
health and fitness or investing or

01:37:12.490 --> 01:37:13.090
whatever

01:37:13.090 --> 01:37:16.120
typically your guts right do you know

01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:17.800
what I mean it's like I read this book

01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:19.570
and yeah there's some followers on it

01:37:19.570 --> 01:37:21.340
but like they're saying like if I just

01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:23.230
read these charts I can put in five

01:37:23.230 --> 01:37:25.030
dollars and I make a million next year

01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:26.920
it's like I don't really know man like

01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:29.500
if something's off in your belly usually

01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:31.990
it's for a reason yeah I've tried almost

01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:33.580
every form you know not every but I've

01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:35.530
tried many let's say I spent a

01:37:35.530 --> 01:37:37.270
significant amount of time chasing fast

01:37:37.270 --> 01:37:40.270
money mmm and I've lost my shirt like

01:37:40.270 --> 01:37:42.940
multiple times over yeah and by the way

01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:44.530
you're not alone like the amount of

01:37:44.530 --> 01:37:46.570
people that have tried that you know

01:37:46.570 --> 01:37:48.760
it's it's great I mean it's it's it's

01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:49.990
literally the reason I keep on bringing

01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:51.280
this to like a philosophical level it's

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:53.350
the same exact thing right like in the

01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:55.900
in the fitness world and let me I'll

01:37:55.900 --> 01:37:58.810
stop sharing so we can see you again so

01:37:58.810 --> 01:38:01.030
so in the Fitness Rose the same thing

01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:05.080
right like there will never not be a new

01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:05.530
diet

01:38:05.530 --> 01:38:06.989
ever

01:38:06.989 --> 01:38:09.389
there will never not be a new piece of

01:38:09.389 --> 01:38:10.710
equipment like there's always gonna be

01:38:10.710 --> 01:38:13.079
something new and and that's because one

01:38:13.079 --> 01:38:13.800
of the things that makes America

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:16.079
phenomenal is like people can go out and

01:38:16.079 --> 01:38:18.420
start new ventures well a portion of

01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:20.429
those is like they're starting ventures

01:38:20.429 --> 01:38:21.749
and they need to convince you that their

01:38:21.749 --> 01:38:23.760
new thing is like the greatest thing

01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:25.530
ever all right so that's called

01:38:25.530 --> 01:38:27.360
marketing right like and that's fair

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.130
game so it's up to you as the consumer

01:38:29.130 --> 01:38:31.769
or in this case like as the investor or

01:38:31.769 --> 01:38:34.260
in this case like the the the

01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:35.489
bodybuilding athlete whatever at

01:38:35.489 --> 01:38:36.749
capacity you're trying to move forward

01:38:36.749 --> 01:38:39.650
in its you who's responsible for

01:38:39.650 --> 01:38:42.420
deciphering what is gonna work for you

01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:44.340
what's fundamental and what's gonna work

01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:47.999
overtime hmm goddamn it dude I think

01:38:47.999 --> 01:38:50.309
that's about it I think you do man I

01:38:50.309 --> 01:38:51.840
think you did it and that's beautiful

01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:53.429
I'm just happy to clear that up was I

01:38:53.429 --> 01:38:56.369
felt like a [ __ ] excuse me I felt like

01:38:56.369 --> 01:38:59.519
a [ __ ] just being like you know we'll

01:38:59.519 --> 01:39:00.749
do this and people are we talking about

01:39:00.749 --> 01:39:02.429
like I don't know so there it is laid

01:39:02.429 --> 01:39:05.610
out you know yes that's a good wave look

01:39:05.610 --> 01:39:07.380
it's one that puts a person you know it

01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:08.519
puts them on the chopping block so I

01:39:08.519 --> 01:39:10.249
don't have that kind of money it's like

01:39:10.249 --> 01:39:13.139
okay yeah a lot of people [ __ ] don't

01:39:13.139 --> 01:39:14.820
it just doesn't come to people one of

01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:15.659
you you know if you're gonna manipulate

01:39:15.659 --> 01:39:18.570
data and try to come up quick cool man I

01:39:18.570 --> 01:39:20.940
I hope to god every person that does it

01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:22.829
make some kazillion dollars a Bitcoin I

01:39:22.829 --> 01:39:24.840
have no person it's something I'm

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:27.079
personally attracted to I cannot like a

01:39:27.079 --> 01:39:29.579
whatever the thing's called the the

01:39:29.579 --> 01:39:31.800
square app just so I could start buying

01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:33.929
little bits of Bitcoin and ya know I

01:39:33.929 --> 01:39:36.449
just never did it but it should I

01:39:36.449 --> 01:39:38.190
[ __ ] always lose it stuff like that

01:39:38.190 --> 01:39:40.079
so it's like when I hear something that

01:39:40.079 --> 01:39:42.179
is kind of the hard way in my experience

01:39:42.179 --> 01:39:44.719
typically not always typically though

01:39:44.719 --> 01:39:47.130
that's kind of how it works and it takes

01:39:47.130 --> 01:39:50.010
a long time it's boring it sucks you

01:39:50.010 --> 01:39:51.539
don't get that like clicking instant

01:39:51.539 --> 01:39:53.789
gratification that seems to be that

01:39:53.789 --> 01:39:55.710
seems to align with my reality that I've

01:39:55.710 --> 01:39:59.190
inhabited so far oh yeah man and and I

01:39:59.190 --> 01:40:01.320
completely agree with you it's I mean I

01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:03.210
would say it suggests that most people

01:40:03.210 --> 01:40:04.469
listening to this if they're willing to

01:40:04.469 --> 01:40:06.599
be honest with themselves cuz that's a

01:40:06.599 --> 01:40:07.590
hard thing like being honest with

01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:10.050
yourself like well Mike my bodybuilding

01:40:10.050 --> 01:40:11.969
coach says is like look he's like do not

01:40:11.969 --> 01:40:13.409
make this harder than needs to be in a

01:40:13.409 --> 01:40:15.840
game he's like it's simple do what needs

01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:18.150
to be done okay that makes a lot of

01:40:18.150 --> 01:40:19.710
sense he's like there's only a certain

01:40:19.710 --> 01:40:20.850
amount of muscle tissue

01:40:20.850 --> 01:40:22.830
can tear down and rebuild in a 24-hour

01:40:22.830 --> 01:40:25.680
period right and it's cumulative so it's

01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:27.180
like you either do that and he said it's

01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:29.400
gonna take a long time you either do it

01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:32.580
and start the clock now or you don't do

01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:34.230
it and eventually find out that's what

01:40:34.230 --> 01:40:36.060
you had to have been doing Yeah right

01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:37.650
that's just that's just how most things

01:40:37.650 --> 01:40:39.210
work right like I don't know what else

01:40:39.210 --> 01:40:41.310
to say like are you gonna find anomalies

01:40:41.310 --> 01:40:42.720
that yeah but they're the exceptions

01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:45.060
they're not the rule yeah right so it's

01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:47.010
like an action I think even as like a

01:40:47.010 --> 01:40:48.810
man like it's so important it's like

01:40:48.810 --> 01:40:51.420
yeah maybe you hit on an anomaly every

01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:53.880
once in a while but I'd rather have you

01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:56.370
not hit on an anomaly so that you keep

01:40:56.370 --> 01:40:57.990
on telling your brain that everything

01:40:57.990 --> 01:41:00.000
takes disciplined effort over time I

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.210
would put my chips with that guy who has

01:41:03.210 --> 01:41:05.130
that philosophy about everything and

01:41:05.130 --> 01:41:07.320
over a 20-year period 30-year period

01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:09.420
four year period I put my money with

01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:11.490
that guy figuratively right like I bet

01:41:11.490 --> 01:41:13.350
on him winning over the long term

01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:15.090
dude like the amount of friends that

01:41:15.090 --> 01:41:18.270
I've had you know who who literally like

01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:19.620
worked out the wrong way or did the

01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:21.000
wrong fundamentals or like you know just

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.980
like like we're doing the wrong things

01:41:22.980 --> 01:41:24.030
and Matt I don't know if you could agree

01:41:24.030 --> 01:41:26.550
with this but it's like those people and

01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:27.930
they may have been like up here on the

01:41:27.930 --> 01:41:30.180
on the Status hierarchy you know back in

01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:31.580
high school or grade school or whatever

01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:34.050
but like the ones who are not operating

01:41:34.050 --> 01:41:36.000
by fundamentals at least that I've seen

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.600
have had enormous collapses yeah

01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:41.700
right like enormous collapses whether it

01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:44.160
be like drinking problems steroid issues

01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:47.670
like literally like like now going

01:41:47.670 --> 01:41:49.290
through multiple decades of life you

01:41:49.290 --> 01:41:51.510
know it's like wow like maybe what my

01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:53.760
mom and Grandpop said of like you know

01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:55.980
like no hard work and effort over a

01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:57.660
period of time and like don't chase gold

01:41:57.660 --> 01:41:59.370
shiny objects and don't cut corners

01:41:59.370 --> 01:42:01.290
maybe that's the real answer and that's

01:42:01.290 --> 01:42:02.580
the cool thing about the internet now is

01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:04.350
like it's like you and I can have a

01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:07.320
multi hour conversation any we can push

01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:09.650
out the message of like know stuff and

01:42:09.650 --> 01:42:13.170
rewards take effort over a long time

01:42:13.170 --> 01:42:16.050
horizon and like just don't even try it

01:42:16.050 --> 01:42:19.260
the other way right but before 20 years

01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:21.570
ago these you know everybody listening

01:42:21.570 --> 01:42:22.920
on this on this podcast would have to

01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:25.140
like trust in it in a 15-minute

01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:27.060
infomercial that was trying to sell them

01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:28.800
on some like dream it's like no man like

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:30.210
you know you're starting to see all

01:42:30.210 --> 01:42:32.250
these people come out who have podcasts

01:42:32.250 --> 01:42:34.630
and YouTube channels and who you know

01:42:34.630 --> 01:42:36.820
we have like real-world results and all

01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:39.040
of them that I know of across the board

01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:41.650
are saying like no man I've been doing

01:42:41.650 --> 01:42:43.630
this for decades but like even you know

01:42:43.630 --> 01:42:44.800
I don't know how many listeners probably

01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:46.210
isn't a Joe Rogan but I listen to drover

01:42:46.210 --> 01:42:48.160
and I think you do too and it's like

01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:50.410
dude how long ago did he start his

01:42:50.410 --> 01:42:54.220
podcast - I can say maybe the 90s yeah

01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:56.230
it's crazy right it's at least over 10

01:42:56.230 --> 01:42:59.650
years easily right like in like 3000

01:42:59.650 --> 01:43:01.780
something episodes it's crazy right and

01:43:01.780 --> 01:43:03.910
and in that one of the things I like

01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:04.750
about him and I don't agree with

01:43:04.750 --> 01:43:05.920
everything he says that's a good thing

01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:07.270
like we all should not agree on every

01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:09.520
single thing but like he continually

01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:11.830
gives the message of like disciplined

01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:14.890
effort over time disciplined effort over

01:43:14.890 --> 01:43:16.360
time and keeps on saying that message I

01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:19.990
love that man yep dude I love it did you

01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:22.780
go you broke it down that's awesome the

01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:24.550
infographics are really even better and

01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:26.320
you know awesome thank the internet gods

01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:27.700
they didn't crap out on me this time

01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:30.040
which was fairly annoying last time but

01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:32.020
dude I really appreciate it for coming

01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:34.180
in and you you have anything you like

01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:35.680
want to put out there or whatever you

01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:38.050
just try out and use a profit no no I

01:43:38.050 --> 01:43:42.100
mean uh just at some point I um I always

01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:43.900
ask for your nudging on this at some

01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:45.430
point I'm gonna do like a podcast and

01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:47.230
and so on got the equipment for it I

01:43:47.230 --> 01:43:49.060
want to do it and and it's gonna cross

01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:50.980
between investing in like life

01:43:50.980 --> 01:43:54.190
philosophy all that kind of stuff in it

01:43:54.190 --> 01:43:56.320
and it's only gonna be for guys it's

01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:57.730
just because like I love having these

01:43:57.730 --> 01:44:00.100
conversations right like we need more

01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:03.250
men's groups to stop giving us the

01:44:03.250 --> 01:44:06.820
stereotypical messages and and like get

01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:08.260
out there make something of yourself

01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:09.670
like that whole thing like so I think

01:44:09.670 --> 01:44:11.140
what you guys are doing is phenomenally

01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:12.850
more conversations like this need to

01:44:12.850 --> 01:44:15.370
happen oh yeah didn't preciate you cool

01:44:15.370 --> 01:44:17.890
same you brother seen I mean oh and let

01:44:17.890 --> 01:44:20.170
me make a disclaimer you know I've got

01:44:20.170 --> 01:44:23.890
multiple monitors so my camera is in

01:44:23.890 --> 01:44:25.210
between this matter so I'm looking at

01:44:25.210 --> 01:44:26.650

but it's a little bit off that's fine

01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:34.630
that was my boomer what say that was

01:44:34.630 --> 01:44:36.670

01:44:41.410 --> 01:44:43.330
exactly so so I didn't want you think I

01:44:43.330 --> 01:44:44.440
was being rude and like playing like

01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:46.870
Tetris or something when we're uh if you

01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:48.220
