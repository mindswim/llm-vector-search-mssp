one show

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.000

morning was tough no it was good it

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.280
wasn't trying for more i went to the dog

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.920
i'm starting a bad dog park

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.360
so it's just for dogs that don't get

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.440
along with other dogs lump them together

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.959
and let them learn this is your second

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.280
so this is your dog right now

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.160
it's my two dogs and my boy spud's dog

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.120
zeus

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.879
so we've taken it over now when i like

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:25.760
my

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.840
my friend andrew's dog only humps it

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.400
like it won't play it'll only help

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.160
so like other people's thought like hey

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.599
your dog a lot of people bring them like

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.120
a lot of people's dogs go to this lot

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.920
i'm at

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.360
have problems at the dog park so they're

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.040
kind of like like kind of like yeah like

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.400
are you sure is it cool if i come in i'm

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.720
like yo come on in

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.080
my dog will try to kind of bite your

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.599
dog's face and my other dog might just

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.760
like run into you so it's going strong

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.519
jackson jackson runs into people we had

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.040
four bad dogs and someone else brought

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.640
their bad dog in i mean they all ran

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.800
around so this is the second idea i've

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.560
heard you had that is basically just

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.160
you're getting into dog fighting it's

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
not dog food like yeah it's a bad dog

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.120
park it does caesar milan

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.400
your first dog fighting ring was just

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.000
literally like we should what we should

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.840

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.120

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.519
[Laughter]

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.040

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.480

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.879
stock

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:12.479

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.400
kittens yeah my the gillis family had

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.840
too many cats so he put a bunch of

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.919
kittens in a bag and threw him in the

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:25.280
[ __ ] creek

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.879
and then it hit a damn split open

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:30.479
cats you know cats drown everywhere

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:32.320

them in the river

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.600
but uh i found this out about my grandpa

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.959
because it all it's all starting to make

00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:56.320
more sense because every story i've ever

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.399
heard about my grandpa old francis

00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:00.720
gillis was just that he was like all he

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.160
did was fight people

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.080
it's all he did like every day every

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.519
story i've ever heard of him was him

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:07.040
freaking the [ __ ] out and then he

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.320
eventually he had like a heart attack

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.160
during like an operation or something

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.200
but

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.519
r.i.p grandpa but uh i don't know why i

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:15.040
laughed at that i found an article my

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.640
dad stopper yeah yeah

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.720
but uh

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.240
my dad just showed me this article this

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.600
week from

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.519
the sports page

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:27.760
in in harrisburg and it was about my

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.560
grandpa playing at notre dame and he got

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.080
a concussion

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.240
so hard that his season ended like he

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.600
was a starting tackle and they were like

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.880
he was supposed to start against purdue

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.640
this week but he's out it was a career

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.560
ending concussion wait when was it in

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.120
1938 when they had like

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.800
no concussions they were like snow

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.480
helmets and [ __ ] yeah but that's when

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.800
they like had no idea like this

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.640
dude and i was laughing so hard thinking

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.320
about how hard that guy's concussion

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.000
must have been dude he must have been at

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
his funeral and he woke up he can't play

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.320
the rest of the season seriously

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.839
but then it's like all right so now

00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:01.200
every story makes sense where he was

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.880
like we got 20 [ __ ] cats i'm gonna

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.560
kill all these [ __ ] cats oh you guys

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.399
it's like oh yeah you got cted from the

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:07.839
30s

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:09.600
well think of it this way man if you're

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.600
if you grew up and your dad hit you your

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.000
grandfather definitely hit your grandmom

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.839
for sure definitely hit your grandpa for

00:10:15.839 --> 00:10:17.839
sure i don't want to put that accusation

00:10:17.839 --> 00:10:19.279
out on my family

00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:20.480
dude like i'm thinking about it now i

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.519
don't know why that popped in my head

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:22.800
i'm like because my dad would like hit

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.720
me if i was in trouble when i was little

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.320
so now like that's kind of not that's

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.600
taboo

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.240
my dad's dead probably [ __ ]

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.480
slapped around at least a firm like up

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.399
into a wall like knock the [ __ ] off yeah

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:35.680
but that that's true though and that's

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.279
also why women back then knew their

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:38.640
[ __ ] place

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.000
i mean they knew that that was on the

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.839
table imagine it was a possibility

00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:43.600
threat was a possibility imagine like

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.800
back in like the 30s if you went to the

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.160
authorities like my husband hit me like

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.519
literally the guy really shuffled papers

00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:48.880
like what'd you do

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.800
yeah yeah he's like well i [ __ ]

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.560
you're like a nice looking broad like

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.480
you come on

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.079
throw some makeup on you'll be able to

00:10:56.079 --> 00:10:58.480
[ __ ] grip her and throw her again

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.240
you [ __ ] i'll show you how a real man

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.320
hits a woman

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.399
yeah that's um

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:05.519
i don't know why i started when you're

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:06.640

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.560

00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:52.639
know it wasn't a big deal he got cancer

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:53.760
of

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.800

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.800
yeah yeah yeah what's the uh what do you

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.079

00:14:00.079 --> 00:14:03.440
your oh your prostate

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.800
is it isn't it from kind of like not

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.720

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.920
i don't know i don't want to put that on

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.440
my dad dude

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.360
i don't think he's got a king's comer

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.959
man coming too much that's a good that's

00:14:24.959 --> 00:14:26.399
good for him dude yeah so if you leave

00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:27.920
to come in there too long it sours and

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.839
that starts to [ __ ] rot the world try

00:14:29.839 --> 00:14:31.040
to say that they're trying to say like

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.480
you got to keep it flowing otherwise it

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.399
becomes enlarged and like like i got i

00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:36.639
got enlarged prostates in my family we

00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:38.399
getting large painful because you guys

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:40.560
come too much no no if you don't come

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.399
enough if [ __ ] you like i get i suffer

00:14:42.399 --> 00:14:43.920
from like real hereditary well that's

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.160
because you keep doing no faps

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.279
i don't know what the [ __ ] going on

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:49.440
down there with you dude that is like

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.040
do you wear a cape on your deck i used

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.120
to

00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:54.880
i took it off because this summer i

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.880
didn't want to get sweaty and get a rash

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:01.600
but makes perfect sense what the [ __ ]

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.440
it's always funny that you throw in

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.040
reasonable logic

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.399
into something that's totally

00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:08.000
unreasonable wizard with that dude when

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.199
i listen to you guys i'm like i don't

00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:10.800
know how he's making this make sense but

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.880
it's like just being honest dude just

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.800
being honest i'm telling you yeah i

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.839
think it's a brilliance you're not

00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:18.079
really giving yourself credit for

00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:18.800
it

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.800
i just it did you my dick did feel good

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.480
by the way you take you after the cake

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.000
yeah you wear that cape for a while it's

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.360
nice but it's like

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.639
i'm doing jiu jitsu and [ __ ] i can't

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:27.680
have that thing fall through my pant

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.120

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:34.720
a dick cape into the lobster

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.160
like that's where my thumb just like put

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.680
on my thumb

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.360

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.240
that yours yes yes

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.040
by the way i quit

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.120
yeah dude old head's like uh it's weird

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.279
like a dog thing

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:52.959
like i feel like if you they nobody has

00:15:52.959 --> 00:15:54.560
anything to care about now

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.000
like you don't have like the possibility

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.040
of like somebody being like hey you

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.639
gotta go to vietnam

00:15:58.639 --> 00:16:00.160
so like more people care about like

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.000
nonsense yeah yeah it's like i mean our

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.160
our country is obsessed with dogs but

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.920
then you go to a third world country

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.120
they're just out in the street and it's

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.639
like we gotta kill these [ __ ] dogs

00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:10.079
that are everywhere yeah yeah we gotta

00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:11.519
talk to them yeah they're like third

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:14.000
world prisons those we got dog

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.120
literally i was watching this [ __ ] last

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.480
night there's a prison in brazil and

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.759
there's just dogs in the yard just

00:16:17.759 --> 00:16:19.519
running around they just get into the

00:16:19.519 --> 00:16:21.120
fence and they're like i cannot chill

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.680
here sort of oh you like i thought even

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.480
like arrested

00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:29.199
i think any punishment for dogs in

00:16:29.199 --> 00:16:30.959
brazil is definitely the death penalty

00:16:30.959 --> 00:16:32.720
yeah

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.279
but yeah they uh even in like spain they

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:37.279
kept they all keep their dogs outside oh

00:16:37.279 --> 00:16:38.880
yeah like in most countries you just

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.320
keep your [ __ ] dog outside and it's

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.000
like why would we have i don't

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.759
understand why they have them

00:16:43.759 --> 00:16:45.920
yeah they just have an animal dogs are

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.440
useful though because if someone tries

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.199
to break into your house it's like

00:16:49.199 --> 00:16:50.560
they're really useful for keeping out

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.440
burglars yeah my dog is my is my my

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.440
alarm at home well how about somebody

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.160

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.320
oh you got a gay dog no i got a [ __ ]

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.680
old man looking is a gay dog

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.319
i have an old french bulldog okay that's

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.919
[ __ ] that's not a gay dog french

00:17:07.919 --> 00:17:09.360
bulldogs are you like one of the few

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.039
small breeds that are not gay yeah she's

00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:12.559
got like a grey goatee yeah that's

00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:13.919
awesome

00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:16.640
but she uh she goes [ __ ] berserk if

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.880
someone even turns the knob

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.559
and it sucks when like people come over

00:17:20.559 --> 00:17:21.839
yeah because she's like the biggest

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.520
[ __ ] in the world yeah but it's also

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.640
like i can go to bed being like all

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.079
right if anybody tries to [ __ ] creep

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:27.919
in if someone looks in the window yeah

00:17:27.919 --> 00:17:29.360
exactly oh yeah and that's how those

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.120
little dogs made their way

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.640
to like being accepted because they

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.760

like my cardiologist isn't gonna get

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.760
shot on a drive-by bicycle shooting out

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.919
in like the suburbs of texas you're in

00:26:07.919 --> 00:26:09.520
an affluent neighborhood peddling your

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.200
bike if some dude pulls up on a bicycle

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.480
right on the way to work yeah he knows

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.600
you're out

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.919
runs away yeah no robbery

00:26:15.919 --> 00:26:17.440
that [ __ ] happens all the time dude it's

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.960
bizarre

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.320
this is great i'm just this is great

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.559
watching you listen to him talking

00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:24.960
i'm telling

00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:28.240
you're the dude who started the cia and

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.520
your heart doctor and a bunch of other

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.440
people connected to you just get killed

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.520
randomly it's like it's bizarre it's

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.840
certainly strange it certainly is it is

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.600
i agree with bullets just ripped through

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.279
this [ __ ] room

00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:40.640
you keep [ __ ] but that would make

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.480
sense yeah

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.000
this neighborhood that makes perfect

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:44.880
sense

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.640
um it's pretty peaceful but that poo

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.080
yeah it is absolutely i haven't heard

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.440
one gunshot yeah you can get two years

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.640
get a couple guns you hear them

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.960
occasionally

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.960
that putin thing it reminded me of i

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.720
think it was with oliver stone he did

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.000
those interviews

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.600
and they were like or maybe it wasn't

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.200
with oliver's tone but it was one of the

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.039
interviews they were asking about

00:27:03.039 --> 00:27:04.400
russian interference with the u.s

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.320
election and he was like again he said

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.840
the same thing he's like this is do you

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.279
think the u.s meddles in other people's

00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:10.799
elections

00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:12.320
and he's like we didn't but do you think

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.840
you guys do yeah

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.480
anyway next question like dude he shuts

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.159
i like watch food and i'm like damn he's

00:27:18.159 --> 00:27:20.000

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
he just doesn't [ __ ] he's just right

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.400
now dairy queen's jerking off going nuts

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.000
he's getting mad right now he's fired up

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.919

00:27:27.919 --> 00:27:29.840
in the fact that we like putin i do i

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:30.960
like i like

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.159
this [ __ ]

00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:35.120
i think it's a liberal troll talk [ __ ]

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.559
it's pretty funny

00:27:36.559 --> 00:27:38.240
i like him man i'm not gonna you know

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.760

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.760
you like the cut of his jib yeah i like

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.760
the kind of thing

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.600
you know invading ukraine you down with

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.360
that they try to hand them the fbi

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.559
report during the thing they're like

00:27:48.559 --> 00:27:50.080
well here's the report saying that like

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.200
you know there was collusion and

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.640
meddling and he goes like the guy goes

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.080
handed to him he goes

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.960
laughs at him he goes put it over there

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.720
so [ __ ] funny again that was another

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.480
thing we were every all the liberals

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.520
were like we shouldn't be dealing with

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.200
russia they invaded ukraine all that

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:03.919
[ __ ]

00:28:03.919 --> 00:28:05.279
and then when they asked that to putin

00:28:05.279 --> 00:28:08.159
he's like how did iraq go for you guys

00:28:08.159 --> 00:28:10.720
yeah and it's like uh never mind yeah

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.720

he's going everywhere he's going crazy

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.399

00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:28.080
russia coming to the white house why

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.320
would that be a problem

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.240
cia controls the media dude that's why

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.840
it's not a problem that's the thing i

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.440
was gonna say you want a bunch of very

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.679
bad things and there's this ex-kgb agent

00:28:37.679 --> 00:28:39.440
with a bunch of power now who knows

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.120
everything you did now he's in the

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.200
mainstream it's not a good thing dude

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.279
the cia got jfk assassinated that's

00:28:45.279 --> 00:28:47.120
that's in control it's like that's a

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.120
fact

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.960
they lied dude they lied and said he got

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.399
shot once he clearly got shot in the

00:28:52.399 --> 00:28:53.679
throat and in the head and they came out

00:28:53.679 --> 00:28:55.600
40 years later and they were like well

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.360
he did get shot in the throat too upon

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.360
reviewing it it's like

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.279
yeah i'm dude look into that [ __ ] it's

00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:03.279
insane nine out of 10 americans in the

00:29:03.279 --> 00:29:05.039
60s and 70s are where i get when you get

00:29:05.039 --> 00:29:07.440
shot when did just 63.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.960
right after that they pulled americans

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.559
and it was like nine out of 10 americans

00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:11.919
didn't believe like the single bullet

00:29:11.919 --> 00:29:14.399
theory the shooter from the hill

00:29:14.399 --> 00:29:15.840
but now they do back in the day you

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.520
could get if they didn't see like

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.200
foresee the internet coming out you

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.399
could cover [ __ ] up and now all the

00:29:20.399 --> 00:29:21.600
shit's coming out and people are

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.760
freaking the [ __ ] out yeah

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.159
what do you think's gonna happen

00:29:26.159 --> 00:29:28.799
i don't know man i have no idea putin

00:29:28.799 --> 00:29:30.000
yeah

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.440
i don't know i think we're gonna yo this

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.399
is one thing i checked uh vegas has odds

00:29:34.399 --> 00:29:36.080
for the next president

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.240
and it shows who because vegas is pretty

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.000
good at that yeah like who who's going

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.200
to actually win

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:41.919
and

00:29:41.919 --> 00:29:44.159
when you see the democrats who they

00:29:44.159 --> 00:29:46.320
could trot out yeah it's like holy [ __ ]

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.159
trump's a hundred percent working with

00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:49.120
right now

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.120
there's no one yeah there's literally no

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.919
one yeah that's definitely gonna

00:29:53.919 --> 00:29:56.080
alec baldwin has a better chance of

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.760
becoming president he has better odds

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.440
than like hillary clinton

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.919
if he writes crazy trump playing trump's

00:30:01.919 --> 00:30:03.440
character though he might be pretty well

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.640
known

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.480
that would be funny

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.480
dude him debating trump

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.399

wrong like two guys just going wrong

00:30:12.799 --> 00:30:14.559
wrong trump what trump would stay in the

00:30:14.559 --> 00:30:16.399
pocket oh yeah yeah would be like

00:30:16.399 --> 00:30:17.600

like had a rebuttal against every one of

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.080
these comics he would murder them

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.320
especially if it was a black crowd dude

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.919

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.760
so corny what was the case

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.200
i didn't get picked so they brought me

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.039
in so like they picked me for jury dude

00:32:43.039 --> 00:32:44.480
which i thought that meant you're on a

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.559
[ __ ] trial and they bring you all

00:32:46.559 --> 00:32:48.000
into a room and they like ask questions

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.240
like are you racist or yes like do you

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.159
not like this dude's face

00:32:52.159 --> 00:32:54.080
but it kind of feels racist

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.399
they're like they try to keep you like

00:32:56.399 --> 00:32:58.399
one of the lawyers will be like

00:32:58.399 --> 00:33:00.799
yes yes yes

00:33:00.799 --> 00:33:02.640
the lawyers get to pick yeah well the

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.720
lawyers get to strike six each so like

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.840
they'll turn around they look at you the

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.080
whole time like like they can you can

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.200
see like when they look at you and they

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.720
make a note about you

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.159
like they might be like

00:33:12.159 --> 00:33:14.720
a young guy with beard kind of fat must

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.559
be a liberal

00:33:16.559 --> 00:33:17.760
i'm sure they look to me and they were

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.600
like he's probably a [ __ ] you were

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.360
sleeper cell dude yeah dude little did

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.279
you know i was [ __ ] for you i could

00:33:23.279 --> 00:33:25.440
have swayed that [ __ ]

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.360
you would have that [ __ ]

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.039
[ __ ] whatever that lady justice thing

00:33:29.039 --> 00:33:30.159
she would have been her back would have

00:33:30.159 --> 00:33:33.360
[ __ ] broke because of me dude

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.200
yeah the lawyers get to set it up like

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.799
that yeah there's jury selection it's

00:33:36.799 --> 00:33:38.799
like a dream team cherry selection and

00:33:38.799 --> 00:33:41.679
then it's like in oj yeah where they

00:33:41.679 --> 00:33:42.880
were like they just picked every black

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.559
person they could so would they show

00:33:44.559 --> 00:33:46.240
like a white guy's face and like ugh and

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.480
they're like perfect yes well they

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.720
picked any black lady they could yeah

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.919
well you know what's weird is like they

00:33:51.919 --> 00:33:54.320
knew every black lady would be like

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:57.679
he innocent it's like yes

00:33:57.679 --> 00:33:59.679
i've always heard if you want to like

00:33:59.679 --> 00:34:01.600
give a young black kid a harsh sentence

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.960
just put the jewelry full of old black

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.799
dudes and they'll fry them

00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:07.679
really i've heard people say that before

00:34:07.679 --> 00:34:10.399
who yeah

00:34:10.399 --> 00:34:12.960
i'm just worse than old white dude

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.720
yeah cause like they don't have that

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.200
like yeah can i be that you know i mean

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.200
worse than all white dudes in 1956

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.919
probably not but

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:25.679
i think that was the worst jury

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:27.119
they'd be like trial's over we're taking

00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:29.119
them you just have guys the jury just

00:34:29.119 --> 00:34:32.240
took the defendant

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:35.040
that's true

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.639
i don't think it even made it that far

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:38.800
no hell no wait where's this kid for who

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.399
where's this kid at we'll just go to his

00:34:40.399 --> 00:34:41.520
house

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.599
what's the charge shoplifting what do

00:34:43.599 --> 00:34:45.040

00:34:51.919 --> 00:34:53.359
were like so has anybody been a victim

00:34:53.359 --> 00:34:54.480
of a crime

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.919

00:34:55.919 --> 00:34:58.079
hand so like i raised my hand i mugged

00:34:58.079 --> 00:34:59.359
when i was like

00:34:59.359 --> 00:35:00.160
once

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.079
you got mugged by a white guy no yeah i

00:35:02.079 --> 00:35:03.520
know

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.320
i said mug they didn't say rob

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.680
that's funny

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.520
anyways uh yeah white guys robbed

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.760
professionally white guys only ocean's

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.359
11. yeah it wasn't like six dudes and

00:35:13.359 --> 00:35:16.160
like a brand new dodge caravan

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.000
it's like farm animal masks yeah they

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.520
didn't trick me for three hours and

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.040
they're gambling my life away you had

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.640
like a bridge explode behind you and

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.880
diversion yeah then all the lights went

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.440
out your wallet was gone [ __ ] guys

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.280
[ __ ] george clooney [ __ ] white

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.359
guys so anyways they were like they

00:35:31.359 --> 00:35:32.560
brought me in to interview me they're

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.160
like you raised your hand

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.280
and i was like yeah and they were like

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.240
what happened i was like well i got

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.160
mugged at a college campus and they were

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:38.880
like

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.880
was the uh was the mugger identified as

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.560
white or black i was like yeah he's

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:43.599
black

00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:45.680
and uh they were like did that affect

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:46.480
your

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.320
uh did that affect how you feel about

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.920
african-americans and i was like

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:50.640
no

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.240
yeah and uh which would be funny if i

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.160
was like no they were always like that

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.640
but i was like uh no not at all and he

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.920
goes do you think that would affect how

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.440
you would view this case and i was like

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.359
no it happened to me

00:36:01.359 --> 00:36:03.119
but then like later on like when they

00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:04.160
cut me

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.680
i was like thinking if they were like if

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.280
the exact same thing happened in that

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.560
trial that happened to me i'd probably

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.240
like you [ __ ] yeah

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.720
get them dude one jury member tried to

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.240
take the defender

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.440
yeah

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.640
but it did they they interviewed

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.400
everybody so it must have been like a

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:19.520
serious

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.599
thing i guess i don't know

00:36:21.599 --> 00:36:22.800
yeah

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.079
oh yeah you think there's a murder dude

00:36:24.079 --> 00:36:25.280

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.520
dude you read the story it's

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.640
questionable

makes me look like a [ __ ] i'm gonna

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.720
preface this by saying remember a few

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.800

he

00:37:47.599 --> 00:37:49.520

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:50.720
that came out i was like good i'm glad

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.560
that [ __ ] guy the ice is a [ __ ]

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.920
yeah i'm glad it happened i'm not glad

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.200
it happened but like that's the outcome

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.480
and everybody was like you're an [ __ ]

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.240
i was like i'm not happy that i got shot

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.079
yeah but like this is what happens when

00:38:00.079 --> 00:38:01.760
you walk around being like i'm the

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.839
[ __ ] man i'm untouchable would you

00:38:03.839 --> 00:38:05.280
eventually run into a [ __ ] asian dude

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.200
with a piece who doesn't exactly dude

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.720
you know and you know what it's funny

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.960
that's the most unlikely of people you

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:11.920
usually think something they thought he

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.079
was going to be easy bigger better guys

00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:15.520
and beat him up one day just a small

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.839
asian nerd with a gun just like pop dude

00:38:17.839 --> 00:38:19.440
think how [ __ ] that chick must have

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.960
been hot as [ __ ] that asian must have

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.480
been one of the coolest asians on earth

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:24.400
yeah yeah obviously he's willing to

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.320
murder in the street yeah i think they

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.480
had the [ __ ] sickest swag dude they

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.240
dishonored him dude they dishonored him

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:33.760
very much oh that's designers

00:40:17.119 --> 00:40:18.800
you do is you sit there and hopefully so

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.079
a black person pulls up behind you and

00:40:20.079 --> 00:40:21.440

camera footage either which is weird it

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.800

those little streets they're uh i bet

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:48.160
you could get uh camera footage from

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.560
homes but a lot of times they don't have

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.440
like the

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.880
gotcha yeah but they don't have like

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.640
street cans that makes sense so he gets

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.640
out and apparently

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:57.839

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.560

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.520
was a big ass [ __ ] knife it was just

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.119
like a machete yeah that was on my

00:43:33.119 --> 00:43:34.240
shoulder

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.920
you think you had a mashat you must add

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.440
a rainbow knife dude once you know the

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.960
knives have like matches and a compass

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.640
in the back

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.000
he's like i've been dying to use this

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.200
[ __ ] thing

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.400
he's been in the woods with that since

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.280
like 10 years old like one day

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.400
that's a kill

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.720
that's a wound

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:52.560
but yeah man you're getting stronger

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:54.319
this guy's dead so now it's like they're

00:43:54.319 --> 00:43:56.000
going to argue as if it's self-defense

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.359
or not and it's pretty much all word of

00:43:57.359 --> 00:43:58.800
mouth but dude the people these

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.240
developers are going to exhaust their

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:02.240
[ __ ] funds to try to bury this kid

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.839
yeah but this is the bar all right so

00:44:03.839 --> 00:44:05.520
what i would say is this is the same

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:06.800
[ __ ]

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:09.359
that when like a [ __ ] slashing cowboy

00:44:09.359 --> 00:44:10.640
you're saying yeah or like when a black

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.480
dude rolls up in a white dude with a gun

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.760
yeah that white dude's like i feel like

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.440
if i don't do something this guy's gonna

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:17.359
beat me to death likely scenario

00:44:17.359 --> 00:44:18.960
sometimes you're talking about zimmerman

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.400
not that i don't i don't but like that

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:21.839
it's but there's been very like

00:44:21.839 --> 00:44:23.760
variations of that same situation but

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:25.040
hold on who does a black guy have a

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:25.839
weapon

00:44:25.839 --> 00:44:26.560
no

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.079
okay so in this situation the white guy

00:44:28.079 --> 00:44:29.839
didn't have a weapon but

00:44:29.839 --> 00:44:31.119
if you're the black guy you could argue

00:44:31.119 --> 00:44:32.240
like all right what if these three dudes

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.000
get a hold of me true what if they get

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.599
this humongous sword out of my backpack

00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:37.680
and stab me in the back yeah so if it's

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.680
no it's if you're outnumbered if you're

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:40.880
outnumbered

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.560
and you interfere with somebody else's

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.240
argument you're allowed to kill them no

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.240
that's not what happened shane oh wait i

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.599
thought i thought those guys were

00:44:47.599 --> 00:44:48.800
yelling at somebody in their car they

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.640
were and then he passed and he rolled up

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:53.040
sometimes and murdered a guy

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.560
and then he pedaled up and put the

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.160
kickstand down

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.839
the guy in the back and peddled away

00:44:57.839 --> 00:44:59.520
yeah pretty much yeah

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.440
well it was but it all no one knows how

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.040
physical the argument was getting so

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.200
three dudes tried to assault him

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:07.280
physically then yes but yeah

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:08.960
nobody knows that's the thing nobody

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.720
knows dude so it can be painted however

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.000
you got people being called there was

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.599
three guys and then some people are like

00:46:13.599 --> 00:46:14.880
did he spit on a guy and he stabbed him

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.319
in the back with a [ __ ] i think that kid

murdered a white guy at the exact right

00:46:18.079 --> 00:46:20.319
time politically this today's climate i

00:46:20.319 --> 00:46:22.640
think he's gonna walk in philly yeah man

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:23.920
i mean he went into a lawyer and a

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.680
lawyer i'm like because the fact that he

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.040
turned himself back in he definitely

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.560
consulted some sort of legal counsel and

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.079
they were like all right bro

00:46:30.079 --> 00:46:31.760

but we're in this like beautiful bar and

00:47:01.599 --> 00:47:03.599
like there's these kids from boston who

00:47:03.599 --> 00:47:05.440
like have this dumb [ __ ] accent like

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.280
that right oh god those are the things

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.440
that are talking [ __ ] about my

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:11.920
wife's cousin who has a southern accent

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:13.680
and she talks like it's like hey y'all

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:15.599
like that's she's very very making fun

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:16.800
of a girl she sounds like a ringtone

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:19.119
she's [ __ ] super stubborn but they're

00:47:19.119 --> 00:47:20.160
like she's like all right goodnight

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.599
y'all and they're like oh i couldn't

00:47:21.599 --> 00:47:23.599
like just yeah so then i said something

00:47:23.599 --> 00:47:24.960
i started arguing with this guy and then

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.079
out of the corner of my eye i just see

00:47:26.079 --> 00:47:27.839
this guy getting close to me

00:47:27.839 --> 00:47:29.200
and like that's when everything got bad

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.400
because then i was like all right like

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.079
it's gonna be a thing yeah but in my

00:47:32.079 --> 00:47:34.240
head i was like if i didn't do that

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.079
if i didn't happen to see him

00:47:36.079 --> 00:47:37.920
that guy could have [ __ ] cracked me

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.520
yeah man i could have [ __ ] fell down

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:41.119
hit my head on a [ __ ] bar stool who

00:47:41.119 --> 00:47:43.119
knows what it could have done to me but

00:47:43.119 --> 00:47:44.880
it's also because i made the decision to

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.240
start [ __ ]

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:48.240
well you also didn't was your wife there

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.839
yeah you can't let your wife's cousin

00:47:49.839 --> 00:47:51.200
get trashed right in front and then no

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.880
no no that's [ __ ] up your [ __ ] you

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:54.720
know what i mean of course but like at

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.400
the same time it's like these are the

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.800
possible consequences that come with

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.680
parking in the street

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.079
that's a consequence of parking in the

00:48:04.079 --> 00:48:06.480
streets yeah yeah somebody gets murdered

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:07.920
because you had to have a [ __ ]

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.760
conversation in a one-way street yeah

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.119
you had to finish your text you had to

00:48:11.119 --> 00:48:12.960
put your flashers on and finish the text

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.319
i wonder if the other guy was an uber

00:48:14.319 --> 00:48:16.000
each driver too

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.319
now we're talking conspiracy now this is

00:48:18.319 --> 00:48:19.760
like a whole thing i think you might

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:20.960
figure this out i wonder if they were

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.400
going to lift

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.640
the developers may have been in a lift

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.160
no they were in his mercedes oh they're

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.680
hit okay yeah

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.040
they'll throw that one out there dude

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.240
you know they were [ __ ] they were

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.920
listening to someone

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:33.119
and they turned that corner and he was

00:48:33.119 --> 00:48:34.720
like i got those

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.079
definitely yeah they were doing coke

00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:37.599
dude yeah all three of them were

00:48:37.599 --> 00:48:39.760
watching either wall street or american

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:42.240
psycho on their [ __ ] cell phones

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.680
they're all developing like an eastern

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.760
european accent they never had before i

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.200
think what happened was they pulled up

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.480
there's a black dude blocking the street

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.160
in the car they all unanimously decided

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.359
that that's annoying thing they deal

00:48:51.359 --> 00:48:52.720
with all the time and he goes you're all

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.240

like within the people our fan base

00:55:41.359 --> 00:55:44.079

it's pretty it's not bad you watch it

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:55.040
it's not too wild some of it goes off

00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:55.920
into like

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.839
third planet sun [ __ ] and you're like

00:55:57.839 --> 00:55:59.200
all right this is [ __ ] insane this is

00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:00.640
yeah that's when it loses me this is

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:01.680
stuff that happened in history and

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:02.880
they're like this is why you know this

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:04.799
is what happened yeah and there's also

00:56:04.799 --> 00:56:06.400
like some of those documentaries though

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.400
some of it just seems totally

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:10.000
i know this already it's not like a

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.160
conspiracy what documentaries

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:14.480
uh what was that mass consumption or the

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:15.520
uh

00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:18.160
the one about advertising uh

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:21.040
not hyper normal uh [ __ ]

00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:22.640
either way the entire documentary i was

00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:24.000
like yeah of course

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.839
century of the self yeah the entire time

00:56:25.839 --> 00:56:27.839
i was like this is of course

00:56:27.839 --> 00:56:30.240
you knew about bernays and the pr firms

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.440
and stuff

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:32.640
i knew about

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.240
when it opens i think this is the one

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:35.839
that opens with how like ford was

00:56:35.839 --> 00:56:38.160
selling [ __ ] to the nazis no that was a

00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:39.520
different one that was the one about

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:40.480
them

00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:42.319
ford selling stuff to the nazis and how

00:56:42.319 --> 00:56:44.079
hitler kind of got you know everyone's

00:56:44.079 --> 00:56:45.359
like well hitler kind of i guess

00:56:45.359 --> 00:56:46.400
everyone doesn't defend hitler in this

00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:47.599
way but people were like well hitler did

00:56:47.599 --> 00:56:49.440
help the economy people do say that like

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:51.599
really it was just foreign

00:56:51.599 --> 00:56:53.359
time man of the year

00:56:53.359 --> 00:56:55.119
it was just running from the bushes

00:56:55.119 --> 00:56:56.319
and they propped him up just like

00:56:56.319 --> 00:56:57.760
america has been propping up dictators

00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.359
forever yeah so like that didn't

00:56:59.359 --> 00:57:00.960
surprise me at all i knew it's so insane

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.480
to think that they made the bushes made

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:05.040
money off the holocaust

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:06.960
that's america they know that america

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.640
made money off world war one and that's

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.559
where we became what we are you i hear

00:57:10.559 --> 00:57:11.520
that we're

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:12.960
you know we were selling stuff and we

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:14.160
got factories it wasn't like they were

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:16.079
supplying gas to the gas no one's like

00:57:16.079 --> 00:57:18.240
we sold it we sold arms we sold it gas

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:20.559
chambers guns to both sides yeah we sold

00:57:20.559 --> 00:57:21.920
everything at both sides that's why we

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:23.280
were neutral we weren't neutral on some

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.119
moral standpoint we were neutral to make

00:57:25.119 --> 00:57:27.520
money yeah and then when the japs

00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:28.799
[ __ ] brought us into it we had to

00:57:28.799 --> 00:57:30.960
[ __ ] crack some skulls and drop some

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.799
space-age bombs on

00:57:32.799 --> 00:57:36.480
the japanese we disrespected them

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:40.599
we came at them hard yeah

00:57:46.079 --> 00:57:47.920
yeah that's the first hour of that that

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:49.599
which again that's that's like nothing

00:57:49.599 --> 00:57:51.520
mind-blowing but it goes that's setting

00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.200
the stage like these are these people's

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:54.960
fathers and then there's the next

00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:56.720
generation and here's what happened

00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:59.119
the guy who was financing the holocaust

00:57:59.119 --> 00:58:00.960
his son started the cia and here's what

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:02.480
they've been up to of course they're not

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:03.359
like

00:58:03.359 --> 00:58:04.799
it's i'm just saying that it's never

00:58:04.799 --> 00:58:06.319
surprising me to know that the people

00:58:06.319 --> 00:58:07.920
who have billions of dollars got it

00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:09.839
through pretty much

00:58:09.839 --> 00:58:11.119
acts of

00:58:11.119 --> 00:58:13.839
you know extreme violence definitely and

00:58:13.839 --> 00:58:15.839
war against humanity that's crimes for

00:58:15.839 --> 00:58:17.839
sure definitely and those same people on

00:58:17.839 --> 00:58:19.599
the news so that's when you're like yeah

00:58:19.599 --> 00:58:21.040
that [ __ ] they they own and people like

00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:23.200
to you're ridiculous it's like

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:24.400
it's not ridiculous but it is not

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.079
ridiculous it's not but nobody wants to

00:58:26.079 --> 00:58:27.520
hear it though it just but it because

00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:30.160
it's it always it always uh

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.319
sounds conspiratorial yeah it sounds

00:58:32.319 --> 00:58:34.720
crazy because it's like it is crazy

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:36.079
so when you hear something that's crazy

00:58:36.079 --> 00:58:37.280
people are quick to be like that can't

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:38.799
be true yeah then my life's all [ __ ]

00:58:38.799 --> 00:58:40.000

little league's going well it's almost

00:58:44.079 --> 00:58:45.359
like yeah dude the cia owns the news

00:58:45.359 --> 00:58:46.640

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.480
those it's like well what what can we

00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:06.480
possibly do just not watch it yeah and

00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.480
tell everyone like by the way you know

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:10.559
don't pay attention and that's and again

00:59:10.559 --> 00:59:13.040
without watching without delving too

00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:14.319
much into these documentaries i can

00:59:14.319 --> 00:59:15.599
still watch the news and be like oh this

00:59:15.599 --> 00:59:17.440
is [ __ ] you just flip channels and

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:19.119
be like oh this is all

00:59:19.119 --> 00:59:20.799
there's an agenda on both sides yeah for

00:59:20.799 --> 00:59:22.400

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:25.359
like can we stop yeah yeah and and

00:59:25.359 --> 00:59:27.119
everybody because again you have to pick

00:59:27.119 --> 00:59:28.799
a side so now you get on social media

00:59:28.799 --> 00:59:31.599

00:59:43.119 --> 00:59:44.160
um

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:45.520
michelle wolf's new show just had a

00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:47.280
[ __ ] sketch about how ice it's

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:48.880

people that organized it and like put it

00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.720
together but not the [ __ ] individual

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:03.359

like it sucks it's you like the they uh

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.920

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.680
interview with uh johnny carson uh and

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.680
it's good like he had barbara wallers is

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.359
interviewing him and she's like you

01:03:31.359 --> 01:03:33.200
never talk about politics

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.960
and he's like i always notice that all

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.240
my colleagues whenever they start to

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.079
talk about politics they become less

01:03:38.079 --> 01:03:40.160
funny he was like you have to turn in a

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.720
little bit of humor yeah once you start

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.559
talking about what you like believe in

01:03:44.559 --> 01:03:45.680
and [ __ ]

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.319
and it's i have never ever seen anybody

01:03:48.319 --> 01:03:50.160
make me laugh with a

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.520
socially

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:54.400
just or politically just statement that

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.920
doesn't make me [ __ ] it's not funny

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:56.960
yeah it's like

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.720
funny the point sometimes i'll go on

01:03:58.720 --> 01:03:59.760
stage and say things that are

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.280
inappropriate mm-hmm

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.799
well every single thing but that's the

01:04:02.799 --> 01:04:04.160
point of it like

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:06.319
because i know it's a silly thing to say

01:04:06.319 --> 01:04:08.400
yeah so that's why it's funny yeah and

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.280
people will still be like that's

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.400
offensive that you're saying it's like

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.079
yeah that's why i'm saying it it's it's

01:04:12.079 --> 01:04:14.480
a dumb i know it's dumb yeah right the

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:16.400
only like i've seen chappelle bits that

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:18.720
now looking back when it could be

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.640
geared more towards like sjw stuff but

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.000
it was just it was funny about him

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.359
living in such a nice house he doesn't

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:24.400
want to call the cops because the cops

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.599
will just think he's a black dude like

01:04:25.599 --> 01:04:27.039
rob in this house yeah but he put

01:04:27.039 --> 01:04:28.079

01:04:28.079 --> 01:04:29.119
everything

01:04:29.119 --> 01:04:30.079

and then like okay it was just it was

01:04:34.559 --> 01:04:36.160
funny well maybe if the

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.000
police would stop shooting black people

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.079

shaking hands and talking to every

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.199

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.239
also one of the biggest uh culture

01:10:12.239 --> 01:10:13.679
shocks was black people putting sugar

01:10:13.679 --> 01:10:15.440
and cream in their coffee i went to a i

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.920
was at a [ __ ] starbucks or i was at a

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:20.320
coffee shop and i watched this lady put

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.560
12 packs of sugar into her coffee and i

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.480
was seriously i was like holy [ __ ] this

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:26.400
lady i thought that was a crazy lady and

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.920
then a week later i saw this i was like

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:30.400

because it's something that has to come

01:10:42.719 --> 01:10:43.920
to a head because when i started doing

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.760

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:19.760
on the reddit i was like dude we're

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.360
pretty much ocean's 11.

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:22.800
we were like we came up with a

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:25.360
diabolical scheme yeah we have done 80

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.360
you know however many this is episode 89

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.360
yeah we've always had we always had a a

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:30.880
very contentious

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.239
relationship with our listeners dude

01:14:32.239 --> 01:14:34.400
it's very like saddam hussein

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:37.280
dirty sweaty rebels

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:38.880
there's always rebels we gotta [ __ ]

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.560
put down exactly i'll line them up

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.320
against the wall next my idea is that

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:43.600
we're going to just film the whole

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:44.880
session even if we end up cutting

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.239
something if you're a patreon guy you'll

01:14:46.239 --> 01:14:48.560
just get to see the whole glorious naked

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.159
process dude

01:14:50.159 --> 01:14:51.360
but sometimes be careful because

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:52.320
sometimes you think you might want to

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:53.520
see what your dad looks like naked and

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:57.719
