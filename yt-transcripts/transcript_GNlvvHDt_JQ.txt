the pal we'll mess with the lighting for

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.599

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.120

white rawr white rigged

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.199

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:50.400
dude

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.039
i'm like i think your dog chose me

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:54.560
that's actually hot one elevator from

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.680
the lobby

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.440
uh there are

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.440
one elevator per wings this is one wing

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.360
of the building okay yeah this building

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.039
a little fun fact the building we're now

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:05.520
used to be an insane asylum very special

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.880
crazy

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.319
and i said as soon as i got here it's

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:10.400
like this looks like gotham he did

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.520
and then he's like used to be insane at

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.680
times so i was like arkham arkham dude

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.199
it's nice that they let the insane

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:16.960
people have their own fires in their

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:17.919
quarters

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.120
you had to

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.840
although this could have been like the

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.880
you know it could have been set up this

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.160
could have been like the orderly

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.199
quarters

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:26.639
you know what i mean

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:28.240
same the insane

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.600
the insanos are probably down in the

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.000
basement

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.120
we definitely walked through the area

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.880
where they were like lobotomizing people

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.479
for sure

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:37.759
definitely down there that they probably

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:39.440
doing in the woods around here

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.720
do you think maybe that's why the dog

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.560
was going nuts because he he felt an

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.240
apparition

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.600
possibly i mean

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.039
my dogs come here and they freak the

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:49.440
[Â __Â ] out there's probably tons of crazy

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.199
ghosts what do you think he freaked out

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:52.639
because he knew his owner was about to

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:54.560
get whited by us

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.599
true

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:57.280
was that a boy dog or a girl dog i

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.440
thought it was a girl if it was a girl

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.840
both of

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.520
them dude there's too many guys here for

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.240
that darn not to get

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.560
that should be whited

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.599
come over

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:11.360
it's like a little bit of dog play it's

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.720
the same thing

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.360
there's a little bit of dog play nothing

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.680
nothing illegal nothing illegal but just

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.680
like uh just making out

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.599
just like your sex with a platonic play

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:22.880
with a dog

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.080
you're just like petting it like

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.520
throwing a ball to it and just getting

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.759
sucked

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:29.680
it's actually yeah that's fair that's

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.280
fair i mean if you're not eating a

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.720
peanut butter and the peanut butter just

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.639
happens to be on your dick and balls

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:36.639
yeah that's a big oops i spilled it but

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:38.880
i didn't want to waste it well can a dog

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.639
you can't i think by law you're not

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:42.479
allowed to penetrate a dog but a dog can

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:44.879
definitely lick something off your body

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:47.120
yeah like a dog can't not seems like the

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.599
cops could walk in guns drawn and they

00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:51.039
don't have [Â __Â ] to say

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:52.479
yeah they can't do anything yeah that's

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:53.680
one of those situations where like a

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.360
lady thinks she has [Â __Â ] good intel

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.560
and they bust in they're like god damn

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.960
it [Â __Â ] it's just nutella

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.879
see the peanut butter on the wall it

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:05.280
must have [Â __Â ] got out of here

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.400
no i think you're just not allowed to

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.840
penetrate your dog or i don't think

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.960
you're allowed to suck your dog's a dick

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.720
i think there's just no genital play

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.680
because you could do you can do it

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.120
whatever you put a glove on can you jerk

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.199
them off

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:18.800
if you're in a veterinarian parking lot

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.360
i think you're like

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.039
no i think because you can do pretty

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:24.400
heavy petting with your dog you can

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.520
spoon

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.840
you can

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.240
you can kiss your dog you can do like

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.759
everything but yeah

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:33.519
you might be able to [Â __Â ] him if you got

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:35.200
the dog catcher loop over him and you're

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.919
still able to put your dick in his butt

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:39.200
that might be the loophole you can do

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.200
everything besides all the way you just

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.560
can't go all the way with your dog what

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.000
if you get hard while you're expressing

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.399
their anal glands

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:47.760
that's on you

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.279
all right but i'm not going to jail for

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:51.279
that you should

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:54.839
no it could be anything

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.279
i want to bring my dog to the vet to do

00:08:57.279 --> 00:08:58.880
that like express the anal glands and

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.519
jump in front of it

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.560
i have a cousin uh we used to hang out

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.000
with her all the time we were kids and

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
when her cat was in heat she used to

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.800
stick a pencil in its [Â __Â ] what yeah to

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.279
relieve it of its symptoms

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:16.800
to relieve her of her symptoms probably

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.279
yeah wait so she would why why you have

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:20.560
to wait till the cat's in heat is its

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.600
[Â __Â ] like completely locked down

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.680
it would come out sharpened

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.440
[Laughter]

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.959
why in heat though i guess i guess

00:09:28.959 --> 00:09:31.120
because she was like yelling like right

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.040
up yeah she was trying to get weighted

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.000
the cat

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.120
the cat was being fresh as hell

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.040
penises have like a prong or something i

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.600
think they're barbed barbed yeah

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.040
so that lady probably wasn't they're

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.800
like i'm done with that pencil

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.040

yeah that's the worst part about [Â __Â ]

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.959
a cat is like when it looks back at you

00:09:56.959 --> 00:09:58.240
and let you know that you're not even

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.120

accept their stepdad and they're like

00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:41.120
they're basically praising him being

they probably brought him down there for

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.120
a big

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.919
hell now

true

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.120

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.480
who else was down there chris tucker was

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.880

obviously like yeah he's the real face

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.650

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:14.170
[Laughter]

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.240
you came in hot dude oh man i would love

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.080
to see like the uh depositions just to

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.679
see who took the most [Â __Â ] up way to

00:22:23.679 --> 00:22:25.760
get to the island like if you could get

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.120
on the plane

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.200
you know what's what's the

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.720
what's the most difficult way that you

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.000
took to get there fan boat

00:22:36.159 --> 00:22:38.080
pedal submarine

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:38.880
yeah

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.400
what'd you say

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.000
jet ski would be pretty tight yeah yeah

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.080
spacey probably stormed it like d-day

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.280
you'd probably talk to the beach

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.840
you don't have enough little boys

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.600
you can't get me back

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.960
no private ryan they're just walking

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.720
around picking up their boy's arms like

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.919
spacey's just walking around picking up

00:22:55.919 --> 00:22:58.559
kids dicks

00:22:59.679 --> 00:23:01.039
they'll never get old just goof like

00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:02.720
what really happened there maybe he was

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.240
all innocent maybe everyone's wrong

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.360
maybe people just keep killing

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.360
themselves in their cell because

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.559
they're just misunderstood and they

00:23:08.559 --> 00:23:10.480
actually weren't pedophiles because jail

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.840
is just so bad i mean if you're

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.919
accustomed to not being in jail you know

00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:15.200
he's like i just had a fun place for my

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.240
friends to hang out what the hell

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.440
everybody have a pedophile i'm gonna

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.799
hang myself

00:23:18.799 --> 00:23:20.400

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.559
looking while i hang myself

00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:24.159
and then his buddy hung himself too same

00:23:24.159 --> 00:23:27.360
circumstances yeah he somehow eluded

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.840
french guy

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.080

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.159
french pedophile which is kind of uh you

00:23:34.159 --> 00:23:37.159

00:23:49.919 --> 00:23:51.679
pedophile business it's a sick business

00:23:51.679 --> 00:23:54.000

that's where i recognize your film what

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.559

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.440
[Â __Â ] epstein cave in antarctica or

little sun well if you're getting

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.480
i think about that

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.640
people molesting dogs like don't mean

00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.919
going all the way with them not just

00:28:59.919 --> 00:29:01.919

00:29:01.919 --> 00:29:04.000
already established is cool yeah not i

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.520
mean to stay within the law just

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.039
grooming them yeah i'm like an old

00:29:07.039 --> 00:29:08.080
testament

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.840
i i like the old testament rule back

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.679
then before jesus came across and like

00:29:11.679 --> 00:29:13.279
like when it was just follow the rules

00:29:13.279 --> 00:29:14.720
don't question them

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.240
good what do you think the old testament

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.480
had to say about molesting dogs but they

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.840
probably didn't give a [Â __Â ]

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.039
to be honest

00:29:21.039 --> 00:29:22.240
if you [Â __Â ] the dog i mean they would

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.600
probably be like you know you probably

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.640
wouldn't be able to become like the

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.200
highest level priest or whatever

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.120
but you could probably have a nice farm

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.559
like yeah he [Â __Â ] his dogs but whatever

00:29:30.559 --> 00:29:32.320
you think when like dog [Â __Â ] became a

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.520
problem somebody went to god was like

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.960
yeah we should really add an 11th

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.720
commandment

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.520
true

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.200
maybe that's what the golden calf what

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.360
was it does the bible say you can't live

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.399
with the beast

00:29:42.399 --> 00:29:43.170
oh

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:46.380
[Music]

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.720
really

00:29:50.799 --> 00:29:52.720
he didn't hear me the first time

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.279
exodus

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.279
now that i'm seeing it in god's word

00:30:05.279 --> 00:30:07.120
that makes perfect sense i take back

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.880
everything i said on the spot everything

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.600
even about the peanut butter

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.120
which section of the bible like where's

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.000
that from exodus bro it's early

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.399
oh wow

00:30:19.039 --> 00:30:20.840
what

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.600
about what if uh

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.200
is your lady allowed to get stuffed by

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.039
the dog yeah leviticus was in the

00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:28.720
horsepower

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.480
so exodus that's when they were

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.799
wandering the desert they just got freed

00:30:32.799 --> 00:30:35.039
yeah that was like no no no knock it off

00:30:35.039 --> 00:30:36.480
yeah people are trying to sleep these

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.799
are just [Â __Â ] donkeys like what

00:30:38.799 --> 00:30:40.399
there's literally no rules against this

00:30:40.399 --> 00:30:42.159
they're like that's a death penalty i'm

00:30:42.159 --> 00:30:43.600
trying to sleep and you're coming loud

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.159
over with this

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.080
sheep women can no they both can't

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.080
there's there's two separate passages

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.919
one that says women can't one that says

00:30:55.919 --> 00:30:58.399
men can and if a man has sexual

00:30:58.399 --> 00:31:00.240
relations with an animal

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.679
the man and the

00:31:01.679 --> 00:31:04.159
animal must be killed that makes sense

00:31:04.159 --> 00:31:06.080
and the wife i'm sure

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.640
even if she was gone so just just so

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.880
you're saying in both things the bible's

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.279
clear from old testament onward no

00:31:13.279 --> 00:31:16.600
[Â __Â ] animals

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:21.840
[Laughter]

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.080
is the man who has sexual relations with

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.640
that i might get that tatted dude

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.679
what is that exactly it's like

00:31:27.679 --> 00:31:30.320
deuteronomy 18

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.350
20 i might get that

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.960
[Laughter]

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.600
is the man who has sex with any animal

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.000
any [Â __Â ] animal

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.480
competition that's the latest one about

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.399
yeah dude imagine the guy who got who

00:31:44.399 --> 00:31:46.480
got the last one written about it which

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.640
is like he was just [Â __Â ] the [Â __Â ] out

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.399
like he must have went ham that dude was

00:31:50.399 --> 00:31:51.460
so cursed dude

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.480
[Laughter]

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.880
guard dog what book is duder in

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.120
older now that's old that's ot

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.720
i thought that's ot right

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.799
dude so t

00:32:02.799 --> 00:32:03.919
i think it's good

00:32:03.919 --> 00:32:05.279
i think new testament says something

00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:06.080
like

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.720
the yorkie is the original fleshlight or

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.559
something like that if it's yorkie you

00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:12.559
can porky

00:32:12.559 --> 00:32:14.159
guard dog what is the quran say about

00:32:14.159 --> 00:32:16.480

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.399
like you better not you devil

00:32:18.399 --> 00:32:20.720
dude yeah don't you dare

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.399
i'm pretty sure every single religion

00:32:22.399 --> 00:32:24.399
forbids dude it's so funny that that was

00:32:24.399 --> 00:32:26.480
a thing like the spiritual traditions

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.159
had to like tackle head-on be like all

00:32:28.159 --> 00:32:29.840
right we got to do something about this

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.679
this is a [Â __Â ] problem

00:32:31.679 --> 00:32:33.039
yeah

00:32:33.039 --> 00:32:34.720
it wasn't a commandment though they

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.600
didn't

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.720
that's why they had it yeah this is like

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.080
the bill of rights obviously there you

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.600
know they had to like flesh that there's

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.960
an amendment

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.799
yeah you can't do that what curse it is

00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:43.919
the man

00:32:43.919 --> 00:32:46.480

kirsten is he who curses

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.559

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.880
yesterday about like the old like

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.760
ancient hinduism back in like bc era

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.960

mountain dude they were like up until i

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.399
think the 1800s they're doing human

00:33:26.399 --> 00:33:28.480
sacrifices in india

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.799
according to this book i should say and

00:33:30.799 --> 00:33:32.799
the yogis would [Â __Â ] so they would

00:33:32.799 --> 00:33:34.880
sacrifice a human and the yogis would

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.720
eat their lungs would fry their lungs up

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.200
and eat them and like they what happened

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.000
was in 1830 the english were over there

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.919
colonizing being bad boys but they

00:33:43.919 --> 00:33:46.080
needed i think in calcutta

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.519
and again i'm just going off this book

00:33:47.519 --> 00:33:49.279
but calcutta was the

00:33:49.279 --> 00:33:51.679
like the central deity there was cali

00:33:51.679 --> 00:33:53.279
the goddess of destruction who like you

00:33:53.279 --> 00:33:54.880
really needed to give like good human

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.720
sacrifices every now and again

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.159
and like dude they were like you weren't

00:33:58.159 --> 00:33:59.039
supposed to do it but every now and

00:33:59.039 --> 00:34:00.159
again people were like super religious

00:34:00.159 --> 00:34:01.679
be like dude we gotta [Â __Â ] cut

00:34:01.679 --> 00:34:03.600
someone's head off and give it to cali

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.360
and they took four englishmen they

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.960
kidnapped four englishmen and then the

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.000
english were like where the [Â __Â ] did

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.359
those guys go and they investigated

00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:10.960

00:34:17.119 --> 00:34:18.320

00:34:30.919 --> 00:34:34.240
150 years

there's somebody in my woods

00:34:44.079 --> 00:34:45.599

00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:47.359
recently dude where are your woods so

00:34:47.359 --> 00:34:49.280
there's a stretch of woods near my house

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.480
uh well right now we're living in a

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.760
temporary place because our house is

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.159
getting all like remodeled at the top

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:55.359
levels getting remodeled so we're in a

00:34:55.359 --> 00:34:57.440
temporary setup but i would frequent

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.640
these woods before that's how i know

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.560
about them so if you go up kelly drive

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.880
there's a little sliver of woods

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.720
so there's a little like

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.839
if you're on like where the [Â __Â ] is this

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:09.520
if you're on like 29th

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.880
she told me a very vicious story about a

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.640
time she did lsd with a gentleman on an

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.560
online date and then proceeded while

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.839
they started having sex told him like

00:40:25.839 --> 00:40:27.200
you have the smallest penis in the world

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.960
and i have to stop oh my god while the

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.359
guy was tripping and then she took a nap

00:40:31.359 --> 00:40:33.200
in his apartment

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.640
and then left

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.319
it's a witch dude and i was like you

00:40:36.319 --> 00:40:38.319

celebrated quincy ascara

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.760

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.400

about the hitler stuff told me she

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.880
basically psychologically devastated a

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.480
stranger for no good reason i can't

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.880
believe that's a first date conversation

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.040
we talked about it all i had sex on lsd

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.560

[Â __Â ] it was so small she had to stop

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.240
and tell him i tell him and when she

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.520
woke up from her nap she went to bed all

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.960

00:41:23.599 --> 00:41:25.119
on acid and then she was like i'm

catching an uber i'm out of here she

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.680

i was like you realize she's like no i

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.359

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.400
even when you're not tripping on lsd

very well maintained day two of letting

00:42:21.599 --> 00:42:23.599

this i'm sorry was this like years ago

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:35.440
yeah this was several years i was about

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.880
to say like every dumb [Â __Â ] who

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:38.480
celebrates brunch now considers himself

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.160
a witch like this sounds like it was a

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.839
time when like this was serious i don't

00:42:41.839 --> 00:42:43.040
think she even considered herself a

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.720
witch that was the most [Â __Â ] up part

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.200
this lady was just a witch

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.800
like she never once said the word i'm a

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.160
witch i mean if i had pressed her on it

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.040
do you think you're a witch you would

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.640
say yes obviously

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.720
but she never once said witch she was

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.079
just like this is what i'm into and it

00:42:56.079 --> 00:42:58.720

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.079

i would imagine hers was large and in

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.800

00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:04.799
the news at all i heard it i heard

00:55:04.799 --> 00:55:05.839
they're not winning for i heard

00:55:05.839 --> 00:55:07.680
ukraine's not winning right now

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:10.799
um i mean but they're a second half

00:55:10.799 --> 00:55:12.400
second half

00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.799
by the russian losing situation yeah for

00:55:14.799 --> 00:55:16.960
sure any way you cut it for sure you

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.559
think that guy's gonna die then they're

00:55:18.559 --> 00:55:19.599
gonna kill the president of the

00:55:19.599 --> 00:55:21.200
president i notice he's wearing like the

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.880
green he's wearing his military greens

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.720
he's wearing his flack [Â __Â ] right yeah

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:27.599
he has fatigues he's dressed up yeah

00:55:27.599 --> 00:55:29.280
you know i hope look you could be in

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.799
that position that dude was a comedian

00:55:30.799 --> 00:55:31.760
you know

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:32.880
what do you think the point of this is

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.400
dude

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:35.599
i'm going to get i'm going to defend us

00:55:35.599 --> 00:55:37.359
from russia i also i was trying to put a

00:55:37.359 --> 00:55:39.440
positive spin on it today

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:40.640
and i thought about it i'm like you know

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.799
it's for sure sad it's terrible

00:55:42.799 --> 00:55:44.720
although the suicide rate in russia i

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:47.040
think's the highest in the world

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:49.839
so you know glass half empty maybe if

00:55:49.839 --> 00:55:51.920
they win a war

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:53.040
less people will kill themselves in

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.160
russia

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:56.000
class half less have you know glass half

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.160
full i'm saying yeah it's a bad you know

00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.079
i'm just i'm a bright cider

00:56:00.079 --> 00:56:01.520
so i'm saying like it's why are people

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:03.520
in russia so sad

00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:04.799
because they don't have [Â __Â ] any

00:56:04.799 --> 00:56:07.119
natural resources

00:56:07.119 --> 00:56:09.440
they still haven't gotten a bud

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.359
no apparently russia killed themselves

00:56:11.359 --> 00:56:13.280
big time dude well it's cold and dark

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:14.000
and

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.280
shitty there i mean they came out of

00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:17.280
like a totalitarian regime that failed

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:18.960
that's [Â __Â ] bummer like we're the

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.880
best buy into this and they [Â __Â ] ruin

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:22.559
your whole life is dedicated to just

00:56:22.559 --> 00:56:24.319
like totally owning you and i was like

00:56:24.319 --> 00:56:26.559
oh [Â __Â ] that fails i do kind of like the

00:56:26.559 --> 00:56:28.480
idea of having a uniform

00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:30.160
if we had less options for clothes you

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:31.520
could get that working at chuck e cheese

00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:32.030
john

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:33.200
[Laughter]

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.799
i'd be down for citizen uniforms to be

00:56:34.799 --> 00:56:36.160
honest i mean it's the next thing you

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:38.720
just assigned me a job i'd be

00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:40.559
dude you think that dude you think that

00:56:40.559 --> 00:56:41.760
then they're telling you what day you

00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:43.760
can work with what your job kind of does

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:46.240
yeah but every job i've ever had no no

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.599
but you don't get it you can't switch

00:56:47.599 --> 00:56:49.280
jobs that's the thing i know i'm gonna

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:51.599
be [Â __Â ] making pink dildos for my

00:56:51.599 --> 00:56:53.359
whole life and i love it

00:56:53.359 --> 00:56:55.280
come home you know in russia they tried

00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:56.960
to what the [Â __Â ] did they try to do a

00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:59.119
thing called the continuous work cycle

00:56:59.119 --> 00:57:00.559
where like the factories were going

00:57:00.559 --> 00:57:02.720
seven days a week mm-hmm and it just

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:05.200
completely probably fell in his face

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.480
yeah that's that's like you and you you

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:07.839
live in a household you and your wife

00:57:07.839 --> 00:57:09.520
would never have the same days they try

00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:11.280
to get rid of like the sunday beat of

00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:12.880
like saturday and sunday pretty much

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:14.720
everyone's off for the most part yeah

00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:15.839
you'd have whole families that would

00:57:15.839 --> 00:57:16.960
just never see each other because there

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.720
were days off one in the line you just

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.200
see each other shift change that was it

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:23.040
two ships passing in the night

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.160
apparently it failed they thought like

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.599
we'll get the factories going seven days

00:57:25.599 --> 00:57:27.839
a week but the problem was

00:57:27.839 --> 00:57:30.160
they would assign people like so i would

00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:32.559
leave my post and like you would come in

00:57:32.559 --> 00:57:34.160
but like you you know they were just

00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:35.599
they didn't let anyone specialize they

00:57:35.599 --> 00:57:36.880
would just move around whatever needed

00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:38.160
to be done so everyone just stunk at

00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:39.440
everything they did

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:41.040
the whole thing fell apart

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.480
i don't think it's a good idea to run

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:45.839
that machinery for 24 hours a day 365

00:57:45.839 --> 00:57:47.599
days a year right you should give it a

00:57:47.599 --> 00:57:50.079
rest dismiss that's not like well maybe

00:57:50.079 --> 00:57:52.000
but you know they were trying to win so

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.760
could be that that could that could get

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:55.839
you in the zone of like never having sex

00:57:55.839 --> 00:57:58.720
again though that's true super busy

00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:00.799
if the russians sent me to space i would

00:58:00.799 --> 00:58:02.400
go there and do whatever they said for

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.680
the rest of my life you are a [Â __Â ]

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:04.960
russophile

00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.880
i just want to go to space and i'll do

00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:08.799
whatever it takes so you you would like

00:58:08.799 --> 00:58:10.240
though just to be

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.160
just a face among the crowd

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:14.160
show up clock in

00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:16.079
in the totalitarian regime if i knew i

00:58:16.079 --> 00:58:17.359
was going to be able to see the earth

00:58:17.359 --> 00:58:19.599
from space i'd be fine with it i'd be

00:58:19.599 --> 00:58:21.200
happy that might be you might not come

00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:22.960
back they'll call they're not sending

00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:24.960
you space dude you're going to be in the

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:26.319
factory

00:58:26.319 --> 00:58:28.720
if they're sweating

00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:30.880
space imagine they promised you space

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:33.200
and then the regime collapsed

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:34.559
you'd probably be [Â __Â ] john what if

00:58:34.559 --> 00:58:37.680
you had to make your dildos in space

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:39.119
even better

00:58:39.119 --> 00:58:41.520
space dildos

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:42.400
i love how you guys are turning this

00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:43.359
thing in the whole [Â __Â ] laughing

00:58:43.359 --> 00:58:45.280
matter i'm trying to talk

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:47.520
i'm trying to be [Â __Â ] serious i'm not

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:49.200
joking about going to space i would

00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:52.079
literally be a russian [Â __Â ] cog in

00:58:52.079 --> 00:58:53.440
the machine

00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:54.559
if they were like we're going to send

00:58:54.559 --> 00:58:56.319
you space when you're 70 years old after

00:58:56.319 --> 00:58:59.280
you retire well that's yeah that

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:00.960
you wouldn't handle the g-force dude

00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.400
it's a better chance of going to space

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:04.480
than i got right now you'd be surprised

00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:06.240
you don't i mean i'm gonna have to shell

00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:08.960
out cash that's a lot of money work be

00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:10.960
like a space steward

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.319
i wish i would have been a [Â __Â ]

00:59:12.319 --> 00:59:15.040
astronaut instead of a [Â __Â ] comedian

00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:17.119
dude it's not too late it's not too late

00:59:17.119 --> 00:59:19.680

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:21.040
gonna get in

00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:24.400

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.040
week

probably yeah i don't know why they

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:09.280
might rule if i'm going to space

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:13.400
no space space is off the table

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.240
so that's your position on the conflict

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:22.550
