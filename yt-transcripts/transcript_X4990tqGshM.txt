00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:30.880
game i

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.240

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.240
almost the first game i i was storming

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.440
shelter so people

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.120
people this is how nasty we were playing

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.080
because you know they were just kind of

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.200
hide behind [ __ ]

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.039
i was going and actively like finding

00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:42.480
where they're at and hitting them point

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.840
blank i'd run up and say surrendered if

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.880
they didn't say anything back i would

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.080
hit them point blank

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.840
i was [ __ ] people up there yeah so i

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.679

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.760
lg's just he was shooting six inches

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.440
over my head oh but anywhere i was

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.799
standing it would there just be a line

00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:00.400
of fire coming right over me

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.000
so i would run up on people the first

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.360
time they pulled a whistle i went i went

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.000

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.480
was like bro you're [ __ ] lucky

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.000
yeah the next round i did the same exact

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.360
thing obviously so i stormed around the

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.160
perimeter

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.520
i caught in on someone and i was like

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.679

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.160
[ __ ]

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.760
uh you would have wiped it right off you

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.200

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.880
somebody blank shot in the face well it

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.559

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.799
foot rule and i was like

00:19:30.799 --> 00:19:32.160
i guess i have to offer him surrender

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.200
then i went right up to him like

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.320

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.840

00:20:28.559 --> 00:20:29.600
doing a thing where they'd hold their

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.720
hands out and shoot

there

00:27:55.679 --> 00:27:57.840
i'm observing i'm seeing people just

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.360
drinking like

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.039
like people at that we were there for

00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:02.640
what you guys were there a little longer

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.919
but i was watching a couple people who

00:28:03.919 --> 00:28:06.000
got there and it was just like a full

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.600
night's worth of drinking in in the span

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.360
of an hour and a half easily

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.760
like you know 9 10 drinks so everyone so

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.799
alcohol had been done

00:28:12.799 --> 00:28:14.799
everyone did alcohol yeah we did alcohol

00:28:14.799 --> 00:28:16.559
and then you came back did

00:28:16.559 --> 00:28:18.960
yeah and then we decided to try other

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.399
drugs tsared

00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:23.440
we mollied yeah a couple of us no names

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.480
majority majority and it was great it

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.679
was going very well

00:28:27.679 --> 00:28:30.240
for some reason the first one i took and

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.000
a couple people took were they felt like

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.919
duds yeah after like an hour and a half

00:28:33.919 --> 00:28:34.960
it was like these aren't working like

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.039
they usually do we should take more yeah

00:28:37.039 --> 00:28:38.799
which we did

00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:41.919
and they worked yes and then we were

00:28:41.919 --> 00:28:43.919
and we were off and then this is where

00:28:43.919 --> 00:28:45.520
things on this trip

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.760
you guys thought that was a pr nightmare

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.039
yeah it's nothing

00:28:49.039 --> 00:28:50.720
compared to the trauma i was about to

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.480
experience well the mushrooms came out

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.640
then a giant bag of mushrooms was laid

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.240
upon the bar yeah

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.240
just laid out just yeah it's like this

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.279
is for anybody

00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:02.720
and i had already taken

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.200
quite a amount quite a lot of molly at

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:05.840
this point

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.440
and i decided it was time for me to

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.200
start eating handfuls of mushrooms

00:29:11.279 --> 00:29:14.880
and uh at first it was great sure

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.799
at first it was wonderful yeah i fired

00:29:16.799 --> 00:29:18.399
switching between the molly

00:29:18.399 --> 00:29:21.440
and into just hallucinations yeah

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.159
seemed great it was very fun and then

00:29:24.159 --> 00:29:25.120
things took

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.840
an incredibly dark turn yep and i

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.720
couldn't see

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.279

yeah i did i i yeah i did i did pretty

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:35.760
much black

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.120
mushrooms will black you out yeah

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.039
especially that much they immobilize bro

00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:41.840
it was like it started i think you were

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.039
i was still chatting with you when it

00:29:43.039 --> 00:29:44.240
started i had six eyes

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.919
yeah you had six eyes everybody had

00:29:45.919 --> 00:29:47.760
multiple eyes everyone had multiple

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:48.640
faces and [ __ ]

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.640
that was i was hearing uh people were

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.760
telling me i was getting reports from

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.960
everyone the next day

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.080
and like dude like i think uh

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.159
spud had like six fa he had like four

00:29:58.159 --> 00:29:59.760
faces from one i was watching people

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.120
communicate telepathically

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.320
being like i just thought that it was

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.080
very [ __ ] funny to walk in on you're

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:04.559
lucky

00:30:04.559 --> 00:30:06.480
you're lucky you didn't do it yeah i

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.080
know you said you yeah yeah

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.000
you have i have that is bad i have my

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.520
five grammar coming up in a week

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.720
basically that was always like

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.480
let me just let me chill i should have

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.919
never done that no you should have that

00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:17.200
was important you did that

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.240
in hindsight i'm like that was cool but

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.399
at the time that was oh yeah legit the

00:30:22.399 --> 00:30:23.919
worst thing i've ever experienced

00:30:23.919 --> 00:30:25.279
i was telling you man you went into it

00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:28.000
like it was literally cold of dionyses

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.240
yeah that just got absolutely stormed by

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.320
medieval catholicism

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.840
you guys where he was drinking it was

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.880
molly and all of a sudden

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.399
it's time to examine everything yeah

00:30:40.399 --> 00:30:41.919
dude how about some trauma you want to

00:30:41.919 --> 00:30:44.080
relive that a thousand times like it's

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.440
brand new every time for five hours

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.880
which is funny too because that's like a

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.640
really effective form of uh

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.960
therapy that was yeah exposure therapy

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.559
that's how you move a thing from your

00:30:54.559 --> 00:30:55.440
amygdala

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.440
down to the area of like where things

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.720
have been processed and they don't

00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.600
affect your

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.840
biology yeah it was pretty crazy there

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.360
was some things that apparently were a

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.960
little more traumatic than i

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.279
originally thought yeah and they came

00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:08.720
back

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.960
yeah quite a bit yeah man and every time

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.799
i'd be like did that happen

00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:15.440
oh [ __ ] and then a minute later i'd be

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:15.840
like

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.880
oh [ __ ] did that happen just over and

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.240
over again and then i'd forget about it

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:20.799
keep going

00:31:20.799 --> 00:31:22.559
we were sitting out by this fire every

00:31:22.559 --> 00:31:24.559
single thing somebody said

00:31:24.559 --> 00:31:26.880
it the way my brain was processing it it

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.480
felt like they had just said it

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.799
a minute before so like if you were like

00:31:30.799 --> 00:31:32.640
hey what's up man it would have felt

i was just smoking dude i've come to the

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.640
conclusion that smoking weed

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.960
doesn't really do i have to eat it i can

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.160
i'm sure like the dabs and a lot of

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.440
stuff would [ __ ] me up if i sit there

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.560
and smoke weed

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.079

[Laughter]

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.560
i don't think it's a bad thing i'm like

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.520
i should have cooked burgers for

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:58.000
everybody i'm so [ __ ] selfish

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.200
yeah that second night was one of the

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.960
funnest nights i mean that whole day was

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.160
one of the funnest days of my life

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.359
easily one of the funnest days of my

00:40:03.359 --> 00:40:04.319
life yeah that was fun

00:40:04.319 --> 00:40:05.839
that was really fun and then at the end

00:40:05.839 --> 00:40:07.359
of that i mean

00:40:07.359 --> 00:40:09.040
i regret the one the one regret i do

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.319
have is not eating mushrooms for some

00:40:10.319 --> 00:40:11.680
reason i had it in my head like

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.119
i need to preserve myself for that you

00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:14.560
should no you did the right thing yeah

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.440
but it would have been it would have

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.800
been fun to have you out with the fire

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.520
that's what i'm saying

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.119
what i like all my boys are in the

00:40:19.119 --> 00:40:20.800
nether realm it will happen again for

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.480
sure well maybe i'm there

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.160
i'm never going to the nether realms

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.079
again true that was it

00:40:26.079 --> 00:40:28.160
i've been there that was i'm done you

in the the one i i believe you but

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.599
there's one small

00:40:33.599 --> 00:40:35.599
i would say you know we're gonna do it

00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:36.880
again

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.560
if it was here like on a weekend you're

00:42:26.319 --> 00:42:27.920
people in general when you guys talk

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.359
about all that like the ego death all

00:42:29.359 --> 00:42:31.599
that [ __ ] i was like this is hogwash

00:42:31.599 --> 00:42:33.760
that's real dude that was entirely

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.119
everything you guys talked about

00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:35.680
happened

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.240
yeah it's crazy yeah in a little just

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.280
tiny little [ __ ] weird little

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:41.760
mushroom dude yeah contains all that

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.480
prophetic i don't know how prophetic i

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.599
mean you're convinced i'm definitely

00:42:45.599 --> 00:42:46.720
going to overdose no i don't think

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.720
you've avoided it now you won't i'm

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.400
saying because although you know we it's

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.680
you know us in the present moment and

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.680
then there's a sea of potentiality

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:54.880
you know there was just some things and

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.960
the mushrooms are going

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.800
here's one you want to stay away from

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.319
and you just went

00:43:00.319 --> 00:43:02.000
roger that yes if you didn't do you know

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.440
what i mean the universe did communicate

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.720
pretty heavily like

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.480
chill it's crazy dude it's time to

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.000
choose i mean dude there's no proof that

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.359
time is linear we

00:43:09.359 --> 00:43:10.640
you know in terms of our consciousness

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.400
it could exist elsewhere

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.400
in time and space and we're just kind of

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.599
like you know we can kind of

00:43:15.599 --> 00:43:17.280
if we get good at it we can kind of go

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.880
back and forth i'm saying i'm not going

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.079
to rule that out

00:43:20.079 --> 00:43:21.760
okay i know that's the case i don't know

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.200
of course it's definitely not

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.560
not it's not definitely not the case

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.079
normally i'd be shutting this down as

00:43:26.079 --> 00:43:27.280
best i could

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.480
but i've seen some evidence i see quite

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.079
a bit of evidence that points to your

00:43:32.079 --> 00:43:33.280
argument

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.800

like i did i think they stayed right in

00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.200
that list there's like if you're like an

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.520
eighth you're tripping your balls off as

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.880
soon as you start to edge over that

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:03.920
that's when like

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.800
you seek shelter dude i was eating so

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:07.359
many

like it was too dry that's like i was

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.319
like forcing them down

00:47:14.319 --> 00:47:17.040
yeah you picked picked out as hard as i

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.160
could on those things because

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:19.280
at the time i thought it was going to be

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:22.400
funny it was going to be a good bit

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:25.599
it was not a good bit dude

00:47:25.599 --> 00:47:27.920

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.640
yeah we'll see we'll see if it sticks

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.160
last night it stuck yeah

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.599
last night people offered me things and

00:47:37.599 --> 00:47:39.440
i said i can't yeah like there was no

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:40.720
part of me that wanted to do it

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:42.480
yeah and i had some bud lights flowing a

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.400
little that was still crazy no that's

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.240
crazy to me yeah

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:48.160
yeah man let's see when i left i left

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.240
early had my last bottle i was like i

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:50.480
see

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:53.200
everybody yeah that dude it puts a good

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:53.760
feeling

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.280
yeah it is i don't leave early i never

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.200
leave early yeah go walking out yeah

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.000
killed

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.319
but also yeah dude it's the best i mean

00:48:00.319 --> 00:48:01.839
dude it puts a hole in the serotonin

00:48:01.839 --> 00:48:02.960
theory how they're like oh you're

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:03.680
depressed

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.720
your brain doesn't produce enough

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.880
serotonin it's like okay i'm sure that's

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:07.760
the case you know

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.839
no i got plenty of serotonin up there

00:48:09.839 --> 00:48:11.520
exactly molly's proved that it's been

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:12.720
like yo you got a lot of yeah there's a

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:13.760
lot of juice up here

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.960
so that's like that's the question but

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.559
it's like okay so that's that's the

00:48:16.559 --> 00:48:18.400
dominant model in terms of people's like

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.599
mental well-being it's like well it's

00:48:19.599 --> 00:48:20.800
not you it's not anything you're doing

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.480
your brain's just slightly defunct

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.440
but someone has one mystical experience

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:26.800
on psilocybin

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.079
yeah and all of a sudden and like all

00:48:28.079 --> 00:48:29.839
the studies show this dude

00:48:29.839 --> 00:48:32.400
like i think it's like 18 months later

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.680
people who like won't smoke cigarettes

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:34.240
anymore

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.760
yeah aren't as depressed aren't as

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.520
anxious [ __ ] blows a hole in the

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:39.119
serotonin hypothesis dude

00:48:39.119 --> 00:48:41.680
which by the way hasn't been shown that

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.400
good in studies

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.000
yeah it's not much more better than

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.599
placebo i'm gonna be a dick because

00:48:45.599 --> 00:48:46.720
that's like a lot of people's like you

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:47.119
know that's

00:48:47.119 --> 00:48:49.359
what keeps them moving but dude i'm

00:48:49.359 --> 00:48:50.559
talking science scientists and

00:48:50.559 --> 00:48:51.680

now that we're both shamans yes

00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.599

00:48:57.599 --> 00:48:59.200
apart now that we're both no wait

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:03.839

which is terrifying

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:46.319

staring at someone in the face yeah

00:53:38.559 --> 00:53:40.400

no it's [ __ ] crazy all right top a

00:55:18.079 --> 00:55:19.359
lot of people i think like ninety

00:55:19.359 --> 00:55:20.960
percent of people rate it as a top five

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:23.119
most meaningful experience of their life

00:55:23.119 --> 00:55:24.400
so what's up day

00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:26.400
yeah that was up there it's crazy for

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.079
certain dude the [ __ ] i was listening to

00:55:28.079 --> 00:55:29.839
with uh whatever the guy's name is on

00:55:29.839 --> 00:55:31.920
tim ferriss podcast of bellage

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.839
i think let me just see this again this

00:55:33.839 --> 00:55:35.280
kind of driving me nuts he said it a

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:36.400
bunch of times

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:39.040
i thought he was what is it yeah it was

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:40.079
bellagi

00:55:40.079 --> 00:55:42.079
it's episode 506. okay i found it that

00:55:42.079 --> 00:55:44.319
way but the um

00:55:44.319 --> 00:55:47.359
he started talking about like

00:55:47.359 --> 00:55:48.799
i i i'm gonna be honest i don't

00:55:48.799 --> 00:55:50.480
understand blockchain stuff a lot but

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:52.319
he's talking about that a lot and he was

00:55:52.319 --> 00:55:54.400
no clue what that is it's just like it's

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.680
using i'm

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.359
probably butchering this but you're

00:55:57.359 --> 00:55:59.119
using the ai algorithm

00:55:59.119 --> 00:56:00.799
to just be totally neutral and take like

00:56:00.799 --> 00:56:02.720
an accurate in real-time historical

00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:03.280
record

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:04.640
that people can then use rather than

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:05.920
have that being constantly manipulated

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:07.200
so they talk to uh

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:09.280
so it's not fake news it's not fake news

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:11.119
it can't be fake news that's a thing

00:56:11.119 --> 00:56:11.920
like it can't mean

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:13.680
maybe you know obviously some someone

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:14.799
could figure out how to [ __ ] with it but

00:56:14.799 --> 00:56:16.319
apparently the way it's set up is that

00:56:16.319 --> 00:56:17.920
it cannot be fake news

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:19.280
and you can't [ __ ] with it so he starts

00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:20.960
talking about uh

00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:23.680
like media bias and how it's just set up

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:24.319
as the most

00:56:24.319 --> 00:56:27.040
unfair crazy thing where it's like

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.720
someone like the distribution's totally

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.480
unfair we're a person in like a you know

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.760
a larger so these guys are considered

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:32.799
right wing

00:56:32.799 --> 00:56:34.240
immediately now they're considered right

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:35.520
i can tell you right away that that

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:35.920
sounds

00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.520
but they're not going to go but the guy

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:39.200
the guy's being he will absolutely will

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:39.520
be

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:41.520
this so what they start talking about is

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:43.200
how to safeguard yourself against all

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:44.480
this [ __ ] and the first thing he's

00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:44.880
like

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.559
you need to get financial independence

00:56:46.559 --> 00:56:48.240
but you also need to get ideological

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:49.520
independence where you can like have

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:50.799
your own ideas because if you're not you

00:56:50.799 --> 00:56:52.400
know financially independent you're

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:53.599
kind of not allowed to think for

00:56:53.599 --> 00:56:55.040
yourself because any way you think and

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.559
then threaten your income

00:56:56.559 --> 00:56:59.200
dude the uh he starts talking about a

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.799
book and this is what blew my mind

00:57:00.799 --> 00:57:01.920
so you know those little things where

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:04.319
they say like the uh the spectrum of

00:57:04.319 --> 00:57:05.760
ally dumb and it'll be like

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:07.520
it'll be like a five-part thing it'll be

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:08.799
like white supremacist

00:57:08.799 --> 00:57:11.119
yes white supremacist sympathetic

00:57:11.119 --> 00:57:12.079
neutral

00:57:12.079 --> 00:57:14.240
ally mega ally yeah exactly yeah yeah

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:15.520
it's me i'm mega album

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.280
i'm a mega ally so that's not like a

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:20.400
more like a maga ally

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.480
so he was saying he's like that's not bi

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:26.160
like that's not some organic thing that

00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:27.280
people have come up with

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:30.559
that's an actual kind of like uh

00:57:30.559 --> 00:57:32.079
not a thought control but it's a pr

00:57:32.079 --> 00:57:34.079
tactic so it's like it's a way to

00:57:34.079 --> 00:57:35.440
influence people's thinking because they

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:36.079
know

00:57:36.079 --> 00:57:37.280
you know because like all right we'll

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.119
put you on this continuum they can't get

00:57:39.119 --> 00:57:40.480
someone from all the way on this side

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.319
all the way to this side so what they do

00:57:42.319 --> 00:57:44.319
is this is from the book i think it's

00:57:44.319 --> 00:57:44.880
called a

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:46.559
beautiful trouble which is a handbook to

00:57:46.559 --> 00:57:48.240
activism so you would

00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:50.480
you would go like all right some good

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:52.079
trouble is it called good trouble

00:57:52.079 --> 00:57:54.640
that's what the one guy the black dude

00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:55.440
in georgia who

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:58.640
passed away is it good to call it

00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:00.079
is that so did they right wasn't that

00:58:00.079 --> 00:58:01.599
what he said who's the guy no that was

00:58:01.599 --> 00:58:03.040
the guy that was uh

00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:04.799
what was his name john lewis yeah yeah

00:58:04.799 --> 00:58:06.079
it was good trouble but there's a book i

00:58:06.079 --> 00:58:07.119
think the book's called

00:58:07.119 --> 00:58:08.880
pardon me i think the book's called

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:10.000
beautiful troubleshooting the second

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:10.559
part

00:58:10.559 --> 00:58:13.359
oh it's totally factory reporting oh get

00:58:13.359 --> 00:58:14.240
the zenfone

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.559
another one do they just dissolve no you

00:58:16.559 --> 00:58:17.280
spit them out

00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:18.400
i take them out and put them in my

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:20.640
pocket

00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:24.000
you can see it during the podcast

00:58:24.079 --> 00:58:25.280
yeah i try to make sure you're not

00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:27.200
looking that's so [ __ ] fun

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:29.599
dude so he was saying there's they have

00:58:29.599 --> 00:58:31.440
this this is a tool this whole idea and

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:32.640
they they're sending these things home

00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:33.200
with

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:34.880
people to be like you know in like grade

00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:36.319
schools being like you we talked about

00:58:36.319 --> 00:58:37.200
this last week

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:38.640
like show us where you think you're

00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:41.839
getting the white supremacy which is one

00:58:41.839 --> 00:58:45.520
i'm a nazi yes you have a nazi attending

00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.359
that would be very funny to [ __ ] oh

00:58:47.359 --> 00:58:49.119
dude circle but here you go

00:58:49.119 --> 00:58:50.960
you guys asked someone opening it like

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.240
whoa [ __ ]

00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:55.280
i knew we had nazis at this preschool

00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:57.440
so the whole point of that whole scale

00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:58.960
is that you know you get the people

00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:00.640
thinking like that's how simple the idea

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:01.520
is and you say

00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:02.960
you're one of these like you have to

00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:04.480
participate in this thing and what

00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:06.000
they're saying is they'll take

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.440
the weight to and this is something

00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:10.000
that's like been laid out as like a

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.760
thing that works to kind of move people

00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:13.440
along like a thought spectrum

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:15.040
wait till something horrible happens and

00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.240
then you start saying like that whole

00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:16.960
[ __ ] of like

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.480
if you're not speaking up you're like

00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:20.160
silence is violence kind of thing yeah

00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:22.000
so you you you say you have to do it

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.599
everyone's social pressures you start to

00:59:23.599 --> 00:59:24.240
get peered in

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.359
like peer pressured into doing this

00:59:25.359 --> 00:59:27.280
stuff and then what it does is like you

00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:27.599
see

00:59:27.599 --> 00:59:28.880
people in your social network start

00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:30.319
speaking up because they feel the social

00:59:30.319 --> 00:59:30.880
pressure

00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:33.760
all this man is manufactured and then

00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:35.359
you see someone move from like you know

00:59:35.359 --> 00:59:37.200
the third one over there and you slowly

00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:38.559
try to move people up and if people

00:59:38.559 --> 00:59:39.200
dissent

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.599
then you disrupt their social networks

00:59:41.599 --> 00:59:43.280
by hit pieces from the news who

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:44.799
you can't compete with because they can

00:59:44.799 --> 00:59:46.079
write whatever they want even if it's

00:59:46.079 --> 00:59:47.760
totally factually incorrect

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:48.880
there's nothing you can do to them

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:50.640
because their distribution is so large

00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:51.440
and that you know they were talking

00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:52.880
about that [ __ ] it was like

00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:54.160
dude at school they were constantly

00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:55.599
hitting us with these [ __ ] continuums

00:59:55.599 --> 00:59:57.200
and this and i'm like this is crazy

00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:58.799
it's a it's just a trick i love [ __ ]

00:59:58.799 --> 01:00:00.400
spectrums they love them they love

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.079
spectrum love spectrums bro

01:00:02.079 --> 01:00:03.359
but this this is like you know those

01:00:03.359 --> 01:00:05.200
things you take where it's like like the

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.160
test where it's like

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:09.119
i strongly agree mildly agree neutral

01:00:09.119 --> 01:00:09.839
blah blah blah

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:11.760
yeah the idea is you slowly condition

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.440
people to move along via like social

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.640
pressure from their network

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.760
and he was saying if you want to be

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:18.480
immune to it you have to basically

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.680
have to get yourself financially

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:21.280
independent you have to get yourself

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.720
ideologically independent and then you

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.160
have to start worrying about what he's

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.200
like dude the news

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.400
the way people move along these

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.240
spectrums is and they've studied this is

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.079
dedicated by the the new spectrum the

01:00:30.079 --> 01:00:30.799
news

01:00:30.799 --> 01:00:33.040
uh outlets they like fully believe in

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:33.920
and he was like

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.119
it's like if you have someone who's like

01:00:35.119 --> 01:00:37.280
adamantly into any one news source

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.040
you got to be careful because they are

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.559
like manchurian candidates

01:00:40.559 --> 01:00:42.240
and as soon as they print [ __ ] they're

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.520
going to like he's like they get glowing

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:44.960
red eyes and they're like all right

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.160
and he's like you got to be you got to

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:47.839
safeguard yourself against that [ __ ]

01:00:47.839 --> 01:00:49.280
just pumping me up dude nice

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.799
i was i was [ __ ] stoked on it you

01:00:50.799 --> 01:00:52.720
should be pumped on that yeah dude

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.240
i mean dude i'm weighing right now into

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.000
starting like little cells not like a

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:56.960
terrorist way but like

no no no like sales cool cells cool

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.280

they put him in jail yeah because they

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.720

if you start sales people put you in

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.960
jail why he's he was conservative dude

but yeah dude it's coming it's coming

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.319
they're going to decentralize the media

01:02:16.319 --> 01:02:17.280
they're going to lose their social

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:17.920
control

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:19.680
it's coming dude people just have to

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.119
hold out and stop being like

01:02:21.119 --> 01:02:22.640

panic attack yeah yeah that's all that

01:06:48.319 --> 01:06:49.920
was fine line between an ego death and a

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.119
panic attack that was a

01:06:51.119 --> 01:06:53.440
totally different death that was a real

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.960
