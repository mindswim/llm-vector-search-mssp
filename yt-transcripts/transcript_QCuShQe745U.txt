00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:55.840
the honky [ __ ] TV Squad [ __ ] white

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.790
wideouts they did their whole offense is

00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:00.220
white basically they have a black

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:12.190
to have more than one is on her way they

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:13.600
have a couple of white white outs they

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.250
used to have a white running back that's

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:17.110
righti that was probably executive order

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.680
of people of color got a lot of awards

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.900

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:36.490
never looking on like guys good leo we

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:38.320
need this that's just because white guys

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.670
always win that of course it's all white

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:40.990
people yeah and then I was like oh yeah

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:42.610
and sports I'm always like come on white

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.220
guys

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.570
like in the NBA I'm like oh there's a

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:47.919
white guy [ __ ] killing little white

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:50.649
guys down the NBA like if we had a

00:29:50.649 --> 00:29:52.360
family party my uncles are like standing

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.789
on the couch like oh yeah baby oh yeah

00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:58.840
we got one bad that is our Oscar dude

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.519
yeah that's why I was watching white

00:30:00.519 --> 00:30:02.619
dunk like I realize I'm like cheering

00:30:02.619 --> 00:30:04.659
for the Patriots yeah Mac is their wife

00:30:04.659 --> 00:30:06.399
but it is all you sports is the only

00:30:06.399 --> 00:30:07.840
thing where that's that's fine that's

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.850
still accepted in the NBA in the NFL

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:12.070
there's a lot of white players we had

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:13.749
that [ __ ] state we had that debate

00:30:13.749 --> 00:30:15.700
this is a good debate you guys like

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.769
sports this is a nice one if there's a

00:30:17.769 --> 00:30:20.950
team if they split the NFL up into a

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:23.649
black team versus a white team who would

00:30:23.649 --> 00:30:27.639
win not easy money says the black team

00:30:27.639 --> 00:30:31.149
would [ __ ] crush them yeah and I don't

00:30:31.149 --> 00:30:33.480
know it's tough and this is surprisingly

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.799
the white team would be surprisingly

00:30:35.799 --> 00:30:38.379
decent they would have the white outs on

00:30:38.379 --> 00:30:39.820
the Black team would destroy the white

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.799
corners that's where that's where the

00:30:41.799 --> 00:30:42.309
issue is

00:30:42.309 --> 00:30:44.649
that's trill but other than that it's a

00:30:44.649 --> 00:30:46.690
good game [ __ ] yeah that would be I

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:48.460
don't know I don't know I'm not yet that

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.139
there's a lot of good white defensive

00:30:50.139 --> 00:30:51.820
like there's good white linebackers

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.679
there's good Demming JJ Watts like the

00:30:53.679 --> 00:30:55.269
best defensive player yeah a line D

00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:58.289
lines like whatever line D lines alright

00:30:58.289 --> 00:31:01.269
linebackers are safeties are good for

00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:02.830
honky scorers gonna get crushed those

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:06.879
corners they're getting humiliated but

00:31:06.879 --> 00:31:08.649
then the one thing would be there's not

00:31:08.649 --> 00:31:10.330
a black quarterback but then Cam Newton

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:11.980
they might have to like white chicks a

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:15.519
couple corners dude yeah but then it was

00:31:15.519 --> 00:31:17.740
like if you're not full black or full

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.279
white you're out so that kind of [ __ ]

00:31:20.279 --> 00:31:22.570
yet levels the playing field a little

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:27.820
bit yeah does it slightly okay but

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:29.529
what's way hold on how would you do like

00:31:29.529 --> 00:31:30.820
what's full though what about if it's

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:37.740
like West Indian and you're out did you

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.119
yeah that's a whole different ball game

00:31:40.119 --> 00:31:42.309
you gotta be LeGarrette Blount this game

00:31:42.309 --> 00:31:45.789
sponsored by ancestry.com everyone's

00:31:45.789 --> 00:31:47.769
taking swabs before or I think the White

00:31:47.769 --> 00:31:51.639
team should get half you get them get

00:31:51.639 --> 00:31:56.350
the mulattos yeah I mean basketball game

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:57.580
would be good too that would

00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.320
be fair you know that way the white team

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.410
could get stuff curry oh man that's just

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:04.390
unfair no that's not fair the Black team

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:06.160
would be [ __ ] unreal yeah that's

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.260
totally fair yeah now that the

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.490
basketball would I don't think would be

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:10.870
vegetable I don't think would be that

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:12.730
close dude they did it like four years

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:14.980
ago would I thought you said they did

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:16.690
this four years ago no if the channel

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:22.720
did this but Fox News yeah oh my god

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.640
they did it like boys so we is so the

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.050
white people could have Derrick and

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:29.530
Steve Nash yeah who's [ __ ] Duncan we

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:31.930
get yelling Tim Duncan's out today we

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:33.850

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:43.510
yeah the [ __ ] White team yeah the

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:44.950
white team would probably get smoked but

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:47.530
in basketball yeah in any sport so like

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:50.500
[ __ ] hockey tennis baseball hockey

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:51.790
would just be a power play because

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:53.200
there's like three black black players

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.930
in the league it was a big power v7o uh

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:01.630
baseball would probably be good baseball

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:02.260
good

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.730

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.660
Hispanic technically yeah there's a

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.940
whole other like thing of racism down in

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.500

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:42.040
