it's a bit late in the game but it'll be

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.000
funny to do a special it's just a video

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
of shane gillis on my special i think be

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.280
funny every time you hit a punch line

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.799
just show the def jam audience

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.560
and then when it cuts back it's clearly

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.000
not the same scene

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.519
even in the def jam audience shot you

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.199
can still see like a small martin

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.759
lawrence on stage

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:23.040
i would just also cut to different

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.960
crowds of black people like the deaf gem

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.080
audience then like one of them

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.240
that would have been [ __ ] great why

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.680
didn't i do that that's just way better

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.240
special just added all the big black

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.919
audience by the way from now on the

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.680
whole show tonight guys every time we do

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.000

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.400
audience reacting okay lewis i know i

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.680

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.040
this bit because they still haven't

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.280

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.800
can you convince lewis to give me three

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.720
tickets ask me for eight tickets if i

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.960
don't i'm

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:33.520
i swear to you if it was like my

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.680
headlining show people ask sometimes no

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.440
you're like okay i get it no here's the

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.120
other problem it's not even so much if

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.520
we had the room i would comp everybody

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.280
we don't have the room

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.800
the problem is it's a limited number of

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.960
people it's a very exclusive engagement

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.400
you're partying for three [ __ ] folks

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.520
you also got to keep it an amount of

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.120
people that you have to be able to gauge

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.560
the amount of people so everyone can

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.879
have fun it's not a club yeah and also

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:56.160
everyone has to be able to see the shows

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.599
also you're poor and you don't deserve

00:07:57.599 --> 00:07:59.360
nice stuff that is also true yeah just

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.280
give your [ __ ] life together yeah

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.639
that's been he's been on a kick of that

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:04.080
all day why do you think god made you

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.840
poor um

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.759
you don't deserve festivals well i mean

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:09.680
the same reason he made my skin brown it

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.680
is to let everyone else know yeah it's

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.680
like you're clear of this individual

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.759
yeah but it is and anybody who's a part

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:18.000
of skankfest will tell you this it is a

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.479
it is a festival unlike any other one

00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:22.639
and it's a different experience as a fan

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:24.879
to come it's a party there's no festival

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.720
that's a party the way skankfest is

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.840

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.800
he's coming into town i was like you're

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.560
selling janine to our crowd was i mean

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.480
she just offended a sexual predator so

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.320
like really give her a shot but then it

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.160
does like like when the name hits you

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.440
resonates like she probably wouldn't be

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.079
into us at all but she is she is

00:10:42.079 --> 00:10:44.079

comedy scene she's [ __ ] great and

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.600
that was by the way that was really

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.440
ballsy because you know her crowd was

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.800
going to give her nothing but [ __ ] for

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.720
that and she stood up for a friend which

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.480
is like an ethic that's completely been

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.480
lost in the world and i thought that was

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.000

hilarious

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.160
but that's funny because uh

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.920
what they're doing though is they're not

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.399

come through this thing man i want to

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.959

they send it to you it's me talking to

00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:50.160
you but i don't know i'm talking to you

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.079
how uncomfortable that must be it's

00:15:52.079 --> 00:15:53.600
embarrassing i don't understand the

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.600
whole the whole look the whole thing is

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.279
you're selling something that there's

00:15:57.279 --> 00:15:59.839
not really a need for and it's just it's

00:15:59.839 --> 00:16:01.120
just the problem is the concept you're

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.720
like oh it's not bad

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.399
it's just when you look at it executed

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:05.759
you go like why are you doing it i don't

00:16:05.759 --> 00:16:07.120
like it yeah like jeff rush you don't

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.040
need the 300 you really don't

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.279
so i get like it it's uh and he probably

00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:12.880
makes money off it but he doesn't need

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.120
it enough in my opinion for what the the

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.480
upside to it which is a little bit of

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.040
cash you bring it up isn't worth the the

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.120
i mean i don't want it just looks sort

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.440
of undignified it's not a little

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.639
humility there's it depends if it's

00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:26.399
funny because look chris dalia did his

00:16:26.399 --> 00:16:27.759
is a thousand dollars i swear to you i

00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:28.720
was gonna bring it right up but he goes

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.240
but here's the thing with him

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.519
i'm unwilling he was like i'm not doing

00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:32.399
the [ __ ] for less than a thousand

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:33.519
dollars i won't do this for less than a

00:16:33.519 --> 00:16:34.720
g and

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.040
the way he wrote that particularly

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.360
in my mind it's a bit of a cop-out i

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.800
feel like do you know what i mean

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.560
because he still wants the g well

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.240
because he's like i'll do it for i get

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.079
it but it's like don't be so it's if it

00:16:46.079 --> 00:16:47.440
reads a little like i'm a fan i realize

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.920
like you you and crystalia look like

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.639
each other but like in a funhouse mirror

00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:53.600
but you know what i'm saying though it's

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.120
like either just say it's like i charge

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.560
a thousand just kind of go did he go i

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.920
ain't doing this it's like it just looks

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.399
so like uh yeah like why sign up for it

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:01.759
if you're gonna do like reluctantly like

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:02.959
i'll do it if you give me this much it

00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:04.799
just comes off it's kind of funny yeah

00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:06.319
yeah it does a little dicky but as it

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.679
should be and because i think he's going

00:17:07.679 --> 00:17:09.039
like all right i guess if somebody's

00:17:09.039 --> 00:17:10.160
really willing to give me a thousand

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.919
dollars i still seem to say happy

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.440
breakfast

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.760
hawking forty dollars when you wake up

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.799
when you wake up in the morning finish

00:18:40.799 --> 00:18:42.480
your breakfast but i'm saying when you

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.760
when you wake up in the morning you have

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.840
like a stack of whatever your emails and

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.600
you have to go sit there and i guess if

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.120
you choose to do them you can just climb

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.960
you said right because you get declined

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.919
but i'm saying ultimately you sit there

00:18:51.919 --> 00:18:54.559
and go happy birthday mark keep your

00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:56.720

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.480
his birthday that guy deserves a message

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.480
i know i would do that one now imagine

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.480
having to do that and then go into your

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.000
suitcase for your mauricio wig

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.480
when they got one of the ones i saw

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.840
he doesn't wear the bottom so he just

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.200
has to wear the tops he's like this is

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.440
the best gig ever dude one of them i got

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.280

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.720

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.039
like he didn't know you know it was

00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:24.400

joker's cruise or something that's just

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.280
so funny when you don't know they're

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.120
doing it for him yeah because he just

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.120
says bobby bobby k or whatever yeah

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.880

for kate beckinsale it's not a great

00:27:05.679 --> 00:27:06.799

00:27:06.799 --> 00:27:08.400
that with like every hot chick it's not

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.240
like women are actually just gross if

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.840
you look at those websites porn stars

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.200

crazy

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.480
jesus we've done it on this show too

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.600
yeah i'm just saying it really is

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:18.960
amazing how they're like different human

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.159
beings some of them have totally

00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:21.679
different skin tones they like make up

00:27:21.679 --> 00:27:23.200
their whole body but all women in

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.559
general i mean the reality is if you

00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:26.240
looked at alex with that makeup oh she

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.000
is oh look at her

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.159
imagine alex with makeup imagine alex

00:27:30.159 --> 00:27:32.559
put makeup on she'd be [ __ ] smoking

00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:35.039
because she's okay

00:27:35.039 --> 00:27:36.960
she's not bad she's really not bad like

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.399
i see alex sometimes and like sometimes

00:27:38.399 --> 00:27:40.080
she's got pokeys

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.000
callback yeah sometimes she's got some

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.600
pokey showing and i'm like all right

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.960
alexa best she got a little hip bone

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.120
action it's not bad no alex is pretty

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.880
and alex um christine was saying that

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.399
alex looks really good on camera on

00:27:50.399 --> 00:27:52.159
skanks when you get started on the thing

00:27:52.159 --> 00:27:53.039
yeah

00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:54.880
yeah you can see the flaws but when you

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.159
know

00:27:56.159 --> 00:27:57.520
when you know we don't we don't really

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.960
have great cameras in the studio yeah i

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.559
mean christine said you look really good

00:28:00.559 --> 00:28:02.000
on camera keep in mind christine has

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.080
seen you in real life thousands of times

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.679
and that's also an insult when christine

00:28:05.679 --> 00:28:07.679
says she looks good on camera

00:28:07.679 --> 00:28:09.520
yes you're adding an inflection to that

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.960
no i didn't i mean she looks good on

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.700
camera but she looks it good

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.880
[Laughter]

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.960
she looks good on camera

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.360
she

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.279
okay inflection can really change any

00:28:23.279 --> 00:28:25.480
compliment yeah she

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.039
[Laughter]

00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:30.399
looks good on camera

00:28:30.399 --> 00:28:32.320
some camera somewhere no alex is pretty

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.760
but the problem with alex is she has we

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.120
said this before she looks like the

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.600
sister from uh pet cemetery right

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.039
and well i didn't think that until you

00:28:39.039 --> 00:28:40.399
put it in my head now it's all like a

00:28:40.399 --> 00:28:42.840
thing now well i mean come on

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:46.240
rachel alex you twist your spine around

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.080
sort of and like let us just see your

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.720
bare back lois you'll never get out of

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.399
bed again can somebody feed her um split

00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:56.159
pea soup

00:28:56.159 --> 00:28:57.679
for the experiment

00:28:57.679 --> 00:29:00.159
we should do a stage reenactment of this

00:29:00.159 --> 00:29:02.720
is we should do a stage reenactment of

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.240
pet cemetery

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.080
how much fun would that be that would be

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.760
and al it's all based off of alex the

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.039
casting right here is like it's just too

00:29:09.039 --> 00:29:10.960
good to not do the reenactment

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.559

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
going to get molested

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.480
it's by far the best the best it's

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.159
almost like better than not getting

00:30:36.159 --> 00:30:38.320
molested

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.799
i swear to god my life versus the life

00:30:40.799 --> 00:30:42.000
of the children who got posted by

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.360

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.679

your butthole while he jerks off is that

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.159

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.080
like he likes you to get on all fours

and spread your butt cheeks while he

00:31:01.519 --> 00:31:03.279

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.480
the earth rotation would have made you

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.440

i know nothing about them there's not

00:34:32.079 --> 00:34:34.399
personality this is the tinder this is

00:34:34.399 --> 00:34:36.639
the tinder of pedos okay this is just

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:37.679
left to right

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:39.440
kinder ender

let's see well you got to get the name

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.240
off the thing

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:45.520
well i know that one is wade

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.960
little [ __ ] i like way better

00:34:51.919 --> 00:34:53.520
i'm sure we have video as well guys come

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.200
on just like let's let's get the program

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.040
by the way it's that similar thing that

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.040
like uh you know liberace's thing was he

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.560
wanted his like partner to look just

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.640
like him he when he would hang out with

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.240
these kids and the doctor they all had

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.440
to dress

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.680
exactly like him didn't he do that with

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.440
colin kalkin in a music video once it

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.960
wasn't yeah yes exactly like that music

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.640
video comes up in the documentary pretty

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.480
big actually no no holly culkin was

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.119
[ __ ] not a music video black or white

00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:18.880
yeah i don't think he was i don't i

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.680
don't think corey feldman or him or were

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.599
melissa i think he was i think the ones

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:24.640
he liked

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.160
he liked they were never going to be

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.400
stars he made them long to i think it's

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.240
calculated almost to have a couple of

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.000
celebrity kids come that you don't [ __ ]

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.920
with well i think they could sing the

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.440
word forever i think all these kids

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.720
probably wanted to be famous and their

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.000
parents were pushing them into that

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.119
lifestyle that's why they were allowing

00:35:39.119 --> 00:35:42.079
him to go to 100 so the reality is what

00:35:42.079 --> 00:35:43.599
he probably did was and this is probably

00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:45.760
a similarity with r kelly as well is the

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.720
ones that weren't really that like

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.720
talented were really easy to prey on

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.200
because it was that sort of like

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.760
like they want to get there and

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.200
both these kids were pretty he went for

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.640
talent he did actually did go for talent

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.240
that was a good comedian it was a good

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.359
excuse huh yeah it was a good excuse i

00:36:03.359 --> 00:36:04.720
think having the kids having time was a

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.839
good excuse to kind of get them like he

00:36:05.839 --> 00:36:07.920
was mentoring them a bit too

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.680
but it was uh it's all [ __ ] up r

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.400
kelly's thing i don't know he's

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.400
let's see the kids making me laugh

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.800
you're gonna show two boys

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.640
we only have video of uh wade robinson

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:19.839
all right let's see the video

00:36:19.839 --> 00:36:22.480
robson get that going this is on star

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.000
search well now obviously you're gonna

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.800
pick him well let's see okay let's get

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.040

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.880
like look at that little pelvis

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.040
[ __ ] me up i gotta be honest with you

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.040
guys it's actually making me feel bad oh

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.640
yeah the documentary is pretty intense

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.839
why could you get an awning yeah my

00:37:09.839 --> 00:37:11.119
erection

00:37:11.119 --> 00:37:12.160
i'm getting lightheaded i don't know

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.839
what's going on

00:37:13.839 --> 00:37:15.440
dance throughout there's one time he's

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.280
just laying flat on the ground humping

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.200
the ground in front of like

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.880
women screaming this little kid this

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.800
little kid is [ __ ] weird man

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.720
it's [ __ ] up all right so lou you come

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.920
home today james is in the full outfit

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.599
knows the dance

00:37:29.599 --> 00:37:30.880
your reaction

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.640
reaction uh

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.400
james it's too late he's dead yeah what

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.599
are you doing

00:37:35.599 --> 00:37:36.960
let's get somebody more current can you

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.400
learn the [ __ ]

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.560
you know little [ __ ] wiggle dance

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.240
but these kids before my kids do the

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.960
parents just sold them out hard in every

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.400
part yeah the parents are pieces of [ __ ]

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.720
the parents

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.000
i feel thought when the kids wanted to

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.440
be like the one wanted to be an actor

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.040
and the other one was a dancer it seems

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.800
like both not only to michael jackson

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.839
calculated like edge the fathers out the

00:37:57.839 --> 00:37:59.760
fathers i feel like were easy to edge

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.960
out because i think you also went to

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.200
families where a little dancy kid and

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.040
the father's like a mustache guy who's

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:05.839
like

00:38:05.839 --> 00:38:07.359
a little fruitcake's never going to take

00:38:07.359 --> 00:38:09.440
over the concrete business so i think

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.119
the parents and dads were so checked out

00:38:11.119 --> 00:38:13.440
anyway was that you think that the kids

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.280
were definitely good i mean the the type

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.440
of person they're both

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:19.200
could someone take james for like a week

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.119
and spend without you being being aware

00:38:21.119 --> 00:38:23.599
or have a word on that no but then yeah

00:38:23.599 --> 00:38:25.359
it's i mean it's not about the lewis

00:38:25.359 --> 00:38:26.720
think about that is it because is it

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.560
because i'm mustachy though i mean no i

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.240
mean i think it's uh

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.400
could you imagine a celebrity who talks

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.560
like a girl and acts like a little boy

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.680
it's a rare type that's the most

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.800
important picture to me right there as

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.480
you see it's michael the dad is

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.560
literally edged out of the picture i

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.920
thought that was a really i brought that

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.359
up a couple times the documentary you

00:38:43.359 --> 00:38:44.880
can see he's like he made it his family

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.240
and the dad's like he has no idea what's

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.359
happening well are these like theater

00:38:47.359 --> 00:38:48.800
moms that like want their kids to be

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.640
like she was she was a stage mom for

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.440
sure

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.119
yeah that's [ __ ] crazy i mean the

00:38:53.119 --> 00:38:54.640
whole

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.720
you know the whole thing

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.400
um is that's the thing that like [ __ ]

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.839
me up it's just like it's sickening and

00:38:59.839 --> 00:39:01.920
i don't know the type of dad that would

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.000
no matter how much you [ __ ]

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.520
you know the instinct to like protect

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.880
your kid is really there it's a rare

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.400
breed of person that wouldn't protect

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.079
their kid even if it was like they were

00:39:10.079 --> 00:39:12.079
mustachy dad and their kid was a [ __ ]

00:39:12.079 --> 00:39:13.359
buddy i believe the mothers i believe

00:39:13.359 --> 00:39:15.440
the mothers loved their kids i do i

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.040
think they're just blinded by what's

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.720
happening i don't think they were like

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.800
i think they were happy to not know and

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.560
if the kid's not wigging out or acting

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.920
weird by getting [ __ ] by michael

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.040
jackson whatever's happening they're

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:26.720
just like dude because he's fine he was

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.280
sending one of the kids was like 11

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.920
when the first charges came out and the

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.079
mom was still sending me to go out

00:39:34.079 --> 00:39:36.400
sleepovers michael jackson it's like

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.480
this weirdo the weirdest human being

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.880
who's ever existed michael jackson

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.560
there's no one weirder than him is

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.800
having your son sleep in his bed you

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.400
know this this is like the thing they do

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.920
they share a bed every time they sleep

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.320
over then he's accused by the way that

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.480
bed is probably fire it's very

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.079
comfortable i guarantee it's like before

00:39:54.079 --> 00:39:57.040
there was even like a uh like those foam

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.480
top mattresses michael jackson was

00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.440
probably

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.119
he was he was definitely the best you

00:40:01.119 --> 00:40:02.960
could get in 1989 actually what he has i

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.400
love he's probably a giant water bed

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.599
which you know sure are not comfortable

00:40:05.599 --> 00:40:07.359
oh that's awful did you know bouncing

00:40:07.359 --> 00:40:09.280
those kids off of them

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.599
the the funniest thing of it to me was

00:40:11.599 --> 00:40:12.880
with the kind of money michael jackson

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.400
had to to get time alone with the kids

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.000
he'd be like bring your whole family out

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.680
and then the family would get there and

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.520
he goes your boy's gonna stay with me

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.200
i'm gonna helicopter you guys to the top

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.319
of the mountain and see if you can get

00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:25.040
back they're like what an adventure

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.839
oh that's his bed wow oh yeah the guys

00:40:27.839 --> 00:40:29.359
smoking the guy snuck into neverland

00:40:29.359 --> 00:40:30.800
took pictures of everything all his

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.119
pictures are like weird he's like a

00:40:33.119 --> 00:40:35.280
knight or with muscles holding a sword

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.960
and [ __ ]

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.040
evidently though the feds did raid

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.280
neverland a couple times and uh never

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.960
found anything that made kids never

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.880
found like any child porn or anything

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.160
like that yeah because you don't need

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.240
child i don't need porn if i have tons

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.319
of [ __ ] at my fingertips right why

00:40:50.319 --> 00:40:51.440
would you need child porn if you have a

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.319
jerk

00:40:52.319 --> 00:40:54.480
live boy but right

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.480
jerking off their child porn also porn's

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.240
not even good back then that's a good

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:01.040
[ __ ] it's not good porn so he has his

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.000
own

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:02.960
[ __ ]

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.720
a bunch of kids that he can just bang

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.160
and then pay his parents off there's no

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.000
kids around he had a lot of monkeys and

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.880
you think about uh how many

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.800
kids we don't know about you think about

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.960
how many people i guarantee there's like

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.599
a dozen people well the documentary uh

00:41:17.599 --> 00:41:19.280
cuts into about like two or three more

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.359
just doesn't tell their story but like

00:41:21.359 --> 00:41:22.800
the ones that that they were getting

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.160
edged out for

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.119
you know i mean the ones that they were

00:41:25.119 --> 00:41:26.240
kind of getting pushed aside and they

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.319
come over they'd be away for a month or

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:29.440
have to go home or something when they

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:31.040
come back he's like holding hands with

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.880
another little boy and i'm telling you i

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.520
don't know how i said my my thought on

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.040
it was this i think everyone thought

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.319
something weird happened always with

00:41:38.319 --> 00:41:41.280
michael jackson and kids but i think

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.960
what this documentary did took it from i

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.400
believed more

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.760
i think we were all kind of just like

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.920
resigned to believe that he it was like

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.400
two seven-year-old kids in a room who

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.839
were like showing each other you know i

00:41:51.839 --> 00:41:53.359
mean because he's such a kid and it

00:41:53.359 --> 00:41:54.960
turns out it's much more sinister than

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.079
that i thought it was [ __ ] up no

00:41:56.079 --> 00:41:57.200
matter what but i always thought it was

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.119
a little more like like i didn't think

00:41:59.119 --> 00:42:01.119
it was so calculating like like it seems

00:42:01.119 --> 00:42:02.240
like michael jackson oh i thought he was

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.839
[ __ ] kids i thought he was a weirdo

00:42:03.839 --> 00:42:05.200
who's doing weird [ __ ]

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.040
or two but now he's leaving the room and

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.040
going like get those [ __ ] parents out

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.160
of here because i'm gonna plow this

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.400
kid's [ __ ] he's so eccentric

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.400
that i feel like it could have been like

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.680
you could have convinced me easily that

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:18.000
he was asexual and was in a loving

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.040
relationship where they didn't have

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.560
anything sexual going on i could have

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.800
been sure but my assumption has always

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.880
been that he was [ __ ]

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.359
you know into boys yeah doing gyms with

00:42:27.359 --> 00:42:28.800
little boys no no definitely that i'm

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.400
just saying like i thought it was more

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.440
like

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.200
i thought he had more was like a what's

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.560
wrong with his two people love each

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.720
other you know it's not it's actually

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.520
like

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.119
it was very calculated he was like he's

00:42:39.119 --> 00:42:40.560
a in your head they were like playing

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.280
doctor yes if they felt more i i think

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.480
that the kid was like you know what that

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.400
does

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.440
but you know what i'm saying though like

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.560
i think that was i think that's what

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.319
happened i think the documentary just

00:42:50.319 --> 00:42:52.400
exposed that michael jackson was like

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.839
way over there

00:42:53.839 --> 00:42:55.359
threatening people [ __ ] like that

00:42:55.359 --> 00:42:56.319
anymore

00:42:56.319 --> 00:42:58.240
he trained them they ran like drills in

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.079
case someone came into the room

00:43:00.079 --> 00:43:02.079
stuck in plain sight crazy yeah

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:04.240
it's it's abducted in plain sight with a

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:07.119
celebrity it's identical just powerful

00:43:07.119 --> 00:43:08.960
except it's a little boy

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.400
story-wise yeah i'm saying story it's

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:11.680
the same thing like he's uh so he was

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.200
doing everything short of doing having

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.040
alien you know recording

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.480
it's very different because in abducted

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:17.920
and plain sight he was like [ __ ] the

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:20.400
mom and jerking off the dance

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:21.680
did you notice that michael jackson was

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.119
like he was never [ __ ] the mom but do

00:43:23.119 --> 00:43:25.599
you see how he edged the fathers out and

00:43:25.599 --> 00:43:27.680
he would get super close there's some

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.359
similar predator like what are you

00:43:29.359 --> 00:43:31.040
saying i'm saying the idea of like get

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.480
like the mom he said all those letters

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.000
he would write to them on but him

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.200
sending those messages that he's

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.880
everything hey doodoo head it's

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.880

yeah

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.760
you know it's funny you i thought of you

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.119
when i was watching the documentary for

00:44:05.119 --> 00:44:07.280
a multitude of reasons i do not [ __ ]

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.800
kids anymore i know you got rid of that

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.000
in your life

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.359
you you make the joke all the time

00:44:11.359 --> 00:44:13.200
because i fight with you

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.359
hey

00:44:15.599 --> 00:44:16.960
you make the joke all the time about

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.640
like why you don't like to wear jerseys

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.839
or whatever not even the joke like you

00:44:19.839 --> 00:44:21.119
make the steam you don't wear jerseys

00:44:21.119 --> 00:44:22.240
and what because you don't want to be

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.359
like

00:44:23.359 --> 00:44:25.200
i'm paraphrasing like sycophantic on

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.079
another

00:44:26.079 --> 00:44:28.560
an adult person it's more i mean it's

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:29.520
about

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.280
it it's very specifically that too like

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.319
wearing a jersey like wearing another

00:44:34.319 --> 00:44:36.800
dude's name on my back yeah where it's

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.040
like it's such a celebration of his

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.319
accomplishment and i'm sitting there

00:44:40.319 --> 00:44:41.599
going like

00:44:41.599 --> 00:44:42.800
just understand if you want to wear the

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.319
gay issue if you want to i've made out

00:44:44.319 --> 00:44:45.920
with you and you've jerked me off

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:47.440
nowhere near as gay as somebody wears a

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:48.720
jersey or their favorite football player

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.480
you've gone out with another man's [ __ ]

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:52.640
on your back that's also true

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.560
but he didn't know he was going out with

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:57.040
him but football jersey to make an even

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.000
explanation of someone who wears

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.680
football jerseys too is you're wearing

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.440
this jersey of the team

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:04.160
the name if you gotta pick a game

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:07.119
yeah it looks i had one ever and i'm

00:45:07.119 --> 00:45:09.040
telling it looks significantly lamer

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.040
when you go to like a game or something

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:13.839
and you see a guy like a fat

00:45:13.839 --> 00:45:15.839
you know a landscaper who's got his

00:45:15.839 --> 00:45:17.520
jersey with his name on the back oh

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.880
that's right actually but i was just

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:21.359
that's lamer i would opt for neither

00:45:21.359 --> 00:45:24.079
yeah i got you but uh yeah but anyway in

00:45:24.079 --> 00:45:25.520
the uh

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:26.720
what i thought was insane when they were

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.480
showing i forgot about that but the mic

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:29.440
it's like where's

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.119
that real quick just it's like wearing

00:45:31.119 --> 00:45:33.680
like a garth brook shirt it's not a band

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:34.960
i don't mind wearing a band shirt but

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.800
sometimes being the dude

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.240
it's just a little gay well let me ask

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.839
you about the shirt did anyone come on

00:45:39.839 --> 00:45:41.520
the back oh no

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.960
you just say wearing it let me just say

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.240
it's okay

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.920
yeah if you were a dude wearing a garth

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.960
brook shirt the man's face on dude well

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.079
i'm going to say the people i get the

00:45:50.079 --> 00:45:51.359
spirit of what lewis is saying but i

00:45:51.359 --> 00:45:53.280
don't know if i yeah i think i actually

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.400
get spirit too i'm saying i thought of

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.079
you in this regard what that documentary

00:45:56.079 --> 00:45:56.880
show

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:59.119
was a lot about to me too was people's

00:45:59.119 --> 00:46:01.520
like sycophantic behavior just some

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:03.359
woman unrelated to michael jackson every

00:46:03.359 --> 00:46:04.880
time they do you remember when the trial

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.040
happened they go on count one of blah

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.359
blah blah we found the defendant not

00:46:09.359 --> 00:46:10.960
guilty and she like released the dove

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.880
and she's crying and everyone's there

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.640
with signs and it's like

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.880
go do something with your [ __ ] like

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.960
if you took my my favorite performer of

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.720
all time whoever it is if you were like

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:22.880
papa roach yeah papa roach if you're

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.800
like the guy from papa roach is uh

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.240
molesting kids and that's your favorite

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.839
man i go i'd [ __ ] suddenly go he's

00:46:27.839 --> 00:46:29.440
going to jail he really did i go wow

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.880
that's [ __ ] nuts i would never be

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.000
like jake

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.240
stop trying to put it no no no no no no

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.520
not like this

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.920
not you dude

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.520
it is it was very strange that i could

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.280
understand like loving michael jackson's

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.960
music he's your favorite sure but

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.240
wouldn't there be a part of your mind

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.440
that's like

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.119
even if you think he didn't do it like

00:46:47.119 --> 00:46:48.960
i'm pretty sure he didn't do it you'd

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.040
entertain there's a possibility that he

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:53.040
did and if that possibility exists

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.480
you're like maybe i don't want to be

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.640
celebrating this guy getting off because

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.640
i might be celebrating

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:02.079
the most horrific thing it's not

00:47:02.079 --> 00:47:05.200
even like look i when people it's it is

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.200
on such a different level

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.400
than

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:11.440
being accused of physical abuse or being

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.599
accused of rape or anything like that a

00:47:13.599 --> 00:47:15.359
[ __ ] little kid look i gotta i gotta

00:47:15.359 --> 00:47:16.640
it's also a different level than the r

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:18.079
kelly [ __ ] it's a different level than

00:47:18.079 --> 00:47:19.599
being accused of [ __ ] i don't let my

00:47:19.599 --> 00:47:21.200
kid around any

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:24.640
really any adult alone

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.720
period like except for his babysitters

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.559
who we vet pretty i've been around your

00:47:28.559 --> 00:47:30.319
kid alone many times no i also got

00:47:30.319 --> 00:47:32.640
molested by your babysitter yeah but i'm

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.319
saying like you are my best friend

00:47:34.319 --> 00:47:35.839
you're like my brother well let me tell

00:47:35.839 --> 00:47:37.359
you james made several passes at me but

00:47:37.359 --> 00:47:38.640
i didn't take him i'm your uncle i'm not

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.160
sucking that dick

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:42.160
i mean leave it out but

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.280
but you know what i'm saying like i

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.640
don't crack my nips i wouldn't leave my

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:47.119
kid around a person that did not have a

00:47:47.119 --> 00:47:49.520
reputation about anything because i i

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:50.720
don't know i don't i just don't trust

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.280
people in general i'm a skeptic of

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.960
almost anything that anybody says or

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.400
does there's always ulterior motives to

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.079
what people are doing at all times so

00:47:58.079 --> 00:47:59.760
eyes have a thing where it's like i just

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.839
kind of believe that just yes i agree

00:48:01.839 --> 00:48:03.359
with you but then add all the other

00:48:03.359 --> 00:48:05.760
things into like if you were to leave

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:09.040
your kid around say a celebrity who you

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.119
didn't know super well but maybe they

00:48:11.119 --> 00:48:12.880
were a celebrity who like

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.119
had like kids of their own had been

00:48:15.119 --> 00:48:16.559
married for a while or something you're

00:48:16.559 --> 00:48:18.960
talking about michael jackson was the

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.720
biggest pop star in history going on

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:23.440
tour who was not going who was going on

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.200
tour holding like a different

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.040
seven-year-old boy's hand every time he

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.400
was going on tour didn't have a

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.400
girlfriend didn't have kids there's just

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.480
so many red flags that even if you

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.000
wouldn't do with anyone definitely not

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000
with this weirdo yeah like this guy's

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.119
weird well no that's the point that i

00:48:37.119 --> 00:48:39.040
mean a feeling like lisa marie presley

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.119
like he was giving her drugs in exchange

00:48:41.119 --> 00:48:43.280
for her time of pretending she's like

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.640
into him or something because she looked

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:47.119
sedated every time yeah she looks like

00:48:47.119 --> 00:48:48.559
she's just like like blankly stem but

00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:49.760
she didn't have a drug problem i think

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.160
her agent and his agent got together and

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:53.119
said hey you know it'll be great if the

00:48:53.119 --> 00:48:55.280
king of pop married the king of rock's

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:57.839
daughter pr purposes you guys i think

00:48:57.839 --> 00:48:59.200
they know they were getting divorced the

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.800
second they got there was no romance no

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.640
i'm sure that was true

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.319
i always knew that i'm just saying that

00:49:04.319 --> 00:49:06.640
she looks drugged up

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.880
yeah i mean she looks like like videos

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.880
of her walk she's just like blank being

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:12.880
laid around being made out at the mtv

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:15.280
music awards yeah i think so

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.640
that was bonus

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.000
just like a bonus

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.880
you taste like boy but

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.240
michael you've been licking butts in

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.319
your room again no no you're ignorant

00:49:24.319 --> 00:49:25.599
that's crazy

00:49:25.599 --> 00:49:28.319
it's crazy being nuts something crazy

00:49:28.319 --> 00:49:29.520
that's what it started as though that

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.559
like you were talking about how you

00:49:30.559 --> 00:49:31.839
couldn't get child porn back then

00:49:31.839 --> 00:49:33.680
because it was like grainy so at first

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.040
he would just have the kids sit at the

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.240
end of his bed

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:36.960
yeah

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:38.800
he just was trying to basically he was

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.400
like i'm not going to touch him

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.079
and then you know start to get into it

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:43.200
you get going

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.559
that's what would happen

00:49:44.559 --> 00:49:46.240
for the girl first on the other bed then

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.599
if you just take like a time lapse of it

00:49:47.599 --> 00:49:49.680
it's like you're slowly moving away no

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.720
but eventually you thought it was going

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.160
to happen at one point and then

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:54.720
eventually pushed in the mushroom boy

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:56.510
yeah

00:49:56.510 --> 00:50:03.760
[Laughter]

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:05.200
that gets me started because i'd read

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.520
that book so often in james

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:08.960
it's a great book

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:09.839
if you give a massive cookie he's

00:50:09.839 --> 00:50:10.839
probably gonna ask you for a glass of

00:50:10.839 --> 00:50:12.400
milk if you ask for a glass of milk it's

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:15.200
gonna probably actually the second day

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.800
you probably should go on and on and on

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:17.760
it goes

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.119
before you know it your dad kills

00:50:19.119 --> 00:50:21.359
himself and your mom's a [ __ ] whacker

00:50:21.359 --> 00:50:22.720
and then he's like i'm thirsty i could

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.720
probably go for a glass of milk again um

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.720
and if you want a glass of milk we did

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:28.880
you know it's funny in the r kelly thing

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.160
that that came out he just did an

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.200
interview

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.960
that i know we have uh clips of but just

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.480
before we even get the interview what's

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.040

that's exactly what they're doing

00:54:27.359 --> 00:54:29.119
they're going back to the past and

00:54:29.119 --> 00:54:31.520
they're trying to add all of this stuff

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:33.040
now

00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:34.079

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.760
stuff that's going on now

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:40.079
feels real to people but the past is

00:54:40.079 --> 00:54:42.240
relevant with you with underage girls

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.480

wait wait pull it pull it back a little

00:59:42.079 --> 00:59:43.359

00:59:59.119 --> 01:00:01.520
stupid would it be for me to do you

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:04.079
think this interview turned one

01:00:04.079 --> 01:00:06.000
fat black woman in the world somewhere

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.760
like youtube said she goes you know i

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.280
thought he did it too and so he was like

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.640
use your common sense and i was like

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.000
girl you've got to start using some

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.760
coffee the only reason i don't think he

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:14.799
turned any is because they were

01:00:14.799 --> 01:00:16.720
definitely all on his side

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.400
already oh he didn't have any to flip

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:20.319
there no you're right he got that that's

01:00:20.319 --> 01:00:22.720
his demographic that's his base man

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.559
it really he really is the uh the king

01:00:24.559 --> 01:00:26.160
of that world yeah he what he's doing is

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.280
he's not actually saying anything with

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.359
any substance so it's like he's just do

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:31.200
it's all passion and bravado he's saying

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.119
so it's like i've been this liar before

01:00:33.119 --> 01:00:34.480
i've been caught cheating or doing

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.640
something and then you think about that

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.559

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:05.500
conversation with your best friend shane

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:09.490

01:02:40.079 --> 01:02:42.559
crazy past and what i've been through

01:02:42.559 --> 01:02:43.920
oh right now i almost said what i've

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:46.319

01:02:46.319 --> 01:02:49.039
and all the people i've hurt damn

01:02:49.039 --> 01:02:51.119
go back go back i want to see that

01:02:51.119 --> 01:02:53.839
i think i need to be a monster and hold

01:02:53.839 --> 01:02:55.760
girls against they will chain them up in

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:58.319
my basement and and don't let them eat

01:02:58.319 --> 01:03:00.400
and don't let them out unless they need

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:02.559
some shoes down

01:03:02.559 --> 01:03:05.359
on the street from the uncle

01:03:05.359 --> 01:03:07.359
i think we've heard that yeah

01:03:07.359 --> 01:03:09.119
[ __ ] detail before i didn't do this

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:10.400
if you put music to the background of

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.559
this he's pretty good even even making

01:03:12.559 --> 01:03:14.319
an argument this is turning into one of

01:03:14.319 --> 01:03:16.559
those like uh yeah like auto-tune this

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:17.599
yeah yeah yeah

01:03:17.599 --> 01:03:19.839
yeah

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.680
i'm sure someone already has god bless

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.680
him

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.200
oh yeah can we see him should we have a

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.480
song version of that guarantee later

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:27.520
already well i don't know if they have

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.760
uh on sensor but there's definitely far

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.520
more like he gets up he's like stands up

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.440
and like a guy comes out and like grabs

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:35.280
him the whole interview aired earlier

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.119
today

01:03:37.119 --> 01:03:38.799
i saw that clip before of him getting

01:03:38.799 --> 01:03:40.160
that's what i said those those clips

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.079
were put out oh the clip of them getting

01:03:42.079 --> 01:03:44.000
up yeah those were the only clips i saw

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.760
okay there's more for sure there was one

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:48.240
part that i think uh we we talked over

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.079
but was pretty funny is after he goes he

01:03:50.079 --> 01:03:53.200
goes five six eight fifty women and then

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.960
uh gail goes up she goes i never said

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:58.000
anything about 50 women

01:04:06.799 --> 01:04:10.400
oh this is not me i'm fighting for my

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.400
life

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.000
oh wow

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.359
well this isn't a song but i do like the

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:27.240
fact that we're seeing more of this

01:04:28.079 --> 01:04:29.839
have you ever had sex with anyone under

01:04:29.839 --> 01:04:32.000
the age of seven no

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.359
no never

01:04:33.359 --> 01:04:34.559
no

01:04:34.559 --> 01:04:36.160
i have to tell you it's so hard to

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:40.839
believe that based on all the best

01:04:53.599 --> 01:04:54.630
wow

01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:57.920
[Music]

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.400
70 years in prison if convicted wow it'd

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.640
be funny to get ready to go to court for

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.079
uh what you could be going to jail for

01:05:04.079 --> 01:05:05.520
years and still getting your cornrows

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.720
tightened up

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.160
like taking time in the day for what's

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.680
happening for all you know it's your

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:11.119
last chance to get them babies tightened

01:05:11.119 --> 01:05:12.000
up

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:12.799
you're going to look good you're going

01:05:12.799 --> 01:05:15.920
to press 80. yeah i uh yeah i'd kill

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.359
myself if i was him like if i got if i

01:05:17.359 --> 01:05:18.799
was going to prison if i if he just

01:05:18.799 --> 01:05:20.960
convicted myself

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.640
it made so much sense to me i killed

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:23.440
myself

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:24.799
i mean so when that happened i was like

01:05:24.799 --> 01:05:26.400
yeah of course

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.839
when you let somebody out like while

01:05:27.839 --> 01:05:29.440
they're on trial oh yeah yeah i thought

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.960
you know i was out with you

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.880
i didn't watch the environment

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.079
they go they go yeah you're being

01:05:34.079 --> 01:05:35.039
brought up on charters is it you're

01:05:35.039 --> 01:05:36.240
going to go to trial and you just kill

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.599
himself

01:05:37.599 --> 01:05:39.119
it was like his brother described it

01:05:39.119 --> 01:05:40.720
like it was a no-brainer too he's like

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.480
of course he has he just killed himself

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.160
especially if you're a pedophile going

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:45.680
to prison that's like the worst thing to

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.799
go there for

01:05:46.799 --> 01:05:50.200
so i heard

01:05:59.119 --> 01:06:00.640
yeah i mean i guess i think technically

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:03.119
he is no no i i think in black culture

01:06:03.119 --> 01:06:04.880
banging 14 year old girls is not a

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.880
really bit like in the hood that's not

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.799
like a big [ __ ] yeah you may not get the

01:06:08.799 --> 01:06:12.799
wrath of prison people he's also r kelly

01:06:13.119 --> 01:06:15.760
no no i no i think you're i think that i

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:16.559
mean

01:06:16.559 --> 01:06:18.079
i've never been to prison but from all

01:06:18.079 --> 01:06:20.319
i've heard that's not a good place if

01:06:20.319 --> 01:06:22.160
the word gets out that you're

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:23.760
in there for like pedophile yeah but i

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.280
don't think he would because what i'm

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.960
saying is in the hood

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:30.000
if you go with those gangs and prisons

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.359
like thugs

01:06:31.359 --> 01:06:33.119
they bang 15 year old girls and 14 year

01:06:33.119 --> 01:06:34.480
old girls in the projects like that's

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.760
not a crazy thing those girls get

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.119
pregnant and they you know they're

01:06:37.119 --> 01:06:38.799
having sex with men but they always

01:06:38.799 --> 01:06:40.079
stick around and take care of the kids i

01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:41.440
don't think that they look at those guys

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:43.200
being pedophiles i think they're like

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.720
your argument is that blacks won't get

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.720
mad at you for [ __ ] children but the

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.799
white supremacists might maybe well they

01:06:48.799 --> 01:06:50.079
hate you already

01:06:50.079 --> 01:06:51.119
even them i don't think i just don't

01:06:51.119 --> 01:06:52.079
think they're looking i don't think in

01:06:52.079 --> 01:06:54.160
really shitty cultures like that that is

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.319
looked at as like being like a pet but

01:06:56.319 --> 01:06:58.079
he's going so above and beyond not just

01:06:58.079 --> 01:06:59.520
like pedophilia or it's not even it's

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.280
called something else i forget it's

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:02.480
called something

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.799
uh when you're into like teenage girls

01:07:04.799 --> 01:07:08.799
like 14 to 17. being cool

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.559
oh having a dick

01:07:12.559 --> 01:07:14.000
but it's um

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
whatever much more that but he's like a

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.160
sense of vision

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.240
but uh yeah i'm going to prison for any

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.559
length of time particularly for like for

01:07:22.559 --> 01:07:24.079
the rest of your life the rest of your

01:07:24.079 --> 01:07:25.599
life [ __ ] the child sex crime thing i

01:07:25.599 --> 01:07:26.480
don't think that's gonna be the big

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:28.640
problem with him you're get you're going

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:29.839
for the rest of your life you're it's

01:07:29.839 --> 01:07:30.880
gonna be a problem for r kelly because

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.400
he's gonna be in a play no matter what

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.240
he will not be with a roommate in a

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.160
[ __ ] thing he's gonna be like sure i

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.440
don't know dude i don't think it works

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:38.880
that way i think if you get convicted of

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.400
like a violent crime or some [ __ ] like

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.400
that like you may not be able to go

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.960
but prisons are privatized so yeah those

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.880
are bad prisons a lot of times you could

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:49.200
i might you could pay your way into

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.640
he's going to go he's going to go to

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.559
he's not going to go to like a like a

01:07:52.559 --> 01:07:53.760
what do you call a federal prison like a

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.280
white collar thing i just think he's

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.880
going to be they're going to because who

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:57.760
he is who he is they're going to keep

01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:59.200
him segregated or they might they might

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.640
keep him like in solitary or something

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.319
right he's not good but he's not i know

01:08:02.319 --> 01:08:03.520
but he's not going to be in us my point

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.039
being he's not going to be in a solitary

01:08:05.039 --> 01:08:06.079
he's going to be in like because they

01:08:06.079 --> 01:08:07.359
have because they have to take him out

01:08:07.359 --> 01:08:09.200
for being famous yeah they're not going

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.240
to do it like they're they're not going

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.240
to do it like they're punishing him and

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:14.160
he's in the hole they have to make his

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.080
single thing as livable as anyone so he

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:17.040
might be one of those prisons where

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.400
everyone's got [ __ ] cable you know

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:19.920
what i mean you don't know so

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.520
would make a huge difference it would

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:23.440
make a huge difference oh i say that all

01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:25.600
the time what's that if i was buying my

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.239
in prison for uh how long could i do in

01:08:28.239 --> 01:08:30.239
prison as it is or how long could i do

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:33.359
in prison with cable tv and uh

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:35.440
and like you know i got my own space

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:36.960
like i won't get [ __ ]

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:38.480
big difference in time

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:40.159
it's a big big difference yeah okay so

01:08:40.159 --> 01:08:42.400
it goes from killing myself before i go

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:45.359
to this sucks to a year or two i'm

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:47.120
looking this up right now and it's like

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.279
you you cannot like officially buy

01:08:49.279 --> 01:08:52.000
yourself into like a better

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.759
prison or a better what you can do is

01:08:53.759 --> 01:08:54.960
having money helps you in a lot of ways

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:56.239
like number one you can get put into a

01:08:56.239 --> 01:08:57.440
favorable prison by having a really

01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:59.040
great lawyer and they know how to get

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.359
that system so it's less of a dangerous

01:09:01.359 --> 01:09:04.239
prison possibly um you may be a lower

01:09:04.239 --> 01:09:05.679
you know lower security depending on

01:09:05.679 --> 01:09:06.880
like your lawyer's situation then once

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.319
you're actually in jail you start

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:09.679
bribing people that are dangerous that

01:09:09.679 --> 01:09:11.120
can protect you there's things like that

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:13.440
but once you're kind of there there's

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.920
you can you can have the

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.600
you can eat before other people but it's

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.440
like you're getting a better menu no no

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:20.880
i agree you know saying like that's like

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.239
no you're living a shitty life i'm just

01:09:22.239 --> 01:09:24.319
saying it sucks how good it is at

01:09:24.319 --> 01:09:26.560
[ __ ] yeah

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:27.920
i'm talking about your side i'm talking

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:30.000
about just taking out like your fear

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.359
looking over your shoulder constantly

01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:33.040
level is different that's all i'm saying

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:33.839
do you mean

01:09:33.839 --> 01:09:35.520
i'm saying for famous people i think

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:36.960
would have a lot of money but here's the

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.400
thing they're saying it's you're saying

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:40.159
they don't get stabbed they put you in a

01:09:40.159 --> 01:09:41.120
situation where you're not looking over

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.640
your shoulder time however

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:43.600
i don't know if it's going to work out

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.359
for him because he didn't have the money

01:09:45.359 --> 01:09:48.640
to make bail people had to raise

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.080
he would be like cost a lot of money to

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:52.319
feed 52 women

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:54.159
and also to pay off their families or

01:09:54.159 --> 01:09:56.080
whatever he was had to do these [ __ ]

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.000
eat

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.360
they

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.360
remember the guy who uh had the girls

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:02.400
under his house

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.679

you think i'm dumb i just think it's

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.480
weird how how commit i've said on stage

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:19.840
a thousand times in reference to an

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:22.960
addict like an idiot wow what a [ __ ]

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.080
that's probably why that joke wasn't

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.679
going on no i could see their faces too

01:11:25.679 --> 01:11:27.679
going yeah it's wrong

01:11:27.679 --> 01:11:29.440
how long you go to present uh until you

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:31.040
kill yourself how was it was the

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.320
sentence where you'd kill yourself

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:35.120
before you go at all probably pre

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:36.560
no like what's the sentence that before

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:37.520
you get there you'd kill definitely

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:40.640
before i get there

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.560
what would you go i'll go serve this out

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.800
versus i'm going to kill him where

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.800
also yeah that's a big

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.800
matters if you have any idea of what the

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:50.800
conditions are going to be like like

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.360
like minimum security general population

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:54.880
state prison

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:56.560
i think you got to do not minimum

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:58.159
security but like you know me like

01:11:58.159 --> 01:11:59.760
modern security you're not in lockdown

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.600
23 hours a day but like

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.199
i think you got to go for it but i'm

01:12:03.199 --> 01:12:04.880
saying i would yeah what's the second

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.640
thing i'm going to give it a shot for

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.400
how many years though i i mean i'm

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.480
saying i would try to live 20 years ago

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:11.840
if you got sir if you got if somebody

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:14.080
gave me a life sentence for the rest of

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.280
your life you're never getting out no

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:16.800
life with no parole yeah i'd probably

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:20.159
kill myself yeah how quickly

01:12:20.159 --> 01:12:22.159
i don't think i'd try to beat it for a

01:12:22.159 --> 01:12:24.159
while i would stephen avery you'd go in

01:12:24.159 --> 01:12:25.679
there and give it a whirl

01:12:25.679 --> 01:12:27.199
yeah see how it goes yeah and see if you

01:12:27.199 --> 01:12:28.880
can set up like a life of you being the

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.239
[ __ ] man because you're actually sort

01:12:30.239 --> 01:12:31.440
of a second chance in a while you can

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.280
kill yourself in prison yeah that's what

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.360
i mean i'd test the waters maybe kill

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:37.040
myself like right away i've never even

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:38.880
thought of that idea too it's a lot give

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.960
it a whirl and then like one day you're

girl is [ __ ] crazy

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:11.840
um but yeah i i mean i guess like

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:12.840
that would be the thing and then it's

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:15.840
like you know

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.920
the idea of your kids seeing you in jail

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.440
and like that's the way you have to like

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:20.800
see your kid

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.320
yeah there's no good option for your kid

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:23.679
at that point you killing yourself is

01:14:23.679 --> 01:14:26.239
pretty bad too but you gotta like if

01:14:26.239 --> 01:14:27.760

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:30.719
cross-dressing murderer or something hey

disco [ __ ] i do it all over again the

01:17:06.239 --> 01:17:07.920
last day of summer and i've been left

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.440
out in the cold with my daughter to get

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:10.800
back in well that's sort of the thing i

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.480
was saying about r kelly right like you

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.679
go to the end of your show with pictures

01:17:13.679 --> 01:17:14.719
when you see the guy's picture yeah i

01:17:14.719 --> 01:17:15.600
seen it

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:17.040
um

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.560
we can show for the fans but i've seen

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:19.520
it

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:20.480
um

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:22.320
but with r kelly uh

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:24.400
the reason i say i kill myself it's just

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:28.159
like especially for him like he's lived

01:17:28.159 --> 01:17:30.560
50 lives i mean he's got to do so much

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:33.440
52. yeah he's ruined 52

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:34.960
but i'm saying like he's traveled the

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:36.960
world he's like you know been world

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.880
famous like just you know multi multi

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:40.239
multi millionaire he's been at the very

01:17:40.239 --> 01:17:41.520
top it's not all fun though a lot of

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.960
times you're on the road and these gross

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:44.560
20 year olds keep throwing themselves in

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:46.880
oh my god old stinky [ __ ] buying her

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:48.480
own drinks

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:52.080
can't kill them all in plane crashes

01:17:53.199 --> 01:17:55.920
but i could easily justify like the

01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:58.000
suicide there it would be like i'm like

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.440
i've lived like way more than most

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.520
people are ever going to live oh he

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:05.840
def even with the if he got better

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:07.679
conditions in jail he should just kill

01:18:07.679 --> 01:18:09.199
himself and also there's something to

01:18:09.199 --> 01:18:11.040
like like i know

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:14.000
if i right now had to go back to being

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.480
as broke as i was 10 years ago it would

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.719
kill me but 10 years ago i was okay

01:18:18.719 --> 01:18:19.840
doing it because it was just kind of

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:21.840
what i was used to and like if you're

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:24.560
used to being r kelly to have to go live

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.560
in prison after you've lived like a

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:29.760
multi-millionaire private jets like

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.120
people toilets i mean come on because um

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.280
guard you got this weird white thing i'm

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:37.360
supposed to listen to now to be fair it

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:39.600
wasn't just people toilets it's all of

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:42.000
my furniture and appliances are people

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.679
he gets into this jail so he goes oh

01:18:43.679 --> 01:18:44.960
what's this

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.360
that's a toilet mr kelly goes i

01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:49.760
where's her hair

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.199
so that's a wait a minute your toilet's

01:18:51.199 --> 01:18:53.280
not crying this is where you pee and

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:55.280
take a [ __ ] excuse me

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:56.960
you don't bring children in for that you

01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:59.199
sh you pee on little girls and you [ __ ]

01:18:59.199 --> 01:19:00.400
in a chock full of nuts can

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:04.850
[Laughter]

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.719
uh yeah i mean you kill yourself that's

01:19:06.719 --> 01:19:08.560
it i don't know i bet r kelly thinks he

01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:09.679
can get it back

01:19:09.679 --> 01:19:11.040
you know what he still feels like i got

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.560
some in the tank and i can go back to

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:14.880
being a super celebrity yeah maybe i

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:16.080
mean but not if he gets convicted and

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.679
goes to prison that's really worth it 70

01:19:17.679 --> 01:19:19.120
years he's going to break out of that

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.880
dude he's going to is that that's the

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.640
thing is i really feel like if i was

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.760
convicted to to go to prison for my life

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:27.760
i could without a doubt unquestionably

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:28.719
escape

01:19:28.719 --> 01:19:30.480
no questions asked and i really deeply

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:32.400
believe this you think you could escape

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.239
prison 100

01:19:34.239 --> 01:19:35.600
if you're not even going go nice i mean

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:38.719
i i i'd say you can't uh definitely but

01:19:38.719 --> 01:19:41.360
then people do escape that's exactly

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:42.320
what i'm saying

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.480
people have done it

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:45.760
well this is what i'm saying like well

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:47.360
lose is a salesman man you probably get

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:48.880
you'd have to get people involved to

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:50.640
work in the jail and you could do that i

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:52.719
think the point you actually just nailed

01:19:52.719 --> 01:19:55.280
it people have escaped prison so there's

01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.600
a path to escaping prison for anybody

01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:58.880
you know and in my mind i'm going like

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.640
i'm probably smarter than the average

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:02.159
criminal and i'm probably smarter than

01:20:02.159 --> 01:20:03.520
the average criminal who's escaped

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:05.440
prison only criminals are super smart

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.040
unless they're like mastermind geniuses

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.639
which is some smart criminals if you're

01:20:08.639 --> 01:20:10.000
willing to [ __ ] something just people

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.199
are getting into a life of crime i don't

01:20:11.199 --> 01:20:12.639
think that they're it's all about

01:20:12.639 --> 01:20:13.920
[ __ ] a female guy i'm gonna say if

01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:15.840
you want to [ __ ] some fat ox of a guard

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:18.239
you'll get out yeah we know lewis is

01:20:18.239 --> 01:20:20.159
willing to do that to escape prison i

01:20:20.159 --> 01:20:22.480
would forget about escaping

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.280
louis

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:25.520
i got a sweet situation

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.760
that you are the fat knocks of a guard

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.360
louis has done it to escape an escape

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:32.800
room it wasn't even part of the clues

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:34.800
i just seductively clink my nightstick

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:36.800
across your bars at night how hard would

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.080
be to escape president look that up see

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.760
if there's like a video on youtube about

01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:41.120
escaping president like about what you

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:43.679
would have to do

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:45.600
what i bet you i just no it's just a

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:48.159
funny idea i'm not making you that i

01:20:48.159 --> 01:20:49.840
could escape no you couldn't you'd get

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:52.000
in there and be like oh bars [ __ ] oh

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.760
[ __ ] i wouldn't want to guarantee you on

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:55.440
it but other than balls i don't know if

01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:57.280
i had my whole life i don't think it's

01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:59.040
just a question of who's smarter who has

01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:00.320
more time i think there's like

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:01.920
opportunity kind of has to present

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:03.920
itself like i think it's very hard i

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:06.000
would get a bible i would get one of

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
those little this guy's never seen tango

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.760
and cash i would get one of those little

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:13.679
uh those little pickaxes and the the

01:21:13.679 --> 01:21:15.040
you know the guy who got me the pickaxe

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:16.159
would say he'd be like he was like oh

01:21:16.159 --> 01:21:18.480
it'd take a man 20 years to dig himself

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:20.400

through a jail cell

01:23:14.719 --> 01:23:15.679
i feel like he could have went that

01:23:15.679 --> 01:23:17.520
direction he probably could have went

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:19.520
through the ones that were

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:21.199
you could have no i don't think so i

01:23:21.199 --> 01:23:22.400
don't think i think that that one was a

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:23.920
little bit thicker but

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.440
um that's the only thing you could find

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:26.719
on how to escape president you can't

01:23:26.719 --> 01:23:29.199
even just google it not just videos

01:23:29.199 --> 01:23:30.639
there's not a blog nobody's ever written

01:23:30.639 --> 01:23:31.760
a blog on how to escape a present i

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:32.880
don't believe you i just don't believe

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.239
that our products probably put you on a

01:23:34.239 --> 01:23:36.159
list if you write that

01:23:36.159 --> 01:23:38.639
people probably afraid to write it

01:23:38.639 --> 01:23:39.920
i don't think so

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:41.679
what would it i mean ted bundy escaped

01:23:41.679 --> 01:23:43.520
twice yeah but that was like in the 70s

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.600
and his escape really made me feel like

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:47.440
lewis would be 100 right it was like

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.840
silly things like like oh we forgot to

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:51.920
lock the cell or like it had like one of

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:53.440
those ceilings with the squares that you

01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:54.800
could just move out of the way yeah i

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:56.800
know i think we forgot to lock the cell

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:59.120
and then we left the [ __ ] uh police

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.120
officer's uniform in your cell

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:02.639
which was dumb of us because you were

01:24:02.639 --> 01:24:04.480
able to walk right out we loosened all

01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:06.880
the bolts on the vents right until their

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.000
edge

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
leaving you a gun and forgetting to

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.400
bring in our guns that's a really stupid

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:13.600
move

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:15.440
you know where i messed up i just left

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:17.040
all the doors unlocked fell asleep

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.760
watching tv in my booth

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:21.120
i guess we should have told all the

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:21.840
other

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:23.600
uh prison guards that you were

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.120
officially the new

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.040
corrections officer all right go home

01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:29.920
everyone we don't need you lewis got it

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:31.520
all i all i like remembered of the ted

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:32.560
bundy story before i watched the

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.000
documentary was like he killed women in

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.679
horrific ways and he was handsome that's

01:24:35.679 --> 01:24:37.199
right yeah like that kind of thing that

01:24:37.199 --> 01:24:38.719
he was like a charming guy who changed

01:24:38.719 --> 01:24:40.560
his look a lot but then they get into it

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:42.480
and he goes to jail and escapes and they

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:44.159
catch him from escaping and he escapes

01:24:44.159 --> 01:24:45.760
and i think he escapes in seattle and he

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:47.760
makes it to florida and keeps killing

01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:48.880
women and at that point in the

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:50.639
documentary it's impossible to not be

01:24:50.639 --> 01:24:52.159
rooting for him a little bit like you're

01:24:52.159 --> 01:24:53.280
like dude

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:55.520
so much here it's kind of like all right

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:56.560
let's see if we can make it to another

01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:57.920
it's like watching jordan play with the

01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:00.239
flu

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.719
you know

01:25:02.719 --> 01:25:05.040
come on alex what were you gonna say

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:06.719
uh one of the ways that bundy escaped

01:25:06.719 --> 01:25:08.800
was really interesting he um

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:10.719
he would practice jumping from the top

01:25:10.719 --> 01:25:12.560
bunk in his cell all the time to

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.080
strengthen his legs and then when he

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:15.760
made it to the courthouse he just jumped

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:17.360
out the window like a second story like

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.360
a crazy high window and jumped down kept

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:20.880
going he would practice day after day

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:22.480
for months and they were like like all

01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:24.400
the prison guards were like yeah he's uh

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:26.080
working out or whatever but his ass

01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.440
looks great

01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:29.280
yeah he goes man i'll tell you he goes

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:30.480
when he lands and someone goes you

01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:31.440
should better that whenever he goes

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:34.239
squatter's ass see you guys later

01:25:34.239 --> 01:25:36.800
yeah see i mean there's ways

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:37.840
where there's a well there's a way i

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.520
just believe there's probably a thousand

01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:41.280
ways to escape prison

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:42.560
why are we even having a suicide

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:44.560
conversation you'll just escape easy

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.239
peasy well because i think the other

01:25:46.239 --> 01:25:48.000
thing is the will to

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.920
live would be a little bit i'd be

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:52.080
motivated to escape my problem having a

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.679
kid is i'm not gonna escape and go see

01:25:53.679 --> 01:25:55.360
him like yeah it's sort of like i'm

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.120
escaping for like nothing like yeah

01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:58.480
you're scared to go

01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:00.000
never see my kid again that sucks like

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.360
it also makes me want to kill myself is

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:02.800
it you know it doesn't like

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:04.639
yeah i hear you yeah there's not like

01:26:04.639 --> 01:26:05.920
you're right when you think about the

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:08.639
practicality of it yeah

01:26:08.639 --> 01:26:09.920
well you heard it here folks when's the

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:11.520
last time somebody escaped from prison

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:13.920
like in america is there any those two

01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:15.920
guys yeah in upstate new york just not

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:17.360
escaping prisons or five years ago

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:19.280
they're they move people from like one

01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:21.280
thing to another thing and they [ __ ]

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:22.239
kick a guard or they don't know what

01:26:22.239 --> 01:26:23.679
they wanted to get away guys the two

01:26:23.679 --> 01:26:25.040
guys that were on the run for a while

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.639
yeah they seduced the guard

01:26:26.639 --> 01:26:28.080
yeah they they said they were gonna be

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:30.480
with the guard chick and she went home

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:32.080
and didn't she even hurt her husband or

01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:33.440
something or like yeah there was that

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:34.719
one guy

01:26:34.719 --> 01:26:36.480
he was getting moved to prison

01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:38.320
and then the bus crashed

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:39.520
and then what there was one of the

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:41.280
guards was hurt the other guard threw

01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:42.480
him the keys

01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:44.560
and uh then he unshackled himself and

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:46.400
ran and then there was like a man hunt

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:49.120
for him for a while but he uh he ended

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:50.480
up piling together evidence that he

01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:52.159
didn't kill that's the first scene from

01:26:52.159 --> 01:26:53.920
wolverine

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:55.840
the wolf i know the wolverine

01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:58.560
from the wolverine movie dave

01:26:58.560 --> 01:26:59.840
uh

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.360
i want to talk about this other thing

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:02.960
really quick

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:06.719
um here it is

01:27:06.719 --> 01:27:08.800
here it is i think no kids really

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:10.239
changes this argument though if you guys

01:27:10.239 --> 01:27:12.320
all had no kids would you just kill

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.000
yourself pretty much right away

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.840
definitely yeah no other circumstances

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:18.560
yeah you guys are all dead i could i

01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:20.480
would do a much like uh it would be

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:23.120
definitely less years where i would kill

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:25.120
myself you know what i mean like with a

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.719
kid because something like seven years

01:27:26.719 --> 01:27:29.120
in a brutal prison like no kids i think

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:30.480
i would just be like i can't live a

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:31.920
living hell for seven years you guys are

01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:33.520
with a kid you just feel an obligation

01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:35.679
to i have to try yeah you guys also have

01:27:35.679 --> 01:27:37.600
significantly younger kids i have much

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.679
less years before isabella is can like

01:27:39.679 --> 01:27:41.120
take care of herself she's basically

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:42.800
taking care of her yeah you know i mean

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.400
so in several years she was sentenced to

01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:46.080
three months and killed himself that's

01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:47.199
it she knows she already knows how to

01:27:47.199 --> 01:27:48.800
live

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.719
i taught her how to pay bills j was

01:27:50.719 --> 01:27:52.400
sentenced to 12 hours of community

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:53.520
service

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:56.639
he hung himself later that day

01:27:56.639 --> 01:27:58.320
um this was uh this is kind of

01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.000
interesting guys i think there's a cure

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.520
for aids

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:03.360
they're saying two people right

01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:05.760
a second person not cured from aids yeah

01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:08.159
is that including magic johnson

01:28:08.159 --> 01:28:11.840
well he's not cured he just has enough

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:13.840
does he test positive for aids no right

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.120
i don't think so

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.280
yeah turns out the cure is ten thousand

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:19.679
lifetimes he never had aids he never had

01:28:19.679 --> 01:28:21.600
his hiv never turned to aids that's the

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.120
whole thing yeah he's always just had

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:25.360
hiv hiv positive but you can still

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:27.120
transmit it yeah

01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.400
but he

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:30.960
it's he has they they basically dilute

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:32.800
it so much in their their body by all

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:34.400
the drugs they take that it's

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:36.960
you can't trust it or i think they can't

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.800
green like it's [ __ ] ooze the secret

01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:40.480

i saw an ad

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:43.440
it might have been a prep ad where it

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:46.400
said you know i said uh i won't transmit

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:48.080
my disease and then won't was crossed

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:49.760
out and said i can't

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:51.679
and they wrote and can't over it like

01:28:51.679 --> 01:28:52.719
that's the name then they crossed that

01:28:52.719 --> 01:28:54.320
out and said well

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:55.920

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:09.040
and then cross out something and then

01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:11.199

great news you're not now you're living

01:31:16.159 --> 01:31:18.639
with aids

01:31:19.679 --> 01:31:21.600
you're right though aids did end up it

01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:23.360
was a bust fizzled it was supposed to be

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.040
big it was like the ryan leaf of

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:26.880
diseases it was the scariest this was

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:28.560
gonna be a big one it is what is the

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:31.840
scariest std now

01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:33.760
oh we were learning a lot about herpes

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.440
on the last podcast we were but i don't

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:37.600
i'm not even scared of probably really i

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:39.360
mean not really i feel like it's almost

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.120
the same way that i feel like r kelly i

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:42.239
feel like i've lived the good enough

01:31:42.239 --> 01:31:44.239
life without it that if now at this

01:31:44.239 --> 01:31:45.760
point if i got herpes i would almost go

01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:47.360
like i had enough of a run

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.400
you know

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:51.040
guys of not having herpes yeah

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:52.880
guys just so you know

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.560
i'm having an outbreak right herpes does

01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:56.560
scare me yeah herpes terrifies me that's

01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:57.840
what's scarce but i'm in a relationship

01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:00.000
so yeah i'm past the point really of

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
having to be scared also because like uh

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.760
when lauren was pregnant they test you

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:05.920
for everything and she passed everything

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:07.679
that's how i found the first time i got

01:32:07.679 --> 01:32:08.719
pregnant that's how i found out i didn't

01:32:08.719 --> 01:32:10.800
have money i was like good that's right

01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:12.080
it's so funny you treat it like your

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:14.960
aids test so i get tested every time hey

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:16.880
guys i don't need to burst your bubble

01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:18.400
but they also test girls for everything

01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:20.960
when they get an abortion nice

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:23.040
so so i had the kids throughout the day

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:27.560
and ironically they did burst her bubble

01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:30.080
yeah

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:31.280
it's not good i mean i guess it's not

01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:33.679
it's sort of like stds are also sort of

01:32:33.679 --> 01:32:35.280
something that i think young kids are

01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:37.120
scared of much more

01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:39.120
as you like grow older you just sort of

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:41.280
like okay i also just sort of don't

01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:43.199
believe in them i've never had gonorrhea

01:32:43.199 --> 01:32:44.719
chlamydia like any of these i've never

01:32:44.719 --> 01:32:47.040
even really believed in uh if i have

01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:48.400
somehow i didn't know i don't know how

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:49.600
it's possible

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.520
you can't have chlamydia not no it

01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:53.199
doesn't go away on its own does it no

01:32:53.199 --> 01:32:54.560
but there's something

01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:56.480
like if it does go on its own i might

01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:57.760
have been infected multiple times i have

01:32:57.760 --> 01:32:59.120
no idea that's what i'm saying if things

01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:00.719
go away on their own does chlamydia ever

01:33:00.719 --> 01:33:03.040
go away on its own bobby

01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:05.600
i wonder i don't even know the symptoms

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:08.880
i think it makes so i always heard

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:14.560
it won't the next time i know exactly

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:15.520
what i was like what happened did i eat

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:17.440
something yeah

01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:19.280
it didn't feel it didn't not burn when i

01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:20.840
just peed

01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:23.920

if i think about my dick enough yes i

01:33:28.719 --> 01:33:31.440
can make the tip of my dick hurt

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:33.360
right now me too i can convince myself

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:36.560
that my dick is in physical pain by just

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:37.840
thinking

01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:39.440
thinking about it like assaulting your

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:45.679
literally pinch the tip of my own dick

01:33:45.679 --> 01:33:48.159

01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:49.280
was that like dave was that was around a

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:52.080
lot during that it was [ __ ]

01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:54.480
out hilarious oh i'm sure to some degree

01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.080
it was hilarious oh and i thought that

01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:58.400
girl said she had chlamydia

01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:00.000
go back pull that up for a second really

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.639
quick right quick

01:35:03.119 --> 01:35:04.880
uh fact your body cannot get rid of

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:07.199
chlamydia on its own this myth can be a

01:35:07.199 --> 01:35:09.040
dangerous one is that a myth that we

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:11.040
perpetuate we started guys don't worry

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:12.400
about it just

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:13.440
try it

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.360
uh once upon a time there was a boy with

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:17.520
chlamydia it's very rare that your own

01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:18.960
immune system will be able to tackle

01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:20.400
chlamydia on its own right they just

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:21.520
said it can't and now they're saying

01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:22.480
it's rare yeah what are you talking

01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:23.600
about is the next sentence you can

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.119
totally get rid of it you know it can't

01:35:25.119 --> 01:35:26.719
get rid of chlamydia i mean it's rare

01:35:26.719 --> 01:35:28.719
that it does you just did happens

01:35:28.719 --> 01:35:31.520
high five you got rid of it

01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:34.239
if you're reading this

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:37.360
if you make this part of the paragraph

01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:38.960
your chlamydia is

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:40.400
cured

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:42.080
see you weren't able to do it by

01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:44.080
yourself that's always charlie the whole

01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:45.600
factory

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:47.520
if it's detected early enough chlamydia

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:49.920
can be treated with antibiotics

01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:52.400
time out that sentence contradicts

01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:54.840
itself sure did the first two sentences

01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:57.760
yeah stark contrast

01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:00.080
one says can't happen the other says

01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:02.400
rarely happens now can we get in a

01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:04.239
definitive answer on this because i sort

01:36:04.239 --> 01:36:06.239
of believe that you've had chlamydia

01:36:06.239 --> 01:36:08.639
many times now i believe

01:36:08.639 --> 01:36:11.840
i believe my body is strong

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:13.840
definitely no i remember our friend you

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:15.600
were bringing yourself before

01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:17.520
he said to us because we were both there

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:19.119
yeah and he said

01:36:19.119 --> 01:36:21.280
that i forget how it came up but he said

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:22.560
i thought

01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:23.920
i guess that's it he goes if you think

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:24.800
you have committee you don't have

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:26.639
chlamydia when you have it you don't

01:36:26.639 --> 01:36:28.239
know you know that you have it is that

01:36:28.239 --> 01:36:30.239
the collapse is that chlamydia the clap

01:36:30.239 --> 01:36:32.639
no i found out not i thought it was not

01:36:32.639 --> 01:36:35.360
the clap is gonorrhea i know so hey i

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:36.800
thought it was like the sounding or

01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:39.040
whatever right no no i swear to god i've

01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:41.280
been living a lie but i already know

01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:42.880
gonorrhea i don't think i've had either

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:44.639
i've never had [ __ ] dick lice you

01:36:44.639 --> 01:36:46.159
don't think jay you wouldn't know you

01:36:46.159 --> 01:36:47.920
don't yeah so i'm saying you don't think

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:49.600
this is what happens to somebody

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:50.960
i remember there was a girl that i used

01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:52.239
to date that says she doesn't think she

01:36:52.239 --> 01:36:53.600
was molested when she was a kid and i

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:55.119
was like you don't think you were

01:36:55.119 --> 01:36:56.480
definitely molested as a kid if you say

01:36:56.480 --> 01:36:58.320
that sentence yeah that's different that

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:00.080
one that girl

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:02.000
do you you can't say i don't think i've

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.159
ever gonna ever happening

01:37:04.159 --> 01:37:06.080
i know i i know i've never been treated

01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:08.159
first std so i've never had okay so

01:37:08.159 --> 01:37:10.080
you've never had uh can you get rid of

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:11.360
gonorrhea i don't think i've ever

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:13.199
molested any children

01:37:13.199 --> 01:37:16.480
dave possibly think deeper

01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:20.280
oh there he is

01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:22.239
ah nathan should it be a crime to go

01:37:22.239 --> 01:37:24.239
back and molest yourself

01:37:24.239 --> 01:37:26.159
in time oh that's a good question that

01:37:26.159 --> 01:37:27.600
is a good question i'm gonna say no it's

01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:29.280
your body your body you're right right

01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:30.560
that's right it's just [ __ ] it's

01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:33.040
looper masturbation

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:34.400
i don't know what would happen you're

01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:36.400
you're a jack you're a jackoff looper i

01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:38.560
mean because if you see yourself you

01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:40.159
know it'll open some sort of time portal

01:37:40.159 --> 01:37:42.480
and possibly destroy time if you [ __ ]

01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:44.480
yourself there's no way oh i mean

01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:46.000
michael j fox is definitely disappearing

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.560
from that picture

01:37:52.639 --> 01:37:54.000
can you get rid of gonorrhea on your own

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.239
your body nope

01:37:56.239 --> 01:37:57.760
wow

01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:59.040
well i feel pretty good about these

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.800
things then i can't believe i've never

01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:02.400
gonna rig away with a treatment left and

01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:04.239
treat a syphilis can kill and gonorrhea

01:38:04.239 --> 01:38:05.920
can cause infertility

01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:08.080
non-viral syphilis i always forget about

01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:09.760
that one oh yeah

01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:11.679
it starts with an s

01:38:11.679 --> 01:38:12.719
uh

01:38:12.719 --> 01:38:14.719
non-viral stds like chlamydia they

01:38:14.719 --> 01:38:16.639
usually don't have symptoms they usually

01:38:16.639 --> 01:38:20.880
don't have symptoms what and sometimes

01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:23.840
symptoms can come and go

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:25.119
what

01:38:25.119 --> 01:38:26.560
maybe that's why you guys dick stings

01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:28.560
and then stops with my dick stick it's

01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:30.320
when it's flaring up oh [ __ ] i thought

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:31.600
it was every time i had an idea my dick

01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:33.360
sort of thing

01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:34.800
every time i think about it my dick

01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:36.320
burns i was like wait a minute there's

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:38.080
no none of them say that then i can

01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:40.480
think my dick uh stingy

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:42.719
yeah it's mind over matter

01:38:42.719 --> 01:38:44.880
yeah i don't know i'm i guess

01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:46.560
[ __ ] knock on wood man never had an

01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:47.600
std

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:48.880
i've heard like people say that's why i

01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:50.159
said i've heard the clapping i got to

01:38:50.159 --> 01:38:52.960
clap like twice but usually it's like

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:54.480
70 or people from the seven like your

01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:55.679
parents or something would say [ __ ] like

01:38:55.679 --> 01:38:56.560
yeah like

01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:58.800
crap

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:00.560
does crabs even exist anymore i think

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:01.840
they say it's like almost been

01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:04.000
eradicated is it bed bugs is it a new

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.600
thing like said like says doesn't exist

01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:06.880
they found out it was like parents stuff

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:08.719
killing their babies

01:39:08.719 --> 01:39:11.199
well it was no suffocating yeah sleeping

01:39:11.199 --> 01:39:13.440
the wrong way yeah i don't think sids is

01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:15.440
gone i think it's like down by like 80

01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:16.719
or something like that but they found

01:39:16.719 --> 01:39:18.000
that sids was like i was basically

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.920
suffocating this majority of kids were

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:21.280
just they weren't just dying in the

01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:23.199
night they were really bad at sleeping

01:39:23.199 --> 01:39:25.520
yeah choking on blankets it was just

01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:27.760
evolution

01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:29.040
they're having a bad reaction to the

01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:30.320
parents stuffing things in their mouth

01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:31.360
