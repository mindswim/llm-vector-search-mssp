yeah i pulled one out that my

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.600
grandfather used to say i never knew

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.800
what it meant but apparently it's a

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.720
known one which is you talk like a guy

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.040
with a paper [ __ ] i've never heard

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.279
that i looked it up what's that even

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:15.120
it's a known thing apparently it's like

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.959
the origin is like it's a guy talking

00:12:16.959 --> 00:12:18.720
about a story it's like dude

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.160

00:12:21.839 --> 00:12:23.760
like that but there's also other they

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.279
said there's other definitions for it

00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:26.560
because i went immediately because

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.480
considering who it was it's my dad's dad

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.639

being gay yeah having a paper [ __ ]

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.560

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.560
in dude the beginning of this podcast

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.000
digest no it's funny i don't even

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.199
remember the beginning i don't know what

00:13:39.199 --> 00:13:41.199
happened i know at one point i got too

00:13:41.199 --> 00:13:43.120
hyped up and uh tried to do an

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.360
impression of the uber driver

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.639
that was fun though you were excited for

00:13:46.639 --> 00:13:48.720
food i know and to be fair it was

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.560
completely

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.639
in i couldn't tell what was going on

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:55.279
mm-hmm don't tell that context also it's

00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:56.800
not that far off

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.560
it was a lot of times the uber driver

00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.680
will call you

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.560
and

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.720
it's not no fault of their own they have

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.000
a tough time with english it's a new

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.440
language for a lot of them yeah

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.279
sometimes they'll hit you with just

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:08.720
you know it'd be like if i was in spain

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.480
i'd be like uh it's like a key now yeah

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.079
you know what i mean well i think it's

00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:15.839
like like whenever like they turn the

00:14:15.839 --> 00:14:17.040
credit card thing around to me like do

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.639
your signature i just go like because i

00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:20.160
know it doesn't matter yeah so that's

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.680
why i genuinely think sometimes they

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.720
just go like

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.639
and you're like black yeah yeah yeah i

00:14:24.639 --> 00:14:26.160
know that i'll come out and get this

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.440
because sometimes it's not like that

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.160
wasn't even an attempt at anything

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.279
that's what i heard though when you

00:14:31.279 --> 00:14:33.120
answer the phone dude he was she wasn't

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.639
far off your impression he was a great

00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:36.560
dude i thought i almost misgendered the

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.880
man in my apologies but it was just a

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.560
dude from

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.199
like gendered maybe estonia with like a

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:45.360
crazy high voice it was really sick

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.519
though it was estonian i can't tell bro

00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:48.959
around can you call it around here

00:14:48.959 --> 00:14:49.920
you've got to be real good at ge i

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.240
thought he just sounded indian no dude

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.839
he was a honk

00:14:53.839 --> 00:14:55.440
no i don't know what estonia is but yeah

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.480
i had a feeling where do you think

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.040
estonia is i'm thinking like near like

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.720
kazakhstan somewhere around there it's

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.560
not he was like one of those kazakhstan

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.959
bros but technically former soviet

00:15:04.959 --> 00:15:06.959
union's so technically the kazakhstan

00:15:06.959 --> 00:15:08.480
and latvia were the same country at one

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.639
point true so you are that's kind of

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:12.240
what's going on isn't estonia always

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.000
loyal would i say lafayette estonia

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.279
which one did you see lafayette i said

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:17.440
estonia estonia latvia and lithuania are

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.320
the three

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.399
on top of each other right

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:23.279
and estonia is loyal to russia i believe

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:25.360
i don't know which one yeah they're all

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.279
i think they're all nato

00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:28.800
i don't think estonia is nato sean look

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.120
that up i think sean look it up is

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.360
estonia in nato

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.440
yeah i think one of those just totally

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.480
there's a couple of those countries that

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.759
are like where russia till we die well

00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:40.320
apparently that's a lot of the ukraine

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.920
you really think so i've heard there's a

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.120
lot of people in ukraine that are

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.639
pro-russia although that could just be

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:46.079
russia being like come on man they love

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:48.000
us russia i was correct thank you sean

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.519
please please let matt know notify

00:15:49.519 --> 00:15:52.399
estonia is it nato yes security is

00:15:52.399 --> 00:15:54.320
guaranteed by the membership of the

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.000
north atlantic treaty organization thank

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.079
you thank you sean fair enough there's

00:15:58.079 --> 00:15:59.839
one that's not there's one that's right

00:15:59.839 --> 00:16:01.120
outside there

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.079
near

00:16:02.079 --> 00:16:04.079
belarus belarus i think you're right

00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:06.240
yeah could be belarus holds it down i

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.120
think you're absolutely right i think

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.880
they should hate russia i'm telling you

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.199
dude one of those guys is like with no

00:16:11.199 --> 00:16:12.320
[ __ ] way

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.680
there's something about ukraine and

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.800
turkey

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.240
turkey yeah they don't get along that

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.680
they

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.759
russia was mad at

00:16:19.759 --> 00:16:21.199
one of those

00:16:21.199 --> 00:16:22.880
yeah ukraine the whole thing's designed

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.440
to box russia in oh for sure oh nato

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.720
yeah yeah yeah but that's the other

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.720
thing too russia has to it's got to

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.480
[ __ ] get those other states back

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.079
because it needs a long

00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:33.279
treacherous road because now with

00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:34.399
ukraine right there you can get right

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:37.199
into one of those capitals dude yeah so

00:16:37.199 --> 00:16:39.120
there russia's in a tight spot dude it

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.360
has no it has no choice going after

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.639
russia

00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:44.160
no it's not it's not that anyone's going

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.639
after them they have to expand

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:48.320
they have to expand to get that buffer

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.079
zone and they will go into ukraine and

00:16:50.079 --> 00:16:51.920
they're going to try to get those other

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.839
previously soviet countries back this is

00:16:53.839 --> 00:16:55.360
the book this is the book this is the

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.360
next hundred years book

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.759
russia will try to expand

00:16:59.759 --> 00:17:01.199
and they're gonna it's what's gonna

00:17:01.199 --> 00:17:02.639
happen is they're gonna expand expand

00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:04.000
expand they're going to start spending

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
too much in the military the economy is

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.919
going to falter because the population's

00:17:07.919 --> 00:17:09.760
going to dip so they're like

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.880
and we're going to figure out different

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:11.919
forms of energy because they're getting

00:17:11.919 --> 00:17:13.679
all that money from that natural gas

00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:15.360
that's going to that's going to peter

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.160
out at some point russia collapses all

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.839
those countries turkeys in a stark rat

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:20.880
they're all going to start grabbing

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.880
pieces of the former russian states or

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:23.760
whatever

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.760
russia is going to be this big bro

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.679
really 20 40. that's the that's the

00:17:27.679 --> 00:17:29.440
guy's prediction i don't know

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.960
but yeah russia is going to fall hard

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.120
and then that's when the eastern bloc is

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.880
going to start just stinks right now i

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.400
know dude but they're they they're

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.000
exporting that natural gas extinct they

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.360
got that they got europe hooked on their

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.039
natural gas

00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:42.240
so

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.360
i think the united states is going to

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.760
start doing space based energy

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.360
once they they're gonna start doing uh

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.799
what are they called battle stars or

00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:50.640
whatever yeah that's the united states

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.679
next move

00:17:51.679 --> 00:17:54.799
launching battle stars up around like uh

00:17:54.799 --> 00:17:56.320
up around the middle east you know all

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.919
those areas so they'll be able to drop

00:17:57.919 --> 00:18:00.080
missiles anywhere tell them knock it off

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.360
yeah dude cause then [ __ ] we gotta

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.120
deal with japan

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.640
japan's gonna start carving into china

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.080
once china collapses then we're gonna

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.840
have japan's gonna have a nasty navy

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.000
turkey's gonna be growing

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.160
only hope is mexico and poland yeah it's

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.320
gonna be 2050 is going to be lit dude

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.400
this dude this book is sick as hell yeah

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.400
next hundred years is tight

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.240
sounds like it tell an old bogey like me

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.080
some stuff about it yeah i appreciate

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.520
your confidence with all this i'm

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.880
telling you dude i mean that's what the

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.000
book says we'll see yeah however china i

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.840
think absolutely will fall too you got a

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.679
gut feeling china's faulting i believe

00:18:31.679 --> 00:18:32.640
so

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.160
same thing happened in japan japan got

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.600
[ __ ] up because when you have these

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.840
communist countries the economy is not

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.480
so much based on japan wasn't communist

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.840
i know but i'm saying what happened to

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.000
japan was they had a similar thing going

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.440
where it was like

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.160
the economy was based more on a elite

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.760
class was it was it was just on like

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.280
relationships so you'd have these

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.640
companies that would just start getting

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.160
loan after loan after loan so it wasn't

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.280
about if you're profitable or not

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.559
because you could just get loans and

00:18:56.559 --> 00:18:58.080
that would have these companies that

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.280
were prone to just collapsing because

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.799
they weren't built on merit and

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:02.080
profitability

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.840
so these big things become like ponzi

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.000
schemes so japan fell but japan's very

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.600
stoic and they're like we [ __ ] up our

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.160
bad china's gonna fall hard yeah because

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.440
it's all the communist party and they're

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.400
gonna

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.320
apparently they're saying

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.840
at least 25 of china's gdp is bad like

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.440
businesses that are faltering ones that

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.880
are faltering

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.320
could be 40 bro

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.919
could be we'll see we'll see i don't

00:19:23.919 --> 00:19:24.720
know

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.160
me and me and george friedman will

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.840
figure this out

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.960
yeah i've been loving hitting that

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.320
because pete no but everyone's like oh

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.600
yeah i could see that

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.600
i have no idea yeah i just read that one

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.480
but pretty sick what happened to japan

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.320
japan starts to carve up china because

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.840
you know what happened to japan when

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.039
they fell

00:19:41.039 --> 00:19:43.360
uh nothing they actually just japan's

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.919
very good at like they have a very uh

00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:47.840
disciplined citizenry so the government

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.520
they like look up to the elites in japan

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.760
they're like we're the elites or bushido

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.039
yeah like here's what we're doing

00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:54.720
tighten your [ __ ] belts for 10 years

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.679
we're going to turn this thing around

00:19:55.679 --> 00:19:57.280
they do pretty well nice japan can

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.600
maneuver because they're a small country

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.520
yeah but the population dips coming so

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.880
now they're going to have to figure out

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.919
how to

00:20:03.919 --> 00:20:06.240
basically get labor but they can't let

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.120
people

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.799
you know immigrate to their country is

00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:10.400
so small and they also japan does not

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.600
like immigrants

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.960
so they're going to go to china what

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.000
types of things do they say to the

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.960
immigrants

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.720
i don't know i don't know

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.720
who

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.159
[Laughter]

00:20:26.159 --> 00:20:27.760
china did build a wall

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.520
they did they certainly did to keep out

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.480
who

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.039
margaritas

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.200
yeah so they said japan's going to carve

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.320
sick navy

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.000

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.080
never seen sonic before that book or

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.080
after the book came out did you predict

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.919
that our supersonic technology yeah

00:21:31.919 --> 00:21:33.039
they're they're saying a bunch of those

00:21:33.039 --> 00:21:34.320

had them before

00:21:35.679 --> 00:21:37.120
did he predict the fact that we wouldn't

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.280
even we'd be like i think they're ufos

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.440
meanwhile china's chinese supersonics

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.360
getting wild i'd have to see the

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.600

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.280
that have supersonic missiles now

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.799
they're saying by 2050 though i think

00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:06.559

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.520

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.839

[ __ ] right yes dude that's what i was

00:36:00.079 --> 00:36:02.240
saying louis took like [ __ ] 11 of the

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.079
12 of these things i was like he was sad

00:36:04.079 --> 00:36:05.520
dabbing by the end of the episode dude

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.839
he was like he's all mad about this kid

00:36:07.839 --> 00:36:10.640

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.160
you sad dabbing dude he's hitting said

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.079
that there's nothing worse dude but i

00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:17.520
saw this video so we're talking about

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.800
this basketball game you guys have set

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.520
up yep and lewis is very confident and

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.040
he showed me this video from skankfest

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.720
and was like cannon and i think you know

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.400
feeny or something playing those three

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.400
and yeah they lost and it's a short clip

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.839
like you don't see much but the one

00:36:29.839 --> 00:36:31.599
thing i noticed i think i owe it to the

00:36:31.599 --> 00:36:32.800
dab i don't think i would have seen it

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.320
without the dab

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.079
i'm watching it

00:36:36.079 --> 00:36:38.000
lewis is playing defense and feeney

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.400
literally just goes left he doesn't try

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.839
a move he

00:36:41.839 --> 00:36:44.160
essentially just goes left louis just

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.079
watches him and gives up and walks over

00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:47.839
i had him run it back but that could

00:36:47.839 --> 00:36:49.440
have been fat lewis

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.119
i mean he was thick loose but it wasn't

00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:52.640
this is still thick yeah he's been

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.560
working out since that was skankfest

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:57.119
like two years ago in new york yeah

00:36:57.119 --> 00:36:59.599
maybe three yeah might i think it was

00:36:59.599 --> 00:37:01.599
lucy dedicated himself to turning his

00:37:01.599 --> 00:37:03.839
body into it was he there this morning

00:37:03.839 --> 00:37:05.359
grappling doesn't grappling doesn't

00:37:05.359 --> 00:37:06.800
translate to basketball absolutely it's

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.720
like the opposite muscles yeah

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.880
absolutely yeah it's two-hand basketball

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.480
shot it's over there is

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.359
zero percent chance lewis

00:37:15.359 --> 00:37:16.960
i would say

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.119
he if if i were a betting man if i used

00:37:19.119 --> 00:37:20.839
something like

00:37:20.839 --> 00:37:22.640
draftkings.com

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.760
christ

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.160
i might put his over under at 0.5 would

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.599
you really i would be shocked if he

00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:29.680
scores one point i'd be willing to bail

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.680
0.5 is the bet on lewis you can either

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.359
bet zero or i was going to say is there

00:37:33.359 --> 00:37:34.960
going to be betting on this because i

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.960
show you oh yeah there'll be bats over

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.960

has that spazz shot

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.400
the kid playing in jeans he'll be half

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.599
when he shoots

00:42:11.599 --> 00:42:14.760
he's two-handed

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.160
he's looking down dribbling and then he

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:18.960
goes

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:21.280
dude it's two hands that's a shot the

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.040
best is a smash the kid with like long

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.640
nails in the basketball team

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.640

tommy on lewis

00:42:37.359 --> 00:42:38.880

well lewis isn't going to touch the ball

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.319
you don't think he'll ever hit the ball

00:42:42.319 --> 00:42:45.040
he's going to be wide

00:42:47.599 --> 00:42:50.480
like can j shoot from the outside

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.640

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.559
shocked you in a super bowl

00:52:12.559 --> 00:52:14.960
you remember young tom brady in 2000 oh

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.559
man that was he said no way this guy can

00:52:16.559 --> 00:52:18.000
beat the rams i was just going to say

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.520

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:22.480
young tv who he's done tv 12. i have a

00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:23.760

who else you got

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.240
i think so yeah that guy's going to be

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:32.000
that young quarterback he jokingly ken

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.520
shock joe

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.960
yeah he's got a wide receiver you'd like

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:36.559
his name is jamar chase he's pretty i've

00:52:36.559 --> 00:52:38.880

00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:40.800
coolest one he's everybody thinks joe

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:43.359
burrows mr cool yeah i mean i hate when

00:52:43.359 --> 00:52:44.800
other people get the shine for being mr

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.720
cleveland the eminem effect it is the

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.480
eminem effect aboard you know wearing a

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:51.040

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:52.800
i'm king of the good times not joe

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.960
burrow heard that i'm the king of the

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:56.720
good times i heard that but i do think

00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.480
through the secondary

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:01.200
the secondary's going to have secondary

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.880
the secondary

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:05.200
from the bengals the secondaries they're

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.559
going to have their hands full with the

00:53:06.559 --> 00:53:09.040
obj and cooper cup

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.800
you'd like cooper cup a lot i know he's

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.800
a white hope dude yeah i heard about it

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:14.960
he's

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.280
ultimately i think the i think the

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.720
bengal secondary is going to get it done

00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:20.800
against uh you know the rams deep threat

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.540

00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:19.280
white girls in their 20s

00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:23.119

00:58:34.079 --> 00:58:36.480
dude they did they hated my [ __ ] guts

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.960
start to finish didn't laugh once

00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.960
talked the whole time at one point the

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.040
check spot happened so three waiters

00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:44.720
come in just start giving everybody

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:46.960
their checks they're women

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.240
so you know how like when we go out

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:50.400
somebody will be like i got this yeah

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:51.760
when girls go down

00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:54.640
we're dividing who got this who's doing

00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:55.440
this

00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:57.040
i'll venmo you it's like well don't you

00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:59.440
have cash means dude oh it's brutal

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:01.440
nightmare so every table is having a

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:03.280
girl fight over the tab

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:05.040
girls at that point start getting up

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.400
going to the bat like five different

00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.559
girls got up jesus dude i was literally

00:59:08.559 --> 00:59:10.720
just standing at one point i stood i saw

00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:12.480
the timer i stood for 30 seconds in

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:14.880
silence the room kept talking do you

00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:16.240
think that was the worst set i've ever

00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:17.599
had why do you think is you think that's

00:59:17.599 --> 00:59:19.280
because girls are inherently greedier

00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:21.280
because they don't know how to do math

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:23.200
i think the check up one of those

00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:24.400
they're the check cubs they're all like

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:26.400
uh you want to do it yeah usually a

00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.960
guy's here

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:30.079
uh

00:59:30.079 --> 00:59:32.480
guys here usually a man is here to pay

00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:35.599
it and figure out the [ __ ]

00:59:35.599 --> 00:59:38.480
tip all that oh but they

00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:39.760
it was

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.520
and also it's always a fight it's always

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:43.280
a fight i didn't care enough to fight

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:45.040
them yeah to go up there and be like you

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:47.440

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.280
which is very cool upstairs though i

00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:52.720
think upstairs

00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:53.839
but also

00:59:53.839 --> 00:59:55.119
that was the worst that was the worst

00:59:55.119 --> 00:59:56.720
i've ever had up there

00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:58.480
and that's saying something but

00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.720
i didn't have any fight i literally

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.160
stood there

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.319
the guy gave me the light i was like

01:00:04.319 --> 01:00:05.920

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:12.240
get out of it

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.160

yeah it's going to be tough shane it's

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.679
interesting because they drive a lot of

01:26:55.679 --> 01:26:57.679
our economy those geezers

01:26:57.679 --> 01:26:58.719
yeah man we're going to we're going to

01:26:58.719 --> 01:26:59.520
hit

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:00.800
the 2020s we're going to hit like a

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.719
pretty hard inflation interest rates are

01:27:02.719 --> 01:27:03.679
going up and we're going to have some

01:27:03.679 --> 01:27:05.360
pretty high taxation

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.760
50-year economic cycles so we got to do

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:09.440
the opposite of reaganomics basically

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:10.480
because we're going to double down on

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:11.520
reaganomics it's going to make

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:13.679
everything worse

01:27:13.679 --> 01:27:15.679
i mean just you'll see check me out in

01:27:15.679 --> 01:27:18.320
2030. 2030 after that we're good yeah

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:20.880
everything's good all right

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:23.280
that that's going to be correct dude

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:24.880
it's 50 year cycles look back on history

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:26.239
if you look throughout history there's

01:27:26.239 --> 01:27:27.920
never been a time where all right now

01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:32.080
we're good in 30 or 10 years mm-hmm

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.840
it's [ __ ] to be like okay in 10

01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.600
years we're good not good forever we're

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:37.679
good for another let's say a little pax

01:27:37.679 --> 01:27:39.920
romana 30 40 years and then we'll have

01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:41.679
whatever we use to get us out of this

01:27:41.679 --> 01:27:43.280
problem will cause us a new problem

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:44.719
we'll have to switch you know yeah

01:27:44.719 --> 01:27:46.159
that's that seems pretty simple yeah

01:27:46.159 --> 01:27:49.040
exactly it's every 50 years yeah so but

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:50.719
it's going to it's going to be nice dude

01:27:50.719 --> 01:27:52.960
