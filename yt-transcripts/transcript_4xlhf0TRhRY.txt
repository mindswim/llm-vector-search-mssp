personal plug to the seller Vegas when

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.500
you go to Vegas the toughest thing to do

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.050
is to have tentpole events to do with

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.760

went to two and two people state watched

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.440
the whole I think they're people who

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.180
just don't have fingers and you know

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.440

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.300
every show but really they just probably

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.190

Avengers previous leadership it was like

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.809

00:29:15.809 --> 00:29:17.040

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.490
like any of these oh that I mean that

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:28.020
makes sense you have to say that though

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:29.640
yeah I think there was a kid's movie I

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.130
don't know how else to cuz that's

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:33.630
insulting because the thing is it's not

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:35.309
a kids movie they're movies for people

00:29:35.309 --> 00:29:37.620
who like these things to say it's a kids

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:39.570
movies just insulting when it's not it's

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:40.860
an its adult they're big there's a the

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.660
billions of dollars sold I think you

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:45.470
don't like I would say it's a kids movie

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:49.980
that adults have begged for so it's made

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.110
for adults

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:55.340
who want to go back to their childhood

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:58.020
it's not going back to your childhood

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:01.890
it's a sort it's a it's a [ __ ] genre

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:03.600
comic books are a thing they're like

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.140
that man

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.580
they're not Batman it's great but I'm

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:06.690
saying like it's a thing that's like

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:08.910
these are just like you know it's - its

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:11.280
storytelling it's a form of story - so

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.750
you're saying that it's more it's

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.690
generous for everyone but it's like it's

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:17.340
not just like hey we want ya they're

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:18.450
gonna make a lot of money off of toys

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:20.250
and [ __ ] but it's like yeah it's for

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:23.130
it's a form of I mean I'm a fan yeah but

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:24.690
I know that I'm going to Italy I'm going

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:26.460
in a fantasy land what I want yeah yeah

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.440
I think it's it's any of that [ __ ] you

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.720
know like Greek Greek [ __ ] mythology

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.549
what do you think about Geno I think

00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:35.010
what ruins is the people that get mad at

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:38.130
it not being done well enough so it's

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:39.720
not that like like I can watch the movie

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.950
and go

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:43.080
I like the Avengers I like I like I

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.970
can't wait for the next one and then

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:46.860
when I go online and I read people's

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.809
response to it like I can't believe he

00:30:48.809 --> 00:30:51.299
had the horn on his helmet it wasn't

00:30:51.299 --> 00:30:53.730
true to life and you're like oh my don't

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:55.470
make me a loser now if there's an under

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:56.130
likingness

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:57.900
I get that there's i underst I don't

00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.429
like them because always way too picky

00:30:59.429 --> 00:31:01.110
but there is a feeling to me because I

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.660
love comic books yeah but comic books

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.179
are like there's it's good storytelling

00:31:06.179 --> 00:31:08.070
but yeah a lot of the movies it's super

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:10.140
watered down for everybody right so it's

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.790
like when you see the movies people are

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:13.500
let's imagine stand-up comedy then

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.570
they're like oh this is [ __ ] you know

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:17.880
Johnny hack and everyone goes oh the

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.500
comedy is just silly it's like no no no

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.260
you don't know about Louie or Doug stand

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.299
we've seen crashing you know you know

00:31:24.299 --> 00:31:30.900
but I'm saying I watch crashing and I

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.760
watched it for like ten minutes and it

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.370
felt like all the notes are there but I

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:37.250
was like it felt like I don't know how

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:39.780
Pete Holmes his character had anyone in

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:42.690
comedy would like him his character know

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:45.390
the character very feels very climbing

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:47.309
to me and if you met him you'd be like

00:31:47.309 --> 00:31:49.590
oh like that's kind of the whole show to

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.940
me I'd be like I don't think this guy

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.500
would get in as quick as he did with all

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.230
these people yeah with the energy he had

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:57.660
but but you died no I understand what

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.070
I'm saying with the comic book thing is

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:01.200
it like what we love about comic books

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.240
is like the super in the the great

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.700
writing of like [ __ ] amazing story at

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:06.000
least

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.280
tellers Straczynski ramita all these

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.500
amazing people that do that and then you

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.140
get [ __ ] uh and then they just do

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.940
movies pretty much that this wash it all

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:17.010
through with for everybody Oh Pollock

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:23.070
yeah yeah this is fine I mean like what

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:24.900
you're doing well you just say anything

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.220
like you know I like that yeah it's all

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.470
good but I'm saying that like it's that

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:29.760
I understand why the nerds get mad

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.290
because you're not seeing what we see

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:33.060
and why we look they can't keep up with

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.700
your imagination no they can't keep up

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.650
with our storytelling they can't keep

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:40.980
what was missing from the first Verte of

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.020
the story that was like whitewashed form

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.480
I know I think infinite I think these

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.980
things are getting pretty close to like

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:48.840
let's watch the preview let's sit let's

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:53.160
see what we got here is this play on the

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.160
listening game it's on it it's not great

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.590
for audio only see I saw this when I

00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:59.910
said this sounds like Day After Tomorrow

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:03.720
yeah yeah see this is why it's it looks

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.730
good to me

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:08.730
because

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.520
tighten up the shield

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.370
I mean well no that was us saying he

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:20.660
didn't have the shield in the last movie

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.240
yeah so this is us them saying hey back

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.930
baby it's back forever America's gonna

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:30.290
say maybe you dark though I mean it's

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:32.150
like that gonna be dark that's what

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:33.500
they're planning and that's the thing

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.640
with these movies is with especially

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.860
with this it's like for comic book

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.120
movies they're always trying to be like

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.890
oh here's an origin story oh hey we're

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:41.720
we're tiptoeing in with this it looks

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.610
like oh no you're already in you've been

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:45.290
in they had now let's get to every

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:47.690
literally made 30 movies lead up to this

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:51.230
yeah it's a it is a feat what they did

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:53.840
yes it is a crazy two dollar industry it

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:57.890
is a crazy feat to take literally 20 I

00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:58.880
don't know how many movies ever have

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.880
been but from Iron Man one to get to

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:05.450
this point is in it without any holes

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:07.160
there's no maybe I like these [ __ ]

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.300
things this is I'm saying

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:12.320
Iron Man was great you know what I

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.180
[ __ ] there's the sense of humor in

00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:16.280
all these movies just sucks they do that

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.850
I just [ __ ] but to me that's what breaks

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:22.340
a comic book II cuz if you read a comic

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:23.780
book I know that there's like they'll be

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:27.440
hacky funny lines and comic books that

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.020
like are like that yeah it depends on

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.310
the writer a good writer with a good

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:32.420
sense of humor is gonna write good stuff

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:32.960
okay

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.430
you know but like yeah sometimes if

00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:35.450
these guys are trying to be funny and

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:37.040
it's like oh god I'm a [ __ ] throw up

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.270
but to have like to have the second

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:44.780
guardians of the galaxy fit in yes is

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:47.180
[ __ ] insane it's an amazing great

00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:49.400

panther racist very Philly of is

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:55.880
something that's your version of saying

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.150
the n-word

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:05.950
I mean hated Black Panther yeah yeah I

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:08.510
didn't really kind of danced around but

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:10.520

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.280

the game was a boring game but the game

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.180

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.950
on the show the show is what the show is

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:58.319

tan I drank on the baby straight and

00:38:29.519 --> 00:38:31.049
then we put a bunch of bets on all

00:38:31.049 --> 00:38:32.910
different problems yes we did that's so

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.460

I was seven vodka sodas Dean that's

00:38:38.339 --> 00:38:41.039
great that's a it's it's a what I'm

00:38:41.039 --> 00:38:44.789
saying you is alcohol and gambling will

00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:48.329
improve anything in your life so we had

00:38:48.329 --> 00:38:50.670
prop bets on you know Brady's

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:52.799
completions yeah yeah the over/under on

00:38:52.799 --> 00:38:54.539
the yards and we put we divided the

00:38:54.539 --> 00:38:56.400
money across all those different things

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.259
we had Edelman winning the MVP at twenty

00:38:58.259 --> 00:39:01.380
to one we killed that been lost on Brady

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:03.900
over completions Brady over yards and we

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.250
won you know a little bit of money but

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:07.950
also by the third quarter I'm looking

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:09.869
around the room being like it's ten

00:39:09.869 --> 00:39:12.059
three like I had no idea course because

00:39:12.059 --> 00:39:14.490
I'm too busy kind of under the table

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:15.869
high-fiving my brother over Brady

00:39:15.869 --> 00:39:17.309
getting his first interception yeah yeah

00:39:17.309 --> 00:39:18.779
yeah because we're like we bet on him

00:39:18.779 --> 00:39:21.779
having one interception so I like what

00:39:21.779 --> 00:39:23.880
was you know the you know the Sal

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.170
Vulcano we all can't be you know

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:26.910
Hollywood people like yourselves Jay but

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:30.960
you know they we you have to know that

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.359
you have to we have to play our own fun

00:39:33.359 --> 00:39:35.579
yeah yeah so when so when everyone's

00:39:35.579 --> 00:39:38.009
like it's boring like the the halftime

00:39:38.009 --> 00:39:39.529

00:39:42.599 --> 00:39:45.599
five or five five you know I don't love

00:39:45.599 --> 00:39:47.609
them but they're fine here's the thing

00:39:47.609 --> 00:39:49.200
so there's a sign for the halftime show

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.370
that's like to me that's the store

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:55.240
of the of the superbowls how anger how

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:59.290
angry the halftime show made people that

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:01.660
is now Shane would you think of the

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:03.100
halftime show

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:06.700
I like it so boy big boy is great love

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:09.250
that fur coat dressed like my Nana Adam

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.920
Devine Adam Levine how do you say well

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.750
let's go for let's go through a fan beat

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:15.340
from that not a fan of these tattoos

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.710
he's definitely got added in the last

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:18.460
five years

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:21.160
now they are I'll fake this [ __ ]

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.530
human being is so I don't like him you

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:26.770
don't like I just don't think there was

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:28.450
a win for maroon 5

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:30.630
there was never a minute God announced

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:34.180
people were angry yes every suck well

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:37.240
they suck is just that's the retweet

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:40.210
able position yeah is they suck but why

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:43.380
because it's top 40 [ __ ] music

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:46.030
should have been put in there but

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:49.960
instead of that van Halen all the time

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.840
about half price better concert but

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.450
that's the thing that they are you're

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:57.520
competing with the only thing I the only

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.220
band that could be put in for a Super

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.540
Bowl halftime show right now it's old

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:04.420
bands like I don't think there could be

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:07.000
any new young top 40 person that could

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.890
come in with any Perry was funny Perry

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:12.280
was pretty fun Lady Gaga would kill it I

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:15.010
think this is the best you did yeah but

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:16.450
I'm saying they are they've done it

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:17.950
already they do it to promote a tour

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:20.470
screw so like when is what I just think

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:22.030
the Internet has everyone on the

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:24.040
Internet has turned into like Statler

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.770
and Waldorf and Waldorf yeah the whole

00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:29.140
internet yeah like the news came out

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:32.050
everyone was like [ __ ] maroon 5 so now

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:34.750
like I kind of feel bad from room 4 at

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:37.540
Adam Levine also tons of people turned

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.160
it down hot tank because of the kneeling

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.440
thing right like the true jay-z jay-z

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.880
probably would have done it he wouldn't

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:44.320
have done it for the but we are all

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:47.590
walled the thing is like I always think

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:49.900
of like you know because then I think of

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:51.040
like then they said that he didn't look

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.600
like he wanted to be there everyone was

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.870
saying he nailed it

00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:58.090
so like right to me there's a lot of

00:41:58.090 --> 00:41:59.590
people if we can play it like a segment

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:01.620
of I thought he I thought he did great

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:04.270
well they said that he mailed it in he

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:04.790
was kind of

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:06.980
right Jules would have been [ __ ] on

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:08.330
the Jules would have been awesome but

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:10.310
who cares around sides I would run the

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:12.260
jewels do it no this is the thing

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.330
absolutely I was thinking about whoever

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:17.990
they would choose the thing is SIA is in

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:20.540
Atlanta big big boy I bet run the jewels

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:25.490
they could have got got a lot of [ __ ]

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:29.510
you for doing yeah I just think like I

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:31.940
always think of like Frank Sinatra he

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:35.900
did think about free Frank Sinatra from

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:41.540
the grave so but Frank Sinatra never had

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:43.900
to hear what people thought of him oh

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.280
yeah like cuz I'm along with the five

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:49.220
but this is the thing with friends and I

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:52.310
sure never had to hear him some go we

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:55.880
booked Frank Sinatra and then a thousand

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.620
women going he treats women badly

00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:04.670
[ __ ] had to hear from minute one yeah

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:07.520
how much people hated that he was booked

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:11.570
for it yeah yeah no no that's a new rule

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:15.490
what's the new rule with the rules

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:18.080

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:18.980
last time I was here and they're like

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:20.120

[ __ ] doing it oh wait and now there's

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.620
now an official rule is low what I'm

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.510
waiting for that is it because were you

00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:29.180

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.730
story where the spongebob community I

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:13.080
didn't understand this so here's the

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.240
story spongebob if we could pause this

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:16.890
bring up the spongebob story on the

00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:20.250
spongebob was the the creator of

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:23.280
spongebob was died this year so there

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.980
was this this outreach where spongebob

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:30.030
fans wanted a song from spongebob

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:32.280
squarepants played during the Super Bowl

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:34.500
halftime in memoriam crazy and then

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:36.900
here's a crazy the Internet okay this

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.630
story makes me hate the internet so

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:42.420
[ __ ] much yeah yeah so maroon 5 not a

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.300
tip they're capped to the spongebob

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:46.260
people and

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:49.080
did like an interlude playing some

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.960
spongebob music okay for the biggest

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:56.250
[ __ ] TV event of the year yeah they

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:59.280
did a nod to this group of [ __ ]

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.010
losers and then the story today is that

00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:04.740
all losers the spongebob people why are

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:07.710
they losers because they should that's

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:09.660
for children but superhero movies isn't

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:12.120
oh no I think that spongebob which I

00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:16.520
like and I think is well written is 100%

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:18.810
you can't like it but I don't think it's

00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:19.830
aimed at a change

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:23.670
your point is made because it is in the

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:25.770
similar ket I think they're the same in

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:27.930
comic books are different comic book

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:29.130
movies are a hundred percent different

00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:30.180
there's a group of people that would say

00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:31.980
the Spongebob there's no playing to

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:33.900
audiences at once I definitely say since

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:35.670
I would definitely say that older people

00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:37.410
can appreciate it's well written but

00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:38.580
they're not playing the Spongebob

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:40.560
they're not playing infinity war at two

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.720
o'clock on the afternoon on a Monday I

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.070
think we could move easy but I think we

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:47.910
can all agree that spongebob do clock in

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:49.080
the afternoon and Monday it's a very

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:50.820
common time for movies to be played no

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:52.470
no hang on what I'm saying is it like

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:54.270
there there's a there's like these there

00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:55.860
sure there's gonna be some but spongebob

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.260
is primarily gonna be for the kids the

00:48:58.260 --> 00:48:59.730
adults bringing their kids these movies

00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:02.340
not necessarily the like alright they're

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:04.440
not playing spongebob at midnight

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.260
showing a spongebob Greg Merson yeah you

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:09.750
can agree spongebob by the way I'm

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:11.550
comparing these are this these losers

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:12.780
are on the same field the ones that

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:15.270
would get mad over the Horn of Abu Dhabi

00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:17.430
yeah but that not being correct on the

00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:18.960
Internet is the same losers I would sit

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:21.150
at home going ha cuz what happened was

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:22.770
but it's anybody who's too into anything

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:25.770
it's the same poser who says gays nobody

00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:27.870

enough it's just - no it's never enough

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:16.740
because it's not the internet that's

00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:19.500
that 0.2% of people that now have a

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:21.270
voice and want to yell about anything

00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:23.220
but it's being reported on because

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.230
people report on tweets now you should

00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:27.750
be [ __ ] reporting on tweets the

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:31.830
probable story I want to read Mike you

00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:33.480
the story Mike this doesn't involve

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.190
drugs or alcohol or anything fun you can

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:37.080
read it there were murmurs that the band

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:38.369
would do some sort of tribute to the

00:50:38.369 --> 00:50:40.020
animated show about the sponge who lives

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.119
in a pineapple under the sea but nothing

00:50:42.119 --> 00:50:44.609
was certain until today in fact over 1.2

00:50:44.609 --> 00:50:46.380
million people signed a change.org

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:49.410
petition to have maroon 5 performed the

00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:51.359
show song sweet victory which was

00:50:51.359 --> 00:50:53.099
performed during a spongebob squarepants

00:50:53.099 --> 00:50:55.500
episode in 2001 where spongebob gave the

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.180
halftime show again that looked eerily

00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:58.859
like the Super Bowls great episode and

00:50:58.859 --> 00:51:00.960
Marin 5 teased the spongebob appearance

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.990
in a January 13th tweet that documented

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:05.490
some of their Super Bowl prep now we

00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:08.670
have all the proof we need let's see and

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:10.020
then right after the Super Bowl moment

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:11.550
Travis Scott arrived in a literal

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:13.760
fireball and started rapping SiC Omo

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.500
if you said that said to anyone yeah 20

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:17.880

00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:24.869
they got the moment they got the

00:51:24.869 --> 00:51:27.359
acknowledgment it just wasn't what they

00:51:27.359 --> 00:51:29.700
exactly wanted yeah it's like it just

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:31.650
kind of this is to me nothing would have

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:33.420
been but this is where this is what the

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:36.359
internet is now like this is em prepare

00:51:36.359 --> 00:51:39.089
the teas if they would have played

00:51:39.089 --> 00:51:42.480
victory someone like someone spongebob

00:57:28.109 --> 00:57:30.060
if Billy Joel wasn't so [ __ ] drunk

00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:31.650

guy who trained the dogs I could see

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:26.690

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:29.000
a [ __ ] Super Bowl champion like I

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.560
want to do that I want to do that yeah

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.560

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:35.599
they'd let me step in to the Super Bowl

01:10:35.599 --> 01:10:39.619
you know yeah I could run yeah yeah I

01:10:39.619 --> 01:10:42.110
mean is that a choral is that is that is

01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:44.330
that the same dude better it stand up in

01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:45.710
this than any of us would do

01:10:45.710 --> 01:10:49.160
yes if maybe I could kick what if we

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.350
were put like defensive defensive end

01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:53.570
you don't think we could do as badly as

01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:55.520
this what would happen to you if you win

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:57.980
I don't the end would be I would pervert

01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:01.640
the person I could at least add en round

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.230
and often well not only I could get

01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:04.640
around but I think I could run into them

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.630
without dying

01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:08.660
you couldn't an NFL offensive lineman

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:10.070
just run into them they would throw me

01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:11.720
to the ground and then I would go on my

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:13.460
very lay on you and their [ __ ] their

01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:16.490
big tell you why I would be ok because

01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:17.810
I've been through this scenario before

01:11:17.810 --> 01:11:21.320
they put me in right no one passes me

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.850
the ball and I'm just standing there

01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:24.260
with my hands open for a whole [ __ ]

01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:25.730
game here's their top scorer who

01:11:25.730 --> 01:11:28.730
wouldn't be put at wide receiver why not

01:11:28.730 --> 01:11:32.180
you're going fullback I'm getting

01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:34.430
annihilate what's the full-back do runs

01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:37.070

01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:38.960
lock them out of the way why cuz I'm big

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.570

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.390
was the last documentation of my running

01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:55.730
I said if you ran a 50-yard dash in 5

01:11:55.730 --> 01:11:57.260
seconds you you might have some wheels

01:11:57.260 --> 01:11:58.550
dude that's why I used to have

01:11:58.550 --> 01:12:01.010
well since baby you did that was a

01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:03.470
inaccurate time so now that what 5.2

01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:16.070
it you think we live in reality yeah I

01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:18.200

of you guys right now I'm not saying I

01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:22.040
would run a better than a 5-2 yeah yeah

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:23.960
I'm also we're talking to sixth grade

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.280
when I was in my height of my

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:30.650
rollerblading career six I'm bad fat

that's worse than dippin

01:12:39.570 --> 01:12:43.440
Shayne he fell into that being a fast 40

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:47.310
what you didn't know 5-2 was fast that's

01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:50.160

high-fiving this guy responded to Louie

01:14:15.710 --> 01:14:20.160
by saying doing his own version of dead

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:22.110
baby joke he was Louie also wasn't

01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:23.670
making fun of dead baby I know

01:14:23.670 --> 01:14:26.430
well that's the thing you put the veil

01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:29.550
of the issue over yourself and you say

01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:31.800

stand-up is not gonna be good well

01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:51.810
I don't think that was what you were

01:14:51.810 --> 01:14:52.980

into the school on Valentine's Day hey

01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:03.270
skinny kid it's probably a language

01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:15.330
things BAM it's just it's a tough watch

01:16:15.330 --> 01:16:16.800
because you're like you're sit there

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:20.490
going I know exactly what you that it's

01:16:20.490 --> 01:16:23.100
everything that happened is awful do we

01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:25.410
do we have to come for this video then

01:16:25.410 --> 01:16:27.210
it gets put on your feed and people go

01:16:27.210 --> 01:16:30.090
that's right yeah look at what happened

01:16:30.090 --> 01:16:32.730
and it's like you know look movies doing

01:16:32.730 --> 01:16:34.590
a joke where he's referencing them and

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:36.990
like you know referencing the idea of

01:16:36.990 --> 01:16:39.420
children telling adults how to act and

01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:41.370
there's like yeah and also it was

01:16:41.370 --> 01:16:43.110
released before it was ready it wasn't

01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:44.640
even a worked out joke people they were

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:46.050
laughing and then it's like this guy

01:16:46.050 --> 01:16:48.030
comes out it's like I get what he's

01:16:48.030 --> 01:16:50.880
doing but like I guess my point is like

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:53.040
if he if he at the end of this was like

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:54.180
here's that I don't know if he at the

01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:55.680
end does he give a place that you can go

01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:58.830
and talk to people about gun control or

01:16:58.830 --> 01:17:01.110
is this about shaming Louie for making

01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:02.940
the joke I bet he does toss in something

01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:03.900
at the end but this is kind

01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:06.960
about him obviously that's me said well

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.300
he takes care of himself he likes his B

01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:11.340
this is a weird dad behavior yeah you

01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:12.360
think this is weird

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.890
I think I'm surprised that guys wearing

01:17:13.890 --> 01:17:15.000

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.550

01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:57.030
make fun of these kids it was about

01:17:57.030 --> 01:18:00.690
making light of like oh they're dead but

01:18:00.690 --> 01:18:02.640
the were though we're making these

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.530
people heroes for not getting shot and

01:18:04.530 --> 01:18:06.690
then the ones who didn't get shot like

01:18:06.690 --> 01:18:07.920
well I'm a hero I'm gonna take down

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:11.250
louis c.k and it all comes out they're

01:18:11.250 --> 01:18:12.570
doing exactly what he was making fun of

01:18:12.570 --> 01:18:15.570
yeah yeah I also felt that Louie's point

01:18:15.570 --> 01:18:17.790
was that like the idea the joke is at

01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:19.950
vert still children they don't know

01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:22.020
about making laws you know and it's like

01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:24.720
yes one percent support them talking and

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:25.950
getting out there and being a face but

01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:27.030
it's like but they don't know but

01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:28.920
they're still children you know where it

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:30.960
goes into this then yeah what were we

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:32.610
doing when we were children it's like

01:18:32.610 --> 01:18:34.050
you're not fully developed it's like and

01:18:34.050 --> 01:18:35.670
that's what Louie always did he says

01:18:35.670 --> 01:18:37.710
here's a thing we hold sacred here's the

01:18:37.710 --> 01:18:39.390
one tiny piece that maybe we should

01:18:39.390 --> 01:18:40.950
question I never thought about how

01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:42.780
good-looking the dad is I think he looks

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:46.800
great this is he's a grieving father

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:57.390
that looks this good great tan together

01:18:57.390 --> 01:19:00.210
