00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.160
chat

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
i like to use dat chat

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.719
to send death threats to people

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.480
and then i delete them after as soon as

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.160
i send them yes

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.360
and they don't recommend that you do

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.079
that but you technically can you can do

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.239
that on their platform because of how

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.840
user-friendly it is it's the most

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.360
user-friendly application on the

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.120
internet and i've often said that it's

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.680
the safest it's a safe it's a safe

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.840

like i can make it bounce no sports bra

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:07.120

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.320

that's when it started that's when it

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.320
started i was getting [ __ ] up in

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.240
jamaica and i wasn't doing stand-up and

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.880

i wanted to unleash on twitter

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.159
yeah

00:23:18.159 --> 00:23:20.080
it's a different medium as an artist

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.080
like it's like painting or sculpting or

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.200
something like that it's a whole

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.960
different medium but you just light your

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.240
hair and as an artist i get hammered

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.520
but dude painters definitely do that

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.440

was painting and you could tell whose

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.960
faces he was working on he was super

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.640
drunk you ever see uh i think it's

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.559

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.600

that's where my twitter's at

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.440
the end of his life he just

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.039
he would he lost his mind and he would

00:23:53.039 --> 00:23:55.039
paint at night with like candles on top

00:23:55.039 --> 00:23:56.400

go around and collect money and then

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.679
finally somebody with a gun would come

00:31:13.679 --> 00:31:15.519
up and be like give me all that damn it

00:31:15.519 --> 00:31:19.480

preposterous it's getting there that's a

00:31:23.279 --> 00:31:25.039
preposterous individual that you've got

00:31:25.039 --> 00:31:27.840
across from you that's wild yeah i saw a

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.519
dude on the train today or like he was

00:31:29.519 --> 00:31:31.279
like sitting outside of like the fourth

00:31:31.279 --> 00:31:33.679
street station and he was uh he was like

00:31:33.679 --> 00:31:35.600
playing the flute along to like uh

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.519
celine dion or something like that and

00:31:37.519 --> 00:31:38.720
then like he took a breath and the

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.399
[ __ ] flute kept on going he was like

00:31:40.399 --> 00:31:42.080
a millie vanilla situation he was just

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.519
faking the funk with the flute he was

00:31:43.519 --> 00:31:45.679
just pretending to play the flute oh

00:31:45.679 --> 00:31:47.039
yeah yeah yeah i've seen you know what

00:31:47.039 --> 00:31:48.640
i'm talking about i saw dude playing

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.559
guitar and then his phone like fell out

00:31:50.559 --> 00:31:52.080
of his pocket and there was like an aux

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.159
cord connected to it and everything

00:31:54.159 --> 00:31:56.240
what yeah yeah like it's all fired up

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.200
that's a great move yeah it's so sneaky

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.399
but a lot of them are pretty bad at

00:32:00.399 --> 00:32:02.159
pulling it off it's very sneaky or

00:32:02.159 --> 00:32:03.519
there's a dude in philly who's been

00:32:03.519 --> 00:32:05.200
there for probably about 10 years at

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.039
this point who's like at fourth and

00:32:07.039 --> 00:32:09.039
market and he plays the saxophone every

00:32:09.039 --> 00:32:11.440
day and like uh he can't play a single

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.320
song like he's just like

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.919
and it just doesn't have any kind of

00:32:15.919 --> 00:32:18.320
like consistent melody or like he's not

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.919

00:32:19.919 --> 00:32:22.240
pictures with him take video him dance

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.600
and if you only see it once you're like

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.679
oh he's like avant-garde and like jazzy

00:32:25.679 --> 00:32:27.600
but really he's just like smashing yeah

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.279
smashing buttons on there there's a guy

00:32:29.279 --> 00:32:31.360
who used to dance on broad street every

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.559

yeah he's fully dressed as jesus and he

00:33:00.159 --> 00:33:02.159
carries around like a full life-sized

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.200
[Laughter]

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.520

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:29.119

i got my open mic punch card that he he

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.320
has to go to a certain amount of open

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.359
mics that he pays for

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.920
no that's about right i got nine more to

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.680
go you're in a tough spot cause you have

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:48.800
fans

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.280
before stand up yeah that's hard to do

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.720
it's weird because i wouldn't do open

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.680
mics

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.359
if i it was a draw

00:37:55.359 --> 00:37:57.760
i didn't i did them i did them for like

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.680
a couple months yeah but it came to a

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.119
point it was also like right when they

00:38:01.119 --> 00:38:02.400
opened up again it came to a point where

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.480
i was like this is i think this is less

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.000
helpful than it is it could be i don't

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.079
know i didn't do open mics in new york

00:38:08.079 --> 00:38:10.160
yeah i waited i was in philly until i

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.480
was 30. yeah i would like go

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.880
from work at like five and i would like

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.960
take the train i would like go and

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.320
you got to pay for like the two drink

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.760
minimum and stuff and then you get there

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.040
and it would be like me and one other

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.040
person yeah host

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.560
they'd be like you guys can do like 15

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:25.599
minutes

00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:28.720
that like to adjust to youtube

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:31.119
no no thank you was it like that early

00:38:31.119 --> 00:38:32.960
on in uh in philly i assume it's

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.480
probably worse in some spots if you're

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.920
doing open mics

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.440
yeah philly was

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.720
right philly had a good scene though

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.760
like raven lounge in philly is good

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.839
helium on tuesdays is good

00:38:43.839 --> 00:38:44.960
yeah it was nice could it be like

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:48.079
crowded yeah and there'd be 60 [ __ ]

00:38:48.079 --> 00:38:50.240
comics really yeah but that gets to the

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.280
point where you're like you're literally

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.359
seeing the same people do the same act

00:38:53.359 --> 00:38:54.880
yeah yeah every single five [ __ ]

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.000
years yeah

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.599
that's crazy some people don't change

00:38:57.599 --> 00:38:58.960
their act so you're watching a guy do

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:01.040
the same act what is he what is he

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.560
waiting for or he's just trying to get

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.880

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.240

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.400
i was like well that's not true

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.400
that can't be true he's been saying it

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.680
for a long time

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.359
he definitely has stomach i know he has

00:39:51.359 --> 00:39:53.280
stomach problems but i don't think it's

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.880
that bad

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.800
i don't he said he had a hiatal hernia

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.160
which means that his like stomach gets

00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.920
sucked up into his esophagus or vice

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.680
versa and part of his body's in another

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.520
part of his body and he had surgery to

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.359
get it reversed but if he throws up

00:40:05.359 --> 00:40:08.000
it'll unreverse it and like he has to

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.079
like take pills or something yeah but he

00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:11.920
still gets shit-faced and he still stays

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.000
out until all out he risks dude he puts

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.760
it on the line yeah

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.119
i appreciate that he literally was

00:40:17.119 --> 00:40:19.119
sitting there we're all drinking heavily

00:40:19.119 --> 00:40:21.520
and he's like if i throw up i'll die

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.119
all

00:40:23.119 --> 00:40:25.760
that right be true yeah but then later

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.000
on he took sass out and like uh he was

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
being so annoying he kidnapped him he

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.760
took his phone away and he was feeding

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.680
him shots

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.880
and we were out until like four in the

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:37.280
morning wait that night yeah oh man i

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.800
missed that i know that's what i was

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.560
saying and he said that he was telling

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.640
sas he was like ron will never do this

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.960
ron will never take you out like

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.480
what the [ __ ] bro i'll show you a good

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.760
time i'll show you a good ass time

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.359
we were in line at the bar that we went

00:40:51.359 --> 00:40:52.880
to and he goes up to the bouncer and he

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.640
goes his id is fake and then they

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.040
wouldn't let me in for like five minutes

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.880
and i was like dude like can i please go

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.200
in and then finally he let me go

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.800
i completely forgot about that until now

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.400
that is really funny of him to do that

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.960
though no it wasn't it's funny to ask

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.440
like do you take fake id's to the people

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.200
at the bar when when they're going in

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.280
unless someone has a fake id yeah i've

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.560
been with him three times when he's

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.960
gotten his fakes taken away oh no yeah

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.040
he also it doesn't help he looks super

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.200
young that's why he needs to get fat bro

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.880
he needs to get that dirty bolt going

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.560
you get it yeah i think the fatter i get

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.079
the younger i look yeah it's typically

00:41:26.079 --> 00:41:27.920
otherwise yeah although i'm defying that

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:30.480
pretty well right now

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.240

cause normally i would last like i used

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.480
to drink a lot and then i stopped for a

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.400
while but drinking back then was much

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.319
sadder yeah yeah

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.000

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.920

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.800
didn't know barstool was like a company

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.319
like this like i thought it was just

00:44:10.319 --> 00:44:12.400
like uh like the instagram

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:14.400
sure and i tweeted and my tweets exactly

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.319
were like bar stool is like the lowest

00:44:16.319 --> 00:44:18.560
form of comedy i think that's about what

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:20.640
i was hitting yeah

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.000
i think that's about where i was i think

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.319
i was like it's the chive yeah yeah

00:44:24.319 --> 00:44:25.280
dudes

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.480
i think it was actually i said total

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.160
frat move in bar stool yeah i was just

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.599
being a uh

00:44:29.599 --> 00:44:31.599
fat little [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah but that's

00:44:31.599 --> 00:44:32.960
what you were doing too exactly little

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.200
[ __ ] i was like they're having fun and

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.280
yeah but it's also kind of true

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:39.200
like there's there's a grain of truth

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.560
you know what i mean you know

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.960
you guys i think barcelona's aged well

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.359
it's like comedy has aged well and

00:44:45.359 --> 00:44:47.839
self-aware like yeah people being able

00:44:47.839 --> 00:44:49.359
to say whatever they want that's aged

00:44:49.359 --> 00:44:51.040
well and i think that there's

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.800
been a grain of like self-awareness

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:54.319
that's kind of grown a little bit that's

00:44:54.319 --> 00:44:55.599
like okay and of course that's how it

00:44:55.599 --> 00:44:58.240
was you guys we're all young if if if a

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.160

the [ __ ] out that's the best part about

00:45:20.079 --> 00:45:21.920

00:50:00.319 --> 00:50:02.160
what was the uh how long have you been

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.720
doing the podcast before it like uh

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:06.640
really started to to blow up like how

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.240
how long have you and matt been doing uh

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:09.920
uh

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:12.000
probably like six years ago six years

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.760
that's crazy yeah you were early to the

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:15.119
podcast yeah

00:50:15.119 --> 00:50:16.000
it was

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.319
we already had the podcast when trump

00:50:18.319 --> 00:50:19.520
got elected

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.359
so you're three three presidents you

00:50:21.359 --> 00:50:22.559
guys have been going we started under

00:50:22.559 --> 00:50:24.839
alabama

00:50:24.839 --> 00:50:27.520
yeah when did it like start to pop off

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.440
um well it's funny because right when we

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:30.400
started

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:32.640
libsyn was [ __ ] uh the the server we

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.720
used for our podcast that gives us

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.559
numbers was [ __ ] up and it was

00:50:36.559 --> 00:50:38.720
telling us like 40 000 people are

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.400
listening this every week and we were

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.240
like dude

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.839
this is crazy

00:50:43.839 --> 00:50:45.520
and then

00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:46.640
like

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.640
and then like five months later they

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.800
were like sorry about that bug here's

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.280
your real numbers it was like 140 people

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:56.160
oh my god god damn it

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.839
that would actually ruin that

00:50:57.839 --> 00:50:59.280
which was actually it probably helped

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.960
because otherwise we may have stopped

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:02.319
yeah you know what i mean but we saw

00:51:02.319 --> 00:51:04.079
those numbers we got to satisfy this

00:51:04.079 --> 00:51:05.760
stadium of people exactly that was

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.119
literally our thought process i was like

00:51:07.119 --> 00:51:09.599
dude 40 000 is a stadium yeah it's the

00:51:09.599 --> 00:51:12.160
vet yeah and then uh

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:15.040
no it started going well and then uh

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.640
from me doing like bonfire and legion of

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.640
skanks with like soda and j yeah and

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.559

and like just saying random [ __ ] i

00:53:23.839 --> 00:53:26.000

00:53:28.079 --> 00:53:29.680

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:31.530
minutes

00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:33.359
[Laughter]

00:53:33.359 --> 00:53:35.119
i was just making [ __ ] up and i was

00:53:35.119 --> 00:53:36.960
sweating was it going well was making up

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:40.839
stuff funny um because that can be funny

00:53:40.839 --> 00:53:43.280
no it wasn't you're like circling back

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.160
to other premises

00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:48.640
and i'm like i had like my phone like um

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:50.000
on the bench and i didn't really look at

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.359
it but then i'm just like scrolling up

00:53:51.359 --> 00:53:52.800
and down and like there's nothing left

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:55.359
yeah yeah yeah there's nothing here

00:53:55.359 --> 00:53:57.839
yeah you don't take a phone up like uh

00:53:57.839 --> 00:53:59.920
with you or anything like that i do i i

00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:01.680
to time it i just sort of timer right

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:02.880
there although you're supposed to record

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.720
your set everybody's

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.319
the trick is to like record your sets

00:54:06.319 --> 00:54:08.800
and then listen back to them i don't

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:11.040
i don't

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.680
uh had the show with uh it was like him

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.680
and there was like a a documentary about

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:17.119
jerry seinfeld or something and there

00:54:17.119 --> 00:54:18.880
was this one comic who was like obsessed

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.559
with [ __ ] becoming the next jerry

00:54:20.559 --> 00:54:23.559
sanders

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:26.960
he got [ __ ] i think by that

00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:28.480
documentary because he looked like a

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:30.000
jerk yeah they made him look like he's

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.240
like a weird jerk in that in real life

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:34.400
he rules and he's very good at stand up

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:35.920
i believe it he's really good but he

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.880
also had like the nfl films library of

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.480
every set that he's ever there are guys

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:41.920
that do that and that's probably it

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.359
probably made him good

00:54:43.359 --> 00:54:45.119
but i also just can't stomach watching

00:54:45.119 --> 00:54:47.200
or listening to myself like that i can't

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.960
yeah i can't at all like you've ever

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.319
listened to your own show you ever l

00:54:50.319 --> 00:54:51.839
have you ever listened to uh sometimes

00:54:51.839 --> 00:54:54.000

00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.720
so funny

00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:59.119

that yeah i could see that especially

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.520

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:58.960

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.480
they internalize their winning and

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:01.599
they're like they feel like they're

01:08:01.599 --> 01:08:03.440

course talk to the boss man yeah yeah

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:28.159
what should he what should he say

01:08:28.159 --> 01:08:29.600
talking to the boss man should he be

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.920
like bold should he be like uh should he

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.679
like kiss the ring like should he

01:08:33.679 --> 01:08:35.359
genuflect or should he be like i'm the

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:36.319
[ __ ]

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:39.120
uh find a medium i don't know

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:41.440
dave at all personally i would imagine

01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:43.440
you got to kiss the ring a little

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:44.799
but here's another thing you do you

01:08:44.799 --> 01:08:47.279
could black out yeah

01:08:47.279 --> 01:08:49.440
that's a good idea and then let it ride

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:50.880
i was thinking about doing that you

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.199
won't even know how the meeting wins

01:08:53.199 --> 01:08:55.199
yeah i just kind of find out like based

01:08:55.199 --> 01:08:57.679
on his response later on

01:08:57.679 --> 01:09:00.000
you get an email that night

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.799
you're fired yeah

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:06.000
the chart remains a little sad and then

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.279
you gotta hit the punch card dude

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:11.600
go back to uh comedians on the loose

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.199
cause like what's the other outlet for

01:09:13.199 --> 01:09:15.040
you like if you get fired from barstool

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:18.080
like where are you going

01:09:18.839 --> 01:09:20.400
school

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.159
don't go to school don't seriously don't

01:09:22.159 --> 01:09:25.520
go to school patreon yeah yeah yeah

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:27.359
that's a viable that's a viable app

01:09:27.359 --> 01:09:29.679
we'll do we'll do patreon and i'll do my

01:09:29.679 --> 01:09:31.440

01:09:36.239 --> 01:09:38.239
the audio some blanks

01:09:38.239 --> 01:09:40.400
patreon is viable like i see comed i

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.679
feel like comedians are like riding

01:09:41.679 --> 01:09:43.520
around in rolls royces based off of

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:45.839
patreon yeah it's like uh rap labels in

01:09:45.839 --> 01:09:48.319

get those bud lights going a little bit

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.679
and you'll also get to where you want to

01:20:29.679 --> 01:20:31.840

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:33.360

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:53.280
the alternative if i was making a bunch

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:55.040
