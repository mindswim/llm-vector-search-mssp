00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.880
excuse yeah no

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.920

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.040
sitting here with a coin on top

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.760
oh

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.440
i've got you i bet you've got a blue

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.120
chewable pill for when this show's over

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.640
he probably got it uh into the tricks

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.920
where he goes 100 like the bluetooth so

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.399
100 bluetooth behind this this is a

00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:38.399
normal diameter on top of this little

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:40.240
cup right here right and then i'm going

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.000
to take this this cup i'm gonna put on

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.880
top of that cup man oh three two one

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.240
dime is gone

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.399
i saw i saw the other cup lift up

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:49.360
already

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.240
what

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.880

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.079
cup at the top and uh

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.639
happened it disappeared mind free

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.600

00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:10.280

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.320
like a bigger version of the pink cups

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.920

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.839
piece of paper instead of a dime yeah

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.880
missed the trick

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.400
he narrowed it down to like a part of

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.480
the deck but that's impressive

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:33.200
he was so bad we thought he was good

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.000
you must think that uh all of the deck

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.679
or nine of hearts

00:25:37.679 --> 00:25:39.360

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.200
nine of hearts

00:25:49.679 --> 00:25:50.270
