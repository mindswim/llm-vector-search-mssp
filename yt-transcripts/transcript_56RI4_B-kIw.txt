somebody's gonna hang on there but uh

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.800
you think the shooting was tied to join

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.720
first of I'd looked it up I think only

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.640
two people got shot and they're okay and

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.070
then they just kept giving speeches like

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.240
there was two million people in the

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.350
crowd they literally were like alright

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:22.180
two people got shot statistically skip

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.740
this thing [ __ ] movement keep rolling

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.130

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:28.330
they were like it's not a mass shoot

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.710
there were like it's nothing so it was

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.300
to blast a regular she's a black person

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.760
okay if I had to guess I don't know you

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.500
don't know but the way that everybody

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.910
was just like well it didn't seem like

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.280

manifestos yeah yeah keep it going

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.930
but what was funny was so the reason

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.450
this whole thing caught my eye sure was

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.270

a couple ladies like mm-hmm like not

it's hard for us now yeah man it was

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.820
[ __ ] wild that's Madi gives a speech

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.430

millenniums it's been so hard for years

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.270
and then somebody's like now that it's

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.610
really hard for women now it's the worst

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.470
this lady was like it's increasingly

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:40.590
Donna and do this lady without like

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.330
basically being like shut the [ __ ] up

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.070
was just like yeah I don't know like

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.050
because she basically purported like we

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.430
need to shift to like all women

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.260
leadership blah blah and the lady it was

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.440
just like yeah I don't know uh she's

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.610
like I hear about the patriarchy she's

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:54.930
like I don't know that a matriarchy will

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:56.340
be much better though saying we need

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.750
more of like a synthesis and like half

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:00.270
yeah she just made too much sense dude

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:03.170
it didn't like you dude like like you

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:06.630
tell they're a little bit like and then

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:07.950
the next lady just asked some other

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:09.870
question like I always ready I was

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.190

watch this [ __ ] the next lady was like

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:15.720
well it's just weird you like talk about

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.390
how like ancient Celtic women were like

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:21.300
in charge of like spiritual matters you

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.500
know like relating it's like it's

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.630
psychology and therapy and yet like I

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.190
don't know I just like don't really see

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:27.780
how that applies analysis it's like a

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.790
male-dominated field it's like dude talk

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.550
therapy's a [ __ ] women dominated

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:34.110
school around this room literally all

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:34.560

the other day is the just a total

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.899
inevitable extinction of the human

00:34:53.899 --> 00:34:54.909
species

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:56.720

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.950
Mars my pretty sure we're gonna be

00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:59.660

the black hand of total non-existence is

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.300
coming for the entire race I would say

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.250
in about 100 years hunter fence oh I

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:12.050

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:15.530
you know that's sure people say that but

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:17.360
it's like all it takes is like one comet

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.920
to [ __ ] nail us so we have no control

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.450
but think about how long humans have

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:22.430
been around you're gonna call you

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:25.610

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:21.380
her easer dome where she probably

internalized that one so you guys should

00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:32.029

he's like he gave it like Reagan's rug

00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:50.380
that was pretty interesting you get to

00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:52.780
pick your desk in the Oval Office like

00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:53.830
certain presidents there's like a

00:59:53.830 --> 00:59:55.660
catalog of like 12 different desks where

00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:56.830
do they keep him which one they I don't

00:59:56.830 --> 00:59:59.710
know but he got the one that I think

00:59:59.710 --> 01:00:02.800
Reagan and JFK used to use well Trump

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.870
daddy pimped out the [ __ ] Oval Office

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:06.760
I haven't been keeping tabs on the Oval

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.680
Office like I didn't know yeah nice and

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.170
he redid the curtains yeah he just make

01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:16.120
it look like Reagan debug it and he's

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:20.080
all flags in there's a bunch of flags

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.490
now in the Oval Office he's like I do

01:00:21.490 --> 01:00:25.690
that that's pretty good huh you got to

01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:27.100
see it it is [ __ ] yeah man you're the

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:27.550
best

01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:29.380
when his makeup starts to run first off

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:30.760
in the morning when they interview him

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:33.730
his makeup is crazy he's got he like

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:36.310
goes blackface really he's black face

01:00:36.310 --> 01:00:38.170
like that spray tan he gets in the

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:40.150
morning his full blackface then he

01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:41.950
sweats it off midway through the day and

01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:44.230
it's just disgusting this is like

01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:47.770
blister he's like talking [ __ ] that'd be

01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:49.420
funny of journalists all stop their

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:51.610
[ __ ] we're like damn when did you

01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:53.530
become the [ __ ] man everyone is

01:00:53.530 --> 01:00:56.620
started to tell me like uh I mean it was

01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:57.970
pretty cool if everyone started me dude

01:00:57.970 --> 01:00:59.890
you're the [ __ ] best he would

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:02.380
definitely be like he would love you

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:03.970
that'd be pretty fun you know what

01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:05.470
you're the best that's why you're the

01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:06.880
best if everyone started hitting him

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.650
with nothing but positive vibes to be so

01:01:08.650 --> 01:01:10.840
funny to see how far he do that'd be a

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:13.060
fun experiment to be like you have total

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:14.770
control and there's no one's anything

01:01:14.770 --> 01:01:16.480
and let him like go about it miss

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.800
pretend like yeah dude what else what

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.480
else what else are you doing just not do

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:21.310
it and reporting back to him it's like

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:23.080
yes it's working you're killing it

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.270
remember that show uh [ __ ] I was talking

01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:27.490
about in for Netflix where the guy does

01:01:27.490 --> 01:01:30.190
these weird social experiments and yeah

01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:31.420
he convinces like someone to push

01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:33.520
someone off of Illinois yes dude if they

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:34.900
did a social experiment on one of the

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.340
presidents and like made them seem like

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:38.800
they had like dictatorial power yeah and

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.630
to see how far they go that would be

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:41.420
fast

01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:44.599
dude yes yes leader what else was funny

01:01:44.599 --> 01:01:46.730
like I'm thinking in that you would just

01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:48.470
have people like fake go up to him be

01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:49.970
like that worked what I'll see you guys

01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:52.730
that was amazing

01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:54.410
see what he does but that's what

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:56.599
happened with now in China that's how

01:01:56.599 --> 01:01:58.069
like 50 million people starved to death

01:01:58.069 --> 01:02:02.270
how was his his cabinet kept giving him

01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:04.010
good news like sweet nobody was

01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:05.359
everybody was afraid to tell him what

01:02:05.359 --> 01:02:08.119
was happening so like massive food

01:02:08.119 --> 01:02:10.520
shortages and his cabinet would come in

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.710
and be like you're killing it dude this

01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:17.510
is all working do imagine if that if you

01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:19.099
did that social experiment and the

01:02:19.099 --> 01:02:20.599
villages end it with him just like a

01:02:20.599 --> 01:02:22.220
ballot in new China I think the crew

01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:24.859
