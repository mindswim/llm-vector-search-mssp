00:29:40.399 --> 00:29:43.440
like the 14 words

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.440
hitler said in i think mineconf and

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.799
there's another version of it too that

00:29:46.799 --> 00:29:48.640
wasn't just hitler but it was 14 words

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.159
that were like

00:29:50.159 --> 00:29:51.360
along the lines of like we need to

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.440
create a better world for white children

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.600

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.119
little bit why don't you cheer for

00:39:29.119 --> 00:39:31.280
kaepernick see what he's up to yeah

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.359
even though ah [ __ ] kaepernick dude i'm

00:39:33.359 --> 00:39:34.880

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.560
that is annoying how everyone's like

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.240
dude blackballing him he's like yeah

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:42.320
well no he's [ __ ] he's not that good

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.520
everyone's like but there's worse than

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.720
him that's like

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.640
maybe but i'd rather have a [ __ ]

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.040
quiet quarterback that sucks than a

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.040
[ __ ] quarterback that's a [ __ ] that

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.440
sucks yeah ah sorry for calling mccunt

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.640
but

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.880
well whatever you get it

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.160
it's not we're sending them back it's

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.079
basically like tim tebow

00:40:00.079 --> 00:40:02.079
yeah it is like

00:40:02.079 --> 00:40:03.440

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.280
he played a little bit and displayed

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.000
that he's kind of capable actually now i

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.400
think kaepernick's pretty

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.240

says the n word in a movie we're like

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:35.920
yeah that's pretty good it's a good

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:37.440
movie

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:41.280
yeah okay leo in good god and

00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:43.200
it's like nice but then bill maher says

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.800
it in a joke and we're like fire that

00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:46.319
[ __ ]

00:54:46.319 --> 00:54:47.520
yeah that's interesting i don't know

00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.680
it's just funny that like i'm an actor

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.520
in it so i said the n word a bunch of

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.400
times and i got away with it in it yeah

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.000
that's true that's right wow why just

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000
because he was pretending to be this

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000
we're like yeah you can say it well

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.079
obviously still the show too so like

00:55:02.079 --> 00:55:04.319
people were just like

00:55:04.319 --> 00:55:07.599
what he saw the show bill maher yeah uh

00:55:07.599 --> 00:55:09.440
he's on the [ __ ] cost dude he's on

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:11.040
the phone they're definitely gonna cut

00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.720
him the sharks are the [ __ ] gay

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.200
sharks are circling now look i i get it

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.800
i understand the other side of the

00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:18.559
argument that i just made my argument

00:55:18.559 --> 00:55:20.559
was kind of stupid but there's just

00:55:20.559 --> 00:55:23.040
something there to that that it's like

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:25.280
why is that profession because acting is

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:26.960
a profession no it makes sense in fact

00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.240
if you can act and say that well it's

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:31.040
cause some other guy wrote it

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:34.079
why can't you write it yeah well [ __ ]

00:55:34.079 --> 00:55:35.359
someone else wrote that i don't know

00:55:35.359 --> 00:55:36.800
that makes sense yeah it's funny to me

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.359
but uh yeah bill maher if i was if i was

00:55:39.359 --> 00:55:40.720
ice cube i'd go down there and school

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:42.960
him that was so frustrating

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:45.119
dude bill maher

00:55:45.119 --> 00:55:47.119

you got too comfortable thought you'd

00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:52.880
get away with it

00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:54.400
it's funny to think that they like just

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.400
laughed afterwards and were like yeah a

00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.839
