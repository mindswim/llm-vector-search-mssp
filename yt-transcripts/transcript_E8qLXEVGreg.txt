[ __ ] Xfinity center before the game

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.100

building and it's not that big

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.579
people are reliving their Super Bowl it

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.829
was nightmarish and then I got into the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.619
game and I was just like I was very you

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.509
know disenchanted by the whole it was

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.299
just like just lights flay looks like a

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.430
[ __ ] casino and every NFL stadium

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.899
using the camera one point hit you and

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.470
like they thought you were an owner

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.579
[Laughter]

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.490
nonplussed look from a box yeah this

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.930
guy's totally unfazed light it's like

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.780
it's like casino legit [ __ ]

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.509
everywhere like brands and logos [ __ ]

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.370
ever just flashing lights and then it's

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.710
like cheerleaders dancing for

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.230
reason why are there cheerleaders why

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.910
the [ __ ] are there Cheerilee yeah and I

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.740
watched them during the game they just

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.840
keep dancing they stand in front of a

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.360
section and just do moves and the people

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.620
in the crowd are just watching the game

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.630
like it's pointless are they supposed to

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.610
come out like it like they run out yeah

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.820
and do a dance of routine yes so stupid

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.850
it is pretty dumb watching 50 women do a

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.370
choreographed dance from like a hundred

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.990
yards away is one of the dumbest things

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.790
you can see it's also kind of a lacking

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.830
faith of like male attention to be like

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.180
the between plays or like the throughout

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.980
half-naked chicks I'm gonna have a dude

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.740
now to the house the dude kills it I'm

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.240
gonna come down there keep a monocle and

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:58.680
that dude the whole time he wears a

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.180
slightly different uniform than the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.280
women what's he rocking he rocks it kind

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.200
of rocking like an Elton John suited

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.020
piano it's so ridiculous to see a guy

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.660
doing those same moves of like every two

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.100
seconds bending down and touching your

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.590
toes and then like and then just that

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.750
knowing the organization being like yeah

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.510

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.460
bunch of dudes from Delco just like I

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.380

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.200
women that's gonna be fun peeing dudes

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.270

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.640
to a troop in the audience and they like

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.350
ladies and gentlemen let's take a moment

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.950

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.320
Staff Sergeant blah blah blah he served

whole crowd stops and claps for him and

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.360

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.450
Sunday we can come here and get all of

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.710
our negative feelings out about

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.080
everything on this guy and the wife and

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.030
the mom like all them were just in the

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.250
box with them listening to their they're

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.990
like oh he gets crazy during the games

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.520
he loves sports only he doesn't know

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.050
what the [ __ ] he's talking about he's

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.520
screaming the wrong thing the whole time

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.830
you were watching a family that's like

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.630
adopted the ethos of like a paper towel

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.830
commercial and they're just living it

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.350
out yes they're just like my husband is

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.390
a fanatic about sports no light beers

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.979
and screams during the game I click my

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.320
tongue but in this secretly I love being

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.940
part of a thing that I can make sense of

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.510
and then there was two chicks behind us

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.060
these two girls that came in just sloppy

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.100
[ __ ] hammered and they just yelled

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.160
the whole time in a boxes man people

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.320
screaming in a box is one of the dumbest

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.820
things I've ever been a part of yeah the

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.260
whole point of that is like separate

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.910
yourself from the holy people um yes

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.919
from the [ __ ] rabble you can just sit

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:08.389
up there and like plot but you're gonna

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:10.300
yeah you can kind of see the movie we

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.190
ate the food in there is so bad it's

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.800
like Philly cheesesteak spring rolls at

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.690
like Bud Light that's what I like filled

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.560
up oh man then I had a cookie bag

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.690
cookies up there at a so you're just

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.110
like miserable eating like horrible food

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.490
but I'm surrounded by all these like

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.410
because it was it has nothing to do with

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.000
it it just happened to be the NBC box

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.020
which was kind of funny

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.930
so I'm around all these like rich old

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.270
people and I'm drunk eating a [ __ ]

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.039
chocolate chip cookie and iced teas

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.840
like I was just standing at the buffet

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:58.580
oh the bathroom wash my clothes there's

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.300
something to do with when you eat

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.620
chocolate looking at the Sun it makes

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.780
you sneeze you got triggered by

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.580
chocolate cookie outdoors yeah I looked

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.110
out and all this [ __ ] lights out

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.949

giant flag then it just blasts hip-hop

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:21.919
and [ __ ] dance yeah and then it's like

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:23.300

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.450
that [ __ ] everywhere yeah yeah say I was

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:30.440
thinking about the time we went to Notre

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.760
Dame and we're on wooden benches

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.140
everyone say there's none of this

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.610
[ __ ] nonsense well they added [ __ ]

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.740
now [ __ ] everywhere every college

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.690
stadium now Sox just dog [ __ ] every what

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:39.770
do you think about this students getting

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.240
paid we talked about this before I'm for

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:41.540
it

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.460
yeah yeah i dude I was I read an article

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.290
about that the amount of money they get

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.210
in endowments well the article is that

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.100
historically black colleges should start

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.480
have like they were like if you're a

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.750
black d1 prospect go to an HBCU su

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.820
whatever yeah and whatever I figured was

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.020
called the initials but there would go

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.280
to historically black school in that way

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.270
we can start funneling all the

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.460
n-c-double-a money to those schools and

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.540
it's like well this doesn't solve the

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.710
problem yeah like we should segregate

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.200
and get [ __ ] paid yeah they were

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.720
hitting that last night debate were they

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.730
really kind of not not that they were

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.390
just hitting uh student loans and they

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.010
were like black people don't pay their

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.350
student loans [ __ ] have

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.120
well they don't who say I'm saying which

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.770
professor they don't like turn all of

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:27.020
them but yeah really elizabeth warren

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.140
was like twenty years after college

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.020
ninety percent i think white students

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.300
have paid their debts and five percent

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.830
of black students have paid their

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.510
student loan debts she was like we need

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.980
to forgive that in order to equalize oh

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.750
no we need to break this racial

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.410
stratification here over the i

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.570
meanthat's system kind of rules black

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.210
people should be like yeah go to college

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.830
you don't say you're [ __ ] debt true i

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.990
mean it's the move you're gonna have bad

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.550
credit but who cares who cares straight

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.320
cash homie shake get a degree

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.020
let your credit sink let make sure your

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.330
bay goes you know does go to school gets

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.650
all the paperwork's right it's kind of

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.800
what i

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.830
it's kind of like I've defaulted on all

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:14.630
my credit cards real hard in my twenties

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.480
knowing like oh you know my bail today

will have good paperwork stuff so that's

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.670
kind of samurais path I thought I was

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.260
gonna I thought I had that path you were

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.060
you rocked it long the idea is to say

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.430
[ __ ] them and then if this degree

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.230
translates into me getting paid

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.660
I'll pay you guys yeah yeah yeah that's

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.070
taking the powers like as soon as I get

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:35.210
money I'll just pay my student loans

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.070
until then you get zero I always

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:38.660
operated on like I'm [ __ ] all these

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.490
credit cards now and I'm going on a

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.200
glory mission either I'll die or like

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.850
I'm not gonna make it my life's purpose

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.550
to pay back a gigantic financial

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.470
institution there's more debt according

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:49.910
this article I read there's more debt

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.730
than capital in the world

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:55.610
it makes no [ __ ] sense so the so

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.650
there's people who literally control the

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.330
money supply who get to dictate the

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.130
money supply and then they hand out

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.260
quote-unquote money whoever is in charge

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.420
of everything who is whoever is in

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.880
charge I can't say if you levels of

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.040
government uh it's it's different in

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.360
every country the top levels of

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.010
government get to control the currency

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:15.050
and then once you control currency you

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:16.670
can drown people in debt and then

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.760
control them yeah I was like okay your

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.390
student loans

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:21.890
definitely don't pay now the top level

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:23.330
of government in the United States it's

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:24.980
pretty much always been like old English

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:28.940
families right like wasps yeah for sure

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.130
yeah I would say he always blames the

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.170
Jews I think there's there's some

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.030
there's a lot of dual citizenship going

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.470
on the high levels the Republican Party

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.200
nobody talks about but like what there's

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.790
a lot of people have dual citizenship to

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:43.250
Israel and they're eight hoes you are

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:44.300
blowing than the Jews I'm not blaming

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.310
the Jews it's it's a it's a pastiche

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.890
dude of all the worst [ __ ] wasps it's

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:51.650
just like a horrible course the worst of

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:53.180
every group who be good you know what

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.890
I'm saying yeah but look what happens

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.770
when a shittier group takes over though

00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:00.350
you get like a [ __ ] Italian in office

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:03.170
oh you just get a Mussolini up there it

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:06.350
never stops never stops I was I've been

because reading this book me too bro it

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.870
never [ __ ] it's like it just gets

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.360
worse there was a guy who's a guy

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.620
Robespierre Robespierre Robespierre

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.610
the first person was not the first

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:20.690
person that was one of those

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.070
people who are like nah dude we're

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.590
making this this is like this is Joseph

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.360

like 20,000 a lot of boys 20,000 but

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.510
more people died at the hands of their

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.790
government in the 2020s century than in

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.790
the first world wars combined

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:40.220
think about that isn't that [ __ ] up

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.280
yeah why yeah well that was because that

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.670
was the end of monarchies like a lot of

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.100
month not the end but like the the you

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.200
know yeah that was the the French family

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.820
power change there apparently they

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.530
stormed and correct me if I'm wrong in

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.600
France they stormed the Vatican's

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.780
property in France seized it and then

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.430
divided it and started selling it to

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:05.810
people yeah well they hated yeah cuz I'm

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:07.880
listening to that revolution spot guess

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.500
and I was listen to that I was listening

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.850
to the French Revolution but I haven't

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.500
gotten into the the meat of it it's all

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.080
leading up to it it's like dude they're

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.110
[ __ ] government was dog [ __ ] it was

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:21.530
crazy it was they had salt taxes that

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:22.880
were just like different for every

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.150
single town they had like the the elites

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.670
didn't pay [ __ ] for taxes yeah I was

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:31.070
listening I was like this is kind of

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.660
eerily similar to where we're at it's

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.190
hitting home dude and then they just

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:37.880

just it dude it's insane yeah yeah that

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.970
that to your point that was the whole

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:51.230
thing in the French Revolution like it

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.790

political stances and I don't

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:40.310
necessarily but yeah we got actually had

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.710
a phaser quick to adopt political

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:46.330
stances matriarchy started racism

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:48.830

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:51.680
agreed his he did yeah I don't know

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.180
something about him I don't like that is

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.340
how that's how racism started like BAE's

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.320
coming back and going they have huge

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:02.990

the Royals so the Prince Andrew you know

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.980

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:14.570
snapshot yeah so he's best for these

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:16.640

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.760

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.840
security news out chillin she stayed

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.040
with him after he got indicted for

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.480
raping kids and whatever but whatever

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.710
okay that's just a normal system

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:30.410
oil-based loyal BAE arguably the most

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:31.160
loyal BAE

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.500
I mean that's the definition of it to

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.510
him so yeah so that's kind of support

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.990
her now

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:40.130
dude I mean technically that's that is

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:41.870
the definition of thick and thin yeah

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:45.650
but I mean I I wonder about that in

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:47.330
terms of like a bait it's like sending

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.150
other BAE's into women prostitution or

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:51.770
to women obviously women like in a young

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:54.020
girl prostitution that's a power trip

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.290

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.710
according to Prince Andrew he got out of

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.390
the Navy he was single for a while but

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:12.980
he never partied it was single for one

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.900

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.820
the exactly what he said some parting I

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.410
wasn't much of a partier that's

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:19.910
literally how he talked and he's like

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.160
but I was single in the 80s for a long

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.929
spell of time and then he starts talking

00:25:23.929 --> 00:25:26.419
about so he was a prince you wanted to

00:25:26.419 --> 00:25:28.490

go to America to learn about business

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:33.169

00:25:33.169 --> 00:25:40.130
really is not I'm a prince and I need a

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.590

to figure out do I mean his whole thing

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.830
with Epstein is that like what he said

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:09.350
Epstein has a what Epstein did right yet

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:10.730

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:13.220
coolest people together he just had a

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.110
way this moody says he's like he had a

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.970
way of bringing like just the most

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:19.130
diverse and just like eminent people in

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:20.600
their fields together yeah what I think

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.730

00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:37.129
world no it was just people who wanted

00:26:37.129 --> 00:26:39.259
to learn about business shame don't be

00:26:39.259 --> 00:26:40.970
such a conspiracy theorist dude that

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:43.100
Prince Andrew was chilling in the castle

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.269
he's in Buckingham Palace

00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:46.789
he's like I'm done the Navy I'm working

00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:48.559

00:26:48.559 --> 00:26:51.620

Dickens novel characters I guess time I

00:26:55.789 --> 00:26:58.009

there he's friends with d'Alene Maxwell

00:26:59.299 --> 00:27:00.769

00:27:00.769 --> 00:27:03.080
Jeffrey Epstein were like good friends

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.759

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:50.600
funniest [ __ ] [ __ ] listening this guy

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.800
but that's his tail

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:56.300
oh so the other thing too is that he so

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.620
the reason so they're like well okay so

00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:00.950
say that's true and you know you're you

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:02.720
were around all this all the time how

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.970
did you not know that way there was

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:06.350
weird chick you're a prince you're not

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:13.790
answers that they were so funny he was

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:15.920
like well first of all with my station I

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.140
am part of the royal family people tend

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.580
to clean up their act a little

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.050
differently around me so when I'm around

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:22.970
it's a whole different set of behaviors

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:25.310
so it was as if he was hitting down on

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:27.620
Epstein again still in business mode and

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.030

whole thing skipping forward sorry this

00:31:11.769 --> 00:31:13.509
is annoying to the people but this is

00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:15.399
funniest [ __ ] I can't do this is the

00:31:15.399 --> 00:31:16.870
sound bites are too funny I was talking

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:20.259

00:31:20.259 --> 00:31:22.480
had to show leadership and I had to go

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.279
and see him and I had to tell him that's

00:31:24.279 --> 00:31:27.940
it that was December of 2010 he threw a

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:30.879
party to celebrate his release and you

00:31:30.879 --> 00:31:34.690

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.240
in 2010 that there wasn't certainly

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:40.600
wasn't a party to celebrate his release

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.139
in December because he was a small

00:31:44.139 --> 00:31:46.419
dinner party there were only 8 or 10 of

00:31:46.419 --> 00:31:48.820

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.790
there's another part at the end where he

he's like I must say Jeffrey's behavior

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.750
was a bit uncoming and the lady's like

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.460

to you and then he describes himself as

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.790

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:44.120

what the whole thing in the ladies quote

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:00.920

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.930
lady's quaking being like we're not

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:03.950
quaking but she's like it's just

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:06.410
certainly odd to be in Buckingham Palace

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:07.970
she's like nervous to even bring this up

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:09.560

is an evil entity hate it this is

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:32.420
disgusting bro it's the guy's narrative

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:34.010
is that he was so interested in business

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:36.500
he somehow got linked up with a known

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.630
[ __ ] section child sex trafficker

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:40.310
that's just a good bit and then the only

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:42.020
reason he didn't made aware of what was

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:43.340
going on which is he's such a prince

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:44.570

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.850
I grew up we have staff and I just

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:07.370

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:08.570
just like I saw a bunch of hot young

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:09.890

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:17.240
of the questions that the democratic

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.250
just talking to me for like a half hour

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:32.210
about the Clinton bastard it's it's

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:34.069
incredible it is wonderful

00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:36.589
I just I yeah it is it is weird like I'm

00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:38.869
like dude where's this [ __ ] going and

00:38:38.869 --> 00:38:40.579
it's like doo doo Prince Andrew the

00:38:40.579 --> 00:38:42.440
worst part is the worst part is is

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:44.630
Prince Andrew was hanging out that's my

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:45.890
thing - it's like he's a prince

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:48.500
that's what princes do whatever they

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.660
want yeah he even said he's like it's

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:52.309
not like now you have to contend with

00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:53.990
all of this electronic social media

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:55.910
stuff that was never like this yeah he's

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:57.470
a weird ass dude he has the weirdest

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:59.180
kind of like you watch his interview

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:00.680
it's like him being like I don't

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.940
remember and him being like definitely

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.770
not and him being like it's just

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:06.530
different now and it's like I mean he

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:07.970
keeps describing the behavior it's like

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:10.190
it was definitely wasn't that the way I

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:12.079
behaved was not becoming for the royal

00:39:12.079 --> 00:39:13.819
fan it's like are you saying you [ __ ]

00:39:13.819 --> 00:39:16.630
kids and it was rude like which one is

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:20.540
like elbows on the table [ __ ] kid is

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:23.210
this yeah I wonder I mean imagine that

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:24.859
like if you had all the power in the

00:39:24.859 --> 00:39:28.819
world and no laws so no matter what you

00:39:28.819 --> 00:39:32.990
did you were right yeah uh yeah I bet

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:34.700
royal families have been doing some wild

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.410
[ __ ] for a very long time I think it's

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:38.359
all true I think citizens come up with

00:39:38.359 --> 00:39:40.280
wild crazy [ __ ]

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.620
the Royals and the elites do weird crazy

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:45.500
[ __ ] calm pretty constantly and it's

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:47.030
it's I think it's all it's literally all

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:49.670
true yeah that people are conspiracy mom

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:50.870
again like this this [ __ ] that's the

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:52.400
other thing being like what do you mean

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.410
what's all true do you think Bill

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:56.330
Clinton performs satanic rituals off the

00:39:56.330 --> 00:39:58.580
coast of New England no I think there's

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.020
a blur well he might hit me with that

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:02.320
today

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:06.980
like in Cape Cod yeah yeah performing

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:08.630
rituals I just dislike the term

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:10.790
conspiracy because it's like to be like

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:13.190
this guy probably [ __ ] young kids like

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:14.510
your conspiracy theorists but it's like

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:16.100
there's a picture of him with his arm

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.380
around a 17 year old girl in Joe's Lane

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:19.610
Maxwell's house Oh a bunch of other

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:21.290
girls are saying sex trafficked them and

00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:23.530
she's a longtime boyfriend of a guy who

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:27.940
suspiciously died in prison so it's like

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:30.740
they get a hold that label off but then

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:33.050
I will read stuff too about like like

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:35.360
The Naturalist calm and it's like just

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:37.130
the wildest [ __ ] [ __ ] about the

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:39.200
Clintons where I'm like wait how is this

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.330
[ __ ] corroborated yeah so I think

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:42.830
it's true like there is definitely a

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:44.000
bunch of people in charge who have done

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.740
horrible horrific things who probably

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.330
don't want that getting out and then

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:48.860
there's this political machine who

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.260
continuously propagandize ha's into that

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:53.720
same vein that just kind of makes it it

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:54.950
is again I've talked about this [ __ ]

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:57.710
before with the hyper normal whatever

00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:59.090
hyper or whatever it's called

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:01.310
normalization hyper normalization from

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:03.530
that documentary it's just you just

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:05.900
inject reality with so much crazy [ __ ]

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:07.070
that no one knows what's going on

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:09.680
anymore but yeah so I don't know I I I

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.110
think Prince Andrew is it guilty yes I

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.600
do I really watch that I'm like cuz

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.720
again read his real story it's like this

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.250
prince was interested in business was

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:21.020
conveniently staying with a [ __ ]

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:24.320
pedophile and then went flew over to a

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.940
guys who wasn't his friend he said he's

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:28.010
that's a stretch to call my friend flew

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:31.100
over it be like okay background we're

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:33.140
done be friends don't be a friends big

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:35.690
wink yeah and then stayed at his house

00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:37.280
for three that's crazy just kind of I

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.540
don't know why they didn't just find a

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.240
different you know pedophile sex ring

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.390
because once you engage in one they have

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:46.610
the dirt on you you're [ __ ] you have

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:49.370
to do what they say unless your mommy

00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:51.950
goes and [ __ ] [ __ ] kills and I

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:53.270
think the Queen did it

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:54.770
I don't know dude I don't know who did

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:57.620
it could have been anyone that guy had a

00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.990
ton of powerful people connected to a

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:03.170

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:23.520
now conspiracy theorists like each

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.500
stripe represents a woman's face like

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:26.880
you know I mean sure no absolutely all

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:28.800
read in dollars this kind of I'm talking

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.030
about there's two waterfalls there's a

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:31.980
grab bag of horrible events from history

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:34.530
and then there's you know conspiratorial

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:36.180
thinking that behooves separate

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:37.560
political parties and they just merge

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.360
into a [ __ ] stream that's totally

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.010
undeciphered yeah so it's like yes

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:42.030
there's horrible stuff that happening

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:43.650
yes but people in charge do horrible

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:44.910
stuff but then there's these political

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:47.100
machines that just completely cloud that

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:48.870
and everything comes out it's just you

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:50.850
don't know what the [ __ ] going on but

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:53.880
yeah I agree yeah to be like seven seven

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.580
sickles on the thing and yeah also I

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:58.260
just watched the Twin Peaks for our

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.270
explanation that all that is is just

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:02.370
like this thing is that and they

00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:04.440
symbolize dude it's so [ __ ] good

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.930
really explains to in Pete you love Twin

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:07.200
Peaks

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.870
I love 20 years and now your enthusiasm

00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:11.340
for it makes me want to give it a shot

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:13.770
it's good man but the explanation kid

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:16.380
over the dialog I love it it's just it's

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.000
just a balance see and I could explain

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.200
I'm not gonna go on another tirade

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.610
because I feel like I'm tired yeah we've

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:22.590
had this conversation well I watch the

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:25.220
explanation now I know it's about about

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:29.820
dude it's too meta you you might explode

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:31.200
let me hear but you haven't seen it so

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.720
it's hard to explain matter so Jesus

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:36.000
Christ a weird listeners have they have

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.830
if there's a four-hour explanation I'm

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:40.220
almost done but basically in a nutshell

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:43.740
Twin Peaks was supposed to bring balance

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:46.710
to television at the time at the time

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:48.270
television people were addicted to a

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:50.040
drug called closure so you'd watch

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.020
wanted like the murder mysteries someone

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:54.060
get murdered no one really grieved them

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:55.710
really there was no real human element

00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:56.730
to it so I'm gonna get murdered they'd

00:47:56.730 --> 00:47:58.830
be zipped up in a body bag I'd find the

00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:00.270
killer who was totally one-dimensional

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:01.620
solved on to the next one all these

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:03.000
people get discarded and you know

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.280
whatever David Lynch was like he wanted

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:06.780
to do a murder mystery that never got

00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:08.760
solved that it was like you know you

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:10.440
there was like the there was a guy in it

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:13.590
Bob who was supposed to be TV violence

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:15.750
who would possess characters and doing

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:17.550
horrible heinous stuff and then people

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:18.840
were is like a real town when they were

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.400
left like people cry for like three

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:26.790
minutes in the show crazy but the and

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:28.380
then he was inhabiting Bob was his

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:29.910
character was inhabiting characters and

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:32.550
he was the spirit of violence on TV so

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:33.970
he and then there was the girl

00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:36.040
beginning Laura Palmer yes mister he was

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.690
never supposed to go solved I'd never

00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:38.890
get supposed to get solved he was gonna

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:41.650
have all these streams or these stories

00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:43.150
was this branch off of this thing that

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:45.190
happened and balance this horrible

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:47.140
violence with all these good like

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:49.810
drinking coffee apple pie and then all

00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:51.609
the bad people were eating cream corn

00:48:51.609 --> 00:48:52.960
and like corn snacks all the time

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.510
because of the invention of after the

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:58.000
nuclear blast I think it was 56 or so I

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.640
forget no 40s I think the bus happened

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.160
Elvis I think went on TV and 56 and that

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.260
was like the I think 56 was all the

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:07.450
invention of the TV dinner and the side

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:08.619
was usually creamed corn

00:49:08.619 --> 00:49:10.450
yeah so a lot of times whether these

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:12.040
these people are eating all the time was

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.570
creamed corn so there was coffee and pie

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:16.690
and coffee fuels for you to get in touch

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:18.700
her like the Unified Field it's it's he

00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.890
goes really this he's the transcendental

00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:23.170
meditator so the Unified Field if you've

00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:25.890
watched a third season there's this like

00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:30.040
dude I can't do that it's it's I have to

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:31.570
see all three of them but the third

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:33.849
season there's a place where all either

00:49:33.849 --> 00:49:35.380
way for the first season sorry this is

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:36.670
such a scramble you can do it

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:38.770
they forces doing it they forced him in

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:40.060
a second the first season was a hit

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:41.349
everyone loved it it was like there's so

00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:42.609
much mystery around and all this cool

00:49:42.609 --> 00:49:44.440
stuffs happening he was pushing in all

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.940
these other kind of concepts and ideas

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.070
and people would research and then the

00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:49.690
second season they're like you have to

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:51.460
announce who the killer is and Lynch was

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:53.200
like [ __ ] that the whole point of the

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:54.790
show is never announce to the killers

00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:56.619
yeah the whole thing was they were in a

00:49:56.619 --> 00:49:58.060
TV show and there was characters who

00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:59.650
were semi aware of the fact they were in

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:03.430
a TV show it was weird but the so he

00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:04.900
walked from the show and then they

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:06.700
closed it up and everything they're so

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:08.020
[ __ ] sucks they like they earlier

00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:09.640
that blows is you know his tank cuz he

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.230
just walked away from it so the the

00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:13.240
third seasons on Showtime so he did a

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:15.609
remake in where the show is dead and

00:50:15.609 --> 00:50:17.260
then like there's characters just

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:18.609
walking around doing like kind of

00:50:18.609 --> 00:50:19.900
nothing they have no idea what's going

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.700
on cuz Laura the mystery was what held

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.349
the whole thing together either way but

00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:25.180
he's Unified Field is like where you

00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:26.859
kind of your consciousness reaches to

00:50:26.859 --> 00:50:28.150
when you met if you're experienced

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.869
enough meditator

00:50:28.869 --> 00:50:30.849
you can reach the Unified Field where

00:50:30.849 --> 00:50:32.320
you're just at total peace of everything

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:34.540
and that's where he said good ideas like

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:36.849
Laura Palmer come from so in the field

00:50:36.849 --> 00:50:38.650
it's like you see this egg popping out

00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:40.750
of this like weird ocean thing and then

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:42.190
there's like these the whole thing with

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:43.210
electricity where there's these like

00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:46.000
power line sizzling to where like kind

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.860
of like all the bad ideas from the

00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:49.390
nuclear blast there was just like

00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:51.310
zeitgeist a fear that inhabited all

00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:53.410
these people that was then broadcasted

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:55.300
through electricity in Epler rock acid

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:56.560
through television it's too much to

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:57.940
explain it's four hours where this guy

00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:00.670
goes through line by line oh man it's so

00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:01.390

00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:04.840
they're they're the lifeblood of Comcast

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.970
the geezers are the lifeblood for a lot

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:08.590
of those things they're gonna they're

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:09.760

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:12.490
streaming and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:14.350
dude I I the Twin Peaks thing I'd have

00:52:14.350 --> 00:52:15.820
to talk about for like three hours it's

00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:20.590
so [ __ ] sick I'll watch it now I

00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:24.010
won't keep trying to watch it it's good

00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:25.360
it's it's you know it's kind of I can

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:26.890
see though how it would have not appeal

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:30.040
it's like super and again this is just a

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.270
guy's interpretation of it but it's like

00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:33.940
beyond all meta everything it's

00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:35.710
unbelievable Dan

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:37.750
it's his that he's a filmmaker his whole

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:39.790
thing is that like film is where that

00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:41.380
you can have like a real dream and

00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:42.700
things come from and it's balanced he's

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:44.830
like TVs not balanced and TVs what with

00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:46.900
TVs replacing film so people are

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:50.140
becoming unbalanced and I mean I think

00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:52.450
he's kind of right but yeah either way

00:52:52.450 --> 00:52:53.800
so what else is going sorry that's my

00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:56.500
[ __ ] no tirade about ass Chris Andrew

00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:58.360
Twin Peaks which is my personal thing

00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:00.730
that's my personal little all I had was

00:53:00.730 --> 00:53:01.270
the [ __ ]

00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:03.880
I fell was just thinking about that

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.920
[ __ ] game [ __ ] that was so funny uh

are spreading their asses in the air and

00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:05.860

00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:07.720
while they're hanging on so everyone can

00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:10.470

it all culminates in you getting a

00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:12.460
hooker the Dominican Republic like I

00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:19.630

00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:21.310
you once of you are getting a hooker the

00:56:21.310 --> 00:56:25.710
Dominican Republic and Akash [ __ ] I

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:29.050
would I actually had it I thought of a

00:56:29.050 --> 00:56:31.270
show recently that made me think of I

00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:33.370
want to do a show I don't know I wonder

00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:34.750
if anyone's ever done this probably have

00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:36.910
where it's almost like a black mirror

00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:38.650
set up where it's set up like a normal

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:40.720
pilot so it took about you know say it's

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:42.040
a guy on a vacation just getting all the

00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:43.480
senses simulated and gets in a horrible

00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:45.640
situation over there died said either

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:48.100
the end of the first season or dies at

00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:50.560
the end of the first episode there's

00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:51.940
gonna be about and then it picks up with

00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:53.350
someone who we briefly interacted with

00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:55.390
so at the end so that maybe that guy

00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:56.830
story goes on two or three episodes and

00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:58.930
he dies and you never you're watching a

00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:00.370
story of someone who's literally about

00:57:00.370 --> 00:57:01.990
think that's guy gets final destination

00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:03.880
kind of is like that but it would be an

00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:05.170
ongoing story yeah but they know they're

00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:06.640
gonna die they know they're know does

00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:07.540
say something about a story about a

00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:08.650
person here and then he wasn't just

00:57:08.650 --> 00:57:10.840
going to a casino sitting there you

00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:12.430
would yeah you'd watch the first three

00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:14.650
episodes and that person dies this about

00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:15.850
then you just pick up with someone he

00:57:15.850 --> 00:57:17.290
interacted with all right and then that

00:57:17.290 --> 00:57:19.180
person dies and by the end I doing a

00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:20.350
whole pile it would be cool or a whole

00:57:20.350 --> 00:57:21.640
season because then you end the season

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:22.870
this guy dies it what the [ __ ] in next

00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:24.160
season about it's got another person

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:26.890
you're like just not gonna die and then

00:57:26.890 --> 00:57:28.150
you and then slowly it's like four

00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:29.119
episodes in that guy

00:57:29.119 --> 00:57:30.529
like what the [ __ ] and then finally

00:57:30.529 --> 00:57:32.059
you'd catch on being like I'm watching

00:57:32.059 --> 00:57:33.440
the dude is about to die and you don't

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:35.269
know how it's gonna happen yeah could go

00:57:35.269 --> 00:57:36.680
on for like six up so you never know

00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:37.400
when it's coming

00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:39.950
it'd be pretty tight I like it I think

00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:40.970
it'd be pretty fun how are they dying

00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:43.460
just freak acts all kinds of wild ways

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:45.319
so you would it would be like people in

00:57:45.319 --> 00:57:46.849
different countries someone they'd

00:57:46.849 --> 00:57:48.079
interact it was like a tourist and I

00:57:48.079 --> 00:57:49.309

there all right weird like there is

00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:53.029
someone in there it would just be

00:57:53.029 --> 00:57:54.829
[ __ ] I don't know I think it'd be

00:57:54.829 --> 00:57:57.470

you're telling me you're channeling just

00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:35.539
I would say what would constitute as

00:59:35.539 --> 00:59:38.690
immense life pain yes and then making

00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:40.730
people laugh with that yes you're a [ __ ]

00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:42.280
and then there's

00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:44.200
route if there's a lady in front that's

00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:48.280

that's been all so shame on someone for

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.420
going too far hidden the comedy show me

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:09.220
like this is the worst thing yeah like

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:10.720
you see where I'm standing

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:13.600
yeah like this is a joke yeah this is

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:16.450
not real like I'm obviously this is the

01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:18.640
reason I'm saying it is because of you

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:19.900
what percent what percentage would you

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:21.640
say I mean I could kind of say no it's

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.620
low it's very spoiled sports it's very

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:26.020
low it is low especially when you walk

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:27.190
out and say something [ __ ] up

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:28.920
immediately

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:31.480
that's like clear what you're trying it

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:32.830
you're trying to [ __ ] bother people

01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:34.720
but they don't get bothered hilarious

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.730
yeah and most people are enjoying this

01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:38.920
immensely yeah and it helps so much if

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:40.780
somebody visibly especially if they're

be a fictionalized character no he's

01:08:45.190 --> 01:08:46.720
real he's a real person John Smith's

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:49.290
real he was like a [ __ ] mercenary who

01:08:49.290 --> 01:08:51.400
wasn't it in fashion to like completely

01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:53.110
lie about your autobiography or

01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:54.460
something back oh yeah and John Smith

01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:57.820
