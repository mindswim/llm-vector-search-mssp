tea with me podcast with me she and Todd

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.540
it's the weddings day episode it's a

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.610
guest episode I'm gonna fly solo this

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.370

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.530
do the TripAdvisor review listeners

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.630
questions all that kind of stuff but

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.400
I've got a guest that's way very very

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.609
excited about this one I was in New York

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.660
in God when was that like February kind

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.210
of time I think it was fair URI and I

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.519
got to perform at the stand comedy club

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.890
which is just one of the best comedy

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.160
clubs anywhere in the world really I had

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.739
a brilliant brilliant time I spent a lot

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.180
of time just actually watching a lot of

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.430
stand-up I performed it some shoes but I

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.870
was just sort of soaking in the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.969
atmosphere of the place and really

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.670
headed off with a lot of the comedian's

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.770
there and on the owner Chris Chris

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.469
Italia so when I was there I saw a

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.230
comedian called Sheehan Gilles and the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.510
name definitely wrong a bell Sheehan is

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.750
a stand-up who there's no beast in New

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.660
York and as we sort of get into at the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.420
time and during the interview that

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.270
you're gonna see he was he made it on

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.729
the Saturday Night Live he was like a

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.990
became a cast member on Saturday Night

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.900
Live which is I don't know how long it's

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.909
been running for like at least 30 years

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.259
probably probably a good bit more

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.820
actually a probably way off I'm not in

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.040
fact that's it's why he like 50 years I

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.350
don't know but anyway so many people

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.180
have come through it Eddie Murphy Will

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.700
Farrell Adam Sandler you could last

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.630
about 50 people she in who I think is

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.090
like younger than me became a cast

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.979
member he successfully got onto the show

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.200
he was on the show for four days and

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.259
then thanks to like me like a media

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.390
trial almost he got sacked

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.090
so he never actually made it onto an

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.890
episode of the show and this at the time

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.770
was massive news so I I did this time

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.840
after this had happened like a good but

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.100
after was she in the lineup was

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.719
unbelievable whenever I was out there

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.680
you know you had mark Normand Joel s Dan

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.679
Soder they these are a huge name

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.350
American stand-ups

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.850
of course you know the money toward

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.920
himself was was on the bill as well you

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.320
know so full of have you it was full of

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.880
heavyweights basically you know the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.950
audience busy came to see us guys I mean

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.660
mainly them I don't want to say merely

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.400
them I mean all them but I was lucky

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.190
that I got to do spot anyway Sheehan

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.150
said like really stood out to me and by

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.380
the way that's not me talking in third

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.480
person she and Gilles who's on this

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.500
episode of the podcast um I just I think

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.380
I was sitting with like my hands under

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.950
my chin

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.630
you know like together and then I may

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.360
have just been lying on my front on a

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.160
table sort of kicking my heels behind me

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.830
going this is great really really

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.470
enjoyed a set and briefly chatted to him

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.660
I think we fold each other on Twitter

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.490
after that and then I sent him a message

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.140
asking him if he would do the podcast

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.170
which he very kindly agreed to do so we

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.440
chat just a lot about a lot about stand

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.680
up a little bit about the SNL thing but

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.600
that's not why I wanted him to

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.400
in fact I'd asked him to do the podcast

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.130
before I linked him with being that guy

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.850
from that news story you know but we did

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.380
talk about that a little bit but we

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.760
talked we talked about stand-up and

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.440
loads of other stuff for you just a real

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.500
easy easy guy to chat to just a very

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.000
like naturally funny guy and I really

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.430
really enjoyed talking to him and we we

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.130
did speak a bit about him too you know I

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.510
asked him if he'd done stand-up outside

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.860
of the States and I think he just don't

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.620
Canada so I told him he should come over

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.280
here and do some shows and you'll see

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.200
that he just has a very like he has a

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.760
way about him that I think he would do

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.000
really well stand and stand up here but

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.270
but yeah I've delayed too long let's

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.670
just get into it and we've got the

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.930
Friday episode coming up which would

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.760
just be me by myself and then every

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.980
Monday obviously we do the patreon which

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.530
is patreon.com slash tea with me podcast

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.750
we do the bonus episode where you get a

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.760
ya weekly episode me and producer Dan

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.370
and some other stuff as well so without

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.049
further ado this is the tea with me

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.410
podcast episode with Shane Gillis my

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.330
first question for every guest I have on

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.520
the podcast is do you drink tea hmm

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.169
now I guess yeah I've had it yeah I

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.090
guess we have different definitions of

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.160
TV because you know the American

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.169
American tea and then there's obviously

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.780
the the British and Irish tea so have

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.030
you ever gone like fool

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.250
Irish tea or like English breakfast tea

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.630
I don't think so no I don't think I have

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.759
is that an experience you think you'd be

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.199
open to are you just totally shutting

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.780
off from it like no chance not

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.610
definitely I would yeah

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.210
I have no bias against it I think I

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.800
think it just has to be the right

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.270
environment you know I mean like it's

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.120
it's very it's it's very it's very

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.800
sensitive environmentally you know I

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.060
think if you were if you were in this

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.530
part of the world I think you could

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.330
really enjoy it I think America's

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.000
probably too quick for an edge it was

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.780
just I'm not I don't do [ __ ] so I

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.360
definitely have time to [ __ ] sit

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.620
there and drink tea and feel like I'm

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.740
doing something oh yeah yeah I just have

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.169
a major problem any time I'm in America

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:29.970
just trying to just trying to get tea

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.139
because there's so many variations

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.990
whereas we just have like your your your

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.130
warranty you can I share a first name as

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.900
well as well unless we share a first

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.849
name would that buy me anything with you

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:43.530
like say we'd never met each other on

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.409
like I ran into you and I was like these

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.810
guys are kissing me I'm also colchean

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.370
would you be more inclined to help me

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.370
out or I'm not gotta be honest that

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.409
would probably make me join the guys

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:58.680
chasing it yeah this guy's a [ __ ]

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.710
idiot well let's fight him I mean you're

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.000
probably gonna have more loyalty with a

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.530
surname I don't know if a first name

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.710
really like really buy Jenny yeah yeah

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.409
yeah for sure I used to do a.m. I think

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:12.300
she is a far more common name in the

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.430
states but it's not a wouldn't say it's

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.900
uncommon here but it's not that common

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.680
and it's not very common it's I think I

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.780
was named after a [ __ ] cowboy movie I

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.020
don't know about you Suze I yeah yeah

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.590
I'm like and I remember my dad telling

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.169
me about this crabber films named after

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:33.810
her coolest character was and he's like

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.789
we got we gotta watch it sometimes I

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:37.949
watch like two minutes over a sec no

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:40.439
this looks oh [ __ ] sucks

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:43.689
it's black and white it's so bad yeah

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:46.210
this it's it's not it's not great

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.699
I guess they if they remake it like yes

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:50.229
I would definitely be up for it but in

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:52.180
its in its current format like I know it

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.680
would mean a lot to my dad but I just

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.650
[ __ ] can if it was a short possibly

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.139
but feature-length black-and-white it's

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:00.189
a it's not gonna happen

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:02.710
it is weird to be named after that film

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.960
and I've met other shiiin's heroes who

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.969
named after it why were why were our

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:09.610
parents so like so buzzing about it to

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.000
the point where a good dumb thing I

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.349
don't think my parents were gonna have

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:15.759
kids but when they saw that they were

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:17.529
like we need that we need to do this

00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:20.139
just we can we can give somebody this

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:23.199
name I used to do it every day I still

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:26.469
do renew show on BBC and we had this

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:27.969
feature where I would interview other

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:30.490
chien towards around the world and to

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:31.930
just like email them and ask when they

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.939
come on the show and I thought like

00:07:33.939 --> 00:07:36.210
seriously we're gonna have like such a

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.710
such a connection because we share this

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.169
name we may be interviewed like 12 guys

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.090
why would you ever why would you ever

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.900
expect it I just think thinking I just

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.919
think there's you know because it's a

00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:52.659
slightly unusual name like it's not -

00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:54.849
very very common first or surnames I

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:57.759
just think like if I met you know even

00:07:57.759 --> 00:07:59.139
when I when I went to one of the sound

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:01.479
good there's not that many comedians

00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:03.129
where I'm from Northern Ireland there's

to being weird but it's gonna kind of

00:11:49.199 --> 00:11:51.480

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.220
jerking off like I gotta hide it again

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.899
although this is a disaster this is a

00:11:57.899 --> 00:12:01.470
disaster so my mom this is breaking news

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.889
this happened last night I had a wank

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:08.490
and my mom keeps there's a box of

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:09.660
tissues in the room that I've been

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:13.920
staying in and I finished the tissues so

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.899
now there's an empty box of tissues next

00:12:15.899 --> 00:12:17.639
to the bed and my mom's definitely gonna

00:12:17.639 --> 00:12:20.009
find that yeah I mean I think you're

00:12:20.009 --> 00:12:21.600
just gonna have to you know quickly

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.699
pretend that you're just emotional maybe

00:12:23.699 --> 00:12:27.240
emotional like covert in general I mean

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.649
I like to think that when you had you

00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:30.839
had your first wine key back in your

00:12:30.839 --> 00:12:32.279
parents house Charles Barkley appeared

00:12:32.279 --> 00:12:36.420
just yeah yeah everybody was I mean it

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.579
was big yank him back at the parents is

00:12:38.579 --> 00:12:40.379
nice but other than that no it's like

00:12:40.379 --> 00:12:41.939
it's like being a kid I'm down in the

00:12:41.939 --> 00:12:43.829
basement like [ __ ] playing video

00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:46.259
games and [ __ ] oh it's it's weird

00:12:46.259 --> 00:12:48.509
III find it where do you guys have

00:12:48.509 --> 00:12:50.040
basements like that's very much an

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.019
American thing like I just think of from

00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:54.959
films I stayed not the last time I was

00:12:54.959 --> 00:12:56.220
in New York when I kicked up the sound

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.470
at the time before and I stayed at my

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.499
wife's cousin toys in their basement and

00:13:01.499 --> 00:13:03.179
they you don't need to know this but

00:13:03.179 --> 00:13:06.299
they went to Columbia on to wedding and

00:13:06.299 --> 00:13:08.220
they left her dog there well they said

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.360
they were like can you can you look

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.759
after mr. Pepe I thought miss Pepe was

00:13:11.759 --> 00:13:13.380
like a guy like a relative

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.990
and because they were like he does it

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.000
were like he's he's like he's very old

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.530
and he doesn't need really any attempt

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.300
you just leave him water so I thought

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.910
maybe like an uncle or whatever and what

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.880
they didn't tell me is mr. Pepe and hot

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.330
oils in the night and like he is like a

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.570
problem with this throat and there mr.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.270
Pepe used to signed like a like like a

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:38.760
ghost child like he would I don't know

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.680
that this is why I like out one time

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.600

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:47.310

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:48.750
is upstairs you don't know if it's a guy

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:54.810

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.760
mr. r.i.p mr. Pepys and he sadly no

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.970
longer that's funny about it's funny

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:06.450
about dog names sorry sorry yeah it's

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:07.920
funny about dog names that when they

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.870
have like a funny name like that no

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.390
matter how they die it's funny like ah

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.090
mr. Pepe had you know you had esophagus

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.010
cancer

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.140
it just it undermines it undermines it

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:24.600
totally yeah and so yeah you and I we we

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.630
did a gig at the at the stand and I've

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.070
been over to New York couple of times

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.910
for for stand-up but I've kind of

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.950
punster on different open mics and stuff

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.270
like that and this is the first time

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.430
where I probably went to your club and

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.560
just stayed there for all the shoes like

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.810
I did a couple of again I just sat and

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:44.940
watched and kind of chatted there if you

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.160
comedians and that's the first time

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.280
where I think like I got a bit a bit

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.410
more of a feeling for this a night

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:53.940
they're like [ __ ] like that

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.860
I couldn't believe the lineups because I

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.840
listened to a lot of podcasts in New

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.330
York and LA and all not line up you know

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.220
you hear so many I think the lineup that

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.820
I was like you Norman down sodor duelist

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:10.020
like just you I can't fathom that like

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.880
you know you guys are all headliners

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.740
you're gonna do clubs for a weekend or

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.690
whatever and you're all on the same bill

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:16.980
like the way it works it like we have

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.420
such a small scene here we're like

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:21.330
you've got like one headliner that's it

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.450
yeah and it's more about solo shows but

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.580
and the fact that you guys can get every

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.180
night of the way

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:30.360
as well like well multiple times like

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.500
you're doing well here like we have a

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.330
good scene here but it's very new so

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.340
like you're doing well the gig like four

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.890
times a week and there's no weekend

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:40.200
clubs which is which is crazy but have

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.880
you always been based in New York or did

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.590
you move there from somewhere else no I

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:46.620
moved I moved to New York it'll be two

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.260
years this summer so a year and a half

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.990
and then I really didn't get passed at

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:54.660
all the clubs until like the last like

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.480
year so first I was kind of bouncing

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.470
around because I was from Philadelphia

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.230
at first so that's where I started doing

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:01.680
stand-up

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.620
but yeah back to the the headliners all

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.780
on one bill at that like that helps a

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.420
lot because I I started you know before

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.710
I started I was listening to all their

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:13.110
podcasts so it's funny to be like a fan

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.750
I'm a fan of all those guys and then and

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.580
then you know it definitely keeps you on

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.830
it like when you have to follow any of

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:20.970
them it's like all right I better not

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:25.380
[ __ ] suck tonight yeah I think after

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.620
mark Normand and I mean it's just fun

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.900
you know I went I went alone where zero

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.180
expectation you know I know and it was

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.700
lovely like the stand and and Chris who

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.700
runs it like I when I get I get chatting

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.970
to Chris Italia I didn't know Chris like

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.770
was the guy who runs it and I don't

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.350
think of everything I've ever struck up

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:49.230
a friendship as quick with someone just

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:52.140
for no you know we got talking about

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.420
music and he's just the nicest guy like

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.930
you know I I would sort of like a couple

00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:59.520
times a year I'll go over to America to

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.830
different parts and do like very small

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:03.900
solo shows to just Irish people that

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.390
live they live over there and but when

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:08.700
but when I made like promoters and stuff

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.110
I guess they're runnin like four or five

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:13.260
shows a night the you get like

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.300
formalities that's kind of it but Chris

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.970
like I just chatted the Chris like all

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.550
night like what a guy and this time like

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:23.610
a proper authentic club like even the

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:26.339
brickwork behind behind the stage yeah

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:30.720
oh I love I love the stand the stands

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.730
that was the one thing like for real

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:35.490
during kovat I'm like man I hope I was

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.020
just praying that [ __ ] thing survived

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.700
because I that's that's my favorite Club

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.130
I love that Club yeah just just hang a

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.920
noodle all night go was great and and I

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.070
think I got like more of a flavor of the

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:50.190
style there if that makes sense like I

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.830
think the other place in America being

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.080
for stand-up so many of the acts that I

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.660
saw we're kind of knocking McKee but

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.510
everyone was like more of an exaggerated

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.860
version of themselves like everyone

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.810
worse in New York it just felt like the

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:05.250
material was more important than

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.590
anything else you know so the delivery a

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.510
lot more like low-key you know like

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.790
where where were you where was the other

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:14.250
place la the other place I've been to LA

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.460
a couple of times like LA yeah yeah

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.810
which I mean don't get me wrong like

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:20.850
lineups as well oh my gosh

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:25.010
Comedy Store but but it just felt like

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:28.350
it just felt like in New York it was

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:30.840
just more more about the sound I'll

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.820
blast maybe my profile as well and some

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.030
like even though the big and you you can

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:37.590
tell that no one was good just because

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:39.000
maybe they have certain credits it was

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
just just just Keller's on I did ston

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.460
the panel a for the first time long as

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.700
you doing Raven know this so I so the

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.410
way I work is like put it on on social

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:51.480
media and say like does anyone know when

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.040
they won't he like owns a bar in Philly

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.230
and I can put on like a small show for

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.680
like 30 40 people I got over and the guy

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.570
was like listen we're gonna have to do

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.790
it on Sunday afternoon instead of Sunday

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:05.160
night because there was like a hookin so

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.700
I had to do like 2 o'clock on a Sunday I

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.080
know warm up act like that that was on

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.270
me I was like I'll go without a warm-up

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.430
back but on a Sunday afternoon man I was

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:18.390
it was thinking it was fun well I was

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:19.980
like this is this is gonna be good and

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.890
you know it wasn't but it was nice cuz

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:25.140
like em what was the bar do you remember

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:28.560
it was called sooner sooner

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.220
yeah SOA na it was in like a really nice

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.200
part of town like not really don't owned

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.880
somewhere slightly more outside but

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.680
it was good added filly Chicago and

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.530
Boston and there yeah really nice did

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.000
the Laugh Factory in Chicago which was

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.030
awesome I all I wanted in the Laugh

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:48.320
Factory was someone to get a good enough

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.180
photo so I can use it as like my water

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.340
watch outside outside the states like

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.050
you ever been over darling blue Britain

00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:00.020
no no I've only performed in Canada

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.150
outside of the United States that's it

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:04.700
is that something you like to do oh yeah

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.190
yeah yeah I it turns out like

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:11.270
Australians and the UK and yeah they

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:14.660
love like podcasts and stuff and yeah me

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.760
and my friend Matt have a good podcast

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.770
that yeah those guys like so yeah we'll

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:21.170
probably hopefully when this you know

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:23.840
clears up and you know we can we can go

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.400
on tour over there in like Australia or

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.150
obviously Ireland okay you could do like

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:33.260
I mean where I live it was mainly just

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:34.760
British comedians and you would get the

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.920
odd American comedian but but with the

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.110
success of podcast now I like you know

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.990
you guys could do Belfast Dublin maybe

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.150
Galway somewhere like a like do you have

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.490
our do you have an Irish background I do

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.800
yeah what do you know where like if you

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.890
ever like ah my mom's Kilkenny

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:54.830
and my day that's actually like her

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:58.910
[ __ ] made a name and then Gilles my

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:01.130
think my dad's Scots are I don't know I

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:03.650
think he's like Scottish and Irish so

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:05.870
Kilkenny hablar festival that's great

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:07.820
like a comedy yeah yeah yeah it's really

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.550
good so like yeah yeah I think I think

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:12.050
you will go down very well here like

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:14.360
just in terms of style like we're we're

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.540
probably although it's like null point

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.800
none or 1 percent the size of New York

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.240
the same is probably hear more about

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.520
more about material as well less about

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.520
luck the show we kind of show we kind of

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.310
side of it and yeah New York is just

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:34.030
being able to go up so many times like

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.350
the idea like it's so it's difficult

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:38.660
here like have a bit of material it

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.340
might be like a week before you can go

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.720
and do that better material and then you

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.240
got a winner to go again so I guess

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.520
going up multiple times a night do you

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.260
do you ever take one bit of material

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.590
this is what I would love to do

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:53.230
material on like a Thursday night or

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.419
whatever and do like four or five shows

00:21:55.419 --> 00:21:57.279
and just keep working on not better

00:21:57.279 --> 00:21:59.559
material yeah yeah don't do that as you

00:21:59.559 --> 00:22:02.730
go I'll do that for months at a time

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:05.380
just every night kind of doing the same

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.270
same stuff and just figuring out the

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.669
best way to do it yeah for sure yeah I

00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:12.760
mean that that sometimes I can it here

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.100
gets talking a little bit of a rod of

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.840
yeah like a new are every year because

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.250
you can have to if you want to if you

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.710
want to tour in Ireland I am so you

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:23.049
don't really get there you spend maybe

00:22:23.049 --> 00:22:24.340
like two months working on new material

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.470
and then you get it and you know going

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:28.750
turret so you're not actually spending

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.250
the whole year working on new bits the

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.500
thought makes sense no I understand I I

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.090
really should probably be writing some

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:36.309
new [ __ ] well what do you what happens

00:22:36.309 --> 00:22:38.529
what happens is it like you said there's

00:22:38.529 --> 00:22:40.510
those lineups of all those guys that are

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:43.840
[ __ ] killers so I every night one of

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.760
them will kill right before I go on and

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.890
it's like a [ __ ] I'm not gonna I got a

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.500
kill yeah do the same [ __ ] ten

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.080
minutes I do every night yeah yeah yeah

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:58.029
I mean it's what was amazing right yeah

00:22:58.029 --> 00:23:00.730
well I have two starter this all covered

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:03.190
thing and I'm on the lockdown I thought

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:04.659
this gonna be great like I'm gonna write

00:23:04.659 --> 00:23:07.570
ten minutes of material a day you know

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:09.429
I'll do like two hours writing it I'll

00:23:09.429 --> 00:23:10.659
have something to come out of it and

00:23:10.659 --> 00:23:12.850
then up until pretty much it this week

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:15.279
like the last thing I wanted to do is

00:23:15.279 --> 00:23:16.960
write stand-up and I I'm not even in

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.149
like a dime to put the whole thing I'm

00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:21.730
just kinda because there's no there's no

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:23.649
one set like there's no automatic or I

00:23:23.649 --> 00:23:25.510
can go and pass this material tomorrow

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:26.080
yeah

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.909
it's difficult because what's that

00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:30.370
what's the motivation then to to just

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.909
write no I just I just booked a show in

00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:37.899
two weeks I'll be in st. Louis and at a

00:23:37.899 --> 00:23:39.460
club and I have it you know I haven't

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.990
headlining and I haven't done stand-up

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:45.820
in since March so uh yeah I should write

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:49.570
that surprised me because from I don't

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:52.270
watch a lot of news but like it seems

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:54.399
that you guys are probably like started

00:23:54.399 --> 00:23:56.890
the isolate like slightly after us so I

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:58.480
would've thought like your clubs would

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.159
be coming back like way later like

00:24:00.159 --> 00:24:01.840
there's no there's no even talk of our

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.669
entertainment venues really open them

00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:04.540
but I guess in America

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.060
there's way more of a [ __ ] open

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.280
everything you know like I see people

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.200
getting pretty like there's people I

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.520
said the White House being like let me

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.030
get it

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.160
you know assigns being like yeah yeah

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.880
please you know dude with guns at like

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.910
[ __ ] ice cream shops being like open

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.900
this [ __ ] fast-food restaurant but uh

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.360
no it's it's in Missouri it's and so the

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.910
south and kind of everywhere other than

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:33.550
the Northeast really doesn't seem to

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:35.110
give too much of a [ __ ] it's basically

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:37.510
it's weird because it's obviously like

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:40.060
anything else it's become political so

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.940
if your state's Republican it'll be open

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.350
if your Democrat you'll probably be

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:46.390
closed way longer than it needs to be

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:49.090
it's just you're either open to earlier

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:53.230
close to long yeah I mean could get back

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:55.330
to stand up like my god you know it

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:56.710
almost feels like the longer this goes

00:24:56.710 --> 00:25:00.010
on for the less I kinda would be would

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:01.450
just jump at the chance to go in there

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:03.880
and I'm gonna I'm a bit has a bit like

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.890
of course you would walk anywhere no I

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:07.810
did go and do go and do a show but like

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:10.300
sure it just feelings like that so long

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.070
like we're being like so I was supposed

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:14.230
to start turn in September in Ireland

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:16.330
but it we just put it back to ferry

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:19.210
straight away just it seems like

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:20.500
anything that opens here is gonna have

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.090
like thirty thirty forty percent

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:25.570
capacity so you say February yeah I do

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:27.310
stand-up till February oh definitely

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:30.490
gonna do stand-up but like oh yeah yeah

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.710
so like the way you guys go on the road

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:35.190
like we we don't do that you do like a

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:37.750
two or three-month - and that's like

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:41.560
Friday Saturday shows that's it okay in

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.260
in like good in like theaters but then

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.270
the rest of the time is it's just yeah

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:48.100
you go do clubs and all that kind of

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.200
okay yeah just just for the big show

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.830
like doing like a big theater at like 40

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:56.770
percent would just fit know it's gonna

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:59.200
be bad doing clubs it like the the st.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.210
Louis shows are gonna be bad it's gonna

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:03.820
be like on everyone that looks okay and

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.040
in masks they're gonna be wearing masks

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.520
it's gonna be [ __ ] bad but I think

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.390
you know there'll be a couple people

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:12.220
that take their masks off and say [ __ ]

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:14.110
it start getting drunk it should be I

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:16.180
mean it'll be a experience I'll probably

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.370
bomb the first on Thursday night

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:21.190
but hopefully front end Saturday it'll

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:22.690
feel so good the bottom though you know

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:23.919
what I mean I know I know

00:26:23.919 --> 00:26:25.779
I'd love to just do stand-up for a bit

00:26:25.779 --> 00:26:29.020
not to work just just to get back to it

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.650
so well I think bombings are gonna if I

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:34.299
bomb the first show I'm gonna be like

00:26:34.299 --> 00:26:35.950
man I lost it I'm not gonna be able to

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:38.169
do this yeah I suck I mean I feel that

00:26:38.169 --> 00:26:40.450
way anyway yeah that's usually like I've

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.940
done well that week because people looks

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.669
like Evan people are suggestible so like

00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:47.440
you would imagine there's gonna be like

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.240
a lot of room for error you know what I

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.380
mean like fine I think so

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.210
although the other side of that is not

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:53.590
to jinx your show but they might be like

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:56.169
I waited three months for some event

00:26:56.169 --> 00:26:59.080
yeah yeah yeah yeah it's better be great

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.520
and if you talk about you know if you

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.960
bring up anything political people

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.390
[ __ ] go nuts I don't think I'm gonna

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:07.929
do anything crew no virus related I

00:27:07.929 --> 00:27:09.429
don't think so it's probably that's

00:27:09.429 --> 00:27:10.809
probably cuz I haven't thought of a good

00:27:10.809 --> 00:27:12.970
bed I mean yeah I keep saying I know

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:14.919
there's gonna be no mention of covert in

00:27:14.919 --> 00:27:16.539
my show unless I think of something in

00:27:16.539 --> 00:27:19.419
the meantime which Kaos settled in the

00:27:19.419 --> 00:27:21.960
Shu that one thing you probably like are

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.399
sick to the back teeth of talking about

00:27:24.399 --> 00:27:26.679
and being asked on podcasts no I don't

00:27:26.679 --> 00:27:31.000
want it in their life yeah so like I had

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.429
heard so many people on podcast the

00:27:33.429 --> 00:27:35.919
podcast that I listen to and talk about

00:27:35.919 --> 00:27:39.370
the stand-up chignon chien killers from

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:42.100
Saturday Night Live and sucked from the

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.950
cast or asked to leave and because the

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:47.559
comments me and on on a podcast I didn't

00:27:47.559 --> 00:27:49.179
put in two together so even when we did

00:27:49.179 --> 00:27:51.760
the stand and I briefly said loading and

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:52.929
stuff and watched you on stage

00:27:52.929 --> 00:27:56.710
it wasn't until very recently even after

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:58.149
I'd probably asked you to do this

00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.809
podcast

00:27:58.809 --> 00:28:02.830
I was like that's that's who that was

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:07.330
so essentially for I yeah I mean I know

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:09.309
you're you seem very cool we're talking

00:28:09.309 --> 00:28:11.110
about it but no I don't wanna be it's

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:14.200
gotta be it's gotta be I feel like

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.299
there's probably you you can't keep

00:28:16.299 --> 00:28:18.100
saying the same thing i'm sure i'm hard

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.960
asking people when people ask you about

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.360
it but em from the outside and you were

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.210
on saturday night life and a podcast

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:27.909
clip resurfaced from how long before was

00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:30.159
that like it wasn't that old it was from

00:28:30.159 --> 00:28:32.320
like 2018 okay

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:38.409
it wasn't that old 1984 no it was like

00:28:38.409 --> 00:28:41.830
last year so you make comments the that

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:43.750
some you you were talking about the

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:46.360
Chinese community in in New York in

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:48.929
Philly yeah yeah we were talking about

00:28:48.929 --> 00:28:53.259
how how Chinatown started and we were

00:28:53.259 --> 00:28:56.549
making fun of the fact that back then

00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:59.080
they must like the white people in the

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.090
city must have been like what the [ __ ]

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:02.230
is that like when they build like a

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:04.419
pagoda in the middle of the city like

00:29:04.419 --> 00:29:05.679
all these weird buildings the white

00:29:05.679 --> 00:29:07.330
people were probably but the [ __ ] is

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:10.029
that and then my friend was like why do

00:29:10.029 --> 00:29:12.669
they are they all live in the same area

00:29:12.669 --> 00:29:14.980
and I was you know I was just talking

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.259
about how City developers back then

00:29:17.259 --> 00:29:19.659
probably segregated quite a bit yeah and

00:29:19.659 --> 00:29:23.019
I happened to imitate one poorly enough

00:29:23.019 --> 00:29:24.639
that people I think thought it was just

00:29:24.639 --> 00:29:27.399
me saying it I was like man let the text

00:29:27.399 --> 00:29:29.169
live there and that was that was it and

00:29:29.169 --> 00:29:31.059
that now don't get me wrong there was

00:29:31.059 --> 00:29:32.860
there was significantly more they could

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:35.710
have got me on so I was yeah I was

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:38.769
alright with that one I took the L on

00:29:38.769 --> 00:29:40.779
that I said yes I understand you have to

00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:41.379
fire me

00:29:41.379 --> 00:29:43.600

going and I was like in meetings with

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.909
people at Saturday Night Live like

00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:50.380
trying to figure out how to get out of

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.529
it and they were like like they kept

00:33:53.529 --> 00:33:55.210
getting like texts and [ __ ] they were

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:57.399
like oh you you called someone a [ __ ]

00:33:57.399 --> 00:34:00.340
and I was like oh my god I don't think I

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:01.570
did that but all right well I'm

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:04.020
definitely [ __ ] you can't say that

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:08.560
what what was the moment when when you

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.179
realized that it was all it was all like

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:11.649
kicking off I don't know if you guys use

00:34:11.649 --> 00:34:14.050
that phrase in America which which way

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:16.899
like good or bad like bad like like what

00:34:16.899 --> 00:34:19.060
was the point where weird liked it was

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.889
it an email that you go from someone or

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:23.020
that it just blew up on on Twitter one

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.599
day ah no I was on the way to the stand

00:34:25.599 --> 00:34:28.060
actually when the first article came out

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:31.570
which was written by this kid who hates

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:34.050
he like hates Aaron I live like he like

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:36.339
like writes about cast members all the

00:34:36.339 --> 00:34:39.369
time tries to like call Michael che like

00:34:39.369 --> 00:34:41.940
transphobic like he just constantly is

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:44.080
going out to show with like woke

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.290
[ __ ] but uh he wrote an article my

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:49.200
agent called and was like did you say

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:52.419
[ __ ] and I was like no I wouldn't say

00:34:52.419 --> 00:34:54.849
that and then I listened the clip and I

00:34:54.849 --> 00:34:58.599
was like alright yeah but and then I

00:34:58.599 --> 00:35:00.369
knew yeah and then I got to the stand

00:35:00.369 --> 00:35:03.730
and like I think I think it was that

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:05.619
night or the next night like TMZ was

00:35:05.619 --> 00:35:08.470
there like with paparazzi would take a

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:12.020
pic and it was like yeah I'm in trouble

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:13.670
I'm not a moment where you were like god

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:17.000
this is this is big yeah it was funny

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.560
cuz I was going to the stand

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.020
I had shows that night so the day it got

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:22.730
announced I had shows at the stand and I

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:24.950
was like oh this is gonna be such a fun

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:27.230
[ __ ] night like all my comic friends

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:28.940
are gonna be there to like Pat me on the

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.800
back and be like ah we knew you were the

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.650
you were gonna be the one and then said

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:36.020
it was just like a it was like a funeral

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.080
people were like you'll be all right

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:43.250
back and sort of sorry for ya and to

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:44.960
take it back like a little bit like

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.730
getting on Saturday Night Live like that

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:49.580
is like we I think most people in

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:50.810
Ireland like we definitely know that

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:54.050
shoe yeah we know oh boy like everyone

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:56.060
who's come through and going on and and

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:58.339
me being a stand-up and like listen to

00:35:58.339 --> 00:36:02.020
podcasts and stuff I imagine like it is

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:05.390
such a big it's probably like being like

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:07.849
one thing to the thing here for people

00:36:07.849 --> 00:36:08.690
that are in the comedy would be like

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:10.400
people you want to play from Manchester

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.680
United like it's like it's it's the

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.510
equivalent of that like it is it is the

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:17.690
pinnacle I guess for yeah like it's

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:19.130
actually a lot like Manchester United

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:20.960
cuz everybody that doesn't get on the

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.420
team says how much they suck you know

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:25.550
they used to be really good and now they

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:29.089
suck and yeah in fact before I got a so

00:36:29.089 --> 00:36:30.740
now I definitely like talked [ __ ] on it

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.359
until I got it and then I was like yeah

00:36:32.359 --> 00:36:34.130
[ __ ] yeah I'd love to be on Saturday

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:37.190
live but the hope the whole process I

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:39.230
was I never thought I'd be on Saturday

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:41.089
live so even during like the audition

00:36:41.089 --> 00:36:43.220
process and all that I was kind of I was

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:45.109
pretty cavalier about it cuz I really

00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:46.490
didn't think they could ever take

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:48.410
somebody like me which obviously I was

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:49.480
right

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:53.000
y-you know uh so yeah the whole time I

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.740
like I was pretty relaxed and didn't

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.480
give a [ __ ] until the the audition

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.690
that's on the main stage which that was

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:01.190
and it's in front of an empty room

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:03.640
except for the producers of the show and

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.780
you're just supposed to died you just

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:07.250
have like five minutes and they're like

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:09.589
I go did you do Starbuck

00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:12.320
or did you have any ID no I did do

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:15.230
stand-up yeah I mean it was great

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:17.290
I mean you hear like so many so many

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:19.190
legends so many people who have gone on

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:21.260
to me that just the biggest stand-up

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:24.290
stars who crumbled a donation or got to

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:25.580
that stage and Justin

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.380
me again on how long were you actually

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:33.650
on the show for like four days oh I

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:37.100
thought any year no I wasn't even on the

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.200
show it got announced that I was on the

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.570
cast and I got fired in like four days

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:44.390
in a way do you look at that and go well

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:46.040
that's that's maybe better because you

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.660
didn't have a chance to like properly

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.640
like be like this is the best thing ever

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.700
or oh yeah or is that worse do you think

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.110
they just like not have a chance to

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:57.920
actually I'm sorry I can ask you a

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.750
question do you think that if you were a

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:02.330
little like if you had done shows and

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:03.950
people were like he's the guy that does

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:05.450
this character whatever do you think you

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:07.430
would have been better supported if you

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:09.530
feel like you do a hundred percent like

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:12.950
if people had ever even seen me do

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:15.550
stand-up they would be like oh he's not

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:18.290
he's not a bad guy like if anybody had

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:19.940
ever even seen me yes I would have had

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.530
more support for sure in fact that's

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:24.830
what that's what like SNL was trying to

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:27.170
do they were like I if we can if we can

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:28.910
figure out a way to get you on to the

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:32.090
first week of the show we should have a

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:33.740
good chance to get you out of this but

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:39.650
now yeah that would help and so I mean

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:42.410
you used the phrase yourself counseled

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:44.480
because I the reason that I started

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.980
looking back into this again a little

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:49.430
bit was um Charlemagne was from the

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:52.270
Players Club and had Joe Biden is that

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:54.800
yeah he's a Democrat presidential

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.840
candidate and Joe Biden made just a

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.700
ludicrous comment that I'm sure a lot of

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:02.840
people saw and yeah about race and you

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.670
know you pointed out did you know you

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:06.830
were counseled for for something that

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:09.560
there was you know a lot a lot less a

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.810
lot a lot more innocuous than than not

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:14.870
probably and sure well here's a small

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:17.030
scale yeah yeah I mean it was just as

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:18.680
I'm not running for [ __ ] president

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.780
and if I say something dumb and [ __ ]

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:23.510
up and it's on a comedy podcast and I

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:26.540
might be joking it's like I as a society

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:28.430
I am look I even in the tweet I was like

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:29.810
I'm not defending myself because I don't

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:31.370
want to I'm not comparing what I'm doing

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:34.550
to what he's done I'm just saying the

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:36.080
same people that were like you're not

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.490
allowed to say that and then have a

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:39.430
career which they said to me will

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:41.980
literally vote for that guy and even if

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:43.300
it's not what they want they're gonna

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:46.780
vote for him uh so yeah it's just it's

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:50.099
it's hypocritical in that sense but whoa

00:39:50.099 --> 00:39:53.050
two final questions about this what was

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:57.819
the reaction from stand-ups especially

00:39:57.819 --> 00:39:59.470
the guys who had been nude shoes within

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:01.569
the likes of the stand for example on

00:40:01.569 --> 00:40:06.099
that under new robes um well most end

00:40:06.099 --> 00:40:10.839
ups are selfish you know narcissists so

00:40:10.839 --> 00:40:12.250
they were all like oh I'm gonna get in

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:13.869
trouble I'm gonna get in trouble so that

00:40:13.869 --> 00:40:17.079
was basically everybody's reaction most

00:40:17.079 --> 00:40:19.150
people were definitely you know they

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.760
usually some what's a Chad and Freud

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.210
shouting Freud you know I mean I can see

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:26.829
the word I couldn't spell like I

00:40:26.829 --> 00:40:28.839
wouldn't get any points for ya but I can

00:40:28.839 --> 00:40:30.280
I can see when you

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.260
yeah public shaming is usually pretty

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:35.319
fun for everybody so even even my I'm

00:40:35.319 --> 00:40:36.700
sure close friends were probably

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:40.089
slightly internally happier thinking it

00:40:40.089 --> 00:40:42.460
was funny and and truthfully it was kind

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:43.049
of funny

00:40:43.049 --> 00:40:45.910
some of it was very funny I guess it's

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:47.349
like yeah when you see your friend get

00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:48.819
in there like a little bit of trouble in

00:40:48.819 --> 00:40:52.059
school on a far bigger scale gonna be

00:40:52.059 --> 00:40:53.619
like one day he's gonna laugh at this

00:40:53.619 --> 00:40:55.450
one day he's gonna laugh at this yeah

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:58.750
yeah yeah my final question on that is

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:03.400
em you know the the free is like being

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.960
counseled and being like a council

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.750
comedian I'm doing stand-up obviously

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:09.790
like you know you're a stand-up you just

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:12.520
plied on the stand-up do you know did

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.920
you or do still get like anybody comin

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.380
to shows getting the wrong idea did you

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:18.970
get anyone come to the shows being like

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:21.069
like this guy's counsel he's gonna say

00:41:21.069 --> 00:41:23.470
something in a set like yeah you know

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:24.940
that kind of like there's people who

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.329
sure I find it weird the idea of like

00:41:27.329 --> 00:41:30.790
shock comedians because to me like it

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:32.980
it seems forced but did you get anyone

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:34.900
that had got the wrong idea and thought

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:37.630
that's what it was yeah definitely I

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:39.190
mean there's there's definitely there

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:40.540
was definitely an opportunity for me to

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:45.010
become like a shocking edgy you know

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:47.170
[ __ ] edge Lord which I definitely

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:50.829
have said edgy [ __ ] on a podcast but

00:41:50.829 --> 00:41:52.480
it's usually I mean it's literally just

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.110
me and my friend

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:55.600
[ __ ] around saying [ __ ] up things

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.190
to each other I don't do that [ __ ] on

00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:59.650
stage really but yeah there's there's

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:01.030
definitely that for a while like people

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:03.300
would show up and like scream [ __ ]

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.770
racial slurs against Asians and I'd be

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:08.890
like all right [ __ ] relax like you

00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:10.720
could make a lot more money for you just

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:14.500
leave me I know I know I know there yeah

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.030
if I leaned in and was just like yo

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:20.440
Trump rules yeah I probably would be at

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.180
the white house you make so much on

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.920
merch you know I mean you get out some

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.680
serious slogan t-shirts [ __ ] maybe I

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.860
should follow I still good I mean if

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:31.240
nobody saw it I just started making

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:38.800
Trump t-shirts goes on with my yeah what

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.860
[ __ ] me on that was like during what

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:44.350
like in the four or five days that like

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:46.120
I was I gonna get fired and not get

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.850
fired like the news like reporters were

00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:50.920
showing up to the stand and secretly

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.920
recording my sets uh yeah one of the

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.740
first one of the first sets I did was

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:59.710
about how it would be funny like Trump

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:03.580
would be funny to see get shot like his

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:06.610
assassination would be funny the tape

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:11.310
yeah and yeah they sent that to Fox News

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:14.200
so like immediately the right the right

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.530
didn't like me either yeah yeah I mean

00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:19.330
you could have really used those guys

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.250
you know and I know I could I could have

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:24.100
totally just gone right-wing but you

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:27.190
know that wouldn't be honest so do you

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:29.680
feel like when you when you are you

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.930
still like aware of it when you do

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:33.520
stand-up or or is this just like

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:34.930
something you're able to be like gentle

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:37.650
well it's kind of done no and you're I

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:40.450
don't know how easily it is to put

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:42.100
something like that like that past you

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:44.290
you feel like it's in the air in its in

00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:47.380
the air when you're doing started um if

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:49.150
I'm doing like a long set or like

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:50.560
headlining yeah I'll bring it up cuz a

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.690
lot of people know me from that so it'd

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:54.390
be weird if I didn't address it but ya

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:56.800
know I was getting to the point before

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.200
this before the break here with Cova die

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.510
no it wasn't really on my mind that much

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:04.090
in standup now off the stage obviously I

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:05.500
think about a lot and I still get like

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.150
like that [ __ ] bite into

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:10.120
people were talking sneer like there

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:12.430
you're not gonna get SNL shut the [ __ ]

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:14.130
it's like dude I'm not trying to get SNL

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:18.280
shut up you know and then it's it's also

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.920
funny like even other comics like cuz

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.470
cuz in the you know oh there's a lot of

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:26.680
woe comics that get their [ __ ] points

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:29.620
amongst their peers by you know

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:34.000
correcting other comics words they get

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.590
like one dude tweeted at me that I used

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:37.990
to be friends with tweeted at me use

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:39.430
like you know black people didn't cancel

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:42.190
you I was like no [ __ ] I didn't [ __ ]

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:44.020
say where'd you read that why'd you want

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:46.030
to see that in that tweet you [ __ ]

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:49.810
weirdo yeah it's weird I mean there are

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:52.330
a lot of them are phonies and maybe I

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:56.410
would be too so stomp stand up to stand

00:44:56.410 --> 00:45:00.670
up and with stand up come back how do

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:04.630
you I think since this will break like

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:06.970
I'd never really had a break from doing

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:08.500
stand-up like I started doing stand-up

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:11.830
maybe 13 years ago which in like New

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:14.650
York or LA years it's probably about six

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:16.960
years worth of shoes yeah but because

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.570
because it's it's spread I you know and

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:22.510
sure but I've never been lucky I've like

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:24.520
never had to take a break from it I've

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:26.110
never thought about not to have just

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:28.690
always been doing it and the first

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:30.250
couple of weeks of locked and I was

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:32.830
really panicking I was like I only know

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:34.360
I'd like go and do stand-up and it's

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:37.540
such a great release and but I actually

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:38.740
I have started thinking in the last

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:40.960
couple of weeks it's actually not not a

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.420
bad thing because the way I'm writing is

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:46.270
a little bit different like I I very

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:48.250
much got like to the point where I was

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:50.410
just writing notes on my phone and I and

00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:51.850
I thought that's the best way for me to

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:53.830
do it and now I have been been able to

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:55.300
watch them on my stand-up back and I'm

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:57.850
like I'm taking so long just to get to

00:45:57.850 --> 00:46:00.280
the point that was that's what was good

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.960
about New York about watching New York

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.870
stand-up was it it was it was a little

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:07.050
bit of a setup and then BOOM where is

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:10.150
where more I think in Ireland were more

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:13.180
storytellers so it doesn't long bet like

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.610
if I'm when I was going to do the Laugh

00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:17.170
Factory in Chicago if I that's five

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:19.060
minutes said I was maybe doing one bit

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.400
you know just one five minutes

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:23.920
which is fine but if it doesn't kill

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.890
like stock in it you know you're stuck

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:30.370
in it [ __ ] so has anything changed for

00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:31.750
you for you do you think or when you

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:32.770
come back to stand up will you do

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:33.490
anything different

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:37.780
I assume I'll change slightly and

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:38.830
hopefully for the better you know

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:41.710
hopefully I don't know I've never taken

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:45.550
a break either so I mean we'll see

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:47.170
hopefully it doesn't hopefully it's not

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:50.080
a step back yeah I just think in a way

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.490
it can be a good thing because I

00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:53.620
obviously think about your material a

00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:56.140
lot but yeah I'm having like a big prop

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:58.480
or think about it and I new friends that

00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.980
are doing that on it's like a negative

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:02.140
you know friends or like don't really

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:03.760
want to be doing this or like you know

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.500
their question either you're rid of them

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:07.420
they're like ability or whatever but I

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:09.100
think it's a good chance to like really

00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:12.460
have a think about the way the way I'm

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:13.960
doing it and just being like of course

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.150
even looking a little material and going

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:18.280
is there any way I could make that like

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.290
one bit for later can I can I change

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:23.260
this word and make it that and so I I

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:25.150
don't I don't know I think like getting

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:27.310
back to it's gonna be great but I heard

00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:29.380
the analogy of like it you know it's

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.420
like expect in UFC fighters and boxers

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:34.150
to take you know months off and then

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:35.950
just like straight go straight back in

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:38.050
their fight yeah you got to be able to

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:41.560
go and work out but I just can't I can't

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.120
wait like that I think it'll be ages

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.250
before I can come over to like New York

00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:47.110
or LA again I just think that's good

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:51.070
that's gonna be a while yeah I don't

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:53.860
think so I think I think with I think a

00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:54.580
year from now

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:58.450
within a year yeah yeah yeah that'd be

00:47:58.450 --> 00:47:58.810
great

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:02.500
and we put it it was so like gotten in a

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.690
way because when I when I did that trip

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:06.760
and did the stand and just a couple of

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:09.070
other places I I was thinking like I'm

00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:10.870
gonna come straight back so probably

00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:12.940
around this time maybe like a month ago

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.830
I probably would have come back and sort

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:18.490
of the visa that like lets me go and do

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:19.810
that which is great because you don't

00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:21.910
have to lie about why you're you know

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:23.800
been like oh come on over be like I just

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.650
can't get enough least two respects why

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:28.300
are you coming over five times a year

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.790
like I've been love love the Staten

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:34.270
Island Ferry you know and let me

00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:36.810
let me ask you one final question about

00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:41.080
about doing stand-up in in New York do

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.630
you think it's like I always thought LA

00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:45.700
was the place to be so I was like I'm

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:47.020
always gonna go over to LA and watch

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:49.780
stand-up and like how short trips of

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:52.810
doing comedy but yeah do you think of

00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:54.700
someone who's played probably everywhere

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:57.430
in America do you think New York is like

00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:59.260
the place like would you say New York

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:03.400
Comedy is better than la comédie yeah I

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.310
think I think a lot of people tend to

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:07.780
know I don't know I've only I've I

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:11.020
haven't really been in LA that much but

00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:14.530
it seems like you it's a lot easier to

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:15.670
get stage time in New York

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:19.870
it's MIT's um I think it's it's good to

00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:21.100
develop in New York

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.870
if you know and then once you're [ __ ]

00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:24.760
famous then you go to LA I would say if

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.890
you were trying to become just good at

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:27.460
stand-up

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.410
New York's good if you want to do like

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:31.360
TV and all that [ __ ]

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.910
I did LA would definitely be the place

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:35.950
to go I think New York comedians

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:38.710
definitely there's like a there's more

00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:40.870
of an openness you know like us I was

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:43.480
like a complete outsider who you know

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:46.000
like I also am NOT like you knows where

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.470
you see stand-ups in a new players that

00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:49.000
like go straight up to all the acts and

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.030
think their friends like obviously I

00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:53.560
want to say hello to everyone but I will

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.810
just say like say hello one kinda but

00:49:55.810 --> 00:49:57.010
people will bring you more in the

00:49:57.010 --> 00:49:58.720
conversation ask you where you're from

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.780
that kind of thing I did the Laugh

00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:02.440
Factory

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:05.560
no the Comedy Cellar in Las Vegas I was

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:07.930
in Nice I was in Vegas from my honeymoon

00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:11.020
and I said my wife I was like listen if

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:12.970
I can get like a five-minute spot can I

00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:14.740
go and do this guy I was like it's it's

00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:17.110
the Comedy Cellar like it's I said like

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:19.120
it it's the best club in the world

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.890
no I didn't know I just thought the one

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:23.110
I'm paying this would be just the same

00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:24.760
you know I was like it's it's yeah yeah

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:27.040
yeah because they said it built like a

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.750
model the model for the New York once I

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:30.970
was like this I'm going to play the best

00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:33.460
club in the world and I didn't know was

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:35.830
in a casino and the real casino and I

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:38.680
went to and I have never had a worse

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:40.630
interaction in the green room like I

00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:43.990
showed up nobody like I like it was in

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:47.230
there am so let me think

00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:48.880
who's the English guy who's like Russell

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:51.660
Brand but he's not Russell Brand and

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:56.140
tall gang Jeff Jeff died no chair

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:58.089
although I did Jeff died was not there

00:50:58.089 --> 00:50:59.410
that again would you after hey he's a

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:01.480
nice guy in San Diego also on my

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:05.560
honeymoon so I'm super I think yeah what

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:10.530
am i Jeff Jeff Jeff leach that's it yeah

00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:15.339
he was there and the the owner was there

00:51:15.339 --> 00:51:17.560
with like a load of other there was

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.450
maybe like a tax I didn't recognize

00:51:19.450 --> 00:51:23.020
anybody else but the only persuade all

00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:25.089
ready there but I wasn't on the bill but

00:51:25.089 --> 00:51:27.910
they'd let me come on so I kinda said

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:30.099
hello but I didn't want to say like um I

00:51:30.099 --> 00:51:32.050
get sent I'm a comedian too because

00:51:32.050 --> 00:51:34.180
that's just terrible Sims sure so I just

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:35.680
kind of stood there and they continue

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:36.970
their conversation I just had to like

00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:40.060
stand in the room and the older I get

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:42.790
that person who checked in with me and

00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:44.920
like and by the way I had the worst set

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.750
because I was in honeymoon holiday move

00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:50.320
I wasn't I was not on it I'm a child the

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:52.180
only person who like came up to chat to

00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:54.550
me and you know had a lovely

00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:56.470
conversation with was Tony woods knew

00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:59.440
Tony woods Oh Tony's the [ __ ] man he

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.780
kind of I think he sensed I was kind of

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:04.510
just like yeah sort of Irish weirdo just

00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:06.190
kind of standing in the shadows of the

00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:09.010
of the backstage bit and yeah he knew I

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:11.500
had a bad said and he chatted to me for

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:13.630
like 15 20 minutes and it's just like

00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:15.460
the nicest guy then I saw him on the day

00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:18.099
of Chappelle and no weird thing when he

00:52:18.099 --> 00:52:19.270
was getting the award and he showed her

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:21.490
Tony woods he's like there's my mentor

00:52:21.490 --> 00:52:22.990
Tony woods and I was like yeah that's

00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:26.079
that's he's like styled he styled is act

00:52:26.079 --> 00:52:28.690
off Tony woods here yeah and you know

00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:30.460
it's just crazy I can also call Tony a

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:33.730
mentor I can't he specifically wouldn't

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:36.040
know me at all but but yeah he was I was

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.150
really hoping you were there when like

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:40.180
voss was there or like the New York guys

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:44.440
no no it was a it was weird it was like

00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:46.210
a lot a lot more like international guys

00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:47.800
it was maybe two newer comedians but I

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:50.109
didn't recognize him and anybody else's

00:52:50.109 --> 00:52:51.609
name but just when I was in New York

00:52:51.609 --> 00:52:54.369
that time like you mark Normand Joe Joe

00:52:54.369 --> 00:52:57.430
less like just I just really like nice

00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:59.020
but like just

00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:01.060
hey what's up conversations and it just

00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:03.490
felt it just felt good and there you

00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:04.510
know I don't want to you were talking

00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:05.920
about sucking Dexter just because we're

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:08.320
both called Shane but but you're set

00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:10.990
that might in particular was hang out at

00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:14.200
an like oh thank you I like great really

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:17.110
you were doing the the Special Olympics

00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:18.520
bit a little bit about yeah yeah yeah I

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:19.690
was doing the say I told you it's the

00:53:19.690 --> 00:53:21.790
same act I've been doing for five months

00:53:21.790 --> 00:53:23.710
there but Davos gonna be good

00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:25.810
like what's crazy is that would that's

00:53:25.810 --> 00:53:27.730
gonna that would work just as well here

00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:30.220
you wouldn't need to adopt anything like

00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:32.320
I see a lot of community and I don't

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:34.150
think their main worry is would this

00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:37.570
work in Northern Ireland yeah but there

00:53:37.570 --> 00:53:39.790
but that that set and not authenticity I

00:53:39.790 --> 00:53:42.420
think we would do really well here and

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:45.070
I'd like to get over there and be fun we

00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:47.400

don't know if you know the conversion

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:56.140
rate but I think I do that sucks no it's

00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:57.820
pretty good pounds yeah you can get a

00:53:57.820 --> 00:53:59.160

00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:33.390

wrestling Alec dotes yeah and then he

00:55:35.099 --> 00:55:36.510

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:58.890
all right great

00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:02.070

00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:10.230
of pressure like on him like one you

00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:11.490

yourself or something no that's like I

00:56:18.839 --> 00:56:20.940
think Stevo had to deal with that from

00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:22.770
like I think he'd be doing shows and

00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:24.060
people like alright get to the part

00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:26.070
