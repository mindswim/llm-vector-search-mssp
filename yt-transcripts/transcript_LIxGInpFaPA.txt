00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:07.920
these weird feelings about white rappers

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.029
in general where I'm like these guys are

00:09:09.029 --> 00:09:11.850
like trans pretty much like this dude is

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.589
trans then there's the trans fight

00:09:13.589 --> 00:09:16.170
oh Eminem and exact dude Machine Gun

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.120
Kelly all the trans rappers are [ __ ]

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.769
so then I'm like I'm listening to Mac

00:09:19.769 --> 00:09:21.360
Miller saying I'm like I don't know what

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.740
does he like making his voice like this

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.060
I mean this must have been so hard for

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.560
this guy to be a white rapper and I'm

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.689
like freaking out then I get into the

00:09:27.689 --> 00:09:29.730
Machine Gun Kelly and and then I like to

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.079
see that Machine Gun Kelly made fun of

00:09:31.079 --> 00:09:33.120
Eminem and I'm like oh no what's going

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.680

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:42.990
trash dude I was just like dude I think

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.960
he ate a [ __ ] microd st so I just put

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.490
him on my chest and held him all night

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.070
this Helen watching TV like it's right

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.750

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:55.549
dude you'll be all right you ready like

00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:58.110
eventually I bring him into the bed into

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.850
like that like guest bed and I put him

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:00.990

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:02.460
bed I put a blanket on him she was cold

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.590
and then he was like he could you know

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:05.910
what to do with his face so he I didn't

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.110
want him to Elvis out like he was

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.670
facedown in the sheets when he said

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.549
[ __ ] suffocation I put his head on a

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:17.940
pillow like I just like thinking it's

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.530
totally normal to tuck my dog in and put

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:20.880
his head on a pillow I was like sweet I

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.730
went to bed my girlfriend came and it

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:25.410
was like why is he tucked in with his

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.390
[ __ ] head on a pillow I was like I

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:30.360
don't know he was feeling sick so then

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.169
dude the weirdest part I may be the

00:18:34.169 --> 00:18:35.669
weirdest I don't remember I don't know

00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:39.210
probably I needed to talk to me because

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:41.070
he was cold and his face every time I

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:42.390
lifted his head up he would do a face

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:43.890
into the sheets I'm like he's [ __ ]

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:47.220
suffocate so then uh dude the next day

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.350

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:55.470
foggy but he had a good time and uh dude

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.350
ever since he hasn't [ __ ] he said

00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:59.610
every time I left him he would [ __ ] my

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.830
trashcan up eat [ __ ] mess around like

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.860

Wow so again he could have gotten more

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.850
mature I think he [ __ ] ate the [ __ ]

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.040
either ate the grandma quantum cush that

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.799
I can't find right now or he had the

00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:19.169
teabag of the microdose and then it was

00:19:19.169 --> 00:19:20.220
just sitting there the whole time like

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:28.500
dude why the [ __ ] dude he did it's the

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.760
weirdest thing ever

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.530
every time I came in he would [ __ ] my

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.360
[ __ ] up it was like if you look at all

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.450

[ __ ] each other on siculus yeah I

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.179
mean it's kind of ridiculous it's like I

00:27:41.179 --> 00:27:43.279
mean if you think about what you get out

00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:45.889
of it for girls I I'd be tirelessly

00:27:45.889 --> 00:27:49.639
pursuing it to you basically become

00:27:49.639 --> 00:27:51.590
someone's like sole executor of all

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:55.039
their worldly assets I'd be [ __ ] I'd

00:27:55.039 --> 00:27:58.129
be flying after that pretty hard to do

00:27:58.129 --> 00:28:00.799
it's like if I were to get like all my

00:28:00.799 --> 00:28:02.990
guests do it was that's your wife you

00:28:04.639 --> 00:28:07.580
reason it's like I mean I could see why

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.830

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:12.049

engagement ring you get to [ __ ] show

that to people exactly it's so pretty

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:25.340
mmm luckily though do the wisdom I have

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:26.659
it's I mean everyone should go a

00:28:26.659 --> 00:28:28.340

just works under you first girlfriend

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:32.960
pop the question

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.990
let it all fall apart actually no go for

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:37.730
a girl just be like she's [ __ ] hot

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:38.300
dude I'm

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:41.440
marry her [ __ ] ride that one out

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.970
that's my gameplay that's been my move

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:48.110
forever dude yeah didn't like well she

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:49.480
makes me she makes me want to come

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.600
exactly

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.620
we could probably join our lives

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.270
together how hard it is to find a cool

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:53.990
lady

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:56.510
yeah just find a hot one exactly deal

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:59.410
with the fallout now I will say the

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:02.750
what's been helping my relationship

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:04.070
skills it's definitely not this is a

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:05.720
thought I had today it's not really

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.210
depressing what it's like it's not the

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:09.470
fact that I've really grown as a person

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:11.450
I just think like my hormonal profile is

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:13.520
cooling as cooling down so it's like

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.950
easier for me to be chill so I'm like I

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:17.300
was thinking about it today I'm like I'm

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.550
the same old [ __ ] JD same old dog

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:21.110
just need to come less so I'm not as

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:23.420
drastic - there's been no personal

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:28.850
growth my body just changed that's it so

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:30.200
they say with time and become women

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.840
really yeah what do you think of that I

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:37.580
think it's true you become a lady time

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.470
dude yeah eventually we all die a baby

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:43.430
laid back we start out as a boy we end

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:45.830
as a girl start out start out as a sperm

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:48.020
cell and as a [ __ ] basically old

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:52.430
cranky old baby man dude as my dad's

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:54.830
gone into baby van all dude old man you

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:56.930
know they get so angry it's just drama

00:29:56.930 --> 00:30:02.120
yeah when you become a baby man who's

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.890
got this stuff in the laundry who's

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:05.510
clogging up the [ __ ] dryer right now

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:06.920
it's like well it's not that big a deal

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:07.730
just switch it

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:10.550
I mean I try to just get in the head of

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:13.640
my like eventual 60 year old brain it's

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.070
just like are there other like weird

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:17.720
tunnels I go down mentally when I'm like

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.250
super stoned in my bed and I can't fall

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.080
asleep I started thinking about like how

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.510
I'm just gonna be this mindset but at 60

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:26.030
the confusion just ever ends dude it's

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:27.800
like a total mirrored hallway oh my god

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:28.640
dude what the [ __ ]

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.800
now you're gonna you know you're gonna

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.220
find something you fully believe in

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.480
you'll get one of these theories is

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.610
gonna kick in hard enough that you're

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:40.010
like that's life true and then you'll

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:42.350
just die with that see and this is my

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:45.230
thing what happens is you think that and

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:46.970
then you hit 60 and you're like oh that

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:48.670
there was wrong I haven't found it yet

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:51.400
why are these [ __ ] clothes in my way

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.950
[Laughter]

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:56.840
yeah I think about that it's when that

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.640
hope dies I'm wondering I'm like I

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.730
wonder people do after that but you just

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:04.910
die true but that's not that's not me

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:06.440
I'm not a pessimist think the final

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.890
revelation is that there is no theory

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:11.360
yeah eventually you get old enough to

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.060
just be like this plan I've been looking

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:15.620
for my whole life just doesn't exist

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.210
exactly time's up

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:21.830
yep [ __ ] figured it out yep got it yes I

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:22.850
think that is the move

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:25.250
you just reach [ __ ] baby man nirvana

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:28.670

Jewish dude who would pass it behind the

00:44:18.019 --> 00:44:19.669
back to a Jewish lady and would pass it

00:44:19.669 --> 00:44:21.469
to another Jew it's [ __ ] a head off

00:44:21.469 --> 00:44:22.609
well then they will give it to the high

00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:24.679
priests and there was these dudes who

00:44:24.679 --> 00:44:26.269

00:44:26.269 --> 00:44:28.729
just slit goats throats all day long

00:44:28.729 --> 00:44:30.650

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:32.239
the pelt for themselves was that fetched

00:44:32.239 --> 00:44:34.160
a value and then they were just feast on

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.289

00:45:19.459 --> 00:45:22.069
you know they blew up this scheme dude

00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:23.929
this was like the Romans came through

00:45:23.929 --> 00:45:25.699
and conquered them and then we're like

00:45:25.699 --> 00:45:27.349

00:45:30.169 --> 00:45:31.519
thing and these let them do their thing

00:45:31.519 --> 00:45:33.979
that's where Harry came in he was like

00:45:33.979 --> 00:45:36.049
the you know the client king or whatever

00:45:36.049 --> 00:45:38.779
and but apparently they're saying there

00:45:38.779 --> 00:45:41.209
it was like yo we gotta [ __ ] cut these

00:45:41.209 --> 00:45:43.400
Jew boys heads off ya hair doesn't want

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:44.959
to be Jew he well he was like he

00:45:44.959 --> 00:45:47.089
converted to Judaism and then they they

00:45:47.089 --> 00:45:48.499
put him up as a king so he was like

00:45:48.499 --> 00:45:50.419
trapped between two worlds but they like

00:45:50.419 --> 00:45:51.709
the Jews back then were like they were

00:45:51.709 --> 00:45:53.719
like [ __ ] Isis dude they were getting

00:45:53.719 --> 00:45:55.429
aqua pied by the Romans and like there

00:45:55.429 --> 00:45:57.559
was a sect of them that were like [ __ ]

00:45:57.559 --> 00:45:58.549
this cuz they got kicked out of

00:45:58.549 --> 00:45:59.659
Jerusalem and had to live in the woods

00:45:59.659 --> 00:46:00.769
so there's like these Jews and

00:46:00.769 --> 00:46:02.119
wilderness who were like totally cut off

00:46:02.119 --> 00:46:04.849
yeah earnest Jews these were Willie's

00:46:04.849 --> 00:46:10.519
while Jews like pigs they're out in the

00:46:10.519 --> 00:46:12.439
woods too long they start growing their

00:46:12.439 --> 00:46:16.459
tusks back nobody sounds by the first

00:46:16.459 --> 00:46:19.719

[ __ ] they're going back and forth and

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:35.230
that's what they're like Nazareth was

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:36.910

little circles what about the prayer

00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:55.090
they say Jesus is from that you'd say

00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:56.530
you're gold down on the tree stump and

00:46:56.530 --> 00:47:01.900

of first century Jews dude it's crazy

00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:19.720
this guy books called historical it's

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:20.800
called zealot but it should be called

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:24.490
the wildlife of first century so then

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:25.990
they're saying Jesus came from that but

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:27.760
it was like these these Jewish Jews got

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.260
displaced like into the wilderness yes

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:32.080
Jesus was raised wild you he was who's

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.630

dude the story itself is [ __ ]

00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.350
hilarious dude and then like basically

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:00.970
there was like these guys called zealots

00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:02.920
that would like apparently all Jews

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:04.780
claimed like being like full of zeal for

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:06.490
the religion we're like you never bounce

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:08.890
like an outside force or you know this

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:10.450
or that and like you just thought about

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:12.250
like David and like all these old Jewish

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:13.570

these guys came out of the woods and

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:20.050
started [ __ ] people off and that's

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:21.940
where Jesus was from he that came

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.260

that you know I don't know probably not

00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:48.900
it's early enough that things are going

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:52.710
well true if this was later and in if

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:55.110

00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:55.680
relationship

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:57.750
BBG that's true this would probably be a

00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:00.089
salty BBG right now there's only one way

00:53:00.089 --> 00:53:01.380
