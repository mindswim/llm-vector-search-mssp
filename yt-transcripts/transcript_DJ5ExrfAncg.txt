WEBVTT

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.750
what up everybody we're right back we

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.150
were a little famished earlier and now I

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.339
just ate one thousand calories roughly

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:15.950
and I'm protein eyes dan dready to go I

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.750
was definitely a little light-headed on

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.390
the last one welcome to the live

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.640
attendees what's I'll be all what's

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.419
going down um alright still figuring out

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.310
this new format might jump back to the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.080
zoom but I kind of like this but again

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.910
it sucks because I can't really see and

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.399
interact with people in real time which

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.430
kind of pisses me the [ __ ] off but it's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.039
not that big of a deal alright so we did

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:43.610
the last one

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.129
so that again the sky loves primers for

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.870
five chapters in and it's like here's

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.809
another primer but again this one really

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.239
I think kind of starts to do stuff which

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.190
is cool because you know I've spent I

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.140
don't know how about three and a half

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.030
hours being like we're gonna get to it

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.500
we're gonna get to the stuff the stuff

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.609
that actually works for you right now

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.050
I'm just explaining stuff which is cool

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.640
you know it's important to learn how

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.560
your brain works and you know at least

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.540
theories on it that have been tested by

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.310
people who spent thirty years of their

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.659
life trying to figure out that right or

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.850
not which is nice we just get to have

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.259
that you know shout out to that so yeah

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.650
so right now the idea is for people

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.390
really you know this is a peek behind

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.189
the curtain but the real idea is to try

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.590
to drive the point home again that

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.460
experiential avoidance is not the way to

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.290
try to hide from everything because it's

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.200
kind of scary you just is an untenable

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.420
approach to life because life is

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.990
inherently scary and torturous um well

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.990
it can be you know alright so let's get

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.060
into the next chapter yeah bum bum bum

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.700
there we go yeah all right presentation

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.880
mode go all right so we're chapter four

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.369
now and I already you know anything

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:02.719
about the groups is in the last episode

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.149
since I'm doing these like an hour apart

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.300
just reference the last episode alright

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.310
so starting out we got a task now we got

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.690
something to do I said I was excited

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.440
personally when this happened so here's

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.660
the deal when you get a chance

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.640
you know you can do this right now or

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.080
really just like listen if you're

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.000
listening to this afterwards just read

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.440
this and then pause this and do this

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.390
exercise and jump back in alright so

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.950
when you get a chance find a quiet place

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.840
where you won't be disturbed and hold

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.450
your breath do this for as long as you

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.760
can and write down the number you know

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.470
for how long that is for how long you

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.570
held your breath right I'll try to do

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.210
this before listening to or watching the

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.550
rest of this episode if I could somehow

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.650
pause Prezi which with again zoom you

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.400
can I would do it but I can't so for the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.560
couple people are in here spoiler alert

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.450
but this will still be fun either way

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.200
and again excuse me if you're driving

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.690
don't try this and if you're at work

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.880
fake a dump and if you've already faked

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.910
a dump faked another state law they

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.740
cannot your employer cannot ask you how

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.240
many dumps you've taken in a day I swear

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.980
to god you have to be able to sue for

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.060
that alright so again hold your breath

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.530
actually you could be holding your

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.240
breath right now I'm bullshitting around

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.860
but the idea is to find a quiet spot

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.140
hold your breath see how long you can do

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.220
it write down that number

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.870
all right pause that if you have to do

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.150
your thing jump back in whatever it's

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.590
not a big deal you can always watch the

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.380
replay alright so what's this chapter

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.330
about this chapters about acceptance and

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.490
willingness which involves letting go

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.570
alright

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.750
so learning to accept this is again yet

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.400
another primer he's calling this a

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.050
primer but I think this is a primer plus

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.490
and I know everyone's ready to rip off

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.270
the training wheels

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.150
I get it but again this stuff's tricky

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.250
man that's why I think you know we'll

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.470
get into that so the idea behind this

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.450
chapter is learning what acceptance

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.550
actually is you know you know the word

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.400
obviously but like how can we use this

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.190
in a way that actually helps us right so

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.050
acceptance States the author is

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.780
something we can learn to do though

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.820
unfortunately it is not something our

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.720
minds can learn to do after all our

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.209
minds are aware of the fact that we are

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.850
reading this right now and in this area

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.480
our minds are not our ally again dude

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.190
for this guy to have sat and figured out

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.080
though like you know his mind is some

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.840
separate thing than him Jesus Christ man

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.120
that's a

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.470
must've been a weird 30 years of this

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.680
guy's life also too I think I said this

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.169
before act is the quickly becoming one

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.370
of the premier therapies of psychedelic

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.050
therapy one of the premier modalities of

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.729
psychedelic therapy which you know you

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.190
start talking about your mind not being

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.690
your allied stuff it's like oh I know

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.729
what you mean brother I know what you

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.290
mean so again that space between you in

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.760
your mind is pretty cool because again

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.680
this is something new part it would be

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.330
like if someone overly identified with

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.389
like they're like you know that Cambrian

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:58.979
period nervous system we talked about

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:00.990
earlier who's like I'm the king of the

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.610
hill CUDA off Mir I'll [ __ ] kill you

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:03.900
that's a part of that's a part of us too

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.160
that's are you know like your nervous

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.889
systems our egos so you can treat your

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.450
mind just like you treat your ego same

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.740
thing just get some space between the

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.540
two there's definitely more to you than

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.389
that also - if you want to learn more

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.400
about this kind of this kind of thing

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.220
but for more of a like psychoanalytic

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.139
perspective check out the denial of

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.840
death it's a really good book they get

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.139
more into this all yet it's very much

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.520
like you know the symbolic self of

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.050
physical self all that stuff but they

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.660
kind of talk about this in terms of like

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.950
people's underlying fear of death and

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.479
how people go and try to do these

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.000
immortality projects and how people want

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.889
to kind of people need like some sort of

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:43.800
like like heat valid hero system they

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.880
can kind of like live their lives

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.380
through and it all has to do again with

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.840
this story of self I'm totally

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.370
butchering the idea of the book but it's

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.930
really cool check it out though they

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.150
talk a lot more about you know just like

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.740
our different aspects of ourselves and

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.930
how you're a lot more we're a lot more

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.760
than we think we are especially what we

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.310
told what we are told we are all right

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.470
so the thought process right now might

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.570
be something like hmm so if I'm not

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.550
willing to be anxious or whatever else

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.970
depressed angry whatever then I will be

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.510
anxious so maybe right so if I'm not

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.700
willing to be this thing I'm gonna

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.860
actively try to avoid being that thing

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.630
and just be more of that thing and so we

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.000
talked abouts experiential avoidance

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.130
right so now we're excited acceptance I

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.440
get this so maybe if I was more willing

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.930
to be anxious I wouldn't be anxious I

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.849
hate being anxious so I guess I could

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:35.039
give that a try I'll try this acceptance

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:36.870
thing so I'm not so anxious and with

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.700
that the thought traps lapse down around

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.860
us a slap stand around us again

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.780
because telling ourselves we accept our

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.449
anxiety our memories or whatever for the

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:47.430
sole purpose of reducing the pain of

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.740
them is yet another avoidance strategy

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.409
god damn it it's not the same as truly

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:55.530
being willing to accept it right is if

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.120
this is tricky man is what I'm talking

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.509
about

00:06:57.509 --> 00:06:59.219
it's why we're that's why we're primered

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:01.379
out it's a fifth coat of primer on this

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:02.960
bad boy right now but that's the thing I

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.159
honestly spent this is really important

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:07.050
I had to read this like five times but I

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.379
did this for years right be like yeah I

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:11.939
mean I guess I can be chill like if I

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:13.590
just be chill I won't be anxious and

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.020
like I'd be so chill and I'd still be so

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.939
anxious and like what the [ __ ] I thought

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:20.849
I was Chu and again it's one of those

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:23.159
things it's you're not being chill or

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:25.409
like again it's forget being chill all

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:29.159
right it's like I was trying still I was

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:32.219
you know trying to avoid anxiety rather

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:34.770
than just feeling it and there was times

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.449
right I did learn that especially like I

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:37.800
used to have wicked anxiety especially

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.379
like prom with anxiety it moves around I

00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:42.930
just had panic attacks when I was 23 and

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.029
then like you know they would morph into

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:47.430
what happened yeah so one for Mike just

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:48.960
out of the blue panic attacks got that

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.520
under control then I'd smoke weed and

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.650
bug out and I kind of like sort of got

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.210
that under control but then it was like

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.770
if I worked out I thought I was gonna

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.240
have a heart attack so like I spent

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.919
years like that where I would like I

00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:01.560
mean I heart my heart rate for like five

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.210
years didn't go over 80 beats a minute

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:06.960
which is not good for you at all but you

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.339
know and this is how this stuff kind of

00:08:08.339 --> 00:08:09.839
creeps in and that's them that was the

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:11.879
master experiential avoidance thing this

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:13.620
is where I like really stand behind this

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.650
is like I got to the point where I had

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:17.909
to start I was like [ __ ] this man I

00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:20.430
can't not be physically active because I

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.060
something I do that makes me feel good

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.199
and I remember I just started going on a

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:26.759
treadmill for like I would I would go on

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:28.409
it for like I swear to God I must look

00:08:28.409 --> 00:08:30.000
like a nutcase dude I would go on for

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.070
like two minutes at the gym and be like

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.690
I'm done that was two minutes I was

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.310
thirty seconds longer than last time and

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:37.769
you know I worked my way up today very

00:08:37.769 --> 00:08:40.440
happily happy to say I ran an entire

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.140
mile today without a you know and this

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.640
you'll see as we get I mean if you just

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.140
held your breath you'll see how your

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.360
mind was kind of like I dude you're

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.770
gonna pass out what are you doing dude

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.300
you're gonna pass out it's like it's

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.730
your mind interfering with something

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:54.690
that just has to do with

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.460
your body man your mind your body in

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.560
terms of breathing hate to break it to

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.930
you does not need your mind doesn't need

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.080
it but our brains just like we're like a

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.600
controlling just like Google don't hey

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.190
Jay check this out it's like dude shut

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.930
up we got this it's like that's your

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.160
butts everyone's brain

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.900
it's just that annoying guy but Google

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.150
what about them but it's like dude shut

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:15.330
up

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.110
we got stuff to do so I'm sorry I'm hype

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.760
I actually have food in me right now so

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.720
I'm [ __ ] hype dude yes the whole

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.550
point of this is like you really I just

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.350
I used to butt heads with people in my

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:29.910
school about this they'd all be like is

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.770
this technically he was the form of

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.930
exposure therapy and exposure therapy

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.580
has been found like I sort of got I

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.710
think it works with like 80% of people

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.750
who try it and then people in my school

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:41.130
be like will cuz they're like my school

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.540
is more of like a psychodynamic bent

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.010
with like you know psychoanalytic well

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.380
like new psychoanalytic cuz like they're

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.360
psycho dynamic but they hate Freud and

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.410
whatever but yeah man it's like when

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.790
you're like you know well let's you know

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.350
let's put a person in the middle of

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.120
street and see what happens you can't do

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.860
that it's like [ __ ] that dude you have

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.750
to you know and it's nice there there's

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.870
room for the relational stuff and just

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.670
building like showing people what it's

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.200
like to like actually deal with an

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.640
empathetic person I do get that and

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.530
there's space for that but like you know

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.420
we're on a time crunch and the rubber

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.770
meets the road it's like the exposure

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.470
therapy in my experience works with

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.420
works really well for certain things you

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.830
know it's not the end-all be-all but

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.260
it's a good thing to have in the old

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.180
tackle box I mean again this is why

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.410
we're getting so many primers sorry for

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.440
the ramble but this stuff isn't so hard

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.600
as it is tricky and subtle like we said

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.580
before you know we're sitting here like

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.140
well if I'm not willing to be anxious

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.450
then I'll be anxious so maybe if I was

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.580
more willing to be anxious I wouldn't be

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.830
anxious I hate being anxious so I guess

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.650
I could give that a try being fake more

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.270
willing to be anxious because I'm just

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.589
trying to not be anxious so I'm not

00:10:46.589 --> 00:10:48.150
really willing to be anxious I'm trying

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.010
to find a loophole doesn't exist dude

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.230
sorry all right so what is this true

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.980
acceptance taking what is offered accept

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.530
comes from the latin root cap array or

00:10:58.530 --> 00:10:59.670
however you however you say that in

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.070
latin probably like you pay it a meaning

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:05.220
take acceptance in a classical sense

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.100
means taking what is offered like I

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.670
accept

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.010
your gifts my liege and a bow though

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.560
sometimes in English acceptance means to

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.290
tolerate or resign yourself this is

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.390
precisely not what we're talking about

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.670
here that's pitching up and we're not

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:23.280
with that we mean something more like

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.350
taking completely in the moment without

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.530
defense it's very different and again I

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.020
guess it is it's subtle still like

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.700
taking something completely in the

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.560
moment is very very different than being

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.010
like fine I guess that's not acceptance

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.530
that's being like I guess I have to and

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:41.730
I have a very I think I have a very good

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.130
example for how to show this and again

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:45.570
acceptance and willingness or the

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.660
opposite of effortful effortful control

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.920
like remember that second dial we talked

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.540
about in the last chapter there's just

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.000
like the overall master pain dial then

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.290
we find the one next to it we're like we

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.900
can't turn the master pain dial down we

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.940
have a little dial we can hit and that's

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.180
our the way we relate to that that you

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.130
know standard pain coming in so we can

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.230
turn alike we can turn our acceptance

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:08.760
all the way up we can't turn the pain

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.890
down but we can jam the acceptance up

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:12.990
that's something within our control and

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:14.070
again here's a difference between the

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.460
two types of acceptance and I first I

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.650
had actually so I put suburban dad

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.570
versus night because I was hoping to

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.580
find a Google image of like a dad

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.350
getting bitched out in a grocery store

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.630
nobody's captured one in the wild so

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.100
this is the best two pictures I could

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.920
get so the first pictures is a picture

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.690
of a knight just soared in ground it's

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.220
so [ __ ] sick dude I love fantasy

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.260
medieval artwork but he's just like

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.790
kneeling down and there's a [ __ ]

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.890
dragon like obviously loading up some

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:42.090
fire behind them didn't even notice that

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.250
the first time that's the acceptance

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:45.930
word I mean it sounds kind of grim like

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:47.580
fire but a dragon about to destroy you

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.320
but this is a [ __ ] where it's like you

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.750
know that guy at night there's no you

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:52.890
know in that picture that's more of like

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:55.500
I'm giving this my all this [ __ ] is

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.840
[ __ ] up and scary but god damn it I

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.340
just accept it all and this guy's

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.690
probably about to grab a sword out of

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.490
the dirt maybe we'll [ __ ] the dragon up

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.960
maybe he'll die doesn't matter because

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.730
always doing is doing his best now that

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:07.410
scene though he's like this is hard the

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.450
cards are stacked against me I accept

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:11.790
that and I'm gonna move on the picture

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.710
below that is a against I couldn't find

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.090
a suburban dad getting bitched out I

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.640
found a picture of a dude who's wearing

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.370
a shirt if you look at the shirt here

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.649
you'll see it's a guy standing with

00:13:22.649 --> 00:13:24.209
like this kind of like dazed and

00:13:24.209 --> 00:13:26.910
confused look on his face a t-shirt of

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.490
his girlfriend's face blown up really

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.350
big on his t-shirt while his girlfriend

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.449
stands next to him and smiles and if you

00:13:33.449 --> 00:13:34.619
can actually look at the shirt it says

00:13:34.619 --> 00:13:36.209
if you're reading this you are too close

00:13:36.209 --> 00:13:39.119
I have a girlfriend that's not the

00:13:39.119 --> 00:13:40.350
acceptance we're talking about dude

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.569
that's bitching up we did they you know

00:13:42.569 --> 00:13:44.369
it's like well I guess you know happy

00:13:44.369 --> 00:13:47.369
wife happy life [ __ ] that dude no that's

00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:49.110
not real it's not a real thing you can't

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.480
just be like well I mean if I just put

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.069
all of her needs first I'll be happy no

00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:54.240
you won't you become resentful and

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.610
become bitter and you know that dude I

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:58.019
don't know what happened with those I

00:13:58.019 --> 00:14:00.110
mean hopefully it's a joke but that

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.129
that's not the exceptions we're talking

00:14:02.129 --> 00:14:03.029
about we're talking about night in

00:14:03.029 --> 00:14:05.490
battle not some [ __ ] [ __ ] web dude

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.110
with the chicks his girlfriend's picture

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.730
on her shirt and whatever you know

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.319
however that goes for the other

00:14:10.319 --> 00:14:13.670
situations in terms of boys and girls

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:16.709
so willingness and acceptance mean to

00:14:16.709 --> 00:14:18.839
actively respond to your feelings by

00:14:18.839 --> 00:14:21.300
feeling them right that's what that's

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.529
all it is it's pretty simple but it's

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:25.379
just subtle so you you get a feeling you

00:14:25.379 --> 00:14:26.970
get a you know like a ho man I feel

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.759
nervous feel that literally as much as

00:14:29.759 --> 00:14:31.769
you might reach out and feel the texture

00:14:31.769 --> 00:14:34.709
of a cashmere sweater right it means to

00:14:34.709 --> 00:14:36.839
respond actively to your thoughts by

00:14:36.839 --> 00:14:38.970
thinking them just as you might read

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.339
poetry to get the flow of the words or

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:43.199
an actor might rehearse the lines to get

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:45.540
the playwrights intent that's this is

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.920
this is the you know we went through the

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.959
last one of like just kind of notice

00:14:48.959 --> 00:14:50.939
right that was a thing for last one I

00:14:50.939 --> 00:14:51.990
know there's not a lot of space between

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:54.480
them but it's like you know you can take

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.589
as much time as you want to practice

00:14:55.589 --> 00:14:56.999
these things I'm just I'm just throwing

00:14:56.999 --> 00:14:58.230
them in your little informational

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:02.939
universe so it's like you know get start

00:15:02.939 --> 00:15:04.470
small start with just kind of trying to

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.089
notice things you know without kind of

00:15:06.089 --> 00:15:07.709
totally fusing with it and then once you

00:15:07.709 --> 00:15:09.929
kind of get the hang of this you know

00:15:09.929 --> 00:15:12.240
I'll get the hang of that I mean start

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.439
to actually feel it man if you feel

00:15:13.439 --> 00:15:15.749
angry like you know Hulk out just be you

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:17.100
don't try not to break anything but like

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.769
and I say feel it I mean located in your

00:15:19.769 --> 00:15:22.139
body you get angry try to feel where it

00:15:22.139 --> 00:15:24.029
starts and stops you'll we'll see this

00:15:24.029 --> 00:15:26.790
later on obviously but feel it see where

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.350
it starts and stops in your body and

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:29.999
just try to like you know try to go with

00:15:29.999 --> 00:15:31.199
it especially this is a big thing

00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:34.139
actually I'll get into that later I'm

00:15:34.139 --> 00:15:35.639
giving myself acid reflux I say too much

00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:37.129
I started talking

00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:39.600
yes this is what is it hopefully this

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.389
makes sense all right so and again

00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:44.579
here's some more metaphors the author

00:15:44.579 --> 00:15:48.119
gave us all right so the idea here is

00:15:48.119 --> 00:15:50.730
being the sky not the clouds the ocean

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.619
not the waves right this is what

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:54.239
acceptance and willingness is all about

00:15:54.239 --> 00:15:55.829
and you know they haven't getting in

00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:57.600
touch with that more expansive sense of

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.129
self rather than just kind of like this

00:15:59.129 --> 00:16:02.489
you know doomed medieval peasant on like

00:16:02.489 --> 00:16:04.529
Fortuna's we owe like why is this

00:16:04.529 --> 00:16:06.119
happening to me it's like whoa what

00:16:06.119 --> 00:16:08.279
whatever I'll get into that

00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:10.019
all right so acceptance and willingness

00:16:10.019 --> 00:16:12.269
allow us to open the windows and blinds

00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:14.790
of our proverbial house letting light in

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.339
life flow through what was once closed

00:16:17.339 --> 00:16:19.679
and dark and yes maybe someone might see

00:16:19.679 --> 00:16:21.269
your penis when you open the blinds but

00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:22.319
at least there will be Sun on your

00:16:22.319 --> 00:16:24.779
teenis which who knows may even puff it

00:16:24.779 --> 00:16:25.259
up a bit

00:16:25.259 --> 00:16:28.259
summer bird is a real thing and I'm just

00:16:28.259 --> 00:16:29.790
saying come August I'm actually kind of

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.859
proud of myself you know at least more

00:16:31.859 --> 00:16:33.749
than I usually am or you know at all I

00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:36.089
should say anyway I really shouldn't do

00:16:36.089 --> 00:16:42.029
these live this isn't about feeling

00:16:42.029 --> 00:16:43.769
better right this isn't about feeling

00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:47.389
better this is about feeling better

00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:49.529
embracing the moment for what it is

00:16:49.529 --> 00:16:52.259
rather than what we'd like it to be

00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:56.369
right hopefully that makes sense it's

00:16:56.369 --> 00:16:58.739
not so much about getting us getting

00:16:58.739 --> 00:17:01.439
right but instead of getting whole right

00:17:01.439 --> 00:17:02.759
we're never gonna and then we'll do this

00:17:02.759 --> 00:17:04.110
and then everything will be awesome it's

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:06.779
like no no we're gonna try to form some

00:17:06.779 --> 00:17:09.289
kind of complete picture of ourselves

00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:11.490
right is that good or bad it's just

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:14.399
whole am i actualized am i in touch with

00:17:14.399 --> 00:17:17.309
myself there's no end goal this is just

00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:20.370
already moving in a good direction right

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:22.169
this is us gearing up to move through

00:17:22.169 --> 00:17:23.990
the swamps of our personal history

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:26.250
feelings and thoughts since these swamps

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.350
tend to lie directly between us and what

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:30.860
we find valuable tell me that's wrong

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.580
there's something I want a promotion

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.070
won't [ __ ] ask your boss no nervous

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.490
well that's a swamp dude you know people

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:39.870
I you know they want to start dating

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.360
when is this all this stuff it's like

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.100
yeah dude that's a big time swamp man

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.720
the fear rejection all that stuff people

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.159
I know a lot of people I wanted to stand

00:17:47.159 --> 00:17:48.899
up it's like [ __ ] dude that's a

00:17:48.899 --> 00:17:49.630
never-ending [ __ ]

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:54.040
swamp good luck alright so in order to

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.930
make this treacherous journey we need to

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:58.630
cultivate a sense of expansiveness one

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:00.910
where again like I said we are we are

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.070
the sky not the clouds the ocean not the

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.050
waves again these are the all this is

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:06.820
the authors of verbiage I like it a lot

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.490
I'm just not trying to steal a man's

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:11.680
poetic prowess you know and again take

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.970
note of this if you find you know what

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:14.140
are you thinking like if you find your

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.450
mind agreeing or resisting this or just

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:18.340
like with the foot just thank your mind

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:19.630
for the thought you don't need it right

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:21.150
now I mean it you know this sounds

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.410
suspect if I turn your mind off but it's

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.060
like you don't turn it off pay attention

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.890
what you're thinking but just try to get

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.900
in the habit of like notice you're

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.460
thinking something like thanks mine

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.070
appreciate the appreciate the memo and

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.870
it's keep on man right your mind's

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:36.850
welcome to come along for the ride but

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:38.710
willingness and acceptance are states of

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:40.570
being that our analytical minds can

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.510
never learn to achieve just they just

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:46.540
can't luckily there's more to us than

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:49.120
our minds all right and this is for

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.650
people who are still down some people

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.570
need like the scientific stuff too you

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:54.280
know I'll give it to the author man he's

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.740
sitting with like the poetic kind of

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.200
like symbolically stuff and now he's

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.120
gonna hit you with the scientific

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.920
literature alright so how does this

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.570
really work meaning with science and

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:06.610
stuff alright so willingness again the

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:08.500
exact opposite of experiential avoidance

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.630
has been shown clinically to help with a

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:13.480
very broad range of issues and yet the

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.440
author was like you know I could have

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.900
done a book on substance abuse of

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.370
relationships everything he's like but

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.700
this this set of skills that again

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.840
willingness and acceptance against

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.880
acceptance and commitment therapy so

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.650
this first piece the acceptance piece is

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:28.990
a primary and important part of

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:30.190
psychological flexibility because

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:31.840
without really the acceptance it's like

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.610
how do you learn to diffuse and all this

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:35.140
other stuff and how you know without the

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.310
mindfulness really you can have the

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:37.780
acceptance and you know it's all kind of

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:41.830
interrelated so you know the author does

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.690
a much more thorough job of doing the

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:44.680
scientific literature if you're

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.270
interested read the book but I'm gonna

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.200
give you the rundown

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.120
so with physical pain right they took a

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.340
bunch of studies in almost every area of

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.130
chronic pain the actual injury or damage

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:56.410
bears almost no relation to the amount

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:58.450
of pain reduced functioning and

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.610
disability the relationship between

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:03.010
amount of pain and functioning is also

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:03.520
weak

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.680
what predicts functioning is a a

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.110
willingness to experience pain and B

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:11.440
ability to act in a value direction now

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.610
of course if you're in if you're in a

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.650
ton of [ __ ] pain yeah obviously

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.540
you're gonna be kind of held up but what

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:17.770
they're saying even if you're even

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.180
people taking people who are in a ton of

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.620
pain if you if you keep that at one

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.990
category who can move the most it's

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:24.730
these people who are willing to

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.350
experience the pain for what it is and

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:29.470
are able to act in a value direction

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:31.480
right and this is all about like if you

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.390
read the book a Buddha brain they talked

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:36.850
about this this idea of two darts like

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:38.860
if your shoulder hurts or like say like

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.300
you I you like today I was running my

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.700
knee hurt right so I hurt my knee my

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:43.990
knees kind of not really feeling that

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:46.030
good the whole time I'm running you know

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.500
my knee actually hurts I can't take that

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.580
away that's just something that's

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.210
occurring

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.580
so that's imagine one dart just right in

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.650
my knee and then the second dart would

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.080
be me being like oh my knee hurts how I

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.550
hate the fact that my knee hurts why

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.220
does this stuff always happen to me

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.570
that's a second dart that I'm putting in

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.040
myself that doesn't necessarily need to

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.230
be there so think of it that way

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:06.850
for another category physical trauma

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.070
disease and disability and head injuries

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.200
spinal injury heart attack and other

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.750
areas of physical illness or injury the

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.030
degree of physical pathology is a very

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:18.220
poor predictor of rehabilitation success

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.760
and long term disability

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.650
what is predictive is the patient's

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:25.090
acceptance of the condition and

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.770
willingness to take responsibility for

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.400
her or his predicament and I think like

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.720
I said I think this has to do more with

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.030
like you know in physical trauma where

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.370
there is a possibility of kind of

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.200
regaining you know being able to walk

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.690
again bla bla bla and I think this is

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:42.670
kind of you know spinal injury heart

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.260
attack I think this is kind of clear

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.450
it's like if you can just like actually

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:48.460
own the fact that that thing happened

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.450
like there's some people like say you

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:51.430
have a heart attack you just don't want

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.830
to act like it happen that was a glitch

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:55.660
you know that was a fluke it's like now

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.790
dude like you need to kind of own up to

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:58.990
the fact that like you know what

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:00.360
happened again if it's just like a

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.860
underlying heart condition fine but you

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.570
still need to own up to the fact you

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:06.640
know accept the fact that you have a

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.450
heart condition

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.540
and then try to like say like you know

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.980
take some sort of responsibility for the

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.420
predicament where it's like you know own

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.190
up to it or not like say if you're born

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:16.510
with a heart defect just on you know

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:17.660
it's my fault it's all your

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.820
it's justyou know that's me if you can

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:22.400
accept that that's the case it kind of

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.550
makes everything easier so again with

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.320
anxiety unwillingness to have anxiety

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.720
predict having anxiety in many different

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.330
forms when exposed to the same levels of

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.880
physiological arousal you know we'll do

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.020
a people who are scared to having panic

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:39.440
attacks for exposure therapy just like

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.850
like I was saying they'll make them do

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:43.100
cardio just like you want to get the

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.540
heart rate up anything that kind of

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:47.030
mimics a panic response or but the other

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:48.890
they make people breathe in co2 as well

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:50.660
if you you know you can get you can do

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.820
you know you can run or you just breathe

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.800
in co2 and the co2 will instantly jack

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.770
up your heart rate so again

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.030
so in exposed to the same levels of

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.920
physiological arousal through cardio or

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.410
co2 experiential avoiders are more

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:05.480
likely to feel panic to those who

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.690
willingly accept it right because again

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:10.700
it's like it's subjective it's like you

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.980
know you can get someone's heart rate up

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.400
it's like panic is something that like

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.830
you can measure biologically but you can

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:20.630
have someone at 140 beats a minute two

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.790
people at 140 beats a minute one's gonna

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.680
be like I'm 10 to 10 I'm 10 out of 10 on

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.910
panic and the other person who could

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.770
just be like my heart's racing you know

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:29.570
I mean so it's like this is again this

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:30.980
is an internal event your heart rate

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.170
goes up sure your heart rate went up but

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:34.910
like how do you perceive it and then

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:36.380
what does that kind of what chain of

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:37.850
events is that set off in your head and

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:38.750
that's what they're talking about if

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:39.920
you're willing to just accept the fact

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.930
that your heart rates up and this what I

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:43.730
was talking about before this is why

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:46.130
they say like your analytical mind

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.650
doesn't it hits its limit here because

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.710
your analytical mind isn't meant to

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:53.180
monitor and run your heart that's a

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.830
whole different part of your body this

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:56.210
is what I was saying with the analytical

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:57.650
mind trying to overstep its boundaries

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.720
mean like well let's make sure I mean I

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.970
heard one time about a guy who did you

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:03.770
know he do this thing and like you

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:05.060
probably had it hard I think I heard

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.200
about the guy had a heart attack I don't

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.700
know but like you know that's where it's

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.080
kind of like dude let your body do its

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.460
thing your analytical mind does not need

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.410
to be here trying to like Apple watch

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:16.790
your whole body no need for that yeah so

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:17.660
this is particularly true of

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.520
experiential avoiders who are actively

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.380
trying to control their anxiety

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.080
sensations I'm feeling anxious well if I

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.000
rub my chest I'll feel better I better

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.680
yawn to get a deep breath all that stuff

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.600
and also just ten minutes of acceptance

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.450
training made panic disorder

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:33.580
people more able to face anxiety or

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:35.320
training and distraction and suppression

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:39.159
were found not helpful why because the

00:24:39.159 --> 00:24:41.110
distraction and suppression are an

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:44.710
avoidance method now again I'm really

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:46.330
hammering of all the examples but they

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:48.100
put a ton of them in the book child

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.289
abuse and trauma childhood abuse

00:24:50.289 --> 00:24:52.570
predicts distress to a degree but the

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:54.549
practice of willingness mediates that

00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:56.919
relationship if you are unwilling to

00:24:56.919 --> 00:24:58.510
experience the memories thoughts and

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.549
feelings childhood produces you get

00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:02.679
stuck with chronic distress as an adult

00:25:02.679 --> 00:25:05.409
however if you are willing to experience

00:25:05.409 --> 00:25:06.730
those thoughts memories and feelings

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:09.130
again the same abuse history is

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:10.960
significantly less destructive in your

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.090
life you know and again with that one

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:16.000
the caveat is like dude there's no you

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.730
know easy road for complex childhood

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.169
trauma you know that's in it they even

00:25:20.169 --> 00:25:21.909
talked about in the book of like you

00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:23.230
know even people who like the most

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:24.490
heinous thing you can think of people

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:25.870
who got molested or you know stuff of

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:27.730
that level it's like yeah nobody's

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:29.289
saying that's like all dude mind over

00:25:29.289 --> 00:25:31.090
matter bro it's like no no no it's like

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:35.380
not at all it's a very real and horrific

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:39.039
thing for anyone to go through and what

00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:40.899
they're saying is is the fact that like

00:25:40.899 --> 00:25:43.179
you know again this is where like the

00:25:43.179 --> 00:25:44.679
rubber meets the road you know it's like

00:25:44.679 --> 00:25:47.080
yeah that's horrible it's [ __ ] up and

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.090
you know death to whoever did any of

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:52.960
that [ __ ] but if you are unwilling to

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.230
just like you know process those those

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:58.990
experiences and memories on some level

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:00.669
and in some time you know should do this

00:26:00.669 --> 00:26:02.080
just on your own time you don't you

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.309
shouldn't have to be forced to rush this

00:26:03.309 --> 00:26:07.240
but if you don't fully process that and

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.380
they found to just by like writing

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.940
things down it moves it from one area

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.350
one area of your brain like your

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.450
amygdala that like perceives threat over

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:15.010
to like the area that kind of processes

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:16.750
language it's where like when you move a

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:18.429
thing out of your amygdala it has less

00:26:18.429 --> 00:26:20.769
kind of puppet master control of like

00:26:20.769 --> 00:26:22.380
your heart rate perspiration and that

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:26.139
it's less easily it less easily gets

00:26:26.139 --> 00:26:27.760
under your skin when you that's when me

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.200
my process a thing get it out of your

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.659
amygdala you know that's why with the

00:26:31.659 --> 00:26:33.010
eat with narrative exposure therapy

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:34.389
they'll have somebody like you know

00:26:34.389 --> 00:26:37.000
these are like rape victims man who will

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.769
just retell the tale and you know people

00:26:38.769 --> 00:26:40.539
have had happen to you that's that's

00:26:40.539 --> 00:26:42.190
[ __ ] horrible and I bet they're just

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:43.720
like ah Jesus Christ dude I don't wanna

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.840
think about that

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.120
but that's that's the experience still

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.190
living in that amygdala and by people

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:50.899
again this you know this found will work

00:26:50.899 --> 00:26:53.090
for like 80% of people you go in and you

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:54.710
just tell the story over and over and

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:56.179
over and over every week to the point

00:26:56.179 --> 00:26:58.700
where like you've told it so much you've

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.320
been able to kind of push that kind of

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.999
you processed it through the threat

00:27:01.999 --> 00:27:03.980
assessment center of your brain and into

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.330
kind of like more of like your personal

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:06.529
history where you can think about it

00:27:06.529 --> 00:27:08.539
without it spiking up your adrenaline

00:27:08.539 --> 00:27:10.639
and all that other horrible [ __ ] so

00:27:10.639 --> 00:27:12.799
again this isn't easy this isn't like oh

00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:14.720
they'll just do this it's really hard

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.639
and horrible and feels bad that's the

00:27:16.639 --> 00:27:18.379
point of this this isn't like a quick

00:27:18.379 --> 00:27:21.200
cure-all you know panacea thing this is

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.539
like we're gonna veer right through a

00:27:23.539 --> 00:27:26.179
thorn bush but after that you know we're

00:27:26.179 --> 00:27:31.999
going to feel better man what else does

00:27:31.999 --> 00:27:33.289
okay so if we're willing to experience

00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:35.539
with thoughts memories and feelings the

00:27:35.539 --> 00:27:37.429
same abuse histories sniffing and less

00:27:37.429 --> 00:27:38.990
destructive all right cover that sorry I

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:40.490
had a just cuz I don't want to just like

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:41.899
gloss over that kind of stuff and be

00:27:41.899 --> 00:27:44.570
like whatever dude tough it up it's not

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:47.119
like that but at the same point there is

00:27:47.119 --> 00:27:49.279
a point where it like or the same point

00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:51.740
there's a thing that has to be said

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.720
where it's like but it has to be faced

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.549
at some point otherwise and it's not

00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:57.139
like you know like you need to grow up

00:27:57.139 --> 00:27:58.279
it's like no no otherwise it just

00:27:58.279 --> 00:27:59.840
rattles around in your head and tortures

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.519
you so I was like you know let's kind of

00:28:01.519 --> 00:28:03.769
push that little turd out and get it

00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:05.559
where it belongs

00:28:05.559 --> 00:28:07.549
alright more science stuff draw

00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:08.629
performance people who are emotionally

00:28:08.629 --> 00:28:10.100
willing to experience a negative

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.769
emotional experiences that's a tongue

00:28:12.769 --> 00:28:15.019
twister okay people are more emotionally

00:28:15.019 --> 00:28:17.149
willing to experience negative emotional

00:28:17.149 --> 00:28:19.009
experiences enjoy better mental health

00:28:19.009 --> 00:28:21.259
and do better work overtime the effect

00:28:21.259 --> 00:28:22.759
is significantly greater than the

00:28:22.759 --> 00:28:25.639
effects of job satisfaction or emotional

00:28:25.639 --> 00:28:27.470
intelligence pretty simple

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:29.450
substance abuse substance abuse is

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:31.220
typically motivated by an attempt to

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.350
avoid negative private events and

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:35.779
experiences the more substance abusers

00:28:35.779 --> 00:28:37.369
believe that drugs reduce their negative

00:28:37.369 --> 00:28:39.230
emotions the more likely they are to

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:41.869
relapse alright again that's the

00:28:41.869 --> 00:28:43.610
ultimate you know one of the ultimate I

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.350
would say experiential avoidance is it's

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:48.710
like let me just get [ __ ] up and you

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:50.029
know and it doesn't work but again it's

00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:52.820
one of those things where if a substance

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.509
abuser you know someone on drugs isn't

00:28:55.509 --> 00:28:58.730
like trying to avoid negative private

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:00.200
if they're going right into them they're

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.390
way less likely to use drugs because

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:04.250
they're not trying to using drugs

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:05.930
typically helps people avoid them you

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:07.730
know and I say drugs I'm not obviously

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:09.650
hold I hold say you can abuse

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:10.850
psychedelics but I hold them in a

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:12.590
different class and I also don't like

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:14.300
separating drugs and alcohol they always

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.680
say that oh between drugs and alcohol

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.390
alcohol is a [ __ ] drug I hate when

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:19.940
people separate that it's how it has to

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.250
be a pretty hard drug - honestly means

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:27.170
it's flammable anyway um yeah so again

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:28.160
this is one of those things if you're

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.750
going through the [ __ ] if you're willing

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.250
to go you know what rather than running

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:32.840
from the [ __ ] I'm going head-on into it

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.190
it's like you know maybe you'll get

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:35.420
halfway into the [ __ ] in heck [ __ ] it

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.670
I'm getting high [ __ ] you dude that's an

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:38.840
improvement just you know try not to

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.880
overdose and die but you know stop doing

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.400
that [ __ ] anyway in depression finally

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:46.160
sorry up to half of the variations and

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.570
the symptoms of depression can be

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:49.700
accounted for by a lack of acceptance

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:52.010
and willingness I mean that sounds may

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:53.300
be a little hazy but it's kind of clear

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.010
you know if you're sitting there going

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:58.100
like why me and if only I did this if

00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.840
it's like that's oppression in a

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.610
nutshell it's you know it's sort a lot

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:03.200
of this I should say depressive thinking

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.640
is of like why me

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.310
I oh I can't move I can't do this and

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:08.480
it's like yeah man that [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.990
sucks but you know again same thing you

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:13.430
got it it sucks

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:14.750
everyone should honor that it sucks a

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:16.220
good thing too for people who are so

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.780
depressed I can't get out of bed I came

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:20.500
across this thing called micro movements

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.520
we're like you know you're in bed the

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.690
thought of getting out of bed is just

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:25.100
like totally overwhelming you're like

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.100
there's no way I cannot physically get

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.680
my entire body all the way out of bed

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.960
it's like well try micro movements well

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.070
you're like yeah I can't get my body out

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:36.170
of bed but I think I can move my fingers

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:38.090
just one even a pinky just twitch your

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.370
pinky all right which my pinky now try

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:42.530
my fingers you know I got my fingers

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:44.180
going here let me go a little elbow pop

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:46.550
and then it's like okay and then once

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:47.960
you get a couple little micro movements

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.190
you start moving your upper body and

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:50.390
like I think I can get the rest of it

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:51.830
out so you ever struggling get out of

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:52.430
bed try that out

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:54.500
I initially belong for more and more

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.240
pages and touch on a bunch of more areas

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.160
but no this scientific literature is

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.810
filled with evidence that the person's

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:01.730
willingness to experience whatever

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:03.440
emotion is present is of central

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.280
importance to many areas of human

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.110
physiological and psychological

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:10.550
functioning and I say the scientific

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:12.100
literature I am speak

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.570
basically the the dude who wrote this

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:16.880
book who actually read like multiple

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.160
meta-analyses and conducted them he's

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.510
saying this I hate when people say oh

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:22.040
the scientific literature is like dude

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.810
what what did you which one what did you

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:24.950
read you know whatever

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:27.920
it's my sticking point just for me

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.620
losing arguments on ready all right so

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.380
why willingness right you know we tried

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.480
the science thing you know yeah whatever

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.940
signs saying not really here's first

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:38.390
hand

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:40.010
here's first hand accounts of the like

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:42.230
some of these guys actual patients you

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:43.340
know he asked them like well why

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.080
willingness what do you guys think of

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.490
people who have actually gone through

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:50.630
act or whatever so the one one of the

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:51.860
answers was because you know why

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.690
willingness because when I'm struggling

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:55.640
against my painful experiences the

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.380
struggle seems to make them all more

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.270
painful that goes back to the two dark

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:00.710
thing I'm saying like again if your leg

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:02.390
hurts and you're also thinking about how

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:04.100
much it sucks that your leg hurts that's

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:05.840
two separate parts of pain you know the

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:10.580
other one you can not do why willingness

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.980
because when I move away from the pain

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.020
that I meet when I'm pursuing what I

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.060
value most I also move away from the

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.070
richness of life that those value that

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:22.700
those valued actions bring to me because

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.170
my experience tells me that being

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:25.790
unwilling just doesn't work pretty

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:28.610
simple because it is a normal human

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:30.950
process to feel pain and it is inhumane

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:32.870
and unloving to try to hold yourself to

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:35.230
a different standard good answer as well

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:37.970
because living in my experience that is

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:39.740
in the moment seems potentially more

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.930
rewarding than living in my mind yep

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:44.900
because I absolutely absolutely know how

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.940
pain works when I'm unwilling and I am

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.770
sick and tired of it it's time to change

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:50.930
my whole agenda not just the moves

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:53.030
inside of a control and avoidance agenda

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:54.770
very good point turn when you start

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:56.300
really thinking about that just like how

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.980
many moves you just make inside of a

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.020
control and avoidance agenda and that's

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.060
you know spend [ __ ] 30-something

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.200
years doing that and you're just you

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.790
start being like this [ __ ] is [ __ ]

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:06.410
impossible I've tried everything it's

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:09.050
like well yeah because you're moving

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:10.760
within a control and avoidance agenda

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.830
but like what if you actually

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:14.810
revolutionized your entire psychological

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:17.540
outlook and again it's not that hard

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.010
it's just this [ __ ] is not on anyone's

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:20.510
rate for the most part this is not on

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:23.930
people's radar part of what I want to do

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:25.170
I forget this set up

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:27.120
go into high schools and just deliver

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.530
these same presentations obviously I

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:29.910
can't talk about like penises and [ __ ]

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:31.740
but it's like they should be teaching

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.690
this in health class dude like rather

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:35.220
than talking about like like here's

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.170
[ __ ] herpes I would look at it laughs

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:39.420
and like still we're all dog and dude

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:40.830
you know it's not like it's like yeah

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:42.179
herby sucks but I'm not gonna get them

00:33:42.179 --> 00:33:43.559
but if you're teaching people this [ __ ]

00:33:43.559 --> 00:33:44.910
you know I think this would be honestly

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:46.650
be more helpful and not letting people

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:48.990
get like you know STDs whatever they're

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:50.400
trying to do with health class health

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.630
class I don't even know the point of it

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:55.679
um all right sorry I'm [ __ ] flying

00:33:55.679 --> 00:33:56.910
dude I'm trying this done so I cooked

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:59.309
ahead all right so this is about and

00:33:59.309 --> 00:34:00.600
this is another you know just again

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.940
hammering this acceptance thing back

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.230
again you know and don't forget to you

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:05.340
held your breath and if you haven't held

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:06.750
your breath yet pause this and hold your

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:08.010
breath for as long as you can just come

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:10.580
back in alright please do that

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:14.129
alright so Brown universe and I mean

00:34:14.129 --> 00:34:15.300
that cuz we're about to do the second

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.830
round of breath holding now and you need

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:18.990
if you know it just really it's a really

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:20.550
cool thing to kind of do this exercise

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:22.889
the way they have it all right so Brown

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:25.080
University psychologist Rick brown which

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.580
hilarious

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.500
recently demonstrated that people who

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.179
cannot make room for their distressing

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:31.710
feelings have a very hard time with

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:34.500
self-control obviously because they're

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.909
they need to control themselves you know

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:37.169
it's 20 like they want to control

00:34:37.169 --> 00:34:38.310
themselves so therefore they have no

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.970
self-control

00:34:38.970 --> 00:34:40.830
he demonstrated this working with a

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:42.899
group of chronic smokers who were trying

00:34:42.899 --> 00:34:45.330
to quit by using a self-help book but

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:47.159
before they started Brown had all of

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:50.040
them do three tasks I can't say tasks I

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.109
can never say that word so he had them

00:34:52.109 --> 00:34:53.609
hold their breath for as long as

00:34:53.609 --> 00:34:54.300
possible

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.340
solve simple book confusing math

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:58.109
problems faster and faster until they

00:34:58.109 --> 00:35:00.780
gave up and breathe carbon dioxide which

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:02.340
again like I said creates anxiety

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.350
symptoms until they tapped out so like

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:05.970
everyone did the self-help book it

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:07.500
wasn't so much about the book it was

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.060
about like you know what are these

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:11.490
people's personal constitutions as it

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:14.190
relates to I mean I guess this is kind

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:15.930
of resilience like you know how much can

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:17.430
people take how much will people put on

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:20.119
themselves before they tap out

00:35:20.119 --> 00:35:22.830
so again holding your breath for as long

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:24.240
as possible you already did that it's

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.040
kind of tough solving simple but

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.780
confusing math problems faster faster

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:29.460
that one act I'd rather hold my breath

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.410
till I passed out than have someone make

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:32.820
me do math problems faster and faster

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:34.260
I'd give up immediately on that one and

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.119
then again breathing carbon dioxide

00:35:36.119 --> 00:35:37.020
sounds [ __ ] terrified

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.820
it's like the opposite of that thing I

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:39.840
don't know if you ever been to the New

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.070
Jersey boardwalk but they have like

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:44.580
these to have like an oxygen bar or some

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:47.040
[ __ ] psycho would hook up oxygen

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.570
tanks to people and let them like get

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:50.550
kind of dizzy but a mat if it I kind of

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:51.960
want to start a co2 tank where you just

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.600
give it to people in a [ __ ] bug I'm

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.010
sorry so in other words if you cannot

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:57.510
feel you too stressful you're stressing

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:58.080
feelings

00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.880
you cannot take proper care of your own

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.970
health right so no wonder experiential

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:04.950
avoidance predicts a gradual worsening

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:07.290
quality of life over time think about

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:09.270
that I couldn't feel the distressing

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:11.370
feeling that was my crazy thought that I

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:12.570
was like ooh I'm gonna give myself I'm

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:13.680
gonna be that guy who has a heart attack

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.360
and needs to get the [ __ ] Frankenstein

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.660
[ __ ] in my chest I was again that's not

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.070
for my body to think it's not for my

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:21.780
mind it's not a problem with my

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.090
analytical mind if like you know again

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:25.560
if I'm if I'm having heart problems

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.630
you'll know you're breathing will be

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:28.920
[ __ ] up and you know there's always a

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.060
story about like it what about the guy

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:31.650
who's like running a marathon its heart

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:34.110
exploded it's like yeah man that happens

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:36.750
but like I just never gonna run average

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:38.910
yeah you know I mean so again your

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:40.530
analytical mind you can only get you so

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.990
far it's a good tool but it's just part

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:44.430
of a Swiss Army knife man it's this

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:45.900
isn't a [ __ ] butterfly knife it's a

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:49.740
Swiss Army knife right take that one to

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.260
the bank so again you cannot feel your

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.210
distressing feelings it's hard I should

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:56.190
say maybe not cannot but it's infinitely

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:57.540
harder to take proper care of your own

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:01.320
health all right so we're gonna do this

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.460
again we're gonna hold our breath again

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:05.670
right this time we have actual tricks to

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:08.130
do that we'll see what happens we'll see

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:10.620
if we hold our breath longer spoiler I

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:14.550
did alright so let's try to hold our

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:15.870
breath again this time using our new

00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:18.450
mental technology of acceptance again

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:20.390
don't do this if you're driving please

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:22.440
alright so same thing is the first time

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.290
only now read these things below first

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:27.420
or listen to them wait until you have a

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:28.920
good understanding of a few of these

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.360
principles and then pause your screen

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.750
when I click the start button or just do

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:35.160
this and turn your sound office again

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:36.390
you can watch the end of it if you are

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:38.100
watching this right now you can always

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.260
watch the end of it later cuz again I'm

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:42.270
live again alright that's why the [ __ ]

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:45.380
is so [ __ ] wild and organized

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.190
alright and again I'm gonna read these

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:49.050
or get a sense of them and if you want

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:50.730
to watch this along with me if you

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:51.840
watching this along with me I'll keep

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:55.260
the slides up on the next when I when I

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.000
click go if you're watching this right

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.830
now the slides will actually be up and

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:00.090
I'll just I'll just stay on here for a

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:01.800
couple minutes and just [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.250
around alright so here we go alright so

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:06.300
the rules will be up in the next slide

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.830
all right so here's things to keep in

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:09.330
your head while you do this when the

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:11.760
urge to breathe become stronger try to

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.800
notice exactly where the urge to breathe

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.800
begins and ends in your body locate this

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:20.790
urge to breathe physically feel it right

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:21.930
this is what we're talking about we all

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:23.430
talk this [ __ ] about acceptance

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:24.630
now you're gonna accept the fact that

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:26.010
you can't breathe right and there's one

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:27.690
thing in here it's so it works so

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.930
[ __ ] well try to just let that

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:32.730
physical feeling be there

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:34.859
turning the acceptance dial all the way

00:38:34.859 --> 00:38:37.740
up locate the feeling and then just let

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:40.680
it be there right third notice any

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:41.220
thoughts

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.740
thank your mind for them and continue

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.359
holding your breath we don't need our

00:38:45.359 --> 00:38:47.190
analytical minds we do not need them

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:48.420
right now they're gonna tell you watch

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:50.550
it's really funny it says watch out for

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:52.109
sneaky thoughts that can lead to

00:38:52.109 --> 00:38:54.270
breathing before you decide it's time

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:57.210
and your your brain just starts freaking

00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:59.660
out dude it's like well but but but

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:02.880
you'll say umm I do already have it

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.040
notice any emotions that emerge other

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.359
than the urge to breathe your body

00:39:06.359 --> 00:39:08.520
contain air if your body contains other

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.530
sensations you know notice how your body

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:12.330
like you'll get it in emotion and then

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:14.400
notice the other sensations you get as

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.080
your body just continues to function and

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.330
as the urge to breathe become stronger

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:20.609
imagine you were continuously creating

00:39:20.609 --> 00:39:22.200
that urge deliberately this is my like

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.580
one of my favorite one so kind of

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:24.869
glossed over that's the first time I did

00:39:24.869 --> 00:39:26.730
it and tried it again and was like oh

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:28.680
that makes a big difference so again

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.750
really listen to this as the urge to

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:33.240
breathe become stronger imagine that you

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.010
are continuously creating that urge

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:37.650
deliberately close your eyes and see if

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:39.359
you can replicate this urge in your

00:39:39.359 --> 00:39:41.730
imagination divorced from your body I

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:43.560
tried that I don't know I had no luck

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.060
with that buddy just try it it's kind of

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.250
a nice distraction or maybe you can do

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:48.540
that I didn't really understand that but

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.160
try to shift the feeling of not being

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.500
able to breathe again I should a

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.660
thousand times bold this try to shift

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:56.460
the feeling of not being able to breathe

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.500
this something visited upon you to

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.210
something you are creating deliberately

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:02.119
just to see what it feels like right

00:40:02.119 --> 00:40:04.539
it's not like you know oh

00:40:04.539 --> 00:40:06.699
and why oh I'm not good at holding my

00:40:06.699 --> 00:40:07.959
breath why don't I have to do this it's

00:40:07.959 --> 00:40:09.699
like no no you were doing this you were

00:40:09.699 --> 00:40:11.049
the one telling yourself to hold your

00:40:11.049 --> 00:40:12.249
breath so just hold your breath

00:40:12.249 --> 00:40:13.869
don't let your analytical mind tell you

00:40:13.869 --> 00:40:15.579
to breathe trust me you'll breathe on

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:17.140
it's time you have no choice alright and

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.239
this urge is technically still the same

00:40:19.239 --> 00:40:20.949
but instead of this your creation this

00:40:20.949 --> 00:40:22.989
desire to breathe you're the one

00:40:22.989 --> 00:40:24.279
creating this so you have control over

00:40:24.279 --> 00:40:26.380
it you need to be threatened by your own

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.019
creation ask the author alright so I'm

00:40:29.019 --> 00:40:31.689
gonna go all right we're gonna hold our

00:40:31.689 --> 00:40:33.640
breath and again the East things will be

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.809
up here right I'm gonna hold my breath

00:40:34.809 --> 00:40:36.099
for as long as I can if you're listening

00:40:36.099 --> 00:40:38.259
and there's a big pause sorry but I'm

00:40:38.259 --> 00:40:41.609
gonna try this again all right

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.690
all right oh I could have went longer

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:57.300
but oh man all right

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:59.010
I didn't even tie myself so I don't know

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:00.960
how long it was they started texting

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:04.640
people back that I've been ignoring

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.770
pressure was on I was like [ __ ] dude he

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:09.330
can't talk hold his [ __ ] and do like 30

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:11.430
seconds I don't know how long I was but

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:15.450
I my record so far until then was I

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:19.050
think like a minute and 27 or yeah I

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:20.670
think like 20 second or third I think I

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:21.840
made it in half roughly right around

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:22.170
there

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:24.720
hopefully I just broke the record again

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.940
I don't know because I was kind of like

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:28.110
oh [ __ ] there's so many too much dead

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:30.300
air but you get the idea right and you

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:32.030
just compare those times and like is you

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:34.590
again if you just kind of like approach

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:36.330
that differently any the the biggest

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:38.670
thing I think honestly is feeling the

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:40.230
sensation start to like separate these

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:42.120
physical sensations from your thoughts

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:43.380
like your feelings from your thoughts if

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:45.900
you can separate the physical feelings

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.340
from the thoughts you can you really do

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:48.480
get some wiggle room and start playing

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.800
around with that because you feel a

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.630
feeling and then you're not like it's

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:53.040
not like feeling in thought or one thing

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.330
that you know it's not even like feeling

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:55.890
thought and you are all one thing it's

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:57.510
like there's the physical feeling

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:58.860
there's the thoughts and then there's

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:01.230
you and it gives you kind of some wiggle

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:03.180
room to be like yeah I feel so [ __ ]

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.780
mad but you know like this will go away

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:09.360
and you know let me just go take a walk

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.330
let me just like just let this you know

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:13.650
let me just feel this thing and it's

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:14.850
kind of let this course through my body

00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:16.230
I sort of got anger is one of the worst

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:17.640
man like you know I can deal with

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.430
anxiety but I'm pissed it's like oh it's

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:22.350
such a [ __ ] it's just like I drank

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:23.910
battery acid is such a horrible feeling

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:27.510
all right so the results oh man this

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:30.570
color of this slide so bad um okay yes

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:32.550
the beginning I went from 47 seconds in

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:34.320
beginning to a minute and 24 again I

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.520
don't know what I just timed that right

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:37.410
then hope it wasn't embarrassingly low

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:39.450
that would suck all right so in the in

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:41.580
the book they have this like question

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:43.440
part you can go through and describe

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.210
your experience right so it's like you

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:46.560
know describe your experience during the

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.290
exercise the first time I did this

00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:51.840
second exercise I was in kind of like

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:53.790
yeah now but not as much I was very

00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:55.920
worried about failing the second time

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:58.020
around like actually holding my breath

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.420
for like you know less than 47 seconds

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:02.610
because it was like well if I fail 47

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:03.090
seconds

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:04.560
that means this Act stuff doesn't work

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:05.310
and

00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:07.410
my prezi's have been for nothing oh my

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:09.120
god and that was kind of like the worry

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.950
I had going into the second one where I

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:12.390
was like legitimately nervous to hold my

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:15.870
breath so but the thing that helped like

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:17.400
I said before feeling the feeling helped

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:20.010
and again telling myself that I was the

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:21.540
one creating this feeling rather than

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:24.060
having it happening to me really helped

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.260
and also I think would help me run a

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:26.880
mile today without stopping was like

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.670
like I'm the one running a mile if I if

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:32.340
I come under any sort of acute distress

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:33.900
that needs to be dealt with my body will

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.820
for sure let me know like my mind is not

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.620
gonna pick up on bodily distress before

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:40.080
my body does so if you if any of you

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.120
have health anxiety maybe that will help

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:45.270
oh the other thing too is I also this

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:47.220
first time I did this for a second time

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.230
I I felt like I barely made it thirty

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:50.640
seconds I was sure like I just

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.860
definitely [ __ ] the bed and made it for

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.390
thirty seconds and I'm just full of [ __ ]

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:56.310
but it turned out to be a minute twenty

00:44:56.310 --> 00:44:57.690
four and I was like that was a weird

00:44:57.690 --> 00:44:59.790
time work alright and again another

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:01.290
question did the difficulty of not

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:03.690
breathing come and go when did it go up

00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:06.240
or down well for me it lessened when I

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.400
felt the feeling or told myself I was

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.690
creating it when I was worrying about

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:11.790
failing or my heartbeat or anything else

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:13.860
feeling itself the severity increased

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:16.500
how did your mind try to persuade you to

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:20.010
breathe before you really had to for the

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:21.420
first time I did set first and second

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:22.860
time I did this my mind was like you

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.300
don't think you got a good breath dude I

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:25.950
did not think you got a good breath you

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:27.510
should restart that that was kind of the

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:29.700
[ __ ] going on what was the sneakiest

00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:32.100
thing your mind did well this first

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.560
again the second time I did this it was

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.210
convincing me that I had only held my

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:37.680
breath for thirty seconds I swear to God

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.240
I didn't make you the full forty second

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.620
forty seven I checked my timer I was it

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:43.050
oh [ __ ] I I beat my time by like you

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:46.740
know fifty percent whatever was do you

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:48.720
see the possible implications the simple

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.730
exercise might have for how their life

00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:52.920
has been going especially the area

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.840
you've been struggling with and I think

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:56.220
my answer is like yeah seeing the

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:59.070
automatic nature of my mind springing up

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:00.450
to the problem-solve

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:03.390
and alert me also my fear of failing a

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:06.090
simple exercise with no real recourse is

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:07.620
something to really kind of look into if

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:10.170
like you know not everything like why do

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:11.400
I feel like I'm on the edge of a cliff

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:12.450
I'm about to hold my breath it's not a

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:13.410
big deal

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:15.420
again looking back on the first time

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:17.670
you've held your breath versus now does

00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:18.870
this comparison give you

00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:21.270
any new practical applications for the

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:23.130
area's you've been struggling with right

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:25.560
and you know again you'll have your own

00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:27.000
answers for me personally it's like you

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.440
know just really trusting my body to

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:31.290
handle biz and all that I need my mind

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:33.690
for is to be creative in ways that

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:36.330
expand my experience not diminish it

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:37.950
that was there my answers I'm sure

00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:39.690
you'll have your own and you can even

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:41.280
just try this yourself even if you like

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.960
you know we're like [ __ ] I'm not

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.550
pausing and watching this just try this

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:45.930
you're trying to just keep breaking your

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:48.450
record it's kind of fun there's also a

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:50.190
really cool thing too I do this in a

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:51.930
church of dogology sometimes with the

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:54.060
it's a wim HOF breathing method so if

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:58.860
you google just like wim wim HOF breath

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:01.140
retention the YouTube thing will pop up

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:03.090
where you take like things like 60 deep

00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:05.310
breaths and you can hope after you if

00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:06.540
you do like 60 deep breaths

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:08.190
you can literally hold your breath like

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:10.200
two minutes no problem and it's so weird

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.910
because you really actually don't feel

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:13.710
like you need to breathe but your body

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:14.970
just starts freaking out and you get

00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:16.860
this adrenaline boost really cool and

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:18.810
also breath retention is supposedly

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:20.940
really good for you that's what a lot of

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:24.570
the like original yoga stuff was based

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:26.640
on not so much like you know meditation

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.500
a lot of its like breathe in breathe out

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.360
focus on your breath a lot of it was

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.250
like breathe in hold your breath for a

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:34.110
while and then breathe out it kind of

00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:35.520
does create this kind of like hyper

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:38.010
awareness and again it it's something

00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:39.450
like a fast you know and you're like you

00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:41.430
don't eat it you don't need for a lot of

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:42.720
times your body will start just kind of

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.190
feeding on [ __ ] that shouldn't be there

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:46.140
I've read I don't you know again if

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:47.520
someone knows more about this please let

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.500
me know but it said something kind of

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.420
like that it's sort of like a fast in a

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:53.250
way we're like you send your body into a

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:55.050
high co2 state where it's deprived of

00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:56.520
oxygen and your body just starts kind of

00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:57.780
getting rid of [ __ ] that it doesn't need

00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.130
again if that's true or not I don't know

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:01.130
I just like to think about it all right

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:03.990
so we're almost done here let's get into

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:05.730
the willingness question I think that'll

00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:08.310
be it right okay so yeah this is it

00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:10.410
all right suppose that in order to live

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:12.120
a healthy vital meaningful and

00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:14.040
satisfying life you needed to give up

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.780
trying to control your internal thoughts

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.180
and feelings before you can move in the

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:20.700
direction you want it to go right so

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:22.350
suppose let's just say that even though

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:23.670
it's like that's kind of the deal or

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:25.500
that's what the author saying at least

00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:27.870
right so in order to live a healthy

00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:29.550
vital meaningful and satisfying life you

00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:31.200
have to give up trying to control your

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.760
internal thoughts and feelings before

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:34.140
you can move in a direction you want to

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:36.660
go make sense that includes feeling

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:38.580
whatever feelings thoughts memories and

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:40.170
bodily sensations that come up along the

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:40.590
way

00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:43.560
right so if that was required in terms

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:45.450
of like having to feel all this stuff

00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:46.860
versus trying to like constantly get

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:47.490
away from it

00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:49.830
to what degree would you be willing to

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:52.140
do that you know we're not assuming that

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:54.050
you'll know how yet we're only asking

00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:57.360
about your openness to that path right

00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:59.580
you can rate yourself one is totally

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:02.220
unwilling and 100 is like less [ __ ]

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:04.440
go like I'm 100% with it so one means

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.900
like no [ __ ] way I'm not facing any

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:08.310
of this [ __ ] I'm not feeling any of this

00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:09.930
[ __ ] I don't want to thank you goodbye

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:12.510
I'm done and a hundred is like dude I'm

00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:14.580
ready to [ __ ] rip this I'm ready to

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:15.810
feel everything you know at least you

00:49:15.810 --> 00:49:16.970
think you are you don't you know

00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:18.960
something really [ __ ] up happen or

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.640
whatever might this that's yes my brain

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.790
does um all right so what thoughts come

00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:25.020
up for you when you hear this you know

00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:26.430
and you might really have some [ __ ] that

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:27.630
you're like dude I hear you're saying

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:28.890
bro but I have some real [ __ ] up [ __ ]

00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:30.870
I don't think about and honestly dude

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:33.300
think about this if there's something

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:35.070
that way I swear to God like this thing

00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:37.170
brings up in you or you're like dude I

00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:38.700
hear what you're saying but like I had

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:39.960
something happen to me that was so

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:42.750
[ __ ] up that I legitimately can't

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:45.840
think about it well that should tell you

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:49.680
that you know that's you need really you

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.630
would need one-on-one help at that point

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:53.790
you would really I my opinion benefit

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:55.170
from that but you know good one-on-one

00:49:55.170 --> 00:49:56.550
help because that's like the risky thing

00:49:56.550 --> 00:49:58.560
when people have like super high drama

00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.450
backgrounds the problem is if they go

00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:02.340
you know if people that go get help you

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:03.600
don't know anything about it and then

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.370
you go get help from someone who sucks

00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:07.320
it can only it can almost make stuff

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.820
worse you know that can be that some

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:10.050
people's experience where people like go

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:11.400
get help man the way I did three times

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.320
and I had three [ __ ] wing bats who

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:14.730
just freaked me out even more and it's

00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:16.920
like you know if that's the case email

00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:19.530
your boy dude I'd like to know you know

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:22.590
my schedule [ __ ] sucks but you know I

00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:24.060
can't you can't have people on the team

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:26.190
that jacked up so email your boy we'll

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:27.450
try to figure something out but again

00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:29.070
for the most I do think for most people

00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:30.690
it's like you know we can and are

00:50:30.690 --> 00:50:32.190
willing to do this just whenever we're

00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:33.540
told we could you know we didn't know

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:36.450
was on the table all right and also

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:38.340
think of this if this is for the book as

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:39.660
well if you had been willing to

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:41.610
experience fully what your personal

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:43.710
history gave you while you're engaged in

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:44.480
actions out

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.950
you know this is key to not like for

00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:47.630
everything but if you had been willing

00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:49.520
to experience fully what your personal

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.160
history gave you while you're engaged in

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:54.050
actions that were important to you how

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:55.550
would your life have been different than

00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:56.630
it has been right

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:58.400
this doesn't mean like experience fully

00:50:58.400 --> 00:50:59.930
all of everything in your personal

00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:01.940
history because as kids our hope you

00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:03.230
know again going to that book the denial

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:05.300
the denial of death they do say like our

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:07.369
personality is pretty much shaped in a

00:51:07.369 --> 00:51:11.240
way that kind of like you know it's like

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.670
a body kit for like optimizing ourselves

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:15.140
through painful situations that's what

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:17.060
you know that's one theory of like our

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:19.550
personalities themselves are kind of

00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:21.230
like some sort of weird character armor

00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:22.850
against like our pain sources early on

00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:24.980
so it's kind of like no weird way in a

00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:26.720
real kind of perverse way like there are

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:29.630
the things that shape us weirdly right

00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:31.609
so I mean that's necessary that's like

00:51:31.609 --> 00:51:32.900
survival [ __ ] so I'm not talking about

00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:34.820
that I'm just saying if you were

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:37.970
actually engaged in actions 100% mind

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:39.350
body and soul that actually are

00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:41.150
important to you right how would your

00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:42.140
life have been different than has he

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:44.119
didn't I say I don't [ __ ] know fair

00:51:44.119 --> 00:51:45.200
enough you know it's just a question

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.250
from the book I thought it was kind of

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:46.609
cool

00:51:46.609 --> 00:51:49.760
all right des clothes remember this the

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.650
acceptance we are talking about is the

00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:54.200
one about receiving a gift not rolling

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:56.869
over and dying and perhaps the gift to

00:51:56.869 --> 00:51:59.570
be had and fully feeling our emotional

00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:01.910
pain is discovering what it is we truly

00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:03.920
care about that's from his other book

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.869
right so it's like you know and that's

00:52:05.869 --> 00:52:07.010
what we're actually what are we

00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:09.200
accepting we're trying to open ourselves

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:11.600
up to see what we actually care about

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.340
because if you're you know for fear of

00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:15.530
judgment stuff if you're like I don't

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:17.240
know that's kind of corny er that's kind

00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:19.100
of lame that's kind of it's like you can

00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:20.630
do that [ __ ] do you die but it's like

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:22.460
what did you actually find in your life

00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:23.780
that was meaningful other than like

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:26.480
trying not to be called a [ __ ] which you

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.730
know feels great didn't know what a [ __ ]

00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:29.930
but it's like it's not stuff you can

00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:32.540
really build a life on alright and in

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:34.670
the next chapter I love to say this we

00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:37.700
will finally be learning some skills and

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:39.050
we kind of did a little bit in this one

00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:40.310
this was you know it was a little primer

00:52:40.310 --> 00:52:43.850
plus but uh alright so I'm out of this

00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:47.600

hell yeah appreciate anyone have any

00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:52.580
