i was hanging on midwest rattler and all

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:32.260
of a sudden she was just like

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:44.880
pull the sword out of your stone dude

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.560
and all of a sudden it's like oh

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.320
the world's back in order yeah it

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.920
doesn't take much was back in order it

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.240

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.120
it took one weekend yeah took last

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.240
weekend

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.600
that's all you needed for me to just be

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.360
like you needed approximately

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.399
10 days i think no it took longer than

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:01.600
14 days yeah yeah yeah yeah it was like

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.320
two weeks

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.000
maybe three dude i've been getting into

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.880
like i had a weird thing yesterday

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.480
i i got really bad sleep for like two

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.320
days yeah and i was [ __ ]

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.279
miserable grumpy so grumpy so miserable

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:13.760
so

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.000
sad and i know i'm like it's from a lack

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.360
of sleep and i'm like all right cool all

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.279
i got to do is get some good sleep

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:21.600
dude when i started going i got on that

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.839
i've been watching a uh

00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:26.800
stand for lectures on it's like

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.040
behavioral biology or some weird [ __ ] or

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.080
about like psychology basically and dude

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.600
when you think about how like

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.880
when you start thinking about how just

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.240
like it depends on like the certain

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.360
little chemicals in your brain

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.720
like when i missed that sleep and i was

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.240
really sad and i got sleep and i was

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.680
happy i was like

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.279
i'm a [ __ ] just some weird animal

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:44.959
dude i need my brain chemical that [ __ ]

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:46.320
was freaking me out yesterday i'm

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.440
driving like

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.959
all i need to do is maintain my brain

00:09:48.959 --> 00:09:50.560
chemicals and i was like i don't want to

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.760
think about that

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.760
i'd rather focus on things yeah that was

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.080
fun it was freaking me out yesterday

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.160
that's yeah because i was legitimately

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.839
upset all day about nothing

00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:02.480
i was just tired and all day i was like

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.000
[ __ ] god damn it just

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.560
so mad i've been mad and sad about

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.680
things for like

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.600
three weeks for like no reason but it's

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.839
just i understand yours is just sleep

00:10:11.839 --> 00:10:13.920
yeah but it's like i'm walking around

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.399
like nobody's ever happy life is stupid

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.160
i mean take a nap that's one thing that

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.600
actually makes sense it's weird how

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.800
someone could get into your head and

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.160
just [ __ ] scramble your brain

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.240
chemicals and you're like

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.680
like it's [ __ ] scary to think about

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.920
dude i was reading about the uh on this

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.600
guy's lecture he was talking remember my

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.519
theory i gave to you about i mean it

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:36.959
by no way validated my theory i was

00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:38.320
totally wrong about the girls syncing up

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.360
their periods

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.880
yeah all because of birth control and

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.399
they all had everybody takes birth

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:43.600
control so that means

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.440
every girl gets their period at once it

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.640
turns out not true

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.640
turns out very untrue as you pretty much

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.839
proved instantly found out

00:10:49.839 --> 00:10:51.839
exactly what i was like uh is that true

00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:53.200
do you know what it is

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.640
what it's um it's pheromones

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.240
it's all they pick up they pick up each

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.079
other's peer like they pick up each

00:11:00.079 --> 00:11:02.399
other's periods through their scent

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:04.640
unconsciously and link periods up and

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.480
women who are more like extroverted and

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.519
outgoing

00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:09.279
tend to be the alpha females who all the

00:11:09.279 --> 00:11:11.760
other females link their periods up to

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.079
which kind of explains their weird

00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:15.040
constant battle

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.240
you know like you see a group of girls

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.079
will kind of like hold court and like

00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:20.079
talk houses and like oh you got three oh

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:21.279
this is only three bedrooms they're like

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:22.800
well with three bedrooms pretty big and

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.440
they all

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.200
they're battling [ __ ] period they're

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.560
trying to see who has the best period

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.839
i've been puzzling i've been indiana

00:11:27.839 --> 00:11:29.440
jones and over the female ego for like

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.399
[ __ ] do you have

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:33.120
like four months that pheromonal smell

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.320
period control thing

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.920
put things into perspective i was like

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.279
that's a big piece of it i still don't

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:38.399
know i'm still in the dark dude

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:40.240
i'd love to hear your big pieces on the

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.120
female ego of

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.079
the dossier i slid across your desk i

00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:47.600
mean i could i could give them to you

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.160
dude

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.560
that's just desire to control yeah

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.480
ideally a female ego wants to wrangle a

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.200
character

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.279
that's kind of like a rogue like a

00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:56.639
romance cover dude like you're talking

00:11:56.639 --> 00:11:58.160
about well that's me and bb girl exactly

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.680
that's like what you're talking about

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.880
you think bb girl is trying to wrangle

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.959
me they're all trying to wrangle you bro

00:12:02.959 --> 00:12:04.639
dude bb girl is not doing being baby

00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:05.200
girls okay

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.279
together forever there's nothing that's

00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:08.240
going to stop us

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.240
i'm not raining on your parents we're in

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.000
love matt you're in the audition

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.200
facebook i've known her for a week

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.720
and we're in love this is something i've

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.480
been puzzling about too you're in the

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.839
audition phase yeah i was in the

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:19.120
audition phase for a while

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.800
and you know everything's flaky you know

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.320
we break up a couple times everything's

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.760
cool audition phase is a good time

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.079
though

00:12:24.079 --> 00:12:25.680
it's a great time my whole my thing i

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.760
puzzle over is like why is it when you

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.680
finally like you move in you do all the

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.399
right things

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:32.000
and they're just kind of like yeah i

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.519
don't like you

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:34.560
they're just kind of like yeah you're

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.639
all right yeah you're like

00:12:36.639 --> 00:12:38.560
but i'm being such a good boy right now

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.079
yeah you still you've loved me what are

00:12:40.079 --> 00:12:41.200
you talking about

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.399
i was cool as [ __ ] okay it's that's just

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:45.519
wild but dude that

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:47.519
and apparently women who don't have um

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:48.720
the scent receptors

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.720
they have like no sense of smell their

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.160

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.079
into the period battle

00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:07.680
that's where all the evil behavior comes

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.880
from because then they start they go

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.720
through instagram and it's just like

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.720
just chicks keeping scores like [ __ ]

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.240

the sand that's like 50 points period

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.240
that's a hard period yeah that's hard

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.760
if you see somebody with their feet in

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.440
the sand you're just like oh and just

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.079

00:13:24.079 --> 00:13:26.240
your [ __ ] starts like you get the donny

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.000
darko beams from your [ __ ] to theirs

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.360

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.560
constantly be with him dude

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.079
right now i think cardi b's [ __ ]

00:13:36.079 --> 00:13:37.680
controls all girls do you think cardi b

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.000
is

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.920
the one who's the head period nicki

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.360
minaj had it for a while

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.199
i think cardi b's period right now is

00:13:43.199 --> 00:13:44.720
definitely controlling a lot of stuff

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.519
right so you can

00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:48.240
cardi b's period is i mean at least she

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.680
probably controls like three barrows in

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.160
new york

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.800
if you're as famous as her your period

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.680
scent probably

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.880
wafts further and further so like when

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.480
cardi b does tour in your city they must

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.680
that's why their period is all [ __ ] up

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.600

please get into doomsday prepping i mean

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:46.960
i'm not gonna get into it

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.560
but this is gonna have some supplies it

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.240
starts with a book bag you're gonna have

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:50.960
a book bag

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.200
i already have that ready to go no no i

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:54.880
don't have the book bag ready to go

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:57.359
but my i was thinking about guns today

00:44:57.359 --> 00:44:58.560
right but you were

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.560
i was like no no real i was thinking it

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.240
was like this guy was saying like dude

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.280
you don't understand like everyone

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:04.400
laughs and [ __ ]

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.640
if the economy did fail and like [ __ ]

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.920
got really [ __ ] up the government

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.640
collapsed

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.640
the starvation would be immediately like

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.480
all we have is a food stores dude and

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.520
like they don't really last through

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:14.800
snowstorms

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.359
he's like if [ __ ] does hit the fan which

00:45:17.359 --> 00:45:18.079
again

00:45:18.079 --> 00:45:19.599
it's unlikely the financial market the

00:45:19.599 --> 00:45:21.119
united states will collapse probably

00:45:21.119 --> 00:45:22.319
will eventually though nothing you know

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:22.720
it doesn't go

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.720
nothing goes forever if this thing some

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:25.920
things go forever

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:29.040
do that something's last definitely

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:29.839
forever

00:45:29.839 --> 00:45:31.599
and definitely not till the next podcast

00:45:31.599 --> 00:45:33.200
when i'm like i'm [ __ ] sad again no

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.560
she's not gonna leave you no baby girl

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:37.760
will never leave dude

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.240
this guy was like dude you like it would

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:42.079
just be everyone you run out of [ __ ]

00:45:42.079 --> 00:45:43.200
from the grocery store and then it's

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.160
like there's farms in lancaster

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.440
sometimes what happens if it's like

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.720
mid-season you're not gonna wait you're

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:49.920
not gonna make it like six months of

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.280
like you know eating whatever the [ __ ]

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.160
you can eat

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.400
so i was thinking like well you know if

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.520
so in my head i instantly i'm like if

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.040
this [ __ ] happens

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.839
i'm definitely i can see why people need

00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:00.319
ar-15s

00:46:00.319 --> 00:46:02.000
because it's like i'm going to the

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.680
grocery store i want to be strapped and

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.200
i'm like it's just dudes with guns like

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.000
the [ __ ] out of the way and you're

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.200
grabbing the canned goods and some other

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.560
guy has a gun you look at each other

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:09.359
like

00:46:09.359 --> 00:46:11.040
are we going to squat he shoots you

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.480
that's dude it's good it'll be

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.440
and then what does he do you don't have

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.640
it yet then he takes your [ __ ] he

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.920
takes all the spaghettios takes all the

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:16.640
spaghettios

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:18.640
and your baby girl now your baby girl's

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.640
gone forget it yeah she's

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.400
what do you think happens if i mean dude

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.839
i would lose baby girl if there was an

00:46:23.839 --> 00:46:25.119
apocalypse

00:46:25.119 --> 00:46:27.520
i would be really interested to learn

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.720
about what do you think bb girls

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:31.680
ships in apocalypse like i would just if

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:32.960
it would just probably like instantly

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:33.839
break up

00:46:33.839 --> 00:46:35.200
so many dudes all right we're [ __ ]

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.560
you're on your own i'm out of here once

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.079
like the real threat of survival comes

00:46:38.079 --> 00:46:38.640
in

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.319
just being like all right you know what

00:46:40.319 --> 00:46:42.640
[ __ ] i've thought of that

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.040
i thought like if you're strapped to a

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:48.240
[ __ ] chick during like a [ __ ]

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:50.800

i don't know then again if you're like a

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.400
family i could see that editing a whole

00:46:58.400 --> 00:46:59.760
extra dimension of like fatherhood of

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:00.400

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:17.680
where

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:20.720

it extends you do certain substances you

00:47:50.079 --> 00:47:51.680
can you can definitely extend if you hit

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:53.200
the methadone clinic you can extend

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.119
maybe grill them into a [ __ ] adult

00:47:55.119 --> 00:47:56.880
into like senior citizenry

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.280
