I try to hold the line they're just like

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.579
that's probably if you're an anti file

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:32.810

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.970

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.700
outside of like a bully in fifth grade

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.410

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.360
them has had physical contact yeah I

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.280

they've watched from fifth grade til now

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.380
all you gotta do is push and people fly

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.170
everywhere yeah that's this this diluted

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.430
mindset that they have that they're

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.250
tough I don't know where it's rocked

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.110
if they were to really go for the Civil

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.030
War dude the Captain America Civil War

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.190
it's like it's not a good matchup dude

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.470
anti files versus like already milk

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.750
sucking Heartland dude it's like no

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.120

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.560
earlier about like even [ __ ] lame

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.420
both sides would be if there's a civil

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.940
war if you strongly on either of those

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.919
sides you're such a [ __ ] loser

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.989

I mean I'm not like I said I'm against

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.850
abortion yeah I mean if it's a woman's

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.290
choice so if you gotta fund it you gotta

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.180
fund it but I'm sets the heavy heart

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.029

00:09:55.899 --> 00:09:58.070
they're like going up against like

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.570
religious nuts who stand in Planned

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.680
York Times Twitter well you know Twitter

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.240

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.560
the feeling is that includes of failing

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.900
New York Times Jeff Bezos propaganda

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.220
machine in Washington Post

it'll be out of business in seven years

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.700
he's probably right well someone

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.020
responded like yeah pretty sure Jeff

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.310
Bezos papers I'm gonna be out of

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:23.600

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.030
days later there was an article being

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.670
like now that Isis is pretty much done

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.440
didn't Syria there's a bunch of women

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.780
and children who like defected from

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.150
Europe and other countries and now they

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.010

yeah they joined [ __ ] Isis dude the

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.500
funniest part was they uh they were like

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.760
quoting the women the women are like

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.680
it's like we thought it'd be something

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.420
totally different we didn't know be like

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.580
this attitude it's just like you guys

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.410
[ __ ] get you guys rolled the dice

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.960
hard yeah thinking like Isis could

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:57.960
totally they're like they've been

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.880
deserted by the men have been arrested

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.500
so just women and children in a tent and

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.540
Syria match of your from Germany you

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.250
somehow got roped into Isis now you guys

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:06.630
did that your daughter every day like I

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:07.980
don't know when we can go back home

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.050
sweetie you're just sitting there and

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.090
it's like sad but it's like you also

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.320
joined [ __ ] Isis you idiot that's

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.940
again that's going back to the line of

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.340
our women helpless retards yeah alright

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.080
cuz if that's a helpless [ __ ] that got

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.730
drunk to that ten extremely helpless

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.500
[ __ ] back that's just a kick-ass

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.450
powerful Muslim how do you test though

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.340
you have to probably watch you got to

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.510
sit them down in front of Michelle wolf

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:40.170
saying if they're like uh yes but that

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:41.580
Isis doesn't want kick-ass women either

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.710
so it's kind of a [ __ ] tough I wonder

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.120
if they if their husbands got in trouble

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.310

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.530

he's been different I've noticed I'm

00:24:16.409 --> 00:24:17.970
sure he's just trying to step back from

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:20.250

you break the other thing if people

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.460

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.190
DHS stuff so it's like if your house is

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:18.419

that's what I meant do you think that's

00:30:53.929 --> 00:30:55.820
how they conduct business I don't know I

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.080
was thinking about that's what's telling

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.509
you today I was like I think if you come

00:30:59.509 --> 00:31:02.419
right from shiny shiny yeah and you open

00:31:02.419 --> 00:31:04.129
up a restaurant and you see a bug it's

00:31:04.129 --> 00:31:06.049
not as like CodeRed as if like you've

00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:08.090
been [ __ ] you know breathing the

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:10.580
American oxygen for a couple for a

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.320
couple generation of freedom gets in you

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.269
but then again I worked in each place

00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:15.799
one time I've worked in a pizza place

00:31:15.799 --> 00:31:19.369
one time not gonna name names but it was

00:31:19.369 --> 00:31:22.669
pretty [ __ ] nasty now central that's

00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:24.080
where they kill mice everyday that's

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.969
where you drowned mice and so every day

00:31:25.969 --> 00:31:27.379
for like three years yeah ever no for

00:31:27.379 --> 00:31:29.330
three months what's wrong with you

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:30.919
how you gonna kill a mouse dude that's

00:31:30.919 --> 00:31:35.539
on a sticky trap smash it with what flip

00:31:35.539 --> 00:31:37.639
the paper upside down and stomp as I was

00:31:37.639 --> 00:31:40.190
doing I was a town stomping them I found

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:43.309
stomp the first one and I used to you

00:31:43.309 --> 00:31:45.859
stop a mouse's head I was like man [ __ ]

00:31:45.859 --> 00:31:47.749

00:31:47.749 --> 00:31:49.700
little scolded I love those guys too I

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:53.299
like I like them too but it's like get

00:31:53.299 --> 00:31:54.739
off the stand you can't right everyone's

00:31:54.739 --> 00:31:56.179
have over washed them off the sticky

00:31:56.179 --> 00:31:58.789
trap dude can't those limits are flags

00:31:58.789 --> 00:32:01.219
right yeah they're totally [ __ ] you

00:32:01.219 --> 00:32:03.919
gotta stall them dude so that's when I

00:32:03.919 --> 00:32:06.109
started drowning I hold it hold the trap

00:32:06.109 --> 00:32:07.759
in there and hold him in the chair Eko

00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:09.499
they like [ __ ] resist I didn't love

00:32:09.499 --> 00:32:11.089
this and you could feel the thing

00:32:11.089 --> 00:32:14.570
[ __ ] waiting a little bit oh my god I

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:16.070
wanted to get them in like a tiny little

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:17.450
car and put it like a floss around their

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:27.469
neck and [ __ ] we're taking a ride I'd

00:32:27.469 --> 00:32:30.619
be sick yeah but we I was in there all

00:32:30.619 --> 00:32:32.299
day like god this place is so [ __ ]

00:32:32.299 --> 00:32:34.129
foul that would take it out of me

00:32:34.129 --> 00:32:35.659
killing mice like that I would actually

00:32:35.659 --> 00:32:37.099
be sad that was the first thing I did in

00:32:37.099 --> 00:32:38.179
the morning for literally three months

00:32:38.179 --> 00:32:41.089
yeah comments are high right most likely

00:32:41.089 --> 00:32:42.649
yeah yeah for the most part so it's like

00:32:42.649 --> 00:32:45.440
I'd walk in kind of stone to work and it

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.479
wasn't like I had a manager as a girl

00:32:47.479 --> 00:32:49.219
she wouldn't touch it she big only got

00:32:49.219 --> 00:32:51.649
you and I'd be like yeah right I'm

00:32:51.649 --> 00:32:52.969
getting you're getting the big bucks and

00:32:52.969 --> 00:32:54.559
here I got a [ __ ] handle matters of

00:32:54.559 --> 00:32:56.809
life and death dude I got to sit here

00:32:56.809 --> 00:33:02.640
and [ __ ] and then I have to cook

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.100
so I [ __ ] like kill mice and go back

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.750
in fire up the grill and the guy let's

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:08.070
talk and let's get this girl so they

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:09.299
would when you would hold them in the

00:33:09.299 --> 00:33:11.010
Cherry Coke you could feel them do you

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:13.380
feel it trap stop wiggling

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:15.150
they're probably drinking as much as

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:16.740
they could that is for a mouse turd that

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.540
I knew this is your theory is to hit it

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.920
with the best way to kill them I mean

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.450
for a mouse do they probably open up

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:22.890
their mouths and there's everything the

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:25.290
projects ascended to heaven dude if I

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:27.330
like if I open up their mouth honestly

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:28.920
it probably burned the [ __ ] out of their

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:34.080
eyes and they went straight to hell they

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.910
tasted that cherry I think about so you

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:37.860
didn't want to [ __ ] stomp their head

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:39.480
stomping the town stomping on water

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.760
[ __ ] helps it's it's just like that

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.340
you look at the step on a mouse's head

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:45.630
and check out the bottom of your shoes

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:47.610
dude I know it's horrific I'm sure I'm

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:49.500
saying if I open their mouths and we're

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.419
like mount mice don't really get access

00:33:51.419 --> 00:33:52.620
to so to that much they're more like

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.860
crumbs cheese vegetables they're

00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:00.929
probably what's this yeah they usually

00:34:00.929 --> 00:34:02.549
drink like you know one like puddles

00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:04.320
like cars leaked into a puddle it's like

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.360
oily rainbow puddle yeah that's what

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.380
they drink that's what they drink holy

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.879
fig they drink that so drinking or

00:34:08.879 --> 00:34:10.770
sipping on that it's the [ __ ] super

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:13.830
nice cold cherry ice cold

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:18.119
Jericho that'd be sick of they didn't

00:34:18.119 --> 00:34:19.530
die if they're just passing out and

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:21.270
waking up like an hour later like I had

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:31.139
the most [ __ ] up I guess if I could

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:32.609
pick how to die I think that would be it

00:34:32.609 --> 00:34:36.000
John they strapped out a glue trap and

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
then someone just dunks me and I've

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.980
actually this isn't more of it this is

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.270
really a death thing but I've had a

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:43.889
fantasy for as long as I remember about

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:45.960
filling a swimming pool with jello and

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.830
jumping in see what happens I'll be

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:54.300
pretty tight do you dive right in it is

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.590
I wonder if it were like hold you if

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:56.940
you'd sink to the bottom think you would

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.830
die if you think you die you jumped in

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.440
jello a pool of swimming pool yeah eight

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.240
feet yeah you drink my weight sure I

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.500
might talk about some above-ground

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.810
[ __ ] jelly wrestling jello wrestling

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:08.490
will be tight he'll talk about doing

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:11.190
like a cannonball straight into jello oh

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:14.100
you swim to the top I think you're just

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.430
stuck and you die

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:17.319
you just wiggle out I don't think I

00:35:17.319 --> 00:35:18.970
don't know like a worm you just activate

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:20.200
your worm muscles dude and burrow

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.390
through get out I think it would be like

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:23.109
quicksand

00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:25.030
jello yeah I think you would just be

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:30.400
stuck in there like just trap probe like

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.640
the mosquito in Jurassic Park is stuck

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:37.510

color of their skin if Germans were

01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:15.680
