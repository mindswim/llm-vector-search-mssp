she's very smart she's the only and

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.159
she's not insane at all the only thing

00:25:58.159 --> 00:26:00.169
she's crazy about is when everybody

00:26:00.169 --> 00:26:03.020
makes fun of her she cries

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.610
she's the only normal person in my

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:08.539
family she's mean like today at dinner

00:26:08.539 --> 00:26:11.450
before the podcast I just looked at our

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:16.780
[Laughter]

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:36.549
thumbs down in the me

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:43.850
me my mom and my dad had soup comes down

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:45.350
oh this is why I gave her a thumbs down

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:51.290
she wants to buy a $1,300 microwave she

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:52.190
was like well we're getting a new

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:53.780
microwave because I was talking about

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.430
its kid she always passes if you

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:57.380
microwave something like if you reheat

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:00.110
soup you'll be like don't microwave it

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:02.540
like every time no matter what you if

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.730
you take something out to reheat it she

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:06.320
will tell you not to micro put it in

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.360
like the pan so they put it in the pan

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.890
or if it's like pizza or something put

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:11.750
in the oven she is adamant to tell you

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:13.640
to do that every single time I kind of

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:14.630
do the same thing dude

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:16.940
I'll i reheat stuff in the pan pan I'm

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.170
something wrong with doing it that way

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:20.810
but if you watch someone else take

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.840
something out would you be like I

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.480
believe I'm like Britney this will be so

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.160
much better if you put in a pan every

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:32.510
single time but anyway we were making

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:34.820
fun of her for that and then so that she

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:35.690
was talking about the microwave and

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:37.070
she's like well we got a new microwave

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:40.790
soon and I was like I'll buy you a

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:43.370
microwave right now like when you kind

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.500
do you want they're like $30 and she was

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.600
like this one's like $1,200

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.060
she wants a [ __ ] test there's

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:53.540
microwave drawers now you build into

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.700
your cabinet that's a pullout drawer you

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.720
put the food in and close it's like why

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.280

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.850
if we were [ __ ] if we were the musk

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:16.280
family we could get something like this

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.860

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:21.290

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:23.870
focused on my sister's rocking boobs we

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:26.660

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:58.630
no it's on HBO yeah there's a miniseries

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:01.060
or just I don't know yeah it's about a

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:05.020
book there's a book by the student it's

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.720
just about if the United States went

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.330
fascists in World War two so it just

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:12.600
follows a Jewish family basically

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.399
especially the movie that's like what if

00:34:15.399 --> 00:34:18.640
America was more racist yeah towards the

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.990
Jews so it's just a series about that

00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:25.899
okay oh I got historical fiction where

00:34:25.899 --> 00:34:27.700
the United States side with the Nazis in

00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:28.360
World War two

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.880
I remember this yeah under yeah like

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.090
through hate and it's uh it's kind of

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:36.179
weird it's weird

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:38.860
once it's wheeled so what hat sewed the

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:43.120
Nazis it's it's it really what's that

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:45.820
the Nazis it's early in history in this

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:48.220
is a fictitious universe the Nazis were

00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:50.890
successful I don't know I haven't

00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:52.540
finished it but I bet if they had us on

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:53.320
their side they would have been

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.390
successful yeah so are there juice on

00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:57.940
the show as a question this is while

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.100
they're successful they're not

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.990
successful yet so yes there are Jews on

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:03.850
the ship this shows about Jews but Nazi

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:07.240
still like getting them in Germany yes

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.450
okay but not in the in the United States

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:12.340
they're like so in the United States a

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.020
guy named Charles Lindbergh do you

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.610
remember you probably he flew across the

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:18.190
Atlantic yeah the spirit of st. Louis

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:19.090
that plane

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:21.630
who's that hearse first transatlantic

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:26.260
flight and yeah he landed he was like

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:33.670
excuse me after respect actually

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:38.680

bits I've ever had in my life

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:57.460
but um I don't know it's it's odd

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.170
because they made this whole documentary

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:01.000
about how Charles Lindbergh is a giant

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.030
piece of [ __ ] and he was like a Nazi

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:05.650
sympathizer and all the stuff and like

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:08.170
if he ran for president against FDR he

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:10.450
basically pulled a trump yeah and like

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:12.820
the whole time they're like there's no

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.350
way this idiot can win and the main

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:15.790
characters like there's a lot of hate

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:17.470
there's a lot of hate in this country

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:19.150
and this guy knows how to pull it out of

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:21.340
people like it did fully reflect even

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.570
though the book was written before Trump

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:25.300
it fully reflects like truck like this

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:26.800
guy just screams at the radio every day

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.350

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.300
[ __ ] gay about it imagine if people

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.730
made a show about like what if the

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:43.220

00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:02.240
alternative history shows the thing I'm

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.680
curious about though is I think I'm

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.760
gonna have to look into Charles

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:07.640
Lindbergh because this show makes him a

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:12.110
Nazi and it's like I don't know I read a

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:14.300
couple things about like because he was

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:16.310
he was boys with the Nazi like the Nazis

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:20.510
him in like Ford yeah Ford Ford was in

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:22.310
it and he said they had I think the I

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:24.830
think it was Ford in this historical

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:27.410
show that calls him like he's like you

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:29.270
Jews should be out with the n-word like

00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:31.450
you know he says the n-word Henry Ford

00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:34.090
Ford did a job in the n-word it's like

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:36.860
did he say that or we just don't talk

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:39.560
some that in this show and it didn't

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.390
Henry Ford sell cars like the Nazis or

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:43.790
something yeah I mean Henry Ford I

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:45.460
believe was a Nazi sympathizer I think

allegedly Walt Disney who knows I mean

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:49.940

00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:24.980
like they paid her dude they paid the

00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:27.110

00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:47.390
I don't think she's lesbian she

00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:51.140

know you know I don't know what she does

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:02.600
but I think on a beach she spikes the

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:05.300
[ __ ] out really I think she's more of a

00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:11.510
setter low base low base and then

00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:13.700

they just laugh anytime you talk [ __ ] so

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.540

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:33.950
turn on the tears dude when you get the

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:35.090

01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:48.590
like I mean I guess dude it's like I

01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:50.350

it stands for it stands for some

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:03.340
negative things it looks cool but it's

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.140
just unlucky that that's a cool flag

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:07.480
that's well it's also funny too is it

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:09.970
you know stuff like that you know

01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:11.380
everyone says that was like an ancient

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:13.690
Hindu symbol but those symbols are

01:04:13.690 --> 01:04:15.520
supposed to like have a get deeper we're

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:16.990
suppose having a deeper resonance with

01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:18.370
those symbols naturally so it's like

01:04:18.370 --> 01:04:20.320
when you see a swastika part of use like

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.840
I think looks kind of cool I hate that

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:25.390
I'd like to draw that there in class and

01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:29.760
then quickly make a window out of it

01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:31.770
[Laughter]

01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:34.180
it's like obviously you know it's like

01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:36.190
nobody's flying if you was but if you

01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:37.720
make it a fifth graders notebook and see

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.460
a lot of little houses drawn all over it

01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:49.090
just a young Nazi dude I hope I hope the

01:04:49.090 --> 01:04:50.740
Jays have a great 2020 that's what I

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:53.350
don't want anyone have a bad 2020 the

01:04:53.350 --> 01:04:56.200
Jays are probably gonna have a good 2020

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:57.970
I think so I think I don't think nobody

01:04:57.970 --> 01:04:59.710
freeze rent I think they're gonna be

01:04:59.710 --> 01:05:00.340
doing all right

01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:02.860
what do you mean any freeze right in New

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:04.060
York the Jays are doing well

01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:06.250
they're still collecting rent which is

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:10.330
great okay good jeiza win it I want them

01:05:10.330 --> 01:05:12.250
I want them in that summer 2020 I want

01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:13.990
the J's of a great summer 2020 that's

01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:17.920
the guy I am I mean that's just me when

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.570
the Jade look if the Jays are doing well

01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:21.610
our country is doing well dude I want

01:05:21.610 --> 01:05:23.740
the date the Jays are having fun I'm

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:25.570
having fun that's how this works

01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:27.790
know for sure I mean this is you know

01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:32.620
I'm obviously a segue the yeah I hope

01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:34.450
the Jays do very well and again yeah I

01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:35.590
think it is I think that's definitely

01:05:35.590 --> 01:05:39.570
bottom-up economics dude trickle-down

01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:42.370
what are you saying that they should

01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:43.570
have that should take a measure of

01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:46.540
wealth that should be like the JTP

01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:48.700
yeah JDP words like well how much richer

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:52.030
your Jews I'm killing it at home how

01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:54.850
much are you Jews acting black that's

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:56.740
the they're rapping sir

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:04.270
true that's that's a strong economy love

01:06:04.270 --> 01:06:06.790
the NBA now sir perfect I mean honestly

01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:08.200
if you think about it the Beastie Boys

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.520
that way when were they they were doing

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.080
like to clip that was like the internet

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:11.560
bubble

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.810
yeah little dick a little before that

01:06:13.810 --> 01:06:15.520
it'll do a little digging that was

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:17.110

it's like bro come on

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:03.310
yes what are you making this for it's

01:07:03.310 --> 01:07:05.860
like oh yeah cuz it's cool in America to

01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:07.870
be like there are Nazis everywhere and

01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:09.670
then this did this literally is a show

01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:12.180
that's like half the country are Nazis

01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:16.110
here's this show it's like

01:07:16.110 --> 01:07:20.520
why yeah it's like you do not well I get

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.530
it it's a book so there's just and then

01:07:22.530 --> 01:07:25.730
a bunch of Jewish people made the show

01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:27.030
yeah

01:07:27.030 --> 01:07:29.850
and sold it to Jewish people so of

01:07:29.850 --> 01:07:31.260
course if I was Jewish I'd be like the

01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:34.020
show rules yeah look how hard I've had

01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:39.180
it yeah look how America hates me yeah I

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:41.750
don't know I just I don't know about the

01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:43.890
when they're saying like that was the

01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:45.150
one thing that like you know do they get

01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:46.530
teased do they get joint if you're

01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:48.630
wearing the [ __ ] like priests closed

01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:51.300
yes obviously probably but to be like de

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:53.400
Blasio that mayor the governor's

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.320
bullying Jews it's like dude would you

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.330
guys stop this thing I don't think that

01:07:57.330 --> 01:07:59.280
was I think that was just everybody was

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:02.190
so excited to say that although I'm so

01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:04.350
excited I could see them being sensitive

01:08:04.350 --> 01:08:07.410
to like governments not being totally on

01:08:07.410 --> 01:08:09.990
board with them gathering as soon as the

01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:11.790
government's like hey Jews come on hey

01:08:11.790 --> 01:08:12.750
get out of here they're probably what

01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:15.690
the [ __ ] going on [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah

01:08:15.690 --> 01:08:18.030
yeah I can see the pair of some of the

01:08:18.030 --> 01:08:19.620
paranoia I can see being warranted I

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:23.100
think they got good reason to be upset

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.350
if anybody in the government's like and

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:31.890
especially Jews Jews you should put up

01:08:31.890 --> 01:08:33.780
that gift from Schindler's List that

01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:35.700

01:16:09.079 --> 01:16:11.030
the same thing with we've been talking

01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:12.739
about since the goddamn that goddamn

01:16:12.739 --> 01:16:15.229
podcast started yeah is that because

01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:16.339
we've been seeing it especially with

01:16:16.339 --> 01:16:18.859
like whoa comics and comedy where it's

01:16:18.859 --> 01:16:21.949

01:16:21.949 --> 01:16:25.010
Lebanese trying to like somehow loophole

01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:26.510
your way into having the black

01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:28.939
experience in the United States yeah is

01:16:28.939 --> 01:16:30.349
that what you're doing cuz it's weird

01:16:30.349 --> 01:16:33.969
and so it is weird well it's weird like

01:16:33.969 --> 01:16:37.309
it's a weird aspect of the black

01:16:37.309 --> 01:16:41.059
identity to try to kind of like latch on

01:16:41.059 --> 01:16:43.819
to be like yeah come on dude do the

01:16:43.819 --> 01:16:45.379
awesome part dude be like a player and

01:16:45.379 --> 01:16:46.969
dude and like hit on chicks and probably

01:16:46.969 --> 01:16:48.319
that's what I'm talking about that's my

01:16:48.319 --> 01:16:50.719
favorite dude that's that's my favorite

01:16:50.719 --> 01:16:54.199
type of Asian yeah Asians that adopt

01:16:54.199 --> 01:16:56.629
black culture just black culture not

01:16:56.629 --> 01:17:02.269
this story a story yes Victorian easily

01:17:02.269 --> 01:17:04.969
the most swagged out group like arguably

01:17:04.969 --> 01:17:06.859
the most swag dog group there is for

01:17:06.859 --> 01:17:11.569
sure I agree I agree dude some aspects

01:17:11.569 --> 01:17:14.679
of fast and furious in the crew still

01:17:14.679 --> 01:17:19.429
you're the whole squad is on it there's

01:17:19.429 --> 01:17:21.379
some cool [ __ ] squads like that that

01:17:21.379 --> 01:17:23.629
might be number one they were they did I

01:17:23.629 --> 01:17:25.099
mean this is kind of besides the point

01:17:25.099 --> 01:17:27.379
in this uh well sort of I so I had to

01:17:27.379 --> 01:17:29.300
read an article for you know after I get

01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:30.469
before I got done school I hadn't read

01:17:30.469 --> 01:17:31.939
an article that's spanking this is kind

01:17:31.939 --> 01:17:32.989
of something that's annoying cuz it'll

01:17:32.989 --> 01:17:36.499
be like you know spanking is like

01:17:36.499 --> 01:17:37.579
spanking some play this happened my

01:17:37.579 --> 01:17:38.929
school all the time spankings a black

01:17:38.929 --> 01:17:42.530
thing it's like no then I must be [ __ ]

01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:47.629
yeah it's like Noah's 50 cent the sort

01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:52.339
of nine policies have nine it's like

01:17:52.339 --> 01:17:54.199
well this is this is a black thing and

01:17:54.199 --> 01:17:55.550
you guys don't know this is a cultural

01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:56.839
thing we have that you guys don't

01:17:56.839 --> 01:17:58.010
understand it was like you know if

01:17:58.010 --> 01:17:59.719
you're on the main line in [ __ ] Bryn

01:17:59.719 --> 01:18:01.339
Mawr then yeah every white person rooms

01:18:01.339 --> 01:18:04.669
like my dad was out on business all the

01:18:04.669 --> 01:18:06.499
time and never lifted a hand towards me

01:18:06.499 --> 01:18:09.679
but say they did this whole article

01:18:09.679 --> 01:18:12.859
about how they were they were like I

01:18:12.859 --> 01:18:15.229
think the offering like parental advice

01:18:15.229 --> 01:18:16.879
Bank you shouldn't hit your kids like in

01:18:16.879 --> 01:18:18.289
hospitals when you had a kid like don't

01:18:18.289 --> 01:18:19.760
hit your kids here's the research saying

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:20.210
like it's

01:18:20.210 --> 01:18:21.950
an effective parenting tool doesn't work

01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:24.530
bah blah blah then you had like a black

01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:25.940
doctor who was like yeah this is [ __ ]

01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:27.710
up this is our experience and the reason

01:18:27.710 --> 01:18:29.270
we hit our kids is because of like you

01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:31.040
know we have to we don't they don't like

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:34.670
they have to be they don't have any the

01:18:34.670 --> 01:18:36.739
world won't tolerate them though they're

01:18:36.739 --> 01:18:39.260
more at risk blah blah blah and some

01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:40.400
reason I'm like alright well you know I

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.800
I don't think that's why you know black

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.120
people are getting spanked I think it's

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:45.469
just you know the same reason I got

01:18:45.469 --> 01:18:47.750
spanked like you have like an kind of

01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:50.110
uneducated parent who's like not as

01:18:50.110 --> 01:18:52.520
cultured and be like okay I go to

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:53.719
college but yeah this is a pretty

01:18:53.719 --> 01:18:55.969
[ __ ] bad idea to hit your kids but

01:18:55.969 --> 01:18:57.590
and then the article weirdly through in

01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:59.239
this stack where it was like you know

01:18:59.239 --> 01:19:01.010
and with you know I think it was like

01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:03.800
[ __ ] it was like the 55 kids between

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:05.270
like whatever it was a five year period

01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:06.890
three year period 55 year old young

01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:08.510
black males I got shot by the police and

01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:10.310
then they threw in this tidbit like oh

01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:13.100
and you know to be fair in that same

01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:15.560
period 1500 black children died at the

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:17.480
hands of their caregivers it was like

01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:20.390
what the [ __ ] there's like holy [ __ ] man

01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:22.010
and I might look how much I'm not

01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:23.570
throwing a fly anyway man but I was like

01:19:23.570 --> 01:19:25.219
that's a fact it's a [ __ ] stat you

01:19:25.219 --> 01:19:27.800
don't hear about yeah unless I misread

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:29.480
this which i if I misread this I'm gonna

01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:31.430
feel very bad but I'm pretty sure I read

01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:33.290
that it was like they they're like yeah

01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:34.280
and that's a problem but you know

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:37.040
there's also the issue of like just kids

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:41.840
dying gross negligence but yeah it was

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.390
either way I didn't want to I don't want

01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:46.550
to and I'm just all about you know

01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:48.500
victorious I'm not victorious behavior

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:49.760
but I read that article and it was like

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:52.210
holy [ __ ] man that's insane

01:19:52.210 --> 01:19:54.650
yeah it's that's a rough one yeah but

01:19:54.650 --> 01:19:56.090
again if you go that that's just like if

01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:58.310
you were to go to like a coal mining

01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:59.690
country you're gonna get a bunch of kids

01:19:59.690 --> 01:20:02.660
like falling out yeah I watched I

01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:05.840
watched to cleanse the palate last night

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:08.300
after watching the plot against America

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:10.610
which I still watch and I actually enjoy

01:20:10.610 --> 01:20:14.630
the show then I watched it was about the

01:20:14.630 --> 01:20:17.450
Atlanta murders of all the little black

01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:18.739
kids that were just getting murdered in

01:20:18.739 --> 01:20:22.580
Atlanta for a long time yeah they forget

01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:23.870
the guy they got who say he was like the

01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:26.420
first like black serial killer like

01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:31.470
Wayne oh so there was uh he was

01:20:31.470 --> 01:20:34.200
he was culturally appropriate so they

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:36.330
appropriated my culture and started

01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:40.530
killing children and uh but now then it

01:20:40.530 --> 01:20:42.750
was like oh this is real oppression here

01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:43.080
it is

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.300
they aren't talking about Atlanta and

01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:48.690
like dudes they're like the governor's I

01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:50.100
think there was a speech the governor

01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:53.730
gave in like 1974 in Atlanta or the

01:20:53.730 --> 01:20:55.650
mayor of Atlanta he came on it was like

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:59.400
look I hate to say it but just about

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:02.330
town black folks started thinking white

01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:04.770
because they had a serial killer and

01:21:04.770 --> 01:21:06.180
everyone's chalking it up to just like

01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:08.940
violent like just no no no this was just

01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:10.650
a guy they were highlighting what

01:21:10.650 --> 01:21:13.530
Atlanta was like in the 70s where if

01:21:13.530 --> 01:21:14.670
seventies and eighties where it was

01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:16.560
genuinely like dudes from Georgia that

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:18.870
were like hey you guys want to make

01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:20.640
money or you guys want to be black you

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:23.610
tell me you gotta start acting white so

01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:26.340
who was killing all these kids uh I

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:27.330
don't know I haven't finished it but

01:21:27.330 --> 01:21:32.190
there was a black yeah but hey I think

01:21:32.190 --> 01:21:33.720
the problem is is they just literally

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:35.820
attributed every single missing kid to

01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:39.510
this guy ah he's close we're not looking

01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:41.760
into this anymore we want to plan it to

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:44.760
become like an economic mecca of the

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:48.030
south we can't be focused on [ __ ] we

01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:49.940
got a bunch of missing kids down here

01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:51.690
did you hear about that guy that got

01:21:51.690 --> 01:21:54.150
shot the dude who was jogging yeah

01:21:54.150 --> 01:21:56.580
that's a rough one bro he's [ __ ] some

01:21:56.580 --> 01:22:00.990
shot yeah they caught him when it

01:22:00.990 --> 01:22:05.670
happened okay I was I was here like no

01:22:05.670 --> 01:22:06.840
they caught him and they were just like

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:09.450
you guys are innocent and then the video

01:22:09.450 --> 01:22:10.940
came out and the whole country was like

01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:14.940
what you gotta get this again I'm back

01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:17.130
in yeah they got him in now cuz

01:22:17.130 --> 01:22:19.080
everybody saw the video gotcha

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.060
it's like a Ray Rice like a Ray Rice

01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:22.470
situation like everybody was kind of

01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:24.000
cool with it until you see the video and

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.670
then you're like that's not good

01:22:26.670 --> 01:22:28.800
I mean what don't get me wrong no one

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.510
heard the story until they saw the video

01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:33.360
sure yeah except I kept hearing the

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:35.160
version of it that was like oh and then

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:36.510
they called these guys and now they're

01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:38.190

or just free and they're like yeah they

01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:44.640

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:45.330
they are now

01:22:45.330 --> 01:22:47.160

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.600
how he got you like five months ago

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:51.930
gotcha hey nice yeah it's like it's like

01:22:51.930 --> 01:22:54.630
and then you hear people try to defend

01:22:54.630 --> 01:22:56.310
those dudes by being like well that guy

01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:59.130

01:22:59.130 --> 01:23:00.960
was [ __ ] doing all this [ __ ] and I

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:01.830
don't know if that's true

01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:04.770
but even if that is true stop [ __ ]

01:23:04.770 --> 01:23:06.600
being retards and following people right

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:07.860
like it's exactly like George Zimmerman

01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:13.890

01:23:34.530 --> 01:23:35.910
this guy was totally innocent but they

01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:39.630
do the media is excited about it too to

01:23:39.630 --> 01:23:42.630
make this they do this they did it with

01:23:42.630 --> 01:23:44.310
Mike Brown they did with Mike Brown in

01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:45.300
in Ferguson

01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:47.730
where like the narrative is like oh I

01:23:47.730 --> 01:23:50.250
can't even go to the store today without

01:23:50.250 --> 01:23:52.470
getting shot by cops like you can't rob

01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:55.800
a store yeah he still should have been

01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:57.450
shot he still should not have been shot

01:23:57.450 --> 01:23:59.730
sure I think he wrestled a cop for his

01:23:59.730 --> 01:24:02.670
gun like yeah he reached in the guys car

01:24:02.670 --> 01:24:04.920
and was punching him don't get me wrong

01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:07.530
I think he I'm like with his hands up in

01:24:07.530 --> 01:24:10.650
the street we didn't it was bad when we

01:24:10.650 --> 01:24:12.600
did that to Nazis in World War two like

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:14.580
if you watch an old war movie there's

01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:16.170
other troops so like I surrender it's

01:24:16.170 --> 01:24:18.540
like who shot him what piece of [ __ ]

01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:20.910
shot those [ __ ] like even in

01:24:20.910 --> 01:24:23.760
wartime it's like yeah true that's

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:25.140
actually a guy in the street like

01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:30.660
alright yeah man again I didn't I heard

01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:32.400
the story I didn't read anything about

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.230
it but I heard the tale it was presented

01:24:34.230 --> 01:24:36.330
to me already the facts got twisted it

01:24:36.330 --> 01:24:37.620
was just like Doc's got to listen to me

01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:39.540

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:42.630
them go anyway no it's like I don't

01:24:42.630 --> 01:24:44.100
think that I was I don't think that's

01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:46.110
what actually occurred I thought they

01:24:46.110 --> 01:24:48.960
got out eyes were deemed innocent I

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:51.180

have gotten brought into the [ __ ]

01:24:52.530 --> 01:24:55.200

this stuff but it there are there's

01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:05.830
definitely sides like the easy thing to

01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:07.180
do is to look at it and just be like

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:09.520
okay just receive the information again

01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:11.020
be like alright fine done with it move

01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:12.440
on don't talk about it

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:14.600
whatever [ __ ] it I agree with that to

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.460
some extent it's usually what I do but

01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:18.440
now I'm not a hero I'm not saying I'm a

01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:18.710
hero

01:27:18.710 --> 01:27:22.340
but uh we like there's there is false

01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:26.090
information on both sides like [ __ ]

01:27:26.090 --> 01:27:30.380
they did it the media enjoys the racial

01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:33.770
tension they genuinely it sells [ __ ]

01:27:33.770 --> 01:27:36.710
tickets it's click a so the more of

01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:37.910
these that happened the more they loved

01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:39.620
the pushing well did you get into the

01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:41.510
Zimmerman thing how like they released

01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:43.940
the actual 9-1-1 calls the media and

01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:45.800
it's funny cuz you see that you don't

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:48.380
want to be like well I tell you what

01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:50.300
Zimmerman was a security guard you

01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:52.760
watched and ice i watch this on a which

01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:55.760
McCall it I saw this on my talking

01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.710
talking blogging heads at Glenn Lowry

01:27:57.710 --> 01:27:59.780
show and he was talking about is he was

01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:02.720
like dude it sucks because to even go

01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:04.010
against the narrative you're

01:28:04.010 --> 01:28:05.690
automatically people like [ __ ] you you

01:28:05.690 --> 01:28:07.370
piece of [ __ ] but they released a 9-1-1

01:28:07.370 --> 01:28:10.070
calls from the zimmerman tapes the news

01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:12.620
edited them to make them sound worse

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.230
than it actually was

01:28:14.230 --> 01:28:16.820
really yes like they they were heavily

01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:19.160
edited and they weren't like what I mean

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.080
that's perfect yeah that makes perfect

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:23.570
sense no but I'm saying like edit it

01:28:23.570 --> 01:28:25.670
reported on in a way like so and they

01:28:25.670 --> 01:28:27.710
were like hey see ya are and he was like

01:28:27.710 --> 01:28:29.870
and then they had him say something else

01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:31.100
that he did as if he was like [ __ ] that

01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:32.930
no I'm actually getting out he actually

01:28:32.930 --> 01:28:34.790
waited and you know it was it just was

01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:36.260
reported it was like twisted a little

01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:38.090
bit I could be wrong here I think Dave

01:28:38.090 --> 01:28:39.650
Smith was saying this like I'm pretty

01:28:39.650 --> 01:28:41.870
sure I think George Zimmerman is like

01:28:41.870 --> 01:28:44.690
suing Martin's family

01:28:44.690 --> 01:28:46.100
yes he's suing them because then there

01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:48.800
was a whole other thing there there's

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:51.170
the so [ __ ] crazy he's suing that's

01:28:51.170 --> 01:28:52.370
what I thought I was this is insane

01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:53.780
that's why I started googling it and

01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:55.640
then I I learned about some of it and it

01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:58.160
was like the key witness or it was like

01:28:58.160 --> 01:28:59.720
the person he was texting was his

01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:01.760
girlfriend and they're saying that the

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:03.860
girl and again this is this is something

01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:06.170
that I I don't know how it shook out but

01:29:06.170 --> 01:29:08.540
the girl who testified being his

01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:09.370
girlfriend

01:29:09.370 --> 01:29:13.700
supposedly wasn't his girlfriend it was

01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:16.340
just somebody else so you know but this

01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:18.140
guy made this whole documentary about it

01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:21.110
you know it's pretty nuts this yeah well

01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:24.200

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:25.880
following people with guns yes

01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:28.580
