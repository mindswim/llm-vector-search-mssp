00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.480

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:51.880

or the balls printed on both sides now

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:15.340
if I unscrewed the bats do you think I

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.010
could actually play sports with

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.810
bats and then those balls and then put

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.580
it back together you know I could play a

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.680
little little baseball with it all right

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.380

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.360

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.570
you

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:26.960
[Music]

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.490
what up dog dude you know you're live on

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.840
this [ __ ] patreon episode dude

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.220
yeah I got you live on a movie not live

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.740
but I had to call you for some strength

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.030
dude I'm getting hung up on by everybody

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:04.140
oh my god dude dude I [ __ ] I started

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.330
I called people first person I pitch it

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.180
to was like no second person I like

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.560
started giving in the choice to like

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.210
talk about current events or listen to

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:18.630
mythology it's like well that so then I

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.870
started to Ida volved into the idea of

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.160
I'm just gonna start calling Craigslist

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.690
a negotiating's ol answer people on

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:25.860
Craigslist will answer so then I

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.490
negotiated about a sports-themed table

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:30.900
with the guy that was actually pretty

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.300
fruitful so I'm have to figure out the

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.010
mythology thing is tough to hit people

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.420
in a course talk to get someone to

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.040
listen to 20 minutes of Celtic mythology

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.240
on a phone call from a stranger this I'm

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.130
learning but I might just have the whole

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.680
thing I might have the thing be mine ago

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.390
she might just just negotiate cuz that's

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.770
easy I can get people on Craigslist

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.710
negotiate I might just do that and then

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.990
do the mythology just call people I know

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:56.850
cuz this like him [ __ ] possible I

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.560
thought I knew I was sick salesman but

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.700
Jesus Christ is hard

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:36.150
yeah what up boy you what your per diem

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.700
yeah so yeah this first Epis gonna be

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.920
definitely a little sample attack dude I

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.300
mean you know just there right now

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.830
there's just a lot of ideas this is a

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.340
swirled potential right now but it's

00:08:54.340 --> 00:09:05.080
tough dude it's tough dude it's a heater

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.910

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:49.900

00:10:27.109 --> 00:10:29.549
Calvin says this is like beneath the

00:10:29.549 --> 00:10:33.029
inner sanctum this is way way down yeah

00:10:33.029 --> 00:10:36.659
dude tell Steve a blur amount see

00:10:36.659 --> 00:10:56.129
oh wait how'd that thing go they had

00:10:56.129 --> 00:11:01.399
like they do like a Model UN type setup

00:11:07.309 --> 00:11:12.859
yeah it's true you got to go back

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.819
[Music]

00:11:37.819 --> 00:11:41.759
Southport kind of left chef parks on

00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:43.559
Hulu and its own website South Park

00:11:43.559 --> 00:11:58.289
pieced out I thought people would be a

00:11:58.289 --> 00:11:59.699
little more open-minded man I thought I

00:11:59.699 --> 00:12:01.139
mean I'd be happy if something someone

00:12:01.139 --> 00:12:02.309
call me how the bloom was like I'm gonna

00:12:02.309 --> 00:12:03.779
read you a story I died [ __ ] yeah dude

00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:22.199
Thanks I might switch it up to where I

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:25.349
just get a patreon it's people's numbers

00:12:25.349 --> 00:12:27.269
and then call patreon subscribers and

00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:29.220
read them this

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.600
I think that might be the way to go dude

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.100
yeah I might teach the bull some myths

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.640
it's important to know dude imagine is

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.880
good no it's a fairy fair question it

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.680
was basically if like if we somehow to

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.350
said [ __ ] science and all the scientific

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:50.730
knowledge just was buried and that

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.470
that's what that was our science back

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.770
then so there's just a treasure treasure

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:57.270

that's the end of that that was uh as

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:04.460
you can see it that was the compiled

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.560
phone calls of I called like thirty

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.600
[ __ ] people most people don't answer

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.570

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.470
the podcast you hadn't get it done this

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.750
is the last weekend you can get salty

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:22.440
delete your [ __ ] I don't care you know

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.520
go for that if you live in a world where

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.190
you know you feel like you're swaying

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:32.100
things with you know even 20 bucks dude

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:38.070
I don't you know you know I get it you

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:39.060
know you're promised something you're

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.380
looking forward to it I you know I like

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.620
to stay by my word I try to but you know

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.990
I didn't which it does kind of bother me

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:47.910
I wish I didn't do that but at the same

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:51.390
time I am [ __ ] busy and I just forget

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.910
pretty much everything all the time so

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:56.010
you know I wasn't trying to be a dick

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:59.280
but again the worst thing people can do

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.780
to me is to try to coerce me with

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.760
[ __ ] a dollar fifty it's like you can

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.930
SMD forever with that but yeah so again

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:10.170
the patreon here's how it's shaping up

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:11.730
because this is how I work I had just

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:14.520
had to get into it um I'm definitely

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.110
gonna do a little thing you know

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:17.580
miiverse Craigslist where I just call

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.170
people on Craigslist negotiate with them

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:20.100
and just [ __ ] with people who are

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.650
selling stuff I think I am gonna do a

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:24.450
thing or listeners you know if you want

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:25.049
I

00:24:25.049 --> 00:24:27.210
people kind of hate this idea besides me

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:30.659
but it's like call people read a

00:24:30.659 --> 00:24:32.909
mythology I just I like mythology and I

00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:34.799
just think it's a fun way to read it

00:24:34.799 --> 00:24:36.869
everyone thinks I'm a [ __ ] loser for

00:24:36.869 --> 00:24:40.049
this apparently but whatever so that's

00:24:40.049 --> 00:24:41.909
it that's that's the that's the most

00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:45.179
inside scoop I can give people if you

00:24:45.179 --> 00:24:46.769
want more than this I don't know what

00:24:46.769 --> 00:24:48.779
else I can do besides show you guys the

00:24:48.779 --> 00:24:53.460
folds of my butthole so I hope you

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.789
enjoyed
