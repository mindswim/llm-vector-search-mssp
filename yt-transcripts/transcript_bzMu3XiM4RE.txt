tricks jacob and makes him marry his

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.000
ugly

so well this is old testament time so

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.360
those seven years that could be like a

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.880
definitely not it's probably like six

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.720

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.560
good place it's like what 400. yeah

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.000

they're like oh perfect this is exactly

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:06.160
what jordan peterson's talking about

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.120
when he's talking about how these

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.960
stories are instilled in our souls yeah

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.800
look at this three thousand two thousand

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.479
years later you and me are still sitting

00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:13.520
here like

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.400

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.160

00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:23.600
getting past leviticus

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.200
what's that how much after two more

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.040

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.720
yeah i mean i'm calling it now the stuff

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.240
that's ends next the stuff that's

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.320
podcast it's part of my systems dude

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.920
that's the thing people ask i wake up

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.600
every day i work out

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.320
come home i eat and then i feed my free

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.000
i don't free feed my dogs anymore i make

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.560
my dogs earn their food for tricks

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.320
so i like put their food in bowls and

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.680
put it up on the counter and put it in

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.600
my hand so if my dogs want to eat now

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.480
they have to [ __ ] eat from my hands

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.560
so i'm like they have to physically

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.160

mean come on yeah

00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:26.639
well there's a huge difference between

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:28.399
people like baby boomers or people

00:16:28.399 --> 00:16:30.480
raised by people in the great depression

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.120
and people millennials or whatever yeah

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.880
because it's been like even like the

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.040
bible you read it and it's like

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.360
got some got a water well some goats

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.360
married my cousin and it's like it's the

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.120
end of that guy's story he's like game

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.120
[ __ ] over dude yeah and then for baby

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.560
boomers it was like get a house have

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.680
kids

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.920
game over now for millennials i have to

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.920
express my voice artistically yeah

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.519
there's so much in the world i need to

00:16:53.519 --> 00:16:55.680
change yeah dude it's well it's all you

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.440
know i just said all i think about is

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.800
stand up

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.720
the thing is is that you're competing

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.759
now

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:02.880
like you used to be like you're in a

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.880
little town there's 60 people if you

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.959
just aren't like elephant men people are

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:08.720
like that's a good looking boy now like

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.600
we're driving around there's just

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.120
posters of brad pitt everywhere and it's

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.199
like you're competing with millions of

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:14.880
people now yeah because the internet

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.079
like if you want to be a comedian

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:18.480
there's the world basically watching on

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.079
youtube and every [ __ ] that

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.760
wants to be a comedian in the world

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.880
whereas like if you were just kind of

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.480
like a half funny insurance salesman in

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.760
the 50s

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.199
you were probably [ __ ] like three

00:17:27.199 --> 00:17:29.200
chicks yeah

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.400
probably beating two of them [ __ ]

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.440
three yeah it's uh

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.280
it's weird it sucks yeah sitting there

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.880
only thinking about like again when we

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.240
had that conversation about daydreaming

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.720
and i was like i don't think i daydream

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.160
i just sit there and think about [ __ ]

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.600
stand up and it's not productive it's

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.120
not like i'm thinking about bits or like

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.640
good material it's just like

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.160
blanket

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.840
yeah you're being glorious dude not

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.760
necessarily glory it's just like what i

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.080
need to do and like how how can i do it

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.120
well that's kind of all of it that's

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.240
just

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.360
mentally

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.210
mentally weaseling all day

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:03.440
[Laughter]

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.799
i know what you mean now that makes

00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:07.679
sense yeah i have just pure glory dreams

00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:09.200

maybe maybe when i was younger but like

00:18:15.039 --> 00:18:16.960

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.280
being a lead singer oh dude nevertheless

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.520

coming at my novel my novel dude i will

00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:58.960
say i've had two different editors

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.880
neither of them were particularly blown

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.799
away with my knowledge

00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:04.799
i thought it was all right yeah but i uh

00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:06.559
it was funny i like to finish it i got

00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:08.480
my feedback sorry

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.600
the reason i didn't finish is because

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.280
it's all on my [ __ ] phone you can't

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.600
do that and then uh whenever i stop

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.000
reading it i have to go back and scroll

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.679
the whole way down to try to figure out

00:22:17.679 --> 00:22:19.120
i have no delusions

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.039
i have no delusions about the enticement

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:22.559
well i want the pdf so i can just put it

00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:24.640
on my kindle true that but yeah the um

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.400
but it's funny because i've said it i've

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.600
sent it out to this

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.120
what you could do is put the pdf on the

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.320
patreon

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.600
that would be sick you get a little cash

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.960
for that that's something that's all the

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.799
boys would be happy to pay like a dollar

00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:36.720
or five dollars i mean my plan is just

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.480
to put it out on kindle and just charge

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.320
the absolute lowest i can charge for it

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.720
just to basically cover it because yeah

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.080

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.120

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.559
pretty [ __ ] funny uh you

00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:42.400
we we were talking on the last episode

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.440
about

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:47.760
that sick collage of me playing football

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:48.960
first off somebody got mad that we

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.559
called it a collage

00:23:50.559 --> 00:23:51.760
because what else is supposed to be

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.799
what's it supposed to be i don't know i

00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:53.919
don't know what you would call that i

00:23:53.919 --> 00:23:55.520
guess it's not a vision board it's just

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.919
it's a bunch of pictures in one frame

00:23:57.919 --> 00:23:59.760
it's a [ __ ] collage but they're not

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.600
touching each other i think a collage is

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.159
like a cut up mash together yeah and it

00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:06.320
has words it'll have like friendships

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.159
makes no difference

00:24:08.159 --> 00:24:09.919
but somebody had a problem with that i

00:24:09.919 --> 00:24:11.200
was like man why these people all

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.840

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.200

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.760

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.600

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.919
of course dairy queen dude hit me with

00:24:25.919 --> 00:24:28.480

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.760
transferred

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.000
so my yeah originally my dad was my

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.280
mother feel like the couple who wrote

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.119
the matrix or the one the guy who wrote

00:38:55.119 --> 00:38:56.880
the matrix trans and married like a buck

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.359
angel set up no really so i've heard

00:38:59.359 --> 00:39:01.200
yeah that's pretty sick really sick but

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.720
dude the funny thing about seacrest is

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:03.520
like

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.800
so either

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.040
he had his he had a hard penis in the

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.599
wardrobe and he rubbed it on her or

00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:11.839
she made that story up which is an oddly

00:39:11.839 --> 00:39:13.200
specific thing

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.560
for a girl to be like and then he had

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.480
just in his boxers he had his hard penis

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.000
and he rubbed it i'm like it does sound

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.680
like a girl story though well he

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.520
definitely had his hard penis at some

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.079
point she definitely saw his boner

00:39:24.079 --> 00:39:25.920
yeah i'm guessing whether he rubbed it

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.839
on her butt and grabbed her [ __ ]

00:39:29.839 --> 00:39:31.440
and apparently

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.839
according to her he said like

00:39:33.839 --> 00:39:35.280
as long as she was like you're not gonna

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.040
tell me are you as long as you keep my

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.880
job i'm not saying [ __ ]

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.640
that's what she said he says that she

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:43.200
was like none of it's true she came at

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.119
me i was like look give me 13 million

00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:46.400
dollars or i'm gonna [ __ ] say all

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.320
this [ __ ] and secrets was like no i

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.920
believe in the litigation system i

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.280
refuse this

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.560
what if he's telling the truth that's

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.160
hilarious i know but the funniest thing

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.920
is you always have to believe women in

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.160
this so his his

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.240
apology thing i guess whatever he did he

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.280
said like

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.160
i'm sorry to deny an allegation but i

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.240
also did not do these things so i have

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.160
to and it's like

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.000

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000

i'd be like fire and fury i bet it'd be

00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:22.640
frustrating to get falsely accused of

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.000
something like that i'd be [ __ ]

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.320
infuriating yeah dude he [ __ ]

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.640

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.079
ages

00:43:28.079 --> 00:43:30.240

[ __ ] and ever to be like hang her

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.319
yeah that would have been it

00:43:34.319 --> 00:43:36.160
[ __ ] yeah it's hilarious to think of

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.359
like how they would be like she's

00:43:37.359 --> 00:43:39.520
obviously a winch yeah they'd be like

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:42.079
yes get rid of this witch throw her in

00:43:42.079 --> 00:43:43.440
the lake

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.560
they used to

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.640
tie weights to women and throw them in

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.640
the water and if they broke out they

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:49.760
were a witch

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.200
yeah and if they drowned they were

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.200
innocent they should do that in europe

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.200
they do in europe where they'd have a uh

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.200
a boiling pot of water and they'd be

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.560
like if say

00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.920
you know people think you stole

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.040
something but there's no way of proving

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.640
it it's like all right sticks his hand

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.880
in the boiling vat of water

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.560
if it boils him

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.560
he's obviously guilty but the priest got

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.079
smart and started putting the water not

00:44:10.079 --> 00:44:12.319
that hot so like right when the guy was

00:44:12.319 --> 00:44:13.440
approaching to stick his hand in the

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.720
water he'd like [ __ ] it i did it i did

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.240
it i did it and then when they put it in

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.440
they didn't like i didn't do it and they

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.359
put it in and be like holy [ __ ] my hand

00:44:19.359 --> 00:44:20.800
didn't get burnt the priest of the [ __ ]

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.359
and then you know wow yeah

00:44:23.359 --> 00:44:26.319

00:44:26.319 --> 00:44:28.160

himself for not being able to read like

00:48:13.119 --> 00:48:14.400
without being cross-eyed but then the

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.000
one part where he's like

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.920
if we told them what it was like would

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.560

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:13.680
weather storm

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.880
she was like well like because i was

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.480
like i know it was a nor'easter and i

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:17.760
was like yeah it was like a category

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.839
five and i was like they actually

00:50:19.839 --> 00:50:21.760
categorize storms by how many black

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.760
ladies walk outside and go oh no and

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.040
they're like wait how many was that if

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.079
it's like for the fifth hundredth one

00:50:26.079 --> 00:50:27.440
they're like category five how many

the storm

00:50:42.559 --> 00:50:44.720

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.440
like what the [ __ ] happened here it was

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.359
the funniest thing i've ever seen they

00:51:41.359 --> 00:51:42.800
thought it was purple drank dude i don't

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.319
know what it was dude it was literally a

00:51:44.319 --> 00:51:46.640
purple paint can tipped over and then

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.240
purple footprints running away from just

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.640
like a dissolved outfit i was like dude

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.640
this like what could have possibly

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.160
[ __ ] happened that's great it was

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.920
insane that's really great it was so

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:57.440
[ __ ] funny to see i took a picture of

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.960
it

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.480
yeah that's uh

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:03.119
i got confronted for my

00:52:03.119 --> 00:52:05.440
onstage behavior this week i heard about

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:08.319
that yeah i wasn't too happy

00:52:08.319 --> 00:52:10.319
i wouldn't be either i got confronted by

00:52:10.319 --> 00:52:11.359
a fellow

00:52:11.359 --> 00:52:13.920
comedian about a fellow pursuant of my

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:17.280
dark choice of words on stage but it was

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:18.559
funny because it's like that guy only

00:52:18.559 --> 00:52:20.800
sees me do open mics yeah so it's like

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.160
an open mic yeah i'm gonna be a little

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.839
more aggressive than i am and you [ __ ]

00:52:23.839 --> 00:52:26.000
around basically i [ __ ] around yeah

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.119
and then that's another thing because

00:52:27.119 --> 00:52:29.119
it's like what because i've had them

00:52:29.119 --> 00:52:30.480
i've had other comics be like why do you

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:31.760
always just [ __ ] around up there it's

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:34.079
like it's like because that helps yeah

00:52:34.079 --> 00:52:35.599
it's like being able to [ __ ] around on

00:52:35.599 --> 00:52:37.040
stage is

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:38.960
pretty good yeah

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.240
anyway no

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.839
i don't i i as soon as i said it i was

00:52:41.839 --> 00:52:43.680
like yeah maybe i don't feel like i mean

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.599
it's dragging this up because he and i

00:52:45.599 --> 00:52:47.520
we talked since and we're fine that is

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:48.720
an annoying thing i mean you know if

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:49.920
someone came up and did the same thing

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.520
to him he'd be like [ __ ] off that's what

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.359
i said to him i was like dude on

00:52:53.359 --> 00:52:55.280
just try to imagine a scenario where i

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.839
approach you about your material

00:52:57.839 --> 00:52:59.839
it would never happen yeah but it was

00:52:59.839 --> 00:53:01.920
funny he was saying it he couldn't get

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.280
into uh

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.359
festivals and clubs because he was gay

00:53:05.359 --> 00:53:07.440
yeah and i was like dude

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.520
there's no you it's unbelievable how

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:11.680
backwards you have that yeah and he's

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.440
like well you don't get into stuff like

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:15.359
that because you're material

00:53:15.359 --> 00:53:17.280
and i was like how can the two yeah i

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:19.280
was like well yeah kind of

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.599
but that doesn't mean my material is bad

00:53:21.599 --> 00:53:23.440
yeah just means

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:24.960
festivals aren't looking for straight

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.359
white guys talking about the truth in

00:53:27.359 --> 00:53:28.480
america

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:31.280
and how much blue lives matter true that

00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:32.720

whatever the [ __ ] you want to call it

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.480
like comedian manager network manager

00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:50.640
obviously with larry the cable guy but

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:52.240
like think about that think about the

00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:54.079
larry the cable guy demographic and how

00:53:54.079 --> 00:53:56.319
hard he [ __ ] killed it yeah i'd be

00:53:56.319 --> 00:53:58.079
like yo check this if you could come up

00:53:58.079 --> 00:53:59.680

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:01.359
comedy that's not like super liberal

00:54:01.359 --> 00:54:02.400
watched

00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:03.920

someone is gonna put two and two

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.680

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.440
yeah just right now everybody

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:16.960
i think so everyone right now is just

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:18.240
kind of like

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:20.880
what was funny is he cited this comedy

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.119
he's like i didn't get into that and i

00:54:27.119 --> 00:54:27.920
was like you think it's because you're

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:29.680
gay and he was like did you apply i was

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:30.640

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.119
if i'm wrong that's a that's a weird

01:00:53.119 --> 01:00:56.119
guess

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:58.319
uh but yeah that's a very good point

01:00:58.319 --> 01:01:00.319
that's his first script rough draft he

01:01:00.319 --> 01:01:02.000

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.319
mel was like i think my favorite part is

01:01:12.319 --> 01:01:14.190
when you call them packs of

01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:16.160

i got a phone call to make that's so

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.520
[ __ ] funny

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:22.880
i'm going to use that material you care

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.960
if

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:29.359
[Music]

01:01:29.359 --> 01:01:30.720
oh my god

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.720
yeah that would have dude if that was

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:33.839
black dudes that movie would have been

01:01:33.839 --> 01:01:35.599
so much better that would have been the

01:01:35.599 --> 01:01:36.880
funniest [ __ ] movie well you know

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:39.200
what's funny i just watched hardball

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.400
starring keanu

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.000
i just watched that last night and that

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.839
it's funny to watch

01:01:43.839 --> 01:01:45.680
did that hold up

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.520
it's interesting to watch because i just

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.359
love that movie it was great it was that

01:01:49.359 --> 01:01:50.640
[ __ ] cried dude

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.400
baby died bro i [ __ ] died

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.920
dude my favorite line of that was when

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:55.839
the chubby kid got beat up and he's like

01:01:55.839 --> 01:01:57.440
i could tell they were banditos because

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:00.400
they had taco breath

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.319
so yeah it doesn't really hold up in

01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:03.760
that sense of like you watch it and

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.520
you're just kind of like it's weird

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.119
watching people trying to figure out

01:02:07.119 --> 01:02:09.280
race through movies to where it's like

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.119
it's keanu reeves he's like a gambling

01:02:11.119 --> 01:02:13.040
irish they're saying like hard and irish

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.480
guys kind of understand black people

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.839
when he like shows up to practice and

01:02:15.839 --> 01:02:17.599
he's like do you guys ever stop and

01:02:17.599 --> 01:02:19.280
think about maybe not being mean to each

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.040
other and all the black kids are like

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.000

what an idea yeah then like and then the

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.200
uh

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.960
the one part where

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.960
the the kid who's like you couldn't get

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.880
on the team because of his grades he has

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.319
to read the book to get on the team and

01:02:32.319 --> 01:02:33.920
they're like what'd you think about a

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.280

on top of his [ __ ] like i mean him

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:30.480

to endure it

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:11.679
the way i was actually thinking about

01:28:11.679 --> 01:28:13.199
that today i was like dude

01:28:13.199 --> 01:28:15.440
i just because i i've decided i like

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:17.040
since i can't be a shepherd that's just

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.480
totally out of the question you could be

01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:20.159
a shepherd ah it's time you gotta move

01:28:20.159 --> 01:28:22.800
to the southwest yeah and i need

01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:23.840

it's hard and it take with technology

01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:32.000
now there's no more like sleeping out

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.360
camping with the sheep fighting off

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.040
wolves it's just it's not happening if

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:37.199
you could find wolves to fight

01:28:37.199 --> 01:28:38.719
true that you go to yellowstone and

01:28:38.719 --> 01:28:40.320

them to just go fight some [ __ ]

01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:44.960

the idea of having everything you need

has become a failure

01:33:14.159 --> 01:33:15.440
because that was my thing i was just

01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:17.120

that

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:40.159

01:33:40.159 --> 01:33:42.239
not have to have never

01:33:42.239 --> 01:33:44.480

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:17.520
piece of [ __ ] who knows yeah or maybe

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:19.280
you're destined to have just a you know

01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:21.120
pretty average hot wife

01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:22.880
some decent kids you go to their

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:24.960

man cave even though it's corny it is

funny it's not corny

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:34.560
having a real man cave is [ __ ] sick

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:36.320
it's it is a ghost

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:37.600
it's funny because the dorks who are

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:39.840
excited about it suck but if you ever go

01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:41.520
into somebody's real [ __ ] man cave

01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:42.960
it's like damn this is [ __ ] awesome

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:44.560
yeah because i fantasize constantly

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:45.840
about having my own room and like

01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:47.119
putting all the [ __ ] i want into it and

01:36:47.119 --> 01:36:48.960
it's that's in essence what i guess

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:50.400
this is bill burr's

01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:51.520
i said

01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:53.360
realize that sleeping on a futon when

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.360
you're 30 is not the worst thing thank

01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:56.400
god

01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:57.840
seriously yeah every day i read this

01:36:57.840 --> 01:36:59.520
quote i'm like [ __ ] i'm 30 sleeping

01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:01.199
on a [ __ ] match i'm doing everything

01:37:01.199 --> 01:37:03.760
right basement i'm pretty much bill burr

01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:05.280
realize that sleeping on a futon when

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:07.040
you're 30 is not the worst thing you

01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:08.960
know what's worse sleeping in a king bed

01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:10.239
next to your wife that you're not really

01:37:10.239 --> 01:37:11.600
in love with but for some reason you

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:13.280
married and you got a couple kids and

01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:15.119
you got a job you hate you'll be lying

01:37:15.119 --> 01:37:16.800
there and fantasizing about sleeping on

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:18.719
a futon there's no risk when you go

01:37:18.719 --> 01:37:20.080
after a dream there's a tremendous

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:22.320
amount of risk to playing it safe

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:23.920
that's true also

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:26.320

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:27.920
chasing a dream right now

01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:29.600
