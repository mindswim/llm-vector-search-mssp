having stoner dads stunner dads is such

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:12.479
a sick podcast

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.159
it's always fun to do it that could be

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.759
the that could be like the uh

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.040
the captain planet you know join forces

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.560
podcast you know

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.840
it could be totally separate from this

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.759
doesn't even matter i mean dude if we

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:24.159
could

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.840
put all of our dicks together and then

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.360
we each get a day of the week to wield

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.600
it

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.119
that would be pretty sick i would cut

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.280
off a third of my life

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.520
we had like all of our dicks and like i

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.560
got like monday

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.079

i just like guys can we power up again

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.399
any way we can get together and power up

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.880
just again i mean okay never mind

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.799
i would do that yeah i don't think i

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:47.759
would yeah i don't think i would trade

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.799
dicks with anyone else

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.040
or like dick up with anyone else but you

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.840
guys oh hell yeah

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.159
i'll blindly trade dicks with most

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.159
people

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.680
most people true we'll go full team this

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.399
out

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.840
we'll join them up with your powers

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.400
combined with your birds combined

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.000
it'd be funny too to trade birds and

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.360
then just like you just because i think

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.040
a lot of times like the downward angle i

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.319
think i read this somewhere

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.080
like the downward angle of looking at

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.000
your bird makes it look smaller than

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.920
it actually is in real life so it's

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.200
sucked to trade birds with someone and

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.160
still like neg

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.360
someone else's bird and it's like this

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.040
thing they need like the the trying on

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.720
sneakers mirror at bird height

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.120
true because you look down at shoes

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.480
every shoe looks bad

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.000
they were like yo did you give me all of

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
your dick

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.360
i just because i gave you all of mine i

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.800
just wanted to make sure you didn't

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.160
leave some dick in the car

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.920
go check dude someone while while

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.519
wasting your dick transaction that would

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.480
suck dude

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.840
they tricked you and you're like what

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.239
you fed this thing before you waited i

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.640
know you did

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.920
you purposely didn't drink any water for

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.239
two days

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.360
i'd be sick too i trade dicks with fat

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.120
people because then it's like they got

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.720
all that extra dick hidden in their body

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.000
so you get a good discount they're like

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.239
no

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.680
i'm only rocking like five and three

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.200
quarters that's a fixer-upper dick i'll

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.599
take it

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.440
yeah i'll take it and just get shredded

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.959
dude do a little bit of keto probably be

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.400
seven yeah

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.760
make a couple trips to home depot

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.720
hell yeah dude that sucks when you get

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.879
fat enough to have that acorn cap dick

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.159
you know what i mean what were you

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.159
talking about like when it actually yeah

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.120
yeah like a bowl yeah like a half pipe

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.760
that's my least

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.360
my least favorite part of my body is the

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.519
soft area directly above my dick dude

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.920
how do you get rid of it dude

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.840
it's like a fat [ __ ] for dudes it is

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.040
that's exactly what it is

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.239
i was trying to figure out a way to say

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.159
it because it's like on women it's kind

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.959
of sexy

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.080
yeah you get a little pudding in your

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.400
panties

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.519
i gotta get all the pudding out of my

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.920
panties

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.000
i think if you just do planks all the

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.720
time

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.560
you can get rid of your dick fat or like

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.920
your oh i thought you were trying to

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.799
increase it

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.360
you just do it if i just like start

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.879
eating my dick fat my dick fat it goes

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.480
right to my dick fat when i eat like

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.200
sweets

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.720
yeah it's like that's going to until you

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.400
get fight club abs though that's the

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.600
softest part of your body

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.880
so i think it's normal to hate it i

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.840
think it yeah i think it's an

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.120
evolutionary thing

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.479
yeah yeah you don't want what's the

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.080
benefit of you know when you're

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.360
contacting

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.919
you don't want like a big punch in your

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.680
everyone's like elbow and you know

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.720
your wife because you should only have

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.800
sex with her you know oh yeah i think

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.600
it's a good thing because it like

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.560
guarantees

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.639
clitoral contact when you're [ __ ]

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.800
missionary that at least true

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.720
that's true i think no i think it's what

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.000
it is i think it's like

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.840
as your bird shrinks from being fat you

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.520
get more of a clitoral punch it's an

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.840
evolutionary thing

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.520
as your bird shrinks you're being fat

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.800
it's just your body which is like all

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.360
right well

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.880
because like he used to be like powerful

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.800
to be a fat guy like if you were fat you

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.520
were the king

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.520
of the tribe or whatever yeah and you

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.520
you had extra [ __ ]

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.080
[ __ ] power yeah i thought it was because

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.960
like your brain

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.880
can't let you think you're not tearing

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.080
that [ __ ] up

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.759
mm-hmm so if you have that extra fat

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.010
sound just sounds like

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.590
[Laughter]

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.800
there's a level of amateur porn that is

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.280
usually uh like a fatter ball dude with

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.479
like a

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.320
big fat like a scoop of ice cream around

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.560
his dick

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.360
he's always banging like a thailand sex

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.400
slave too

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.840
it's always a thai sex slave it's like

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.440
oh hanging out with a thai chick and

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.160
it's like this

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.919
woman's trapped those dudes always push

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.680
from the bottom though i give it up for

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.560
those dudes

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.160
those dudes always [ __ ] up from the

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.680
bottom

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.759
harder than any jack dude you'll see

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.120
well you have to

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.880
so yeah if you're gonna [ __ ] up from the

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.400
bottom i think what that is

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.000
is you know i'm gonna spit on here

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.759
obviously i never do this but it's like

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:50.960
you don't want your dick to slip out

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.880
when she's on top so you start [ __ ]

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.199
you're like

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.440
you go up while she's going up and you

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.280
chase her up

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.600
and follow her back down yeah as opposed

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.360

watching that's kind of weird

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.320
yeah why they capitalized all of mug8

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.279

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.839
democracy let

00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:06.240
like rest in the hands of black voters

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.839
because everyone wants the black votes

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:08.880
is that actually true i feel

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.480
i i'm sorry i feel like it's a myth

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.240
nothing means anything you think black

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.519
people are a myth

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:16.720
yeah black people like black people

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.080
until i see one i'm not just going to

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.839
take your word for it so you think black

00:09:20.839 --> 00:09:23.839
people

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.680
[Laughter]

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.040
yeah i don't know man there's also a

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.880
conspiracy theory melanated voters are a

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.680
myth dude

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.120
true everyone everyone says like it

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.320
comes down to the black vote it's like

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.680
does it don't

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.200
nothing comes down to anything yeah

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.360
black people don't even vote

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.360
yeah i mean i don't know i don't know

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.200
there's a there's a lot of guilt with

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.760
uh black people not voting old black

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.200
ladies will be like

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.279
there's so much like you know we did so

00:09:49.279 --> 00:09:50.800
much [ __ ] so you could vote you have to

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.600
vote blah blah blah

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.600
my wife gets it a lot but they're the i

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.120
don't know they're the first people not

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.080
voting they might not

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.080
though they're like they're like the nba

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.680
20 of the only 20

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.040
of old black ladies are registered to

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.200
vote really yeah that's the end

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.200
you hear about that that was the nba the

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.399
nba is talking all this [ __ ] like

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:07.680
everybody should vote go out there and

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.560
make a change

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.240
only 20 percent of the nba players are

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.600
registered to vote

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.320
only the white ones really no i don't i

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:14.720
don't know

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.600
i don't track it that much

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.119
[Music]

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.000
[Laughter]

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.839
i've been possessed by shane before

00:10:33.839 --> 00:10:35.519
you ever know but i saw they were saying

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:37.279
only 20 of the nba

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:39.839
is registered to vote but i mean i can't

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:40.480
imagine

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.160
that more than 20 of the nba is white

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.600
i feel like those numbers probably

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.360
that's kind of racist they're definitely

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.320
not yeah

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.200
and out of those white guys in the nba i

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.800
would say what like 60 percent of them

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.560
are like from like

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.440
uh like the czech republic yeah yeah

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.000
yeah

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.079
yeah and the other 40 act like melanated

00:11:00.079 --> 00:11:02.480
voters

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:05.760
well yeah i mean that's uh i don't i

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.959
don't think i think majority of the

00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:08.160
country doesn't vote though that's the

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.360
other thing

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.760
they did a poll and like i think like at

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.200
least 60 percent of the country doesn't

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:13.600
vote

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.120
do you think the white players in the

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.560
nba are the black vote

00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:21.519
how what i don't understand i just you

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:22.560
know because they're they're in their

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.880
canvassing uh you know what what the

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.160
black players in the nba want and they

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.160
just go out and vote for their interests

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.839
i think the white players in the nba are

00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:31.519
the black but like like like my white

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:32.240
wife

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.760
she represents my black vote do you vote

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.600
no she does yeah my wife calls me from

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.880
the voting booth and i'm like pick it

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.920
she's like who should i vote for and i'm

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.040
like let me hear the name so like do

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:43.510
that one

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:47.680
[Laughter]

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.440
yeah she gets a lot of [ __ ] for now her

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.880
mom's always like you gotta vote

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.440
yeah i get it you ever well your your

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.959
child is still very young but eventually

00:11:54.959 --> 00:11:55.600
you're gonna have to

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.120
you're gonna give your some a child

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.639
something that you'll have to save up

00:11:58.639 --> 00:11:59.200
for

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.560
and the second they stop using you like

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.560
what the [ __ ] dude that's like

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.000
two paychecks that you're just letting

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.160
collect dust that's how old black ladies

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.279
feel about voting

00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:08.800
true i can see that being like what the

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.800
[ __ ] yeah yeah but dude i i don't i mean

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.959
we're at the point now where it's like

00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:15.040
you know they're being like joe biden's

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.399
weak he won't be able to handle there

00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:17.600
and they're like trump's a [ __ ] hat

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.399
it's like why

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:21.040
why get an ad blocker it's also i know i

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:21.600
first of all

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.120
yeah first of all i have to but why are

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.720
you even letting the advertisers get to

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.079
your eyeballs let alone

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.519
the reason i'm cheap about youtube i

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:29.120
have like a bazillion of subscriptions

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.240
for 10 bucks a month but

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.120
i can't do youtube red i'm like i refuse

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:33.600
but

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.760
the what's also like why are we why does

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.040
the

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.360
some seven-year-old's personality like

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.800
why does the fate of the nation depend

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.480
on somebody's personality

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.160
it's like joe biden's a [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.160
dude

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.760
okay what what what's that what are we

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.200
what do we saw like the issues

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.480
can probably be broken down like

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.160
mathematically and by logic but it's

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:52.639
like

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:54.560
trump's a [ __ ] dick because you're

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.000
not actually you're not actually like

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.560
voting

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.399
on issues not voting on anything dude

00:12:58.399 --> 00:12:59.920
all you're doing is like voting on who

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.680
gets like the bigger share of like what

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.360
the military contractors are gonna pay

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.639
people to just do the [ __ ] that they

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:05.040
want

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.360

want the black boat because if they

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.680
wanted the black boat they'd be in there

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.560
talking about

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.200
which one of them gets more [ __ ] who

your video about trump be to get the

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.639
black vote

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:41.279
uh first of all there's no way uh trump

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.199
can dunk or even slap backboard on a

00:13:43.199 --> 00:13:44.959
layout

00:13:44.959 --> 00:13:46.399
he's not even smacking backward on the

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:48.800
layup dog

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.720
you know come at me what's next after

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.800
that i mean that's all i got

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.160
yeah that's my whole platform yeah

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.160
that's back backboard right now

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.920
candace owens and cardi b are beefing

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.839
right now basically over this thing

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:03.120
they're both being like i think candace

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:03.760
owens

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.279

00:14:05.279 --> 00:14:07.360
b illiterate so cardi b's illiterate

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.480
blah blah blah

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.079
and she was like cardi b's pant like the

00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:11.839
fact that joe biden

00:14:11.839 --> 00:14:13.519
is like giving an interview with cardi b

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:15.279
of all people he's pandering

00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:17.360
and then uh and cardi b gave a picture

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.720
of trump with like a bun

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.800

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.079
a little chuckle

00:15:10.079 --> 00:15:12.880
those are the best owning videos online

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:13.680
because

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.079
typically they're they're owning like

00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:17.519
some white person

00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:19.519
that you really think should get it yeah

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:20.880
you know it's like you just look at

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.240
their posture and say i hope a black

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.240
person just ruins your day

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.839
yeah and then they come in there with

00:15:25.839 --> 00:15:27.440
their [ __ ]

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.279
conservative property i love it i love

00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:30.880
black conservatives ruining people's

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.519
days

00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:32.959
it's [ __ ] awesome to watch but it's

00:15:32.959 --> 00:15:34.399
like then again it's the same thing of

00:15:34.399 --> 00:15:36.079
watching like

00:15:36.079 --> 00:15:37.759
you know some lady with like a weird

00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:40.320
haircut also too i i'm wondering like

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.480
are there goths anymore or are they just

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.920
like antifa now

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.519
i haven't seen goss anymore but i do see

00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:47.279
a lot of lady who uh they would

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:49.199
i see like people who are like should be

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:50.480
goss but they just have like purple and

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.199
blue hair now

00:15:51.199 --> 00:15:53.199
every woman between every white woman

00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:55.440
between 29 and 31 is goff now

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.040
and obviously it doesn't mean anything

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.800
are they are they like are they like

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.000
repping like the

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.079
like demonic spirit world still or is it

00:16:02.079 --> 00:16:03.279
just social justice

00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:04.959
i mean they they talk about that but

00:16:04.959 --> 00:16:06.800
mostly they just complain and

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.920
uh [ __ ] about you know staying regular

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.440
and [ __ ] like that dude

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.920
all boring old lady [ __ ] and then also

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.079
they have weird eyelashes and eyebrows

00:16:16.079 --> 00:16:17.680
and they're like i'm [ __ ] goth

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.920
uh you know i [ __ ] hate my boyfriend

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:20.959
all that [ __ ] that's all

00:16:20.959 --> 00:16:22.320

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.639

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.280
care about stuff

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.080
that's not like within our like as far

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.520
as we can like see

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.440
like absolutely there's wildfires in

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.960
california it's like dude that sucks if

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.240
i was in california i'd be very

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.679
i'd be very upset about this but like

00:17:39.679 --> 00:17:42.000
frankly i'm not affected by it it sounds

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.919
really selfish but i truly don't care

00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:45.520

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.799

but it's like i i it sucks it's [ __ ]

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:50.720
horrible

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.160
but i have too much stuff on my plate i

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.160
can't worry about fires

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.320
yeah even even halfway across even if it

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.240
was like western pennsylvania i'd be

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.080
like i'm eastern pennsylvania yeah my

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.039
place is full [ __ ] off

00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:02.640
i would love to know like there's

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.760
probably a couple of different levels of

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.360
work some but like geographically

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.000
and like emotionally how far is my

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.919
radius of giving a [ __ ]

00:18:09.919 --> 00:18:11.440
basically it's like four blocks

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.520
california's on fire yeah okay can i

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.320
still get peaches

00:18:17.039 --> 00:18:19.600
i'm totally good yeah until it's like no

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.880
more avocados i'm like someone's gotta

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.160
do something about this yeah

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.640
dude don't get me wrong if it was useful

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.400
i would pretend to give a [ __ ] about a

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.039
lot more

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:28.720
stuff but i don't think it's actually

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.080
very useful if anything it probably

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.520
makes me more useless

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.200
i become like a drag on the people that

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.880
like depend on me and care about me so

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.520
it's like

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.799
i'm kind of doing everyone a favor by

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:38.160
not pretending to give a [ __ ] about

you have no obligation to give a [ __ ]

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.880
about anything that you can't see

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.480
i think like right in front of you in

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.080
real life the further

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.520
the further you try to like solve the

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.120
world's ills i think the

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.559
deeper of a hole you get into until

00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:41.200
you're just like a boring old guy who

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.039
really never did actually anything for

00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:45.679
anybody and you're just waiting to die

00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:47.039
yeah that's why you need to have kids so

00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:49.200
you know exactly where your problems are

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.720
yeah i hear you although you are

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.080
creating some problems for yourself i

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:52.559
mean those

00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:54.080
those are the problems you created you

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.679
know it's like but but now you know

00:19:55.679 --> 00:19:56.880
exactly where they are so you don't have

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.720
to make up other problems

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.000
yeah you know like my problems are at

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.360
home with a babysitter right now yeah

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.960
like if you're it's true if you're if

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.320
you're like your life's cause you're

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.000

right i just

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.440
don't think it's like uh i think it is

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.120
funny that

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.360
you have people trying to solve all like

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.520
the ills of the world while also

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.039
kind of trying to have a normal life or

00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:20.400
like trying to like be an artist it's

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.240
like here's my new song by the way a cat

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.280
and then they have to like

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.200
list all like their their causes it's

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.480
like well then how did you make anything

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.120

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.400
did you stop caring about that stuff

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.799
while you were

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.120
you didn't care about you you weren't

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.760
saying a cab while you wrote a song oh

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.799

00:20:38.799 --> 00:20:40.400
what do you think i recognize it's sad

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.000
but i can't pretend that i'm like

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.799
disheveled

00:20:42.799 --> 00:20:44.159
when i hear when i see anything that's

00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:45.200
not like even with dude there was like

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.960
helicopters flying above me and like

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.320
stores getting looted and i was in my

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.000
house it's kind of like this will be

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.240
over

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.200
this will end a couple weeks maybe i'm a

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.720
[ __ ] [ __ ] dude there was six

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.960
gunshots i was woken up by six gunshots

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.080
last night and i ran

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.520

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.440
of my house i ran to my window

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.799
and i couldn't see anyone that was upset

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:06.720
about it and i couldn't see any like

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.679

like i

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.440
i got to watch like mathematically my my

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.760
life get worse because of things that

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.679
they did and i was like ah i kind of

00:21:49.679 --> 00:21:51.120
gave a [ __ ] about the wrong thing there

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.400
i should i should have i should put

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.679
those resources somewhere else in my

00:21:53.679 --> 00:21:54.640
life dude i say

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.159
these are the new party lines i feel

00:21:56.159 --> 00:21:57.600
like girls are democrats boys of

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.919
republicans

00:21:59.919 --> 00:22:01.760
we should just rock it like that okay

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.280
democrats for girls

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.520
bubble games for boys and then just let

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.880
it rip dude

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.280
i'm pretty i'm sorry dude i don't mean

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.400
to be political but i think the

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.640
democrats are for girls

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.400
democrats are for girls republicans are

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.200
boys let's all get along and move on

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.640
if you're a boy and you're a democrat

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.080
stop being a girl become a republican

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.240
like isn't it weird that also that they

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.559
kind of think that like once one side

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:27.600
they think that one side's going to

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.200
eventually win everything and there's

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.960
not going to be the other side

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.559
one side wins everything it's that's a

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:34.320
[ __ ] totalitarian regime

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.159
yeah so it's never going to happen they

00:22:36.159 --> 00:22:37.440
keep you get like

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.679
you know you get bush is in office and

00:22:39.679 --> 00:22:41.120
then all you know they kind of lies

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:41.679
about

00:22:41.679 --> 00:22:44.799
weapons of mass destruction which

00:22:44.799 --> 00:22:46.240
it kind of invades the country and kills

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.280
hundreds of thousands of people and

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.480
everyone's like you're a war criminal

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.840
and now people everyone says war

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.120
criminal so like what does it even mean

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.080
but

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.360
it's like you know then that happens

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.120
then you know now it's like bill clinton

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.240
then there's a bunch of scandals with

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.159
him so it's like bush [ __ ] us up so

00:22:58.159 --> 00:22:59.600
bad i'm gonna take us here then the next

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.280
republican leader after clinton is like

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.960
clinton [ __ ] up the country i'm gonna

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.400
and they just they trade back and forth

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.159
so both people are about to be like it's

00:23:06.159 --> 00:23:06.720
on

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.880
and it's never on they're just stagnated

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.240
and it's getting [ __ ] left right and

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.120
center dude the

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.520
the narrative right now is that like

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.720
black people are being hunted by the

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.360
police

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.480
white people are about to get like

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.400
completely dunked on by communism both

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.080
parties are being like yo you guys will

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:20.559
die

00:23:20.559 --> 00:23:22.400
if we don't win and that's the state

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.600
we're in right now it's like

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.200
neither of those are going to happen you

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.960
guys will be it'll be the same old [ __ ]

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.320
as it's always been

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.679
year after year they're just hyping up

00:23:29.679 --> 00:23:31.360
the fear factor on everybody because so

many

00:23:31.679 --> 00:23:33.840

00:23:36.559 --> 00:23:37.919
government makes decisions with your

00:23:37.919 --> 00:23:39.280
best interests i think 30

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.360
of people said yes so then that was

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.279
before obama

00:23:43.279 --> 00:23:45.520
so obama came and all of a sudden it's

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.400
like if you're like yo i think the

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.760

vote biden yeah all right i guess yeah i

00:24:19.279 --> 00:24:20.240
liked it back when we

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.360
when we all thought the government was

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.520
full of [ __ ] and yeah science was better

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.360
yeah you know what i mean like science

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.559
science used to be

00:24:26.559 --> 00:24:30.240
cool you know and we we used to know

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.440
remember back when we i don't remember

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.720
that yeah what are you talking about

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.679

that's what i'm talking about do you

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.400
remember back when we all had an

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.760
awareness that science

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.559
was incomplete right that it was an

00:24:56.559 --> 00:24:57.600
ongoing thing

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.159
yeah and now all of a sudden people are

00:25:00.159 --> 00:25:01.760
just like well why the [ __ ] isn't all

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.600
the science out on the coronavirus it's

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:04.960
like dude science is an incomplete thing

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.240
it's never computer you're always going

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.360
to be learning [ __ ]

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.039
yeah you know and now we're trying

00:25:09.039 --> 00:25:12.720
they're like using that against us

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.799
well lemare excuse me you're stoned

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:19.360
what what's that rumbling around what's

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.400
that rumbling around

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:24.240
it's just some water bottles ah

00:25:25.039 --> 00:25:26.640
that's what happens man you should have

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.080
went with like two white potheads

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.679
yeah you got ethnic you got ethnic

00:25:31.679 --> 00:25:33.200
potheads that's not a good idea you put

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.720
ethnic potheads together they just start

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.440
doing their own [ __ ]

00:25:38.159 --> 00:25:40.400
honestly they keep the chatter down that

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.240
would be sick if there's a constant buzz

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.120
of chatter behind us

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.480
like like you start saying something in

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.679
the mirror i was like oh no matt don't

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:48.320
go in there

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.960
don't go in there

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.880
they're just showing each other viral

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.840
videos left and right like yo check this

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.360
out

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.039
also brad you guys no one's charging

00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:01.679
their phone right now

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.279
the ultimate move if they just

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:06.640
constantly interrupted the podcast to

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.080
show you pictures of

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.360
[ __ ] fat naked women on the internet

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:15.120
about that like that one

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.720
i think they gotta do a qriket mobile

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.760
commercial where they're like and the

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:18.960
new quicker moments

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.520
the qriket mobile 7 has 30 hours 30

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.880
minutes of battery time

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:28.080
you can make it literally to work

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.120
and plug in your phone

00:26:33.279 --> 00:26:34.720
but sid i think you're absolutely right

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.880
man i think that's people now are like

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.559
i just look i just trust science and

00:26:38.559 --> 00:26:40.240
it's like

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.679
which which part of it dude there's like

00:26:41.679 --> 00:26:43.039
always conflicting views in it and

00:26:43.039 --> 00:26:44.400
people are like no i can you know the

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:44.960
one with

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.320
the most money behind it and it's like

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.400
oh okay it's always it's the science we

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.919
hear first like that's the credible

00:26:49.919 --> 00:26:50.720
science

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.640
like whatever information we hear first

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.000
or somebody in a lab coat tells us

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.520
something first we're like yes

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.360
that and then anybody else comes out

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.559
with something

00:26:58.559 --> 00:26:59.840
first of all like so you take the

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.760
coronavirus for example they were like

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.760
uh you gotta you gotta stay inside and

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.880
they're like yeah that's right you gotta

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.559
stay inside yeah and then pandemic came

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:08.080
out was like yo but that's how we build

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.159
an immunity we have to go and embrace

00:27:10.159 --> 00:27:10.880
this like

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.919
[ __ ] you dude stay inside yeah but like

00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:17.039
for years up until they said stay inside

00:27:17.039 --> 00:27:19.520
the science was get your immunity yeah

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.960
like go out there and embrace it so like

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.360
how did that even

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.360
sinus science caused uh the peanut

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.960
allergy well didn't cause it but that

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.440
was the

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.520
the the thing was like to keep kids away

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.960
from peanuts all together

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.120
like dude kids were dying because they

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.559
had you know the peanut allergies and

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:35.520
then they came out and they're like oh

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.640
actually like they're like keep all the

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.480
peanuts out of schools blah blah blah

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.080
and uh and then they came out like

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.120
actually know if you give your kids

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:41.760
peanuts

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.200
you're making the peanuts stronger you

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.600
fell right into there

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.840
mr planter dude

00:27:49.919 --> 00:27:51.520
said like no keep peanuts away from kids

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.360
just like kids and peanuts can't be near

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.320
each other anymore

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.360
and then they came out and was like

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.559
actually no the kids are dying because

00:27:56.559 --> 00:27:57.760
of that you got to expose your kids to

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:58.799
peanuts

00:27:58.799 --> 00:28:00.399
uh like really and you know people would

00:28:00.399 --> 00:28:02.399
have been like i trusted dude i brought

00:28:02.399 --> 00:28:04.000

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:09.760
there

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.520
and it was like the kids freaked out

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.799
they're like holy [ __ ] we have [ __ ]

00:28:12.799 --> 00:28:13.760

pulled peanut butter out and rubbed it

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.679
on her kid right then

00:28:43.679 --> 00:28:45.279

because i just finished eating an

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.880
uncrustable on the mat

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.360
on the mat

00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:56.640

i'm not trying to [ __ ] ruin this have

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.120
you doubled your encrustable intake

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:47.120
dude on uncrustable on the mat

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.919
i was like putting the last bite in my

00:29:49.919 --> 00:29:50.880

i don't know why but i remember in my

00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:02.240
mind you with the uncrustable in your

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:02.799
hand

00:30:02.799 --> 00:30:05.840

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.760
us more allergic to [ __ ]

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.039

corn yeah i think yeah i think it's

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.240
probably i don't know if it's the

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.440
because they used to spray pesticides i

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.360
feel like even more but i don't know

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:31.760
that's

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.840
some people say it is like kind of the

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:34.960
all the pesticides or

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.720
some we can say like the the food's

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.080
genetically modified

have you had like a regular water like a

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.440

00:34:20.879 --> 00:34:22.560

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.000
watermelon i mean it's so [ __ ]

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.520

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.119

00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:29.839
it's like every bite like yeah yeah [ __ ]

00:34:29.839 --> 00:34:30.159
that

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:31.359
it's pretty tight eating seedless

00:34:31.359 --> 00:34:33.280
watermelon is the the most in the future

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.639
i feel i'm just like dude we've mastered

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:36.960
the world

00:34:37.839 --> 00:34:39.839
that's why black people eat watermelon

00:34:39.839 --> 00:34:41.359
because we get to spit the seeds out

00:34:41.359 --> 00:34:43.839
true yeah we only eat food where we also

00:34:43.839 --> 00:34:45.839
get to spit it out

00:34:45.839 --> 00:34:47.599
like sunflower seeds do they still have

00:34:47.599 --> 00:34:49.040
that steakhouse where you can like eat

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.200
peanuts and throw them like the onions

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.679
yeah like throw the five guys the

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:55.200
waitress

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.200
burgers no no no no no star used to be

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.800
able to eat the peanuts and then just

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.160
throw the shells on the ground sid

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.839
what's the uh what's what's that black

00:35:01.839 --> 00:35:02.720
food that makes

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.800
uh where to spit the seed out you have

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.640
to cross the street really slowly

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.040
what's that sunflower seed that's for

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.079
sure sunflower seeds

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.960
that's why we eat sunflower seeds

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:18.560
sunflower seeds are cross-cultural

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.640
white dudes spit them unsuccessfully out

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.240
of their car and they just landed in the

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.599
back seat

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:27.040
like in the window like in that window

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:29.280
dude my uh so i was down in florida

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.560
recently

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.920

this is a neighbor here blah blah blah

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.320
and apparently she was like one of the

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.079
guys one of the ladies husbands just

00:35:42.079 --> 00:35:42.640

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.680
and i was like oh that sucks she's like

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.800
no it's pretty funny actually he

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.400
accidentally poisoned himself

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.680
he tried to make himself a health

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:50.240
concoction with a tonic

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.160
tonic the [ __ ] that was growing outside

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.760
he picked like i don't know if you ever

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:54.960
did this when you're like really little

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.400
you'd make potions

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.920
yeah take like weird berries and mix

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.200
them in water three different sodas yeah

00:35:59.200 --> 00:35:59.440
no

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.960
no this my cousin used to actually try

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.560
to make a poison for his neighbor

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.640
so he would mix like these weird berries

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.079
and like mash him up with mud and all

00:36:06.079 --> 00:36:07.359
kinds of [ __ ] and be like i'm gonna get

00:36:07.359 --> 00:36:08.400
her to drink this i'm like dude she's

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.520
never gonna drink that

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.040
but this guy made a potion from like

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.640
these weird berries drank it

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.680
died he made a potion for himself at

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:16.640
like 75

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.720
and [ __ ] croaked outside jesus christ

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.480
there's a 75 year old kindergartner he

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.119
was back

00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:22.560
to hide outside but apparently he had

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.200
exposed himself so i i was like

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.640
you know i was wondering as he was like

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.119
no no he he had exposed before

00:36:29.119 --> 00:36:32.640
okay wait he he was greek so yeah

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.079
oh well come on yeah that doesn't count

00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:35.440
wait i feel like i just lost time what

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.720
do you mean he exposed himself so

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.320
i was wondering why the lady was being

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.400
so kind of like he died it was hilarious

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.480
in it but apparently like a year before

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.160
he had like showed bird through her like

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:44.880
she was

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.160
looking out her way he was hell he

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.760
actually exposed bird from outside her

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.560
house he pressed it into the screen door

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.920
i think the window he just like showed

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.440
bird and was like sorry i know you're

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.240
there she's

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.160
lucky she was living next to an old

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.079
greek dude that ever had bird not

00:36:58.079 --> 00:36:58.880
exposed

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.480
true like old greek dudes always had

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.920
their dick out true

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.680

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:06.160
uh like the closer you get to like the

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.480
the source of the romance languages

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.000
like when they get older their dicks are

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.599
never for sure it's like one of those

00:37:11.599 --> 00:37:13.119
speedos with like just their balls on

00:37:13.119 --> 00:37:14.000
either side

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.359
basically it's like a thonged testicle

00:37:17.359 --> 00:37:18.960
after they take a bath they go outside

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.320
and dry it on the porch with a towel

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.200
just individual

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.520
bird rolling yeah we should get into

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.320
that show and

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.560
i would definitely show testies dude

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.520
yeah show and test

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:28.880
i was talking about showing testicle

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.560
cleavage years ago

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.240
really yeah talking like hanging them

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:33.760
out the side or just like

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.680
i don't know what the mechanics of it

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.280
would be but uh it's just got to be a

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.119
hint you need to show a hint of ball

00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:41.359
yeah but then you get the pheromones

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:42.400
flown and

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.440
who knows what kind of trouble you get

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.960
just show the one show your best one

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:45.440
true

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.960
just put the best one out there whatever

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.040
hangs lower basically yeah

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.400
yeah let them know what you're working

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.480
with i don't know

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.760
maybe i don't know i thought about

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.200
showing my balls and like i think you're

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.520
allowed to share your balls aren't you

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.200
uh i think you're allowed to show your

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.480
testicles if you're like

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.760
i don't think that's a decent expo i

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.440
think bell end constitutes some decent

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.119
exposure

00:38:07.119 --> 00:38:08.800
i can hear the mayor googling it women

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.160
can show certain points i know there

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.400
dude there's a law you can legally show

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.480
i think like half of your buck rack i

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.680
think there's a limit

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.520
on your buck rack before like it goes

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.440
from plumbers to like moon

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.800
so i think you're loud i think legally

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.480
you're allowed to expose someone to like

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:24.000
three inches of your buck crack

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.079
yeah i remember when uh it's your

00:38:26.079 --> 00:38:28.240
god-given right the wwf figured that out

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:28.880
with lita

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.200
and she got to show her crack on tv

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.640
every monday night they had the they had

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.240
the ratio down

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:37.520
what is it the mayor what

essentially nor any bell end

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.760
uh a person commits the crime of

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.200
indecent exposure if

gratify sexual desire of himself or of

00:39:31.359 --> 00:39:34.960
any person other than his spouse

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.480
he exposes his genitals under

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.880
circumstances in which he knows his con

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.359
he knows his conduct is likely to cause

00:39:41.359 --> 00:39:43.599
a front or alarm in any public place

00:39:43.599 --> 00:39:46.560
or the private premise of another or so

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:47.839
near there too

00:39:47.839 --> 00:39:50.240
as to be seen from such private premises

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.280

00:39:56.079 --> 00:39:58.720
wet that that's fine that's good unless

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.240
someone else saw it unless someone else

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:00.880

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.680
of your fault

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:58.960
i mean the dude was and that's the other

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.720
thing the guy i think he was like i'm

just taking a piss but it might be

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.520
because i think people who need to show

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.680
bird it's like a real compulsion like

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:06.800

it's like when you get those flat

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.200
[ __ ] snakey turds i've been rocking

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.480

00:48:19.119 --> 00:48:20.880
intestines will kind of uh

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:24.480
like one spot of your testaments that

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:25.200
are inflamed

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.680
and then the turd gets play-doh molded

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.440
like it's like steamrolled oh it kinks

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.000
the hose

had to look into like

00:50:02.319 --> 00:50:03.680
um as far as they're like as far as you

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.920
can go back see like your grandparents

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:06.240
like

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.520
what was up with their life and do like

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:09.280
a whole like family tree like genealogy

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:10.319
thing because you're trying to assess

00:50:10.319 --> 00:50:10.880
like

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:12.400
intergenerational stuff in like your

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.880
personal family context

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:17.119
and i my aunt was like yeah your

00:50:17.119 --> 00:50:18.000
great-grandmom

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.599
dropped one of her kids into the

00:50:19.599 --> 00:50:21.440
schuylkill oh yeah i remember the story

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:22.960
dude i was like we were down in florida

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.079
and i was near the gulf and i was

00:50:24.079 --> 00:50:25.280
holding maya we're checking out the fish

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:26.079
and i was like

00:50:26.079 --> 00:50:27.760
death gripping i was like dude this [ __ ]

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.359
is [ __ ] in the family

00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:31.200
i was so scared of [ __ ] dropping her

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.720
in the water because i was like we're

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.000
feeding there's all these catfish coming

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.359
up it was super fun but i was like these

00:50:35.359 --> 00:50:36.480
are the perfect this is probably what

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:37.520
got one of my

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:40.400
great uncles dude

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:45.359
[Laughter]

00:50:45.359 --> 00:50:47.599
imagine dropping like a [ __ ] 18 month

00:50:47.599 --> 00:50:49.760
old into the water

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.680
that's it game over dude did i talk

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:53.760
about the [ __ ] the kayaking kid on

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:54.240
here

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.480
no when i was in uh when i was in the

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:57.760
pacific northwest we went to this

00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.040
[ __ ] campground i talked about this

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:00.480
on dead meat but uh

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.640
this [ __ ] dad took his uh 10 year old

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:04.720
son kayaking they're in separate kayaks

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:07.200
and this river was this river was so

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.040
wild that i wouldn't even get into it as

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.240
like a joke oh

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:12.160
yeah and they got separated the dad

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:13.280
thought of his kayak

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.359
and he swam to shore and just watched

00:51:15.359 --> 00:51:16.880
his 10 year old

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:19.920
go down the river and it's that was the

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:21.359
beginning of july there's still people

00:51:21.359 --> 00:51:22.640
up there looking for the kid

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:24.160
yeah they're like he might have got out

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:25.440
he might have escaped the river and like

00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:26.960
camped out he had pretty good survival

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:27.760
skills

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.280
dude the weekend i was there i was

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.720
swimming in like the lakes and [ __ ] like

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:31.280
that

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.839
i i got up in the middle of the night in

00:51:33.839 --> 00:51:34.800
a light rain

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:36.640
and i was so cold i was like i might die

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.160
before i get back to my tent from like

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.359
500 feet away

00:51:39.359 --> 00:51:40.319
and they were like yeah maybe he's out

00:51:40.319 --> 00:51:41.760
there maybe he's out there just so

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.680
anyway this dude just watched his his

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:45.200
ten-year-old just sail off out of his

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:45.599
life

00:51:45.599 --> 00:51:47.280
he's like oh 10 year old probably found

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.599
a dad that wasn't a [ __ ] and was like

00:51:49.599 --> 00:51:51.520
true that was what my wife said i was

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:52.640
like can you believe the dad got out of

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.000
the water she was like i would make you

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:54.800
get back in

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.319
right we'd drive back and i would watch

00:51:56.319 --> 00:51:58.000
you get back in the river yeah dude

00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:58.880
that's crazy

00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:01.760
that is crazy so be be kind to your

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.280
ancestors man who knows what the river

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:04.400
was looking like that day maybe it

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:04.800
rained

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:07.200
vehicle yeah maybe the skew the skuggle

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.960
i mean this cubicle is no it has a

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.319
little current but there's no wrap i

00:52:10.319 --> 00:52:10.720
mean

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:12.400
also the water is like it's basically

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:14.480
like half water half like oil

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:16.319
so it's true probably that it was

00:52:16.319 --> 00:52:17.760
probably super dark and the kid was just

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.119
do you ever uh there's this one pool

00:52:19.119 --> 00:52:20.480
game i played i went to a summer camp on

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.280
time and they

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.000
they covered a watermelon and vaseline

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:24.400
and

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:25.359
you had to like fight over the

00:52:25.359 --> 00:52:26.800
watermelon in the pool who knows how

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.240
slippery that bait maybe they got the

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:29.680
baby a couple times like oh

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.000
true it was just like it was just gone

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.920
yeah well there's like an iphone back

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:34.960
then you're just like

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.520
just a phone

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:41.839
you shouldn't leave your phone man

00:52:41.839 --> 00:52:43.440
go to a [ __ ] iranian dude for crack

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:47.839
baby repair

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:52.319
like the baby was gone it was a gone

00:52:52.319 --> 00:52:54.079
like the baby as far as i know unless

00:52:54.079 --> 00:52:54.480
yeah

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.640
you know unless she just [ __ ] cause

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.319
because a lot of parent drop stories

00:52:58.319 --> 00:52:58.960
it's like

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:01.119
you pick it right back up yeah you know

00:53:01.119 --> 00:53:02.720
and it's like ah you still tell the

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:03.359
story because

00:53:03.359 --> 00:53:06.400
i want to do babies float yeah

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:07.839
okay yeah there's there's that thing

00:53:07.839 --> 00:53:09.359
where they like take newborns and throw

00:53:09.359 --> 00:53:10.160
them in water

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:13.119
and they have like that swim reflex yeah

00:53:13.119 --> 00:53:15.839
huh

00:53:16.559 --> 00:53:19.680
i mean there's noah yeah noah floated in

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.040
the basket

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.640
that might have been mostly bad yeah

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.880
basketball

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:25.760
that's the thing if you're taking your

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.280
kid to the water take a wicker basket

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:28.720
true at least you'll end up in like the

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:30.000
hands of the pharaoh will end up in a

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.599
really cool book at some point

00:53:31.599 --> 00:53:32.720
every second we floated all the way up

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:34.079
to the northeast and got to like the

00:53:34.079 --> 00:53:36.960
head contractor

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:41.280
i'ma name this baby james

but yeah man that's uh i was like dude

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:44.319
that would [ __ ]

00:53:44.319 --> 00:53:45.680
the whole time i was there i was like

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:47.280
all right even if you did sink could i

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.960
like see and would i jump it dude

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:50.240
the whole time was like doing math of

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.880
like jumping yeah partly being like also

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:56.640

00:53:57.119 --> 00:53:58.240
i'm like kind of tortured by that

00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.359
question because she goes she comes in

00:53:59.359 --> 00:54:00.720
the pool with us and i'm like

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:03.200
would she hold her breath if i just went

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:03.920
under real quick

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:05.760
i'm curious but i'm like also could she

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.280
gulping it in there

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.280
yeah dude one time we were at a

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.599
playground and finn was like my son was

00:54:11.599 --> 00:54:13.520
on a slide and he was sliding down

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.359
like on his stomach and like like as he

00:54:15.359 --> 00:54:16.800

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:17.280
me

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:19.200
and then one time he did it like i dove

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:21.359
on my stomach and grabbed his hand

00:54:21.359 --> 00:54:23.119
and he still recalls that as dad

00:54:23.119 --> 00:54:24.480
remember that one time you saved me on

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.960
the slide

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:29.040
where was woozy about to like go down

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.480
and get crushed i just did it for

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.559
to be funny i was just like i got you

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.200
death yeah yeah yeah but

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.960
he still remembers that as me saving him

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:38.480
i'm pretty tired dude it's

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:40.559
and i feel like a hero every time i

00:54:40.559 --> 00:54:41.520
think about it

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:43.839

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:54.640
grandkid

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:57.200
yeah did you see the guy who like

00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:58.880
ditched his son

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:00.640
or did you hear about it no we got there

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.000
the day that the search party

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.839
started yeah come on i'd be in the river

00:55:03.839 --> 00:55:05.680
right now also dude there should be a

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:06.000
rule

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.760
if you jump into a river like that and

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.520
save someone else's kid that's yours

00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:10.799
should get the buck their wife no you

00:55:10.799 --> 00:55:12.000
give the kid back you should get the

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:12.720
buck their wife

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:13.760
or take their kids it should be like a

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:14.960
carnival you get to pick if they're all

00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:16.799
in the same prize level

00:55:16.799 --> 00:55:18.319
i mean naturally you should at least get

00:55:18.319 --> 00:55:20.400
hit yeah [ __ ] man

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:23.520
here's your kid i need head right now it

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:23.920
just

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:25.520
has to happen it's a perfect price

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.119
because any woman would sug

00:55:27.119 --> 00:55:32.240
to get their kid back from her shirt for

00:55:32.839 --> 00:55:34.559
sure

00:55:34.559 --> 00:55:35.920
i'd be so pissed that's the girl's

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.599
version be like well i was supposed to

00:55:37.599 --> 00:55:38.880
suck his dick and i didn't want him

00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.640
you're telling me to suck his dick and

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.640
our kid floated down the river

00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:44.880
what the [ __ ] get out of the way i'll do

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:46.480
it

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.240
give me it come that's actually what it

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:50.880
should be like if the dad is there

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:53.200
tim jumps in saves their kid the mom

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.640
should get to choose which one of them

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:55.599
sucked tim's dick

00:55:55.599 --> 00:55:57.760
yeah either she would want to so badly

00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:58.960
that she would do it or she would be

00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:00.640
able to force her husband to

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:03.440
true that would be so sick also first of

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:35.119
those windows that was low enough

00:58:35.119 --> 00:58:37.280
that if you like you step it would like

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:38.880
you could step out of it and be touching

00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:40.240
the ground and still in the house at the

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:41.599
same time you went head first though

00:58:41.599 --> 00:58:44.960

house my cousin's house yeah

00:58:49.119 --> 00:58:51.359
to tell his mom what happened and then

00:58:51.359 --> 00:58:52.720
they all went down to the house and they

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.400
were banging on the door and everything

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:55.920
it was it was a big deal that's a big

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:57.599
[ __ ] deal it was a bit and then like

00:58:57.599 --> 00:59:00.240

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:01.599
my cousin they got him out

00:59:01.599 --> 00:59:02.799

00:59:02.799 --> 00:59:04.640
about this again yeah

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:07.520
yeah like i mean he never expressed

00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.520
whether or not he did suck the dick

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:12.400
but he had that's usually the first sign

00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:13.920
of having sucked the dick yeah

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:15.760
yeah but no definitely not what do you

00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:17.280

00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:18.319
yeah it was pretty it was pretty

00:59:18.319 --> 00:59:20.160
ridiculous you know i'm i'm just how do

00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:21.599
you get hit by the car

00:59:21.599 --> 00:59:24.000
he so uh years later which was probably

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:24.960
retribution for

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.640
me leaving him to get his dick get to

00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:29.200

00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:32.400
it was almost as if he planned it he

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:34.480
came into the rec center and was like yo

00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:35.839

00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:40.559
and then we crossed the street and there

00:59:40.559 --> 00:59:41.520

00:59:44.799 --> 00:59:48.720
run up to the hedges and then

00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:51.760

team and they would always

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.599
after they would like work out by

01:02:45.599 --> 01:02:47.280
themselves like outside of the school

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.480
and they would hang out at this one part

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:50.319
of the rec center and then one time

01:02:50.319 --> 01:02:52.160
trenis was like yeah let's go let's go

going up there to talk to him

01:02:58.079 --> 01:03:02.640
he has a handful of like gravel rocks

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.200
as soon as like and i'm like we're going

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.720
to talk to them and he's like slightly

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.480
behind me and i'm like yo without corey

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.200
what happened

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.920
and then you know

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.880
and then they just come at us and like i

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:16.400
didn't even realize what was happening

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.520
at first

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.359
so like i i didn't start running fast

01:03:19.359 --> 01:03:21.280
enough and it was just like

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:23.200
i barely just they just swarmed on me it

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.319
was like

01:03:24.319 --> 01:03:26.160
i must have got hit like 30 times in a

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.160
second and then they were just by me

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.079
chasing him oh my god oh yeah they

01:03:30.079 --> 01:03:31.599
[ __ ] i have a theory do you think

01:03:31.599 --> 01:03:32.319
that maybe

01:03:32.319 --> 01:03:34.319
his like fixation on like this chase

01:03:34.319 --> 01:03:35.839
[ __ ] and you

01:03:35.839 --> 01:03:39.280
was uh because you escaped the the day

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.039
where he was forced to suck a dick

01:03:41.039 --> 01:03:42.640
and he was just constantly reliving that

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.000
situation he was the one who wanted to

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.760
get sucked right no no no no

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:48.319
he had to stop he had to suck oh okay

01:03:48.319 --> 01:03:49.920
and sid escaped i thought there was

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:50.799
i was just saying i was like why would

01:03:50.799 --> 01:03:52.960
you chill on the dude sid made a a

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.559
sydney-shaped hole in the wall and got

01:03:54.559 --> 01:03:56.319
him

01:03:56.319 --> 01:03:58.960
and he was like he was the guy i thought

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.240
he was pushing in front of the car for

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.000
getting away he was like [ __ ] so

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:02.559
now

01:04:02.559 --> 01:04:03.920
that guy's out of the picture then yeah

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.000
he was always he was always uh

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.280
yo you want to go he would like

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.559
literally come up to where we all were

01:04:08.559 --> 01:04:10.240
and be like yo you want to go get chased

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.680

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:13.599
like he was he was trying to recreate

01:04:13.599 --> 01:04:14.559
that scenario

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:16.079
and and come up with an outcome where he

01:04:16.079 --> 01:04:18.240
didn't suck at trying to get away yeah

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.520
trying to be you dude he's trying to get

if i was ever jealous of anybody for

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:26.559

all of us were sitting in the room and

01:04:27.599 --> 01:04:29.280
you guys escaped and i ended up blowing

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.079
somebody

01:04:30.079 --> 01:04:31.760

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.079
million dollars but i won't be forced to

01:05:28.079 --> 01:05:29.280
yeah i hear you're saying it has to be

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:31.359
like a have like a meeting

01:05:31.359 --> 01:05:33.839

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:46.559
uh i don't know what a million dollars

01:05:46.559 --> 01:05:48.160
looks like but it perfectly fills this

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.720
very nice like dark metal briefcase

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.960
it's handcuffed to your wrist right okay

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.319
before i start sucking

01:05:54.319 --> 01:05:56.799
we also handcuff it to my wrist there

01:05:56.799 --> 01:05:57.440
you go

01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:58.960

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.799

01:06:00.799 --> 01:06:05.839

01:06:08.559 --> 01:06:09.920
handcuff rattles all this

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:12.799
yeah yeah yeah dude for a million

01:06:12.799 --> 01:06:14.160
dollars i would make that dude come so

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.520
hard that he'd be like worried about his

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:19.839
own identity

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.119
this was just supposed to be

01:06:23.119 --> 01:06:25.119
uncomfortable for you it is funny though

01:06:25.119 --> 01:06:26.480
if you think about it it's like alright

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:29.039
anymore i used to go up like 120 feet in

01:06:29.039 --> 01:06:30.960
the air on like a lift and like just

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:32.559
hit like there's like cut down metal

01:06:32.559 --> 01:06:34.160
beams and [ __ ] which is pretty dangerous

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.520
and there's guys who like

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:37.920
go to war for like college tuition but

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:39.119
it's like

01:06:39.119 --> 01:06:42.000
you're gonna suck a dick

01:06:42.319 --> 01:06:44.240
it's like you know if you break it down

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.440
just like you know if you're just seeing

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.119
they're all sucking dick in our own way

01:06:47.119 --> 01:06:47.520
dude

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.280
yeah i mean it's it's pretty nuts for me

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:50.319
like now i'm not going to talk dick i'm

01:06:50.319 --> 01:06:50.880
going to go

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.000
i'm going to go fight over here i'm

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.520
going to go enter combat

01:06:56.079 --> 01:06:57.440
i mean dude this is [ __ ] i mean

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.359
there's the opportunity so stupid

01:06:59.359 --> 01:07:02.880
true i will say

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:05.920
you probably could suck enough enough

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:08.000
dicks to go to college

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.839
oh but you couldn't be an engineer you

01:07:09.839 --> 01:07:11.119
typically wouldn't get like paid to be

01:07:11.119 --> 01:07:12.240
like an engineer

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.799
meaning like you know going to like army

01:07:14.799 --> 01:07:16.640
or the army then you can just like

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.680
i guess you could suck your dick and be

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:20.079
an engineer yeah i feel like uh i don't

01:07:20.079 --> 01:07:20.319
know

01:07:20.319 --> 01:07:21.680
this is this is you're right yeah this

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:23.760
is junk i'm losing my mind

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.280
i'm having a hard time even tracking the

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:26.880
logic now well

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.000
i'm saying there's a lot of dangerous

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.440
jobs that guys will do and it's like yo

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.799
go suck that guy's dick and they're like

01:07:30.799 --> 01:07:31.520
yeah

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.760
the least likely you look to suck a dick

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.119
the more you could get paid for sucking

01:07:35.119 --> 01:07:35.359
them

01:07:35.359 --> 01:07:38.880
true no that is true yeah

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.400
so maybe spend a couple of years like

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.079
learning how to weld first looking like

01:07:42.079 --> 01:07:43.760
