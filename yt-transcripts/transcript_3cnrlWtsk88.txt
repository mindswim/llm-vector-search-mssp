i mean the whole time i've tried to

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.360

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.800
talking about it seriously

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.199

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.320
know but i hear you it's tough to uh

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.759
that's a tough thing to navigate because

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.040
the whole when you're thinking and

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.639
talking and there's another voice

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.240
being like shut up [ __ ] yeah you're

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.919
talking it's

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.000
it's just crabs it was it was pure

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.199

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.759
yeah it's funny if you know me

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:02.960
true yeah you don't know me they're

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.199
probably what the [ __ ] is this no

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.720
i think that too i wonder that but

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.639
there's also if i'm just chilling there

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.240
and all of a sudden that comes up i'd be

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.720
i'd be laughing pretty hard yeah because

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.160
you did a good job [ __ ] around it

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.880
wasn't like

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.240
you know it's funny no one ever

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.400
acknowledges the real maybe they do

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.520
but i don't i never hear people

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.639
acknowledging the reality of how

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.000
nerve-wracking that is

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.320
well the temptation to go deep on rogan

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.120
i think is

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.639
i would want to be like i don't know

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.080

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.000
conversations with them but then if i

so parents do yeah moms are on the

00:14:34.079 --> 00:14:35.279
lookout they know what their daughter

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:35.680

this the wrong way

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.560

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.959
long history of dating minorities

00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:49.279

00:14:52.639 --> 00:14:55.120
way but i've noticed they do turn into

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.480
beezer what i broke the news on war mode

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.360
that he can't swim

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.159
beezer might not be able to swim what he

00:30:46.159 --> 00:30:46.960
won't swim

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.399
parents have a house at the shore that's

00:30:48.399 --> 00:30:51.679
his argument we went through it

00:30:51.679 --> 00:30:53.200
so he doesn't have to prove himself he's

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.279
like that's his alibi i don't remember

00:30:55.279 --> 00:30:56.000
him getting in

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.600
verbatim dude we were at the beach that

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.840
entire day me and shane blacked out

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.600
but i don't remember him getting in the

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:02.960

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.960
maybe like ankle deep water did he well

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.320
none of us swam it

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.399
i jumped i think i went no i mean i'm

00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:09.440
saying when we were down in

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:12.159
hill no the water was too cold it's oh

00:31:12.159 --> 00:31:13.840

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.679
yeah but it was it was march no but

00:31:15.679 --> 00:31:17.200

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.840
puts his feet in the water

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.039
yeah i'm telling you dude i've never

00:31:59.039 --> 00:32:01.360
seen no actually beezer and i went

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.760
beezer came in once okay but it's big

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.440
news he's body surfed a little bit

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.200
oh all right was he on a boogie board oh

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.720
he's body stuff no no he just straight

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.480
up body surf this is unfounded then

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.399
all right good good but he didn't go in

00:32:12.399 --> 00:32:14.720
the pool

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.279
now the issue is even deeper he can swim

00:32:17.279 --> 00:32:17.760
but

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.919
he's a salt water fish true he might

00:32:19.919 --> 00:32:21.120
have salt water dude

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.600
he also is actually very saltwater you

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.640
might have actually

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.399
yeah he also may be doing that thing

00:32:26.399 --> 00:32:28.000
what's it like when when babies can't

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.519
walk on their own yet but they like they

00:32:29.519 --> 00:32:31.120
glide or whatever it's called what's it

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.640
called when they just like hold on to a

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.760
table and then they're like

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.399
uh like what's it called maybe he does a

00:32:36.399 --> 00:32:37.360
bottle or something

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.960
called business he never went deeper

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.880
than him

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.039
beat

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:49.440
[Laughter]

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.399
hey you guys said he can't swim i said

00:32:52.399 --> 00:32:53.440
he could no now it's just

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.360
a little swim and it's i think the fresh

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.480
water theory might be the

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.240
freshwater theory dude that dude that

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.279
makes so much more sense because it was

00:32:59.279 --> 00:33:00.399
a saltwater pool

00:33:00.399 --> 00:33:01.919
he asked me a hundred questions about

00:33:01.919 --> 00:33:03.600
the saltwater he's like so like

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.799
what does it do i'm like nothing it's

00:33:04.799 --> 00:33:11.840
just a little bit because

00:33:16.399 --> 00:33:17.840
does it help this does it do that's why

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.000
no one knows how old he is

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.360
if you ask him one day he's like five

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.279
thousand forty that's why he loves me

00:33:23.279 --> 00:33:24.880
how old are you dude that's why he loves

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.799
dmt he smokes emt like he's like yeah he

00:33:26.799 --> 00:33:28.320
talks to his friends like the earthlings

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.039
are treating you well

00:33:31.279 --> 00:33:33.140
yeah the earthlings are pretty cool

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.360

it's like i can have it it's just a very

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.079
unpleasant experience it never

00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:32.160
has been a stimulant for me really i

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.520
don't know i remember like when i took

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.520
it at

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.760
that like two weeks later after you took

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.200
it and i like

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.359
i had to leave helium immediately i

00:35:41.359 --> 00:35:43.040
walked home in the cold and i felt like

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.079
i always could feel my like

00:35:44.079 --> 00:35:47.359
bones cracking it was like nuts

00:35:47.359 --> 00:35:50.079
yeah it was crazy i just it was nuts and

00:35:50.079 --> 00:35:51.599
then i finally like got into apartment

00:35:51.599 --> 00:35:52.640
and i was just like oh

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:56.079
nice and just like put him on tv

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.079
it is the best i'm excited i'm running

00:35:58.079 --> 00:35:59.520
under the sheets and [ __ ]

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.119
that's my that's my one concern dude i

00:36:01.119 --> 00:36:02.720
do not handle stimulants well

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.920
i hope physically crazy you would have

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.520
i'll [ __ ] die dude i gotta get you

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.599
one of those b12 shots and some

00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:12.000
b12 espresso dude a nutritionist gave me

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:12.720
b12 and

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.400
i looked at the bottle it's 24 they give

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.560
you like 24 thousand percent of it

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.560
i'm b2 i'm low in b12 what does that

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.320
mean 24 000

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.880
it's just it's 24 000 of the daily

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.720
recommended dose but you pee it out

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.240
so they're like let's just cram as much

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.000
of this into you as possible and let you

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.200
just pee it all out

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.839
okay can your body only absorb so much

00:36:31.839 --> 00:36:33.440
or can it pretty much but it'll like

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.079
they try to

00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:36.560
because it's like depending on how bio

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.920
available it is so you can give someone

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:38.800
24 000

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.079
of it but like how much is your body

00:36:40.079 --> 00:36:42.000
actually gonna absorb yeah and dude they

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.119
don't really [ __ ] know

00:36:43.119 --> 00:36:44.880
you know in terms of like is that really

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.079
twenty four thousand percent for you is

00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:47.760
that twelve thousand percent but

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.520
don't get started on people like shots

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.119
yeah i don't like needles dude

00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:52.560
no i don't mind needles i just don't

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.160
like the the idea of shooting myself

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.720
with beets i'd rather take a flintstones

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.400

for real you can just tell everyone you

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.560

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.000

i don't know about that yeah the booster

00:37:48.079 --> 00:37:49.359
i don't know about that you can hold off

00:37:49.359 --> 00:37:49.760
you can

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.520
you can you got some time yeah you got

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.880
to wait what like three months between

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.680
them or something no

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.000
days what 21 days yeah why is that

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.200
what's the [ __ ] up with that no one

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.560
knows how any of this works and

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.000
everybody talks about it with complete

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.119
certainty i don't know that's why you

00:38:01.119 --> 00:38:02.800
had to wait for time to moon phases for

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.800
the fight i don't i i don't understand

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:08.400
like what how uh like if you have it

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.200
if you've had it and your body has the

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.240
immune

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.839
response yeah like people don't know how

00:38:13.839 --> 00:38:15.599
long why does that only last

00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:17.359
why does that last less long than well

00:38:17.359 --> 00:38:18.560
that scene i don't know they're like we

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.560
think that it we yet we think it doesn't

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.000
very well against the variance that's

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:22.720
all they say

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.640
dude they just want 70 of people to do

thinking she's old she doesn't have like

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.920
twitter or instagram so she's just like

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:04.720
oh here's something

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.000
well there's people who you know she

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.359
like believes in like the civic

00:39:07.359 --> 00:39:09.119
structure of the country so she was like

00:39:09.119 --> 00:39:10.640
this is important i got to tell people

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.560
my information i do too but also like

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.040
i'm not

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.440
my time i got time for that you're too

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.680
busy

00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:21.839
have you done jury duty no no no did you

00:39:21.839 --> 00:39:22.400
go

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:29.839
no i don't so you have scanned it yeah

00:39:29.839 --> 00:39:31.280
but yeah dude the uh but they're going

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.720
to start giving them to the kids i think

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.680
12 and older

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.119
and if you don't get the vax they're

00:39:35.119 --> 00:39:36.400
going to make the kids who aren't vacs

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.480
to wear a mask to school

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.839
dude that's that's where it's like all

00:39:39.839 --> 00:39:41.440
right you guys are being evil now

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.640
because statistically you're not at risk

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.839
like well they could transmit it to an

00:39:43.839 --> 00:39:45.680
adult it's like dude if you're an adult

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.800
scared of kid viruses you're a [ __ ]

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.680
if you're gonna make kids be like wear

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.040
[ __ ] on their faces well now the reason

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.160
they're doing that is because they're

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.599
saying

00:39:55.599 --> 00:39:58.320
kids can get the virus gonna commutate

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.000
in kids like they'll be fine but then

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.760
they'll create a new i don't know dude

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:02.320

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.160
[ __ ] no one knows that's like marvel who

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.440
the unsung heroes of

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.839

noise cancelling headphones have been a

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:54.400
huge victory for

should be

00:46:17.359 --> 00:46:18.880
you know yeah they got to take that

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.480
moment to just represent everybody they

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.400

here's how you survive and have like 10

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.720

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.680
corn festival where they worshipped like

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:40.400
like a gift from the garden

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:42.480
almost every culture that plants stuff

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:44.319
has a thing about a god being cut to

00:53:44.319 --> 00:53:45.520
pieces and planted in the ground and

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:46.800
that's how the coconut tree came up this

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:47.280
is how

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.440

beautiful young lady dude the hottest

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.000
chick in the village

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000
they make her wear like this the clothes

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.079
of like the corn goddess

00:53:58.079 --> 00:53:59.440
and it's like a three-day thing everyone

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.440

00:54:05.359 --> 00:54:07.440
goddess hell yeah hell yeah eventually

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:08.160
do a big

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.520
after seven days of fasting to give him

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:11.200
a big banquet of like seeds and all this

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:12.000
stuff

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.640
and then at the end of it they [ __ ]

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.000
cut the chick's head off in front of the

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:16.960
whole village

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.440
and then the high priest buffalo bills

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:20.240
her skin

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.319
all just for her body the head just like

00:54:22.319 --> 00:54:24.000
goes somewhere and then he takes

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.839
all of her body skin wraps it around

00:54:25.839 --> 00:54:28.079
himself and then puts on her clothes and

00:54:28.079 --> 00:54:29.280
walks around and does the rest of the

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.240
procession

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:32.079
so you're a [ __ ] dude in this i feel

00:54:32.079 --> 00:54:33.680
like this is mostly to control the tribe

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:34.240
like the

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.839
you know the dudes will compete over a

00:54:35.839 --> 00:54:38.000
two hot chick and they kill her

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.240
dude well a lot of it too their life was

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:42.079
so entwined with violence because

00:54:42.079 --> 00:54:44.240
you worship nature and like nature is

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.319
very violent so these guys were like god

00:54:46.319 --> 00:54:46.880
thinks it's

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.400
awesome when we just cut chicks hearts

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.319
out so that's what was going on then

00:54:50.319 --> 00:54:51.680
you're some dude from spain and you see

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:53.040
this and you're like

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:56.240
[ __ ] this this is [ __ ] this is so

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:56.960
[ __ ] up

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.400
is this why all babes want to get

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.400
murdered yes dude only the hottest

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:01.839
chicks got murdered dude

00:55:01.839 --> 00:55:04.240
but there's these african dudes and like

00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:05.440
so there's like the difference between

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:05.760
the

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:07.200
people who are horticulturalists have

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.440
like this like kind of regenerative

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:09.920
thing like

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.200
dying and coming just looking at your

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.130
dick pressed again

00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:16.880
[Laughter]

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.720
dude but i was this is a little kid in

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:21.240
the back of a station wagon

00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:24.079
[Music]

00:55:24.079 --> 00:55:25.400
i'm the trucker behind

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:27.280
[Laughter]

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.400
so this is what made me think of you

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.240
directly so then there's these african

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.280
villages where like if

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:32.480
the strict hunters had different

00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:33.839
mythologies they didn't have like an

00:55:33.839 --> 00:55:35.280
ordained priest class

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:38.559
would you bum your funny bone the first

00:55:38.559 --> 00:55:40.720
funny thing you've done

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:42.319
i couldn't think of seriously i knew

00:55:42.319 --> 00:55:44.640
there was something there

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:47.040
so there's this african village and they

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.720
if you didn't get to like

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.319
planting stuff and growing and having

00:55:50.319 --> 00:55:51.839
like an ordained priest class

00:55:51.839 --> 00:55:53.440
that's where like shamans came and

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:55.280
anyone could apply so you would just be

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.440
like i'm gonna fast for seven days

00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:59.359
you could just fast as many at least the

00:55:59.359 --> 00:56:00.559
native american indians

00:56:00.559 --> 00:56:02.400
well some shaman places like you had a

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.680
descendant that was a shaman but you

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:04.720
could just fast

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:06.720
and be like i had these crazy dreams

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:07.760
they'd be like

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:09.200
sounds pretty [ __ ] cool dude you're

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.400
but you also had to do like a bunch of

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.680
crazy rites of passage

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:13.839
so it was just chaos dude so like all

00:56:13.839 --> 00:56:15.359
they believed in was ghosts

00:56:15.359 --> 00:56:17.520
and life never ended you just died and

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:19.040
then they're like any time something bad

00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:20.400
happened you're like dude that guy

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:22.880
we like murdered his village obviously

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:24.559
tore my [ __ ] ankle blah blah he's a

00:56:24.559 --> 00:56:25.359
snake now

00:56:25.359 --> 00:56:26.559
but if there was a guy who was like a

00:56:26.559 --> 00:56:29.119
force of nature had a large personality

00:56:29.119 --> 00:56:30.559
they would die so like you'd be getting

00:56:30.559 --> 00:56:32.240
sick right and all of a sudden everyone

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:33.440
would be like yo shane's getting pretty

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:35.040
sick his ghost is gonna be a

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:37.440
[ __ ] so they would like pile

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:38.480
rocks on the

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:41.359
on the uh the grave or if someone was a

00:56:41.359 --> 00:56:42.640
big enough [ __ ]

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:43.920
when they died they'd burn the village

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:46.559
down and run away

00:56:46.799 --> 00:56:48.720
like his ghost is going to be such a

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:50.480
[ __ ] yeah dude imagine

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:53.119
maybe laughs so hard just piling rocks

00:56:53.119 --> 00:56:54.000
on the grave like i

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.520
hope this holds them they have to do

00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:57.599
that ghosts can't get past the rocks no

00:56:57.599 --> 00:56:58.559
apparently you can't just go

00:56:58.559 --> 00:57:00.240
sideways they're very physical dude yeah

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:01.599

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:27.680
what the [ __ ] it was in that into the

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:29.520
wild book i think it was about like

00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:31.280
northeastern native american tribes

white guys yeah because remember that

00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.240
story i told you they like the indians

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:37.760
on the way to the

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:40.319
gauntlet were like say this on you and

00:57:40.319 --> 00:57:41.839

he was just yelling that native american

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:46.640
but uh

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.160
they would like do the same thing like

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:49.520
they would torture someone and then as

00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:51.040
soon as that person left they would go

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:52.559
like hot to hut and each person would

00:57:52.559 --> 00:57:53.280
torture them

00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.640
yeah like you'd go into one room some

00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:55.839
old lady would just bite one of your

00:57:55.839 --> 00:57:56.720
fingers off

00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:58.960
what but then they would all hit sticks

00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:00.640
on their house where what they did was

00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:02.000
[ __ ] up they were like get the spirits

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.520
out get the spirit away yeah they would

00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:03.760
all

00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:05.040
they all believed in that same great

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.720
spirit dude yeah the apaches they were

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:06.960
say

00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:08.480
that was an apache that's how the apache

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:09.680
would become the medicine man at any

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:10.559
point you could just

00:58:10.559 --> 00:58:12.640
have like wild dreams and you'd be like

00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:13.680
all right i'm going to go for my fast

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:14.960
there's a rite of passage

00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:16.720
and you would go in a little tent for

00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:18.400
seven days and then you'd come out and

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:19.040
be like

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.720
this spirit came me blah blah blah a lot

00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:22.160
of them would cut their a lot of apaches

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:23.520
would cut their fingers off

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:25.359
so you just caught a digit and there's a

00:58:25.359 --> 00:58:27.200
lot of apache like medicine men

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:29.200
who only had enough hand action just to

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:30.559
pull a bow back

00:58:30.559 --> 00:58:32.240
so that's all they would just have stubs

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:33.760
but they could [ __ ] rip a bow

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:37.040
hard wild bros dude yeah thank god we're

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:37.839
done with that

00:58:37.839 --> 00:58:39.359
dude the stuff they were talking about i

00:58:39.359 --> 00:58:40.880
talked about a little bit on our patreon

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.880
with billion spud the [ __ ] they did

00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:45.599
and i think uh the indigenous people to

00:58:45.599 --> 00:58:46.799
australia

00:58:46.799 --> 00:58:49.599
dude they would take your dong and slid

00:58:49.599 --> 00:58:50.799
first they would circu

00:58:50.799 --> 00:58:52.720
and then they would slit up the back

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.319
side of your dog

00:58:54.319 --> 00:58:55.839
and the idea was that you were supposed

00:58:55.839 --> 00:58:57.520
to the underside underside dude

00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:59.119
it's called a sub-incision they would

00:58:59.119 --> 00:59:00.480
take the bottom they first of all you

00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:01.280
would

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:03.119
they'd put you in a hut for like seven

00:59:03.119 --> 00:59:04.799
this is just a sharpened rock this is

00:59:04.799 --> 00:59:05.680
yeah man

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:07.839
this is not like a ginsu knife this is

00:59:07.839 --> 00:59:09.200
the shopping rock

00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:10.720
and then you had to sit in a [ __ ] hut

00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:12.480
for like seven days and you're drinking

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:13.920
only like your uncle's blood

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:15.440
but their blood was coming from their

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:17.200
dick cut they'd open up their dick cut

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:18.960
and they'd pour it in like a [ __ ]

00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.640
like bowl and you were just drinking

00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:22.799
blood of your the blood of your uncles

00:59:22.799 --> 00:59:24.559
and then they would circu and once you

00:59:24.559 --> 00:59:26.079
healed they'd bring you back

00:59:26.079 --> 00:59:27.920
in front of your village and then a dude

00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:29.359
would slay down another guy would lay on

00:59:29.359 --> 00:59:31.119
him and you'd lay on like your like your

00:59:31.119 --> 00:59:32.000
second uncle

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.119
and then someone would sit on your

00:59:33.119 --> 00:59:34.960
stomach and trap you that's when they

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:36.720
take your dong and slit it up

00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:38.000
they give you the sub-incision then

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.760
there was an older guy there who was

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.599
like about 30 who was like healed up for

00:59:41.599 --> 00:59:42.079
years

00:59:42.079 --> 00:59:44.160
and he would go cut me down to the right

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:46.000
cut me down to the [ __ ] base

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.440
and they'd take his and open it and go

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:48.720
all the way to the bottom they're like

00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:50.480
ah

00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:51.839
and the idea was because there's how

00:59:51.839 --> 00:59:53.599
prevalent was ed in these

00:59:53.599 --> 00:59:55.040
i don't know dude and none of these

00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:56.799
dicks if you made a noise they would go

00:59:56.799 --> 00:59:58.400
to all your female relatives and slash

00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:01.839
your shoulders and their bellies

01:00:02.079 --> 01:00:04.480
yeah dude that's a nightmare same thing

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.119
as uh

01:00:05.119 --> 01:00:06.559
the native americans dude i'm telling

01:00:06.559 --> 01:00:07.760
you while you were getting tortured you

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.359
like yelled out your whole family was

01:00:09.359 --> 01:00:09.839
embarrassed

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:11.680
yeah forever they would [ __ ] cut you

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:13.599
they give you a little thing like [ __ ]

01:00:13.599 --> 01:00:15.920
yeah yeah dude i'm the [ __ ] i'm reading

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.599
is the craziest [ __ ] stuff

01:00:17.599 --> 01:00:20.319
yeah but you know who's really bad who

01:00:20.319 --> 01:00:22.240
the european

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:25.040
you know who's the real bad guys in this

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:25.680
yeah i mean

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:26.960
with what we know about childhood

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.680
development now that can't have produced

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:31.760
well the idea they were healthy minded

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:32.960
individuals

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:36.000
you got your dick slipped stuff in size

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.760
yeah so when you look at the yeah they

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.680
all the weirdest part was a lot of the

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:40.160
myths

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:43.440
start with like a trans male who's like

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.640
male and female

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.440
adam yeah trans male he was male and

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.520
female until they removed woman from him

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.280
the aranda people that's the australian

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.799
people who slit their dicks up

01:00:52.799 --> 01:00:55.280
they were trying to be like the like

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.880
like original mother man

they all wanted so they wanted they

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.760
wanted to like women could bleed and

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:00.319
like

01:01:00.319 --> 01:01:02.720

the creation what book is this

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.319
uh masks of god it's the primitive it

01:02:14.319 --> 01:02:16.000
starts at primitive mythology then it

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.599
goes to

01:02:17.599 --> 01:02:19.680
his words not mine oriental and then it

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.119
goes

01:02:21.119 --> 01:02:23.920
ramen's word occidental which is like

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.119

yeah i didn't realize the fact that like

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.799
people who a lot of

01:02:32.799 --> 01:02:34.720
the myths that we have and all like the

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.839
major religions are

01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:38.559
they come from like agriculturalists and

01:02:38.559 --> 01:02:39.119
like the

01:02:39.119 --> 01:02:41.200
pagans yeah and it's kind of like tied

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.880
to that and differs from hunting stuff

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:43.440
and you know

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.680
pretty tight yeah but of course you know

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.119
yeah but it's like the hunters

01:02:47.119 --> 01:02:49.520
cain and abel dude kane was a [ __ ]

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.280
his sacrifices were animal stuff

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:52.559
abel's were the plants and they're

01:02:52.559 --> 01:02:54.079
basically like this [ __ ] works that

01:02:54.079 --> 01:02:54.880
stuff doesn't

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:56.720
knock it off we can support a thousand

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.160
people we'll [ __ ] up your 50

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.480
person hunting tribe but no that's true

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.160
yeah i mean every single myth comes from

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.200
another story

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.599
typically and it's like i mean the jesus

01:03:05.599 --> 01:03:07.680
you ever watch religious with bill maher

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.119
cyrus you ever hear about cyrus brown

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:11.119
yeah jesus's story was

01:03:11.119 --> 01:03:13.599
every single every almost every single

01:03:13.599 --> 01:03:15.359
myth system of myth has a death and

01:03:15.359 --> 01:03:16.880
resurrection thing it's it's and they

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.400
think it's based off and the ones that

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.440
have it are the ones who are

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.039
agriculturalists the hunters

01:03:21.039 --> 01:03:22.960
not so much they're just kind of like

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.319
and then i became a ghost and i just

01:03:24.319 --> 01:03:25.520
kind of did the same stuff and like

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.319
there's no like

01:03:26.319 --> 01:03:28.640
next place yeah it'd be hard to it'd be

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:30.079
hard to not believe in ghosts when you

01:03:30.079 --> 01:03:30.480
like

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.319
you know someone dies but you can still

01:03:32.319 --> 01:03:34.079
like see them and have dreams about them

01:03:34.079 --> 01:03:34.880
in your head

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:36.559
and you don't know what the [ __ ] that is

01:03:36.559 --> 01:03:37.920
you gotta be like they gotta be alive

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:38.559
somewhere

01:03:38.559 --> 01:03:40.000
that's what you'd beg your ancestors to

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.839
do you're like just come back in dreams

01:03:41.839 --> 01:03:43.200
dude don't come and [ __ ] with it but

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:43.680
they would

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.520
yeah you could like picture them saying

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:46.799
something in a conversation

01:03:46.799 --> 01:03:48.079
yeah well they were talking about how

01:03:48.079 --> 01:03:49.839
those dudes back then didn't

01:03:49.839 --> 01:03:51.920
know what natural death was like

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.680
everyone you know got either like fell

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.359
off a cliff accidentally got eaten by an

animal or just murdered horribly

01:03:58.079 --> 01:03:59.280

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:00.880
coughed up blood one day and died i

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.079
