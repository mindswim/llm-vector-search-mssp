00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.799
hell yeah we're here finally after a

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.589
two-week struggle to figure out how to

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.290
explain this in a way that makes some

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.830
semblance of sense here we are if you're

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.859
seeing this that means that I've deemed

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.689
my attempt at explaining this acceptable

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.150
and if you're not seeing this then

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.840
obviously I felt um so yeah and if you

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.029
see I'm already into Prezi mode I mean

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.800
full presentation mode you're not seeing

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.360
me jump into it so I'm happy I've

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.790
learned that technology so now I can

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.420
seamlessly present without switching

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.149
windows and stuff Oh before I get into

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.239
it too with the groups I'm start there

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.570
we'll be starting this week and like I

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.250
said before teams before ideally the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.180
same time zone

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.460
but the Google Doc the sign up will be

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.559
in the description of this episode if

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.030
you want to sign up if you want to check

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.570
it out totally Q um and I'm having a

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.890
website bill for it as well so

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.329
eventually this will be on a colonic

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.920
page of a website we can kind of sign up

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.890
and it'll automatically I won the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.860
[ __ ] hands full but oh me go alright

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.189
so the groups are coming all right this

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.500
one dude this was so [ __ ] hard still

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.850
using the same book get out of your mind

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.220
and into your life but I supplemented it

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.439
with Steven Hayes's new book a liberated

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.990
mind which I have right here so it's

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.229
kind of cool because the workbook was

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.420
you know I think it's like 10 years old

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.930
or something

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.720
so I'm supplementing the workbook with

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.250
his new book which is like just came out

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.710
I think in 2019 so they just add like a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.150
ton of more research ton of more

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.950
different exercises and techniques and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.810
you know it just it's kind of like

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.939
verified the stuff in his workbook that

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.590
we started with he wrote like 400 more

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.329
pages being like oh yeah I don't forget

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.979
I'm also right and here's why which is

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.320
pretty cool but this is technically like

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.939
the second chapter of the workbook with

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.490
a little liberated mind worked into it

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.810
so now it's becoming a bit of an

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.990
amalgamation of the man's work and also

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.039
I have to say obviously you know I'm

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.539
taking this from his books

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.459
so again if you're reading something

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.080
like damn Custer's onto some other [ __ ]

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.770
it's not mine

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.150
this is this guy's research and writing

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.980
I'm representing it of course I mix

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.200
stuff around and mix stuff in but I you

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.670
know I just want to be clear with it but

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.080
it's funny to this so complicated to

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.030
relational frame theory is at least at

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.680
first you know it gets easy once you

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.990
kind of you know read about it a

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.050
gazillion times but like I would catch

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.030
myself just like just I would just put

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.340
like a full block quotation on to a

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.830
slide read it and secretly to myself I'm

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.820
like I still not really [ __ ]

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.930
understand it but I'm trying to convince

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.280
myself that I understood it so I you

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.900
know then I would like go through the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.880
slides and be like I still don't truly

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.620
understand the [ __ ] I'm a [ __ ] liar

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.690
and a bullshitter that's why I took so

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.770
long because I would like do a whole

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.470
presentation then being like I gotta get

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.270
to one part and I'd have to ask myself

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.800
like wait do you even know what that

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.100
means and a dick shut up no I don't so

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.030
you know that's why I use this other

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.430
book I use a bunch of other resources

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.710
online if you're interested let me know

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.080
I can tell you the ones I used so I this

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.840
is like this is a ultram algum ation of

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.300
like i watch youtube videos again read

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.480
the books went on the contextual

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.830
behavioral health sciences website

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.260
whatever that is so again this is a very

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.740
I personally did a very deep dive I did

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.930
like a very dumb man's poor man's deep

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.100
dive like you know if you want to do

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.780
like the real deal there there are like

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.880
the clinical research papers but

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.520
apparently they're even they joke about

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.290
and I saw this one of his one of his

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.880
talks that like the relational frame

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.120
theory is something that like PhDs kind

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.040
of go cross I trying to read so it's

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.900
complicated and the reason why you know

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.120
according to Hayes is that this is

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.340
language about language so whenever we

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.020
try to talk about talking or think about

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.570
thinking it's weird it's weird and we're

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.100
not used to doing it we're used to being

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.900
fused with this you know story of

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.100
ourselves that we construct through

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.209
language either way I'm not gonna get

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.950
ahead of myself

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.010
so all right and this is what our so and

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.810
again just to kind of understand what

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.220
we're doing here we've been talking

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.500
about the ax stuff which is you know how

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.780
do you how do you start to align

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.190
yourself with your values and how do you

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.630
kind of you know get out of your head

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.610
and as the book says get out of your

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.209
head and into your life act though is

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.100
based it's not just like he made up act

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.890
he made up Hazen and colleagues made up

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.720
a relational frame theory which so

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.330
really relational frame theory is kind

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.729
the why it's the underlying theory to

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.550
the fact that act works so act you know

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.069
act apparently has been verified it's

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:36.900
been you know stated to be a clinically

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.569
effective modality of therapy so it's

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:41.819
more but act is more of a how act is

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:43.340
like how do you do these things

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.599
relational frame theory is why do the

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:47.969
things you do in act work hopefully that

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:49.949
makes sense if you see if you're

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:51.180
watching the video you see the picture

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.069
is the The Wizard of Oz that's the thing

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:54.840
Hayes used is like kind of one of the

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.430
analogies it's like what is this looming

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.729
voice within us that judges compares

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.680
ruthlessly problem solves and dictates

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.050
our personal story of our self and you

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.930
know how we compare to others where does

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.370
it come from what can be done if it

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.620
starts to get out of control again these

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.060
are the questions asked by relational

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.340
frame theory that then went on to form

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.120
the methodology behind act acceptance

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.639
and commitment therapy so the idea here

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.219
at least one of them is that through you

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:24.990
know an understanding of the basic

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.969
structure of our cognition the way we

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:29.699
think through relational frame theory we

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.560
can then learn how to change our

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.940
relationship with our minds in a way

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.250
that is more beneficial for ourselves

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.289
and others and the reason to I kind of

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.650
went all out on this particular you know

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.180
this particular chapter was you know I

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.650
saw this other thing that said

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.699
understanding just even make a tiny bit

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:49.830
of relational frame theory increases

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.550
people's ability to experience

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.440
acceptance equipment therapy in a way

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.330
that's in a way that works so like if

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.159
you understand the Y your chances of

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.050
like implementing changes that you've

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.120
you pop your view to be positive and

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.490
useful are greatly increased so that's

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.449
why I was like you know I don't wanna

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.279
achieve a lot of times you hit people

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:09.719
with the dumb man's version where it's

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:11.250
like don't worry that rft stuff is for

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.349
eggheads and nerds you're just gonna do

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:14.610
the ax tough is like now we're gonna

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.199
we're gonna try you know what I mean

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:17.580
this is a this is an effort for all of

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.250
us but I want everyone to have even if

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.539
you walk away with just a smidgen of an

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:23.729
understanding fine cuz I really think I

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:25.319
kind of nailed this stuff down but you

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:28.110
know again we'll see and again the goal

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.509
through you know relational frame

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:32.279
theater act is not to control our

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:34.229
thoughts but to learn to relate to them

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.659
differently thus freeing ourselves from

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:38.639
the tyrannical control of our rational

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:40.569
minds allowing us to use this

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:42.490
amazing brain that only human beings

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.679
have for something other than bugging

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:47.050
ourselves out via the story we've

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.089
constructed about ourselves through

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:52.240
language via our experiences and the

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.979
stuff we hear from people see from other

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:57.699
people and I'll get into it this is how

00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:59.499
in one of his talks Hayes was saying he

00:06:59.499 --> 00:07:01.629
boils down 30 years of his research in

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:03.699
this simple little phrase learn it in

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:07.179
one derive it in to put it in networks

00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:10.959
that change what you do and we all kind

00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:12.459
of you know I'm definitely gonna break

00:07:12.459 --> 00:07:14.379
that down as we go but the general idea

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:17.319
is that human beings are the only people

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:19.539
who you know so you learn something

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:21.039
right you have an experience you have a

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:23.080
stimulus you learn it in one direction

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.319
and then you derive multiple pieces of

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:28.779
information out of that one source of

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:30.999
information right again it's not gonna

00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:32.860
make sense just bear with me and then

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.349
you put that information you derived out

00:07:35.349 --> 00:07:37.269
of one experience into a relational you

00:07:37.269 --> 00:07:38.979
filter it through a relational frame or

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:40.990
you put it in a network that changes

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.419
what you do your behavior so you learn

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:45.969
thing derive information filter it

00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:47.529
through relational frames that affect

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:49.689
your behavior and by knowing this we can

00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:52.089
we have a better chance at guiding our

00:07:52.089 --> 00:07:54.159
behaviors in a way that we'd like to

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:55.990
guide them rather than kind of like you

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.779
know being like a constant state of like

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:00.939
a you know bug just being discovered

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:02.169
after someone lifts a rock where we're

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:04.809
like oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] you know that's the

00:08:04.809 --> 00:08:07.389
goal here alright so let's get into the

00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:10.180
power of symbolic thinking which is kind

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.539
of the basis of all this all right so

00:08:13.539 --> 00:08:15.369
feeling what we think through language

00:08:15.369 --> 00:08:17.619
so through some weird twist of

00:08:17.619 --> 00:08:19.539
evolutionary fate we have developed this

00:08:19.539 --> 00:08:21.909
thing called language and although words

00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:24.159
may seem you know kind of harmless or

00:08:24.159 --> 00:08:26.949
innocuous they're anything but right

00:08:26.949 --> 00:08:30.069
because we think symbolically so we use

00:08:30.069 --> 00:08:31.959
words these things again this is where

00:08:31.959 --> 00:08:33.729
we do language about language which kind

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:35.889
of gets kind of weird and meta but using

00:08:35.889 --> 00:08:37.779
words as these very real placeholders

00:08:37.779 --> 00:08:42.099
for things we experience we can feel a

00:08:42.099 --> 00:08:44.730
thing we think about

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.230
physically can physically alter our

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.420
biology or biochemistry however you want

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.470
to put it our physiology by thinking

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.329
about something or seeing a word or

00:08:54.329 --> 00:08:55.850
seeing an image like we're the only

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:58.290
animals who can do this who can and

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.000
again this is not just like like

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.800
obviously a dog can see a steak but you

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.019
know smelling it that's different we can

00:09:04.019 --> 00:09:06.000
you know it's like you don't just see an

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.470
Apple as food we've seen Apple as an

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.360
Apple it's like we can imagine biting

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.639
through its skin and into its you know

00:09:11.639 --> 00:09:14.579
its sweet kind of grainy flesh and you

00:09:14.579 --> 00:09:16.769
know you bite it you can feel the kind

00:09:16.769 --> 00:09:18.480
of it so it's not like Sandy but it gets

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.880
kind of fleshy you can taste and feel

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.250
this Apple in our minds and you know we

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.320
can imaginarily true it if we like

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.720
apples like I do we might be salivating

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.070
which I kind of am every time I [ __ ]

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:32.040
explain that it's funny I almost bought

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.720
apples the other day as food shopping so

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.029
our ability to think symbolically is so

00:09:36.029 --> 00:09:37.920
good that we can produce real bodily

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.320
changes just by imagining something by

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.820
encountering the symbol for the

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.709
experience that we've now kind of

00:09:43.709 --> 00:09:45.570
encoded into our you know relational

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.269
frames okay all right and honestly to

00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:50.550
it's like I mean I'm not gonna do this

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.279
obviously but like I could I could make

00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:55.170
you pulse right now like I could give

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.180
you a boner I could sit here I could I

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.029
could tell you a sexual story I could

00:10:00.029 --> 00:10:01.709
write stuff I could you know I could set

00:10:01.709 --> 00:10:03.990
something up where I could affect your

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.670
physiology again I'm not gonna get

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.709
anyone hard but it's like it's possible

00:10:07.709 --> 00:10:09.839
it's possible you can read certain words

00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:11.790
you know and it's like you can get

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.190
yourself hard it's it's weird again we

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.380
can produce we can produce we can it

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.060
change our bodies out of this like you

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.490
know almost like VR simulator that's

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:21.660
built into our brains and we're the only

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.149
animal that has this so just so you know

00:10:24.149 --> 00:10:26.279
just to recap slate that this ability to

00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:28.649
conjure up a reality purely by thought

00:10:28.649 --> 00:10:30.389
is super helpful for problem solving

00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:33.389
creativity and communication and this is

00:10:33.389 --> 00:10:34.949
this is event this is where it came out

00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:37.139
of but it also means that thoughts that

00:10:37.139 --> 00:10:40.260
are entirely unlikely or false can be

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.089
physically convincing in a way that

00:10:42.089 --> 00:10:43.829
makes us experience them as being

00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:46.860
totally real right

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.329
well something Bad's gonna happen

00:10:48.329 --> 00:10:50.130
something Bad's gonna happen oh my god

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.750
oh now my heart rates up it's like I

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.310
[ __ ] knew it I knew something there is

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.380
something bad it's no we can affect our

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.329
own biology and that's why it's so hard

00:10:57.329 --> 00:10:58.329
to get out of these

00:10:58.329 --> 00:11:00.489
modes of linguistic thinking because

00:11:00.489 --> 00:11:02.139
it's like they're really affecting

00:11:02.139 --> 00:11:04.420
they're affecting the most real parts of

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.160
ourselves which you know are our bodies

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.649
alright so relational frame Theory over

00:11:08.649 --> 00:11:10.089
the last thirty years what would have

00:11:10.089 --> 00:11:12.579
they been doing so the aim of relational

00:11:12.579 --> 00:11:14.259
theory a relational frame theory where

00:11:14.259 --> 00:11:17.110
it came from you know and according to

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.239
Hayes and his team they were kind of

00:11:19.239 --> 00:11:20.529
saying like alright psychology has

00:11:20.529 --> 00:11:22.749
lacked the definitive nuts and bolts

00:11:22.749 --> 00:11:25.299
understanding of our weird cognitive

00:11:25.299 --> 00:11:27.549
abilities you know there's this idea of

00:11:27.549 --> 00:11:29.049
symbolic thinking how we're the only

00:11:29.049 --> 00:11:30.279
people who can do it it's like we don't

00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:32.499
have no idea where it came from how to

00:11:32.499 --> 00:11:34.420
change it or like you know how can we

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.579
you know this is the analogy he uses how

00:11:36.579 --> 00:11:38.079
can we pull back the curtain on The

00:11:38.079 --> 00:11:39.879
Wizard of Oz you know that big scary

00:11:39.879 --> 00:11:41.589
looming head and then show that it's

00:11:41.589 --> 00:11:43.209
like that's just some old man who you

00:11:43.209 --> 00:11:44.739
know he's paying no attention to the man

00:11:44.739 --> 00:11:48.549
behind the curtain so and after 30 years

00:11:48.549 --> 00:11:50.709
of research Hayes and other relation

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:52.959
relational framers claimed to have

00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:55.059
figured out how we think down to the

00:11:55.059 --> 00:11:56.829
level of basic personal consciousness

00:11:56.829 --> 00:11:59.949
the I here now they use there then and

00:11:59.949 --> 00:12:01.779
everything in between

00:12:01.779 --> 00:12:03.759
and I know that sounds weird because it

00:12:03.759 --> 00:12:07.929
is but stick with it all right and again

00:12:07.929 --> 00:12:09.579
let's you know let's jump back what look

00:12:09.579 --> 00:12:11.589
this is why language theorists have

00:12:11.589 --> 00:12:13.449
thought to have been wrong for the last

00:12:13.449 --> 00:12:15.129
300 years this is what they're missing

00:12:15.129 --> 00:12:16.299
because people have obviously thought

00:12:16.299 --> 00:12:19.269
about this a lot but they were missing

00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.629
something

00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:21.939
according to Hayes and they weren't

00:12:21.939 --> 00:12:23.439
totally wrong but they just weren't all

00:12:23.439 --> 00:12:26.139
the way right so for a long time people

00:12:26.139 --> 00:12:28.149
theorized that we acquired all of our

00:12:28.149 --> 00:12:29.860
abilities for language via what's known

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.339
as associative learning right where this

00:12:33.339 --> 00:12:35.319
is relational frame theory so we're I'm

00:12:35.319 --> 00:12:37.449
gonna jump ahead we learn it human

00:12:37.449 --> 00:12:39.790
beings learn relationally we learned

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.970
through relation but we do start off we

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.189
do learn our first words via associative

00:12:45.189 --> 00:12:47.439
learning so again if you don't know what

00:12:47.439 --> 00:12:49.269
associative learning is I've mentioned

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:51.669
this before it's like the Pavlov's dogs

00:12:51.669 --> 00:12:54.129
thing there was there was a whatever BF

00:12:54.129 --> 00:12:57.129
Skinner and Ivan Pavlov Pavlov was from

00:12:57.129 --> 00:12:58.480
Russia and I think Skinner was from

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.419
America England I don't know but Pavlov

00:13:01.419 --> 00:13:03.069
was the guy who was like you know he had

00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:05.319
his dogs he drank a bell gave him food

00:13:05.319 --> 00:13:07.990
rang a bell gave him food bell no food

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.660
the dog still drools because now you

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.610
know

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.940
he's associated the Bell with food so

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.800
it's kind of like you know it's kind of

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.620
like how or it's work and it's like sort

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.209
of but it's only part of it right

00:13:21.209 --> 00:13:24.600
because it's it's true that we typically

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.760
learn our first words via association

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.410
just like did Pavlov's dogs like it's

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.240
like you know we're getting and

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.310
psychologists call this we learn

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:35.010
initially we don't learn words we learn

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.260
kind of how to speak if that makes it we

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.700
learned that like speaking affects our

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.410
environment right so it's not the same

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:42.450
as symbolic thinking this is associative

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.519
learning as we're talking like you know

00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:47.579
six months old we learn to say mama and

00:13:47.579 --> 00:13:50.040
Dada through something psychologists

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.890
call contingencies or when if then and

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.290
again this is associative when I see

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.560
this face if I say mama then I will be

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.800
praised and tickled right so this is

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.450
this is still we're learning to say mama

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:08.850
but we're we're not we're not like

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.730
saying like okay mama is this person who

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.829
cares for me with the associative

00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:16.709
learning is process-oriented right so

00:14:16.709 --> 00:14:18.720
it's when I see this face if I say mama

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.490
then I'll be praised in tickled so

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:21.810
you're just kind of like doing a trick

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.600
so that you get a reward and we do this

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.550
for all of our words we get initial you

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:29.970
do this for data bail bottle doggy on

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.279
and on and on by being rewarded for the

00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:33.480
correct that you know correct we don't

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.440
know we're doing the correct

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.149
identification of objects with praise

00:14:36.149 --> 00:14:37.769
and you know kisses and sweet treats and

00:14:37.769 --> 00:14:41.160
stuff but then around twelve months

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.010
something weird happens so this thing we

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:45.570
you know we're acquiring called language

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.670
right we're just again we're just you

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.589
know we're you know or a monkey at a

00:14:49.589 --> 00:14:50.850
circus earlier we're just kind of

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.680
jumping around we're doing our thing and

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.360
we're getting rewards then something

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.060
weird happens so you know language now

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.190
becomes a two-way street these this

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.800
process of being rewarded and doing a

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.019
certain thing we kind of take out of

00:15:04.019 --> 00:15:05.790
that you know dimensional Pavlov's dogs

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.010
thing and then we put it into a

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:10.230
bi-directional frame of relational

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.079
relational learning and a gal explained

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:15.180
how this is but again to really try to

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.589
Claire I'll explain on the next slide

00:15:16.589 --> 00:15:18.180
but this and this happens automatically

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.890
too by the way so this isn't something

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:22.350
that you know we like will ourselves to

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.190
do or someone tells us you

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.350
do this automatically before I explain

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:27.790
what exactly I'm talking about because I

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:29.910
know that probably makes no sense

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:34.030
associative learning to by the way is if

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.080
you can see if you're watching the video

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.480
it's about they say it goes back to

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.500
about like 545 million years ago as you

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.970
like this is back it's called the

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:46.060
Cambrian period and it if you look at

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.530
pictures of the Cambrian period it looks

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.330
like like The Little Mermaid on acid

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:50.290
it's like there's if you look in the

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:51.490
background there's like a whale with

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:54.280
[ __ ] legs or something there's like

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.380
sharks with like mouths where their butt

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.880
holes are it looks [ __ ] crazy dude

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.460
but this goes back to when we were like

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.490
bug fish of like again associative

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:05.290
learning it's I'm just this thing with

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:07.300
no consciousness that's just floating

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.920
through and it's like oh [ __ ] I bumped

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.150
into this thing that's scratched and

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.130
pricked me and gave me electric shock

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:14.740
I'm going I'm going to now avoid that

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.410
thing because that's a threat to me so

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.920
this idea of avoidance is built into our

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.740
system by you know means of 5 a half a

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.340
billion years is a very powerful thing

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.700
all right

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.010
but again we're different we're humans

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.720
we do have this associative learning

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.310
side but we also have this different

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.710
thing that language or that allows us to

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.020
get language that's called

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:39.220
bi-directional relational learning all

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.560
right again process oriented

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.920
relational process oriented associative

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.630
symbolic bi-directional relational

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.630
alright sorry I know this [ __ ] is really

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:53.500
[ __ ] weird okay so eventually this is

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.270
a process versus symbol I could have

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.650
just jumped to this slide I need to say

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.000
the same thing fifty [ __ ] times

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.360
eventually mama stops becoming a thing

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.550
we get rewarded for saying you know a

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.980
when if-then a contingency and becomes

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:09.010
our mommy mommy the person rather than

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.310
mommy the process of me getting praised

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:14.350
take a chimp train it to point to a

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:16.240
picture of a dragon whenever it sees an

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.910
orange by rewarding it now place an

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.250
orange and a basket of other fruit and

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:22.540
watch the monkey just look at you like

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.310
what the [ __ ] what is this what are we

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:26.140
doing that's because the monkey can only

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.970
learn by association or one-way learning

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.370
but with children we can learn via

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.050
association and then automatically

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:35.770
derive that mama isn't just this process

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.430
mama actually Makenna me do this

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.890
automatically mama is the woman praising

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.140
us and then we start seeing mama as a

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.690
distinct entity in and of herself unlike

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.130
the chimp that can't theoretically

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.350
separate an orange from the rest of a

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.610
bowl of fruit because the chimps just

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:52.160
process-oriented once he sees you here

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.330
don't you hit the chimp with orange

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.370
grapes and a banana now it's like that's

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:56.690
just a whole different thing it's like

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:57.740
what the [ __ ]

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.560
so again as humans we can kind of like

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.600
we can start kind of like cutting and

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.670
copying and pasting our you know our

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:06.380
experiences of reality and filing them

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.270
into our brain under the heading of

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.250
specific objects and symbols that's what

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:11.240
I'm talking about with symbolic thinking

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.250
this is how it starts by the way this is

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:14.750
when we were 1 years old which is

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:15.760
[ __ ] nuts

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.650
so what's even strangers by the time

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:21.200
we're about into 16 months old if we

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.780
hear an unfamiliar word in our near so

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.340
we already learned mama daddy bottle

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.060
apple aren't all that [ __ ] so if we're

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.860
16 months if we hear an unfamiliar word

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.330
and we're near both in a familiar and

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.430
unfamiliar object we will automatically

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:39.230
assume that the thing we don't recognize

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:40.820
is related to the word we don't

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.250
recognize and therefore deduce and then

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.650
say it is that thing so if you have an

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:46.910
apple an orange obviously all right

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:48.170
we're there when the monkey got trained

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.090
we know what an orange is and we don't

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.700
know what an apple is if we're a 16

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.560
months old I know I've been trained to

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.120
what an orange is a note an orange is I

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.010
don't know an apple is my mom's like you

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.110
see the Apple where's the Apple I'll

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.730
look at the Apple look at the orange ago

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:03.770
that's the Apple we do this

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.510
automatically this is what I mean this

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:08.300
is when we start deriving into we start

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.040
we start being told it was told what an

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.900
orange is next to an apple and then we

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.430
hear Apple we can automatically go like

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.560
all right I I know what this thing is

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.970
and I don't know what that is so that's

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.590
the Apple we're deriving extra

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.060
information simply by learning what an

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.830
oranges we're kind of learning what an

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.210
orange is and we're seeing that as an

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:24.620
apple so that's that's what it means to

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.620
derive information in multiple ways it's

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:27.980
weird

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.400
I know so in as a baby every word we

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.290
learned leads us to search for events

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:34.760
and objects in our environment that are

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.980
unfamiliar thus making us derive that

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.590
same to a relation we learned simply by

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.450
being trained to say things like momma

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.310
and daddy so we're getting trained again

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:44.510
that's the associative learning that's

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.130
like if you say mama I'm gonna reward

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.660
you and you just say and say and say

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.130
until you eventually your brain just

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.350
goes just kind of

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.270
like hold on a second I see a bigger

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.980
picture here so we're learning how to

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.870
say things but automatically deducing

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.580
that they are referring to certain

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.550
people places events objects etc rather

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.680
than just being a task to be done and

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.720
rewarded for and they think this come

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.490
this process where they theorize it

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:09.560
comes from unlike so we said you know

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.570
associative learning is half a billion

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:12.890
years old five hundred forty-five

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:14.480
million years old

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.370
relational learning they think goes back

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.200
about two hundred thousand years old and

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.340
again I don't know how people figure

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.770
this [ __ ] out but this is what they say

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.510
and they they think this was like a

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:27.500
distinct feature of Homo sapiens and was

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.540
apparently homo sapiens or humans are

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.930
the most like freakishly cooperative

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.510
primates you know a lot of plot of

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:38.030
primates are cooperative but like human

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.380
beings are on another level and they

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.120
think that this next level of this kind

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.190
of innate cooperation is what gave birth

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.200
to language and they've done studies

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.790
with babies we're like babies will

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:50.060
reward cooperation like so if you if you

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.560
lay it like an in if you have an infant

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.580
in a highchair and you put a bunch of

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.130
honey nut cheerios you have two puppets

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.170
one's nice and ones mean you know that

00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:58.430
you have the mean puppet will just be a

00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:59.930
[ __ ] dick and then the nice one will

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:02.360
be sweet and nice at the end of that

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.530
you'll be here give you know give them

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.090
some honey nut cheerios that the child

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:07.550
will give them to the nicer puppet which

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:09.110
is kind of weird and also there's

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.310
another thing too or if you have two

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.960
toddlers and you tell the one toddler

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.130
like you'll go pick up that you know

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:14.960
that Fisher Tyco bench you know

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.250
something that's light enough and pick

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:17.660
up but big enough for another person to

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.460
grab it there's two toddlers you tell

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.750
one of them and do it the other one will

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:22.580
just naturally walk up and snag it and

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.930
help them out it's weird you know this

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:26.870
again it's a weird [ __ ] all right so we

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:28.940
know mama let's go to the frame so we've

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.550
learned to identify our mother but again

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:32.870
that's just this is like the very

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:36.350
beginning baby stuff alright so the next

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:39.230
step we learned words we're learning to

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.690
identify what things are now we're going

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:44.240
to form relational frames we're getting

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.910
into it man and I think this makes sense

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.070
so after we learn what stuff is we then

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.560
start comparing these people places

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.380
events objects via the constructs of

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:57.530
comparison called relational frames for

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:00.890
example my toy horse is bigger than my

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:03.650
toy car I learned what a toy horse is I

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.090
learned the word bigger

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.190
I learned toy car now I have a

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:09.380
relational frame I have a network

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.600
learning one derive it into put it in

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.370
network so now I'm putting these words

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:15.770
into networks of comparison these are

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:17.030
what relational frames are they're

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:19.880
networks of comparison so we like we did

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.400
with Mama will automatically deduce at

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.320
the toy car you're just hearing that the

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.840
toy car is bigger or the yeah the toy

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.120
horse is bigger than in toy car so we

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.220
will automatically deduce the toy car is

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:33.710
also smaller to the toy horse hence this

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:36.020
is length this is thinking relationally

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.790
things just aren't these you know you

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.460
know dimensional one-way processes that

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:41.570
like you know if I do this thing and get

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:43.400
rewarded it's like well if my toy horse

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.500
is bigger than my toy car that means

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.570
that my toy car is smaller than my toy

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:48.920
horse that's important later when we

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.750
start extracting or deriving information

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.790
via experiences especially in terms of

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:55.460
self judgment so the words we were

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.410
trained through craze start to become

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.390
organized again the words we were

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:00.770
trained through associations start to

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.170
become organized through their relation

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:04.130
to other words

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:06.620
unbeknownst to ourselves before we

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.800
really even ourself in any real sense we

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.480
already start to dip our toes into the

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.670
world of abstraction this is the

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:14.540
opposite of that

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.790
this is better this is worse uglier

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:19.070
prettier so in this early stage our

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:20.840
levels of abstraction or mostly rooted

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.460
and can create physical properties of

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.710
things you know my toy horse is bigger

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:28.190
than my toy car my dad is bigger than my

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:32.270
mom etc at 3 years old we typically will

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:34.220
prefer a nickel to a dime this is how

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:35.720
they they kind of study this so a three

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.210
years old knowing that it you know money

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:40.010
can get us candy it's the thing we want

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.410
you know we'll still will typically

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:44.240
prefer a nickel to a dime simply because

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.100
it's physically bigger linking it with

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.290
more this other this thing we have we

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.350
know you know so we're linking bigger

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:53.960
with strictly physical properties at

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.640
three years old like this is what

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.400
animals do by the way then around five

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.560
or six for some reason again this is all

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.330
automatic stuff it's not just that

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:03.980
automatic we're like sponges we're just

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:05.180
soaking up all this information when

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.500
were little and we're organizing it all

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.200
kind of in the same way but by about

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.290
five or six we will prefer a dime

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:13.190
knowing that it's somehow bigger

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:15.320
quote-unquote than a nickel extracting

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.570
the concept of more away from its

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:18.680
physical properties

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.240
and this doesn't this might not seem

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.460
like a huge deal but by doing this you

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.590
know as a five year old we are now

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.960
entering into a like a cognitive like

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.960
Tron world of just like you know all

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.340
bets are off in terms of like you know

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.240
concrete physical natural kind of law

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.470
we're entering I mean we still have that

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:37.910
to an extent but we also enter into

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:38.960
another realm

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.430
that's totally separated from that that

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:41.780
no other animal can come into or

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:46.490
understand like none of them only us all

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:47.600
right I don't know why I'm getting so

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.400
excited but I'm happy this is actually

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.710
making sense all right so the bottom

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:54.110
line relational thought is much more

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:56.360
complex than associative thought because

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.830
yeah it's much more complex than

00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:59.900
associative thought because it allows us

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.040
to fabricate relations in the abstract

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.970
combining them into networks of

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:06.980
comparison based on no quote-unquote

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.070
real physical relation thus rendering a

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:12.230
virtually infinite network of thought in

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:14.480
comparison since anything can be

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.860
compared to anything else at anytime the

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.660
Association we simply make connections

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.910
between things or events because they

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:24.680
occurred together in time and space or

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:28.220
are physically similar right so again

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.930
I'm getting praise for saying mama

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.480
getting praise for saying data I'll just

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.770
say I'm getting praise for saying Baba

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:35.990
all of a sudden what happens my mom's

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:39.140
you know I'm going ba ba bad ba ba ba

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.450
bah boom bottle my mouth going oh hell

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:43.400
yeah I just did that you know you start

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.170
to learn how to associate that but then

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:47.330
you start saying like I like this you

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:49.520
know I like strawberry milk better than

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.290
chocolate milk it's it starts to get

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:52.640
into it I guess that's kind of physical

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.380
but again the nickel and the dime is the

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:57.560
best one it's like you know why is it

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.180
why is a small little dime better cuz we

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.890
have it we've we've abstracted the sense

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:02.180
we've agreed with everybody else that

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.310
like well this is just more why I don't

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:06.650
know cuz that's what we do and again

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:08.840
with the associative learning it has to

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.820
occur together in time and space or be

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.890
like physically similar so let's let's

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:16.670
uh let's relate something all right this

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:18.470
was something from his workbook get out

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:20.090
of your mind in your well he doesn't in

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.550
both books actually so the idea is to

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:24.680
take any take any two objects hold them

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.110
in your mind or write them down all

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.850
right so you think of two things

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:30.830
I personally want all right I picked a

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:32.330
rock and a feather that's I did it out

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.640
of the workbook but either way pick two

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.640
things Pal is the first so once you have

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.400
your two things do this if you want

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.780
think about how the first one is better

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.900
than the second your mind will generate

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.970
an answer and then think of this is a

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:48.860
weirder one but how did the second one

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:51.920
cause the first so if you think hard

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.210
enough about these things your mind

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:54.770
again try it you know 4-minute Paulette

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:56.540
if you have to but if you think hard

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.130
enough about these things your mind will

00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:59.840
produce an answer it might not make any

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.480
sense but your mind will try to relate

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.890
these objects in the frame you're

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:05.450
seeking and produce something it'll spit

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.550
something out this is what the author

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:09.920
asks is how can we think we're thinking

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.780
only rational thoughts when the very

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:13.550
nature of a thought allows anything to

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:15.620
be related to anything else at any point

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.860
in time and also this is why getting rid

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.960
of thoughts doesn't work because the

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.580
attempt to get rid of a thought only

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.800
relates the effort to rid ourselves of

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.440
the thought to the thought we are trying

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.240
not to think about thus making us think

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.890
about the thing that we don't want to

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:32.180
think about anymore this is again this

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:33.830
is why I say like you start doing

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:35.300
thinking about thinking a language about

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:36.710
language in people's eyes start to bug

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:37.940
out of their heads or like what the [ __ ]

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.160
you're talking about it's like I don't

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.530
know all right I don't [ __ ] know and

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:44.210
it's funny when I did so I do this in a

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:45.650
workbook in the workbook structured

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:46.910
these questions a little differently it

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:48.290
did say how's the first one better than

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:50.240
the second so I was like a rocks better

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.680
than a feather because it's heavy and

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.820
you could use it as a weapon that's just

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:53.600
where my mind went

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.700
I'm like you know that makes sense is it

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:56.570
you know it's better you can always sit

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:57.560
the feather all you can make a pen out

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.240
on the feather you can do whatever the

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.600
[ __ ] you want and in mine it said how

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.400
did the you know a it's actually the

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.600
same thing I said how did the second one

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.740
cause the first

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.990
oh no sorry mine it said how did the

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:12.650
first one rock cause the feather board

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:14.720
says how does the first one the parent

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:18.410
of the second one and and this thing it

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:19.580
says how does the second one cause the

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:20.630
first whatever either way I'm not gonna

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:22.490
get held up on that but you know so it's

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:24.260
like how do the rock cause a feather

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.180
that was the question I had to think

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.880
about and it took me about 30 seconds

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.110
and then you know my brain again

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:31.550
automatically it was just like well

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:34.220
technically the earth is a rock and the

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.870
earth had to be here before feather

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:37.820
could be here from a bird and it was

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:38.930
just boom boom boom and pulling through

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:40.760
all these weird relational four and

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.080
that's a weird relational frame how did

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.670
this one cause that between a rock and a

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:45.980
feather my brain spit out an answer so

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.060
I'll be curious to hear if that actually

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:48.470
works for people cause it did work for

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:52.370
my brain all right and let's go through

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:54.530
here's some examples of relate here's

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.540
like the main relational frames right

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:58.190
because hopefully this makes sense I

00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:59.480
know it just gets a little bit weird but

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.360
it'll it will come together um so again

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.340
these are networks of thought put it in

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.350
networks and you know change what you do

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.240
networks a thought called relational

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.640
frames so the first one frames the

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.350
coordination this is identity this is

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:16.370
just naming [ __ ] this is mama mama I'm

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:19.030
identifying what this is apple orange

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.590
bottle and also frames a coordination

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:23.690
tell us when so it's like being able to

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:25.520
name something and find something that's

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.500
like that other thing you know there's

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.540
no opposites yet it's just like that's

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.280
like that and well sometimes as baby's

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.840
trying to compete like we'll just call

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.450
things the same like you will see a cat

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:36.860
will meet a dog first and like we'll see

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.690
cats and any other four-legged creature

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:40.310
but that's just a dog and it's like all

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:42.050
we have a frames of coordination we can

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:43.730
name a thing and find things that are

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:47.000
similar then as we get a little older we

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.620
get frames of opposition and these are

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.050
you know opposites if you learn hot we

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:52.610
learn cold and we learn that they're

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:54.170
kind of like polar opposites one another

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:56.810
so we learn dark in light etc if it's if

00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:58.370
it's light in here it's not dark and if

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:01.130
it's dark then it's not light these

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:02.630
again these two now these words are

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:04.340
related they're not just words they're

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.260
not tied to like a treat for identifying

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.840
them these become constructs we start to

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.570
filter our experience through and

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:13.850
there's frames of distinction and these

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:15.050
are things like

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:16.790
coordination that's kind of the opposite

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:18.470
of coordination these are things not

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:20.180
being like other things so not the

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:23.210
opposite but just different and then we

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:25.040
have frames of comparison this is just

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.540
you know these are ones that I think you

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.880
know absolutely torture us bigger

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.160
smaller faster slow or stronger weaker

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.380
so again this isn't the opposite either

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:36.320
because things can be two times or four

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.350
times bigger faster slower etc instead

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:41.240
of being diametrically opposed so not

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.370
like light or dark these this is like

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:45.260
the shades between opposition of that

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.600
makes sense like a dimmer so

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.330
you know not big or small I am bigger or

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:51.280
smaller there's there's a whole

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:54.490
continuum of places I can fit along this

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:56.350
you know these dimensions of opposites

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:59.260
that I can occupy different spaces it's

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.490
not like a light switch like I'm big

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:02.440
small big small I'm like no and again I

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.510
can be bigger then someone's bigger than

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:09.340
me etc um so then there's spatial frames

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.140
which is again there's the relation of

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:13.000
space between things not including

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.070
yourself that's important but it's like

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:19.510
my car is near or far from my toy horse

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:21.280
which you know my toy cars and so now

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:25.120
like my Honda Civic um so yeah that's

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.950
that's when things are kind of you know

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:29.350
it's just a space between objects again

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:30.880
not related to yourself because that's

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.950
important temporal just means time

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:34.930
comparing along the dimension of time

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:37.830
before and after all that stuff

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:40.240
hierarchical you don't even need to know

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.830
this this is just comparison among the

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:43.900
dimension of a group membership so it's

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:45.460
like cheddar is a type of cheese was

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:46.840
such a type of dairy products this is

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.310
kind of like being able to kind of

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.740
organize so it's like rally comparing

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:52.540
things we're just kind of like saying

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.690
which kind of classes things belong to

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:57.250
there's another important one causality

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:59.410
which is a relational frame of cause and

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:02.560
effect or if-then so I caused this you

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.420
know I did this and then because of this

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.040
this happened or if I do this then

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.990
that'll happen so it's like frames of

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:09.760
coordination frames of opposition frames

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.300
a distinction it's a really comparison

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:15.850
causality opposition distinction really

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:18.160
important but the one that apparently is

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.570
like you know I first read this one and

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.180
I was like whatever that sounds weird

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:24.970
it's called a deck tick you know and

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:26.560
it's a weird name for it but these are

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.570
the relations stemming from a person's

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:31.090
point of view right so it's for example

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:34.030
from the right of me from the left of me

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:37.230
this is what gives us perspective right

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:41.470
so they are you know it's the I slash u

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.530
that goes here and there every now slash

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:47.470
then and so and these these cannot be

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:49.420
traced to like formal dimensions in the

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.160
environment at all instead it's the

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.050
relationship between an individual and

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:55.930
other events so that this like the

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:57.970
individual is the constant variable upon

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:00.160
which these frames are all based

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.750
it's in this is thought of where we get

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:03.370
our sense of self from and I'll get more

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:04.720
into that that's kind of a bad

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.540
explanation of that but I say that so

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:09.040
here we go so this is the sense of self

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.800
right this is we don't really they say

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:12.970
we don't get this until like three or

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:15.520
four years old but let's get into this

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.740
this is really cool all right so they

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.090
call these instead of deck dick frames

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:20.170
you can call them perspective-taking

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:24.010
frames so this is the sense this is the

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:26.080
sense of relational frame that allows us

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.420
to gain a vantage point from out of

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.010
ourselves so we're not just like you

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:31.810
know observing processes like a monkey

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:35.380
we're being like this thing is near me

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.810
right so gone are the days of like this

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:40.030
truck being bigger than my plastic army

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:42.280
man and into the confusing world of my

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.640
you know my here being you were there

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.620
you know this is like really [ __ ] up

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:48.520
for like a three-year-old or

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.450
four-year-old understand it's really

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:53.860
confusing at first all right so the

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.570
three most critical distinctions of this

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:58.390
type of frame in terms of our sense of

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:01.570
self stem from the AI / you - here /

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:04.690
there and then now / then right these

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:09.220
are like opposites but they're also they

00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:10.960
have to do with us in a weird personal

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.240
way so sometime again around the age

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:15.730
three or four these perspective-taking

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:19.210
relations of a person place time merge

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:20.890
into an integrated sense of an

00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:22.900
individual's of our individual

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.630
perspective giving us a sense of an I

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:29.110
here now so they give us an a sense of

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.750
being a distinct entity you know like

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.910
like any of our trucks or dolls or mama

00:34:33.910 --> 00:34:37.030
we've identified that now has to be

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:40.929
compared again we ourselves are thrown

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:43.600
into the fray of all of the other you

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.030
know you here now's or then there then

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:47.860
that we can think of so again we're

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.240
comparing toy trucks we're doing this

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.520
and one day we're like oh [ __ ] I myself

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.800
and we start you know from a young age

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.679
comparing ourselves to the other selves

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:59.460
we just again weirdly animate ly

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:02.950
recognize as human beings and once the

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:04.930
self is a sense of self is established

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:07.930
it never leaves doesn't go away and it's

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:09.520
also why we can't remember anything

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.620
about being 1 or 2 or before that since

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:13.550
there was no conscious eye

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:17.150
year now to record these events and in

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:18.320
the book they're saying like this sense

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.240
of self regained through perspective

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.660
taking frames cut becomes the you know

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.220
the quotes I think is really nice the

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.350
strand we put the beads of experience on

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:29.930
so this is the underlying like the I

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:31.820
here now that's why everyone always

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.560
harps and a lot of this stuff before I

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:34.970
said was like this is like futuristic

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:36.620
Buddhism I watched another talk and he's

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:38.120
like this is not Buddhism I'm like I'll

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.270
[ __ ] my bad dude but the idea was he he

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:42.800
grew up hazed grew up is like you know

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.470
California in the 60s he went on like

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:47.810
communes studied under like you know

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:49.660
Buddhist masters and all this [ __ ] and

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:52.670
you know did acid all that stuff but the

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:55.190
problem he had was you know you've

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.270
watched one of his talks he talks about

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:59.900
it like you go and it's just like you

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:01.160
know at the end of the day you're

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.600
learning you're breathing you're doing

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:03.980
all the [ __ ] and then you're also like

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:05.870
going in like farming this guy [ __ ]

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:07.340
while he [ __ ] all the girls and it was

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:10.300
like well this is kind of [ __ ] so he

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.640
rft in a act is really what it's really

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.170
trying to do it you know on some level

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:17.120
it's it's like a mix of like they take

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.430
behavioral psychology but then they also

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:21.950
go into like the wisdom traditions like

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:24.920
Buddhism meditation contemplative

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.140
practices like prayer and the idea is

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.940
and this is how he phrases it which is

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.100
hilarious she wants to pull them on the

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.690
joints to be like yeah I get it I can

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:34.070
like meditate I can do all this but like

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:36.260
what's actually helpful about meditating

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.820
and how can I distill that down to like

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.370
the simplest thing for people to use

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:41.660
rather than being like oh you have to

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:43.880
sit here and like work under the master

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.980
for 20 years he's like he kind of is

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:48.200
like [ __ ] let me study this and it's

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.730
funny too he's like you know I don't

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:50.930
want to you guys think we're like dirty

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:53.330
little boys defiling the sacred with you

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:55.730
know Western science but you know it's

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:57.590
like I mean he makes a fair point it's

00:36:57.590 --> 00:36:58.760
like let me just get in and see exactly

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.620
like let me let me find the underlying

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:02.570
processes behind meditation that can

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:04.490
rather than you know he's like only the

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:06.650
elites can afford a 10-day silence

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:08.570
retreat he's like you know if some guys

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:10.220
just driving a truck he's like I want to

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.380
get him those same experiences and I

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.090
think by using that by pulling this

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:16.210
stuff apart with science I think I can

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:18.710
distill like the basic characteristics

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:20.900
that help people from these like praying

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:22.880
all the wisdom traditions hopefully that

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.360
makes sense

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.460
um so again this is where is language is

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:26.220
kind of really

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.960
but it's like you know this is again the

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.820
I here now the person we're in the

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.260
present moment is very important for act

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:33.840
and also for rft and this is how we're

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.840
saying we come to that we're comparing

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.090
objects we're doing this murder my momma

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:41.160
there's my data and then it's like right

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.099
around three four years old we just it's

00:37:44.099 --> 00:37:46.109
like that he says we show up behind our

00:37:46.109 --> 00:37:48.690
eyes and it's like oh [ __ ] like I'm also

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:51.450
a thing and I'm also bigger smaller

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:53.670
faster slower compared to all the other

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:55.470
things and people there's adults and

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:57.210
children you know they just this stuff

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:58.710
starts just coming so it's like this

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.590
unfortunately also gives rise to the

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:04.470
story about who we are right so once we

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:05.730
start comparing ourselves others we

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:07.290
start constructing a story of who we are

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:09.090
you know and obviously we get messages

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:10.410
from the media and our parents and

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:12.300
people around us which we then start to

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.000
ruthlessly compare ourselves to others

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.619
societal ideals fictional characters and

00:38:16.619 --> 00:38:18.750
on and on and on and on on again based

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:20.369
off information that we are

00:38:20.369 --> 00:38:23.760
automatically deriving mostly on an

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:26.160
unconscious level so think about that

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.540
let that sink in this is the kind of

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.940
thing I think is cool out rft our story

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:33.000
of self started a very long time ago a

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.790
time we barely remember and all of this

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:37.890
has been happening automatically for the

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:40.560
most part unless you know if you any of

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.520
you have been lucky enough to have

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.050
parents who understand any of this [ __ ]

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:44.670
you know who don't just lucky like what

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:45.570
the [ __ ] are you talking about when you

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:47.339
bring it up maybe you've got some sort

00:38:47.339 --> 00:38:49.170
of guidance but for the most part these

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:51.450
are just the majority of human beings

00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:53.849
just being shot out of this weird canon

00:38:53.849 --> 00:38:55.140
of language where they you know all of a

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:56.940
sudden now are aware of all this [ __ ]

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:59.099
and you know comparing themselves and

00:38:59.099 --> 00:39:03.540
everything else all right so let's let's

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:05.310
just recap where we're at so far so

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:08.190
story of self plus all ematic comparison

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:10.020
plus again where human beings are

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:12.000
co-operators so innate desire for social

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.119
acceptance plus deriving multiple bits

00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:17.550
of information from each experience plus

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:19.349
the fact that none of our thoughts our

00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:21.000
memories can ever be deleted or

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:21.450
unlearned

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:23.130
that's the other thing too so we're

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:24.690
going through we're driving all this

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:26.220
information driving lost information we

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:27.599
have an experience or deriving this

00:39:27.599 --> 00:39:30.510
we're comparing ourselves you know our

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:32.820
mom [ __ ] just like leaves us a karate

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.440
class or some [ __ ] and like doesn't come

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.599
back for a week you can't unlearn that

00:39:36.599 --> 00:39:38.430
you know like that happens you derive

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:39.670
information out of that experience

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:41.260
typically about yourself maybe about

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:43.869
your mom but none of this there's no

00:39:43.869 --> 00:39:45.040
such thing in psychology called

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.260
unlearning there's no delete button this

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.540
so this these relational frames and the

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.309
information we're exposed so the

00:39:51.309 --> 00:39:52.990
information filtered through relational

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:54.760
frames and stored into networks which is

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.380
just our memory and thoughts and then

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:57.369
you know butts become our thought

00:39:57.369 --> 00:39:59.890
patterns none of this can be deleted or

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:01.420
unlearned it's like a calculator this is

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:03.880
how Hayes puts it it's like your minds

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.650
like a calculator with just a plus and

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:07.809
multiply button with know like

00:40:07.809 --> 00:40:09.549
subtraction or Clear button it just

00:40:09.549 --> 00:40:11.829
keeps building that's all it does you

00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:13.299
might be thinking all [ __ ] dude I

00:40:13.299 --> 00:40:14.829
don't have a story of self from the I

00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:17.260
hear now that's all [ __ ] psychobabble

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.670
[ __ ] [ __ ]

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:22.000
and it's like okay well then think about

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.910
this why do you lie if you don't have a

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:26.470
story of yourself that you're trying to

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:28.569
kind of actualize and you know adhere to

00:40:28.569 --> 00:40:30.730
I never finished quotations sorry I just

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:34.119
saw that um it's like why do you lie and

00:40:34.119 --> 00:40:35.980
of course we live for material gain or

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:37.270
to protect others feelings what about

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:38.710
the times you exaggerated story about

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:41.140
yourself that involved nobody else or

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:42.609
left out certain parts of your day on

00:40:42.609 --> 00:40:43.900
purpose when telling somebody what you

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:47.470
did you know it's like maybe there's

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:48.880
this story we've built that we're trying

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.520
to adhere to and I mean it's it's you

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.260
know it's kind of more like oh maybe

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:54.490
this is where being like polite from

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:55.720
comes from but like you know if you like

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:56.890
I would you do today you're gonna like

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:58.270
completely delete the parts of like all

00:40:58.270 --> 00:40:59.470
I jerked off in the shower

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:03.670
crying in my car you know I know because

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:04.930
it doesn't that doesn't fit with the

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:06.069
story of yourself you'd like to present

00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:07.450
what you know obviously that makes sense

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:09.430
who's you there's pressures of you know

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:10.839
keeping that stuff in you can't go into

00:41:10.839 --> 00:41:12.069
a job interview in vehicle let me tell

00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:14.410
you what I did today [ __ ] kicked my

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:16.510
way no you obviously you know you we're

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:19.059
presenting we're building a story of

00:41:19.059 --> 00:41:20.319
ourselves through language and there's

00:41:20.319 --> 00:41:21.400
nothing wrong with having and

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.559
conceptualize self in fact it's normal

00:41:23.559 --> 00:41:24.819
and it's a healthy thing to do and you

00:41:24.819 --> 00:41:26.500
know frankly a person could have the

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:27.730
total opposite problem where they're

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:30.069
basically floating around with no idea

00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:32.140
no story of self but typically the

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:34.000
problem with our personal story of self

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.829
is when we fuse with the notion of

00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:38.049
ourselves that we have invented through

00:41:38.049 --> 00:41:40.119
language and then struggle to keep that

00:41:40.119 --> 00:41:43.180
story to be true potentially straining

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:45.069
ourselves or even limiting other aspects

00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:47.859
of our truer self that we're denying is

00:41:47.859 --> 00:41:49.000
there there might be other ways we're

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.210
trying to express ourselves in life but

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:53.319
due to this story of

00:41:53.319 --> 00:41:54.940
so we've downloaded through experience

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:58.239
our parents expectations maybe societal

00:41:58.239 --> 00:42:00.579
expectations blah blah blah blah blah so

00:42:00.579 --> 00:42:02.319
it even like you know I can attest this

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:05.199
like I was a realtor when I was I

00:42:05.199 --> 00:42:07.269
started out majoring in psychology a

00:42:07.269 --> 00:42:09.759
bunch of my family was like dude that's

00:42:09.759 --> 00:42:11.559
[ __ ] weird like you're gonna lose

00:42:11.559 --> 00:42:12.969
your mind you can't talk to crazy people

00:42:12.969 --> 00:42:14.140
no one in my family has ever been a

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.099
therapy or anything they're all like

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:16.180
you're gonna [ __ ] lose your mind

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:18.309
that's crazy I know I know one guys with

00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:20.079
therapists he's [ __ ] nuts so I'm

00:42:20.079 --> 00:42:21.369
getting that message then there's

00:42:21.369 --> 00:42:23.199
there's other like cultural messages I

00:42:23.199 --> 00:42:25.089
was like damn I got to go to school for

00:42:25.089 --> 00:42:27.489
like five more years and like I should

00:42:27.489 --> 00:42:29.079
just be getting money this is this is at

00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:31.329
19 years old I was like if I all I want

00:42:31.329 --> 00:42:33.160
to do is make hundred G's a year that

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:36.519
was like my my goal upon goals and so

00:42:36.519 --> 00:42:39.910
you know I through my interactions with

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:41.680
other people I I kind of altered my

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.539
story of self and then went and I became

00:42:43.539 --> 00:42:45.609
a business major and I majored in

00:42:45.609 --> 00:42:47.589
business it was deeply deeply

00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:50.019
unfulfilled I hated every second of it

00:42:50.019 --> 00:42:51.579
so and this is X this is what I'm

00:42:51.579 --> 00:42:53.229
referring to is like you know I

00:42:53.229 --> 00:42:54.789
constructed a false story of the self

00:42:54.789 --> 00:42:56.199
you can call it a false self there's a

00:42:56.199 --> 00:42:58.180
million terms for this but if your

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:00.400
day-to-day reality is causing so much

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.809
psychic friction to kind of like you

00:43:01.809 --> 00:43:03.400
know in class I'm angry I'm like this

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.709
[ __ ] sucks this is boring but I kept

00:43:05.709 --> 00:43:07.239
subjecting myself to that environment

00:43:07.239 --> 00:43:09.910
because I wanted myself to believe that

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:11.799
I I was a businessman you know as

00:43:11.799 --> 00:43:14.170
laughable as that is like you know I get

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:16.690
strict like no [ __ ] businessman and

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:18.039
not like you know I don't want to do

00:43:18.039 --> 00:43:20.049
psychology or anything kind of like with

00:43:20.049 --> 00:43:22.180
words or people like I just need to make

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:23.289
money because that's all I ever saw

00:43:23.289 --> 00:43:24.579
people do in life you know it's like

00:43:24.579 --> 00:43:27.009
make as much money as you can that's

00:43:27.009 --> 00:43:28.209
kind of the whole point to everything

00:43:28.209 --> 00:43:29.529
which is sick if you can get behind that

00:43:29.529 --> 00:43:31.869
dude that's a fun game to play but again

00:43:31.869 --> 00:43:33.969
there was like my story my innate truer

00:43:33.969 --> 00:43:35.979
story of self there was like unexpressed

00:43:35.979 --> 00:43:37.180
parts of that that I couldn't even

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:38.680
articulate back then but I just knew I

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.329
was super stressed and super bothered

00:43:40.329 --> 00:43:42.699
that like end it with me as a Realtor at

00:43:42.699 --> 00:43:45.609
19 years old driving around totally

00:43:45.609 --> 00:43:48.369
[ __ ] zero you know totally

00:43:48.369 --> 00:43:50.289
unsuccessful never sold a single house I

00:43:50.289 --> 00:43:51.880
would get like rejected and like

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.859
basically crying my car it's kind of

00:43:53.859 --> 00:43:55.539
embarrassing then like smoke weed on the

00:43:55.539 --> 00:43:57.249
way I was a bad realtor day it's a very

00:43:57.249 --> 00:43:59.859
bad realtor but that's what I'm talking

00:43:59.859 --> 00:44:01.449
about when like you know this stuff's

00:44:01.449 --> 00:44:03.219
very weird and hard to nail down but

00:44:03.219 --> 00:44:04.750
it's like there is something to that

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:07.450
like who's the author of the story of

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:09.730
yourself it's like well you know we none

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:11.830
of us like our like Beowulf out or like

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:13.630
I'm the one who's defined my being since

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:15.780
3 it's like these are very again

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:18.340
relational we're getting our information

00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:19.570
from the way other people treat us the

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:21.100
way we see other people do things and

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:22.900
we're this is all through relation to

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:25.120
others that's that's how we construct

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.040
our reality through language unlike a

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:29.710
Cambrian period like weird vacuum sharks

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:31.240
that just kind of bumps into an electric

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.550
barb and it's like yeah just moves away

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:34.810
from that thing it's totally different

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:36.430
knowing when a barb is knowing but the

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:40.210
[ __ ] Cambrian period is all right um

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:43.120
let's jump back here we're gonna go all

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:47.380
the way back so we have it I think a

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.120
basic understanding of what relational

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.620
frame theory is I hope you do if you

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:52.150
don't you know we'll just watch it again

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:54.460
you know it'll come to you so let's I'm

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:56.980
gonna take a fictionalised we're gonna

00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:59.230
run through like somebody's life a

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:01.510
fictionalized account right just to give

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:03.910
just a really kind of nail at home so

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:05.800
this is the made-up rft story of Justin

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:09.370
Jones Justin was born in July of 1994

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:11.980
like all newborns he started out in

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:14.140
animal mode like we talked about with

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:15.790
the associative learning stuff not

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:17.530
totally a tabula rasa which just means

00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:19.450
blank slate since he was born with

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:21.220
various instincts and a temperament but

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:23.290
verbally justin is something again he is

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:24.940
a blank state verbally because we're not

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:26.500
total blank slates again we have

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:29.830
instincts but Justin we can say as a

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:31.300
baby the day he's born is a wordless

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:34.450
member of the animal kingdom all the

00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:36.040
while during his first few months he's

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:37.210
surrounded by people making these

00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:39.550
strange noises at him and at and around

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:42.100
him called language but baby Justin

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:43.780
remains blissfully unaware of any of

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:45.550
this the first six months or so just

00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:47.530
[ __ ] eating napping and crying and

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:48.940
when stuff doesn't suit his instinctual

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:50.920
needs you know he just will be like I'm

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:54.430
making noise like a [ __ ] cow all

00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:57.190
right hmm but then at around six months

00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:59.110
or so Justin starts messing around with

00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:01.420
sounds that kind of resemble words you

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:03.610
know like why Baba and all of a sudden

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:05.560
like I said before his mom appears out

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.120
of nowhere with a bottle and super

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.220
stoked on him is praising him feeds him

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:11.170
on the spot it doesn't take many times

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:12.910
of this before Justin still as a pre

00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:15.760
verbal baby start figuring out again the

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.020
associative learning stuff that these

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:18.309
noises he makes can

00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:21.130
direct effect on his environment so it's

00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:22.719
and they can be the opposite way baby

00:46:22.719 --> 00:46:24.279
cries whole time you like screaming it

00:46:24.279 --> 00:46:25.509
gets in his face it'll withdraw

00:46:25.509 --> 00:46:27.160
animalistic [ __ ] it and they'll just

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:29.650
stop which is a bad thing so what

00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:32.199
started out as instinctual groans are

00:46:32.199 --> 00:46:34.390
now being molded by the noticed actions

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:36.579
of others and the processes they kick

00:46:36.579 --> 00:46:38.380
off and how these processes affect us

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:40.420
directly thus we start to learn by

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.430
association like the animal he still is

00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:44.559
to make certain words and we started

00:46:44.559 --> 00:46:46.059
slowly connecting those words the

00:46:46.059 --> 00:46:50.579
experience we have all right

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:54.109
that's that's six months right now we're

00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:56.030
older now Justin's a year right

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:58.300
and one day after his first birthday

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:00.950
Justin's mom comes up and gives him a

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:03.950
round crumbly thing that tastes yummy he

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:04.550
eats it

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:06.740
he enjoys it very much and then after he

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:09.050
eats it that's important she tells him

00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:10.900
the thing he ate was a cookie

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:13.579
Justin symbolizes the process of seeing

00:47:13.579 --> 00:47:16.460
his mom getting a cookie and then

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:19.670
enjoying it with a with enjoying it with

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:22.369
the physical cookie itself the the this

00:47:22.369 --> 00:47:24.140
what a cookie is the shape of it in the

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:28.010
word of it so as he okay so Justin

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:30.260
symbolizes the process of getting a

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:32.540
cookie enjoying a cookie with the word

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:34.220
and physical cookie as a separate entity

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.200
that holds the pleasure of eating that

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.200
thing within it so the word cookie holds

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:41.450
that whole experience in it also his mom

00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:43.069
get some points obviously as being the

00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:45.950
klog forgiving him the cookie so again

00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:47.869
this is where it's important after

00:47:47.869 --> 00:47:50.359
justin experiences a cookie he's told

00:47:50.359 --> 00:47:52.040
what it is and he can be like oh that

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.079
was a cookie you might think big deal if

00:47:54.079 --> 00:47:55.609
I say treat my dog freaks out pretty

00:47:55.609 --> 00:47:56.750
much the same thing it's like no it's

00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:58.609
not because dogs need the word before

00:47:58.609 --> 00:48:00.400
the experience to make the association

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.540
so they don't really know what a treat

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:04.369
symbolizes they just know they're about

00:48:04.369 --> 00:48:06.410
to be enjoying some food in the second

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:08.210
because that's what's typically coming

00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:09.950
after the word or bell or the bag being

00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:12.349
opened humans on the other hand can and

00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:14.630
automatically do tie the experience to

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:15.799
an object we already learned this

00:48:15.799 --> 00:48:18.109
through a verbal unit called a word so

00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:19.700
yes like dogs we hear cookies and get

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.380
excited but unlike dogs through language

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:23.930
we eventually and automatically learn to

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:25.849
picture a cookie in our minds and

00:48:25.849 --> 00:48:28.520
respond respond to that thought picture

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:31.940
you know that like mind's eye image of a

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:34.460
cookie or verbal eye symbol the word the

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:36.470
same way we would seeing smelling

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:38.119
tasting a physical cookie we are

00:48:38.119 --> 00:48:40.130
deriving extra information from one

00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:42.349
informational source unlike dogs and

00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:44.990
associative learning so we ate the

00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:46.400
cookie your mom told us what it was and

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.599
we're able to go oh that thing we just

00:48:47.599 --> 00:48:49.790
ate because we understand but then we

00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:51.020
just ate something a second ago

00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:54.020
all right so let's go a little bit

00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:55.849
deeper into this this this is like the

00:48:55.849 --> 00:48:59.599
explanation of deriving multiple

00:48:59.599 --> 00:49:01.549
relations from the book it's kind of

00:49:01.549 --> 00:49:03.230
weird but I think it's actually not bad

00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:04.910
to look through so alright so

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:07.820
right or 10 months right and if you're

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:08.990
watching the video you'll see what I'm

00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:10.340
talking about if you're not just listen

00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:11.690
it's a weird little shape it looks kind

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:13.280
of like a tadpole so you tell a 10 month

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.380
old you say this is a gub-gub can you

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:17.960
say gub-gub and that you know child 10

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:20.090
months will go gub-gub and look okay the

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:22.700
gub-gub says woo can you say woo ten

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:25.100
months old you will say woo so we can do

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:26.630
this at 10 months so can language

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:30.440
trained chimps put it around for 14

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:32.750
months humans and again humans only will

00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:34.250
reverse the direction of what they

00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:35.330
learned and this is what I'm talking

00:49:35.330 --> 00:49:38.120
about this is a gub-gub can you say

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.980
gub-gub the 14 month old will say

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:42.590
gub-gub and then you can just so then

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:44.510
you can take like the basket of fruit

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:46.100
basically so then you can take the

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:47.330
picture of the gub-gub it looks like a

00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:49.220
tadpole and mix it in with a bunch of

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:50.870
other pictures of like just weird other

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:52.850
you know just weird figures you draw up

00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:55.310
and you can you just big which one of

00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:56.630
these is the gub-gub the

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:58.070
fourteen-year-old will look through all

00:49:58.070 --> 00:50:00.470
of them and point to the thing they only

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:03.020
learned to call a gub-gub so in this

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:05.330
again it sounds weird but it's like it's

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:06.590
just like you're basically training

00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:07.820
again a monkey you're like training it

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:09.500
to just say the word when they recognize

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:12.200
a symbol that's 14 months you're

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:13.640
recognizing like oh no no this isn't

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.860
like a trick that thing that shape is a

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:17.750
gub-gub and it's like again if you're

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:19.600
watching the video it's like you know

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.860
how do we know the gub-gub is not like

00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:23.390
all the white space plus that or just

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:25.070
the white space it's like you know we're

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:26.500
recognizing that thing as a creature

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:29.540
again we automatically realize that not

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:31.580
only does the picture refer to the word

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:34.370
gub-gub but also the word gub-gub also

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:36.620
refers to the picture so again I'm like

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.540
a monkey with an orange and a basket of

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:41.360
fruit we can pick a thing out of an

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:43.100
assortment of other things at 14 months

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:46.610
just by learning how to say a thing

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:48.860
so we're deriving extra information then

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.080
out at around 22 months we learn to

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.000
combine all of the reversible directions

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.860
so again after only seeing a picture of

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:57.140
a gum gum learning what it says the

00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:59.180
child only needs to be verbally prompted

00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:00.920
with the question who says woo and

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.870
they'll respond a gub-gub not requiring

00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:04.190
the picture of the gum gum at all so

00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:06.530
again 22 month old you say this is gulps

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:09.020
a gub-gub this is a gub-gub gum says woo

00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:10.640
can you say we take the picture away you

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:11.960
ask them you know whenever you're like

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.820
who says woo I go gub-gub

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:14.690
because they

00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:16.820
just by doing one thing they've derived

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:18.920
multiple relations out of that and

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:20.000
that's what again that's what I'm

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.140
reversing the direction of what you

00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:22.640
learned means so again that's kind of

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:24.560
weird but we'll see how this works

00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.300
through the you know real-life examples

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.250
we're still on Justin and also to of

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:29.810
anything bad or good happens while baby

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:31.190
is learning about a gub-gub by the way

00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:33.080
they'll associate the word or picture

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.490
with the matter good thing so these

00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:36.620
things a cub cub as fictional and

00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:38.600
nonsense as it is could take a sinister

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.490
or positive implication of his seeing it

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:42.850
you know if something happens the kid

00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:47.960
alright we are moving what the [ __ ] oh

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:51.620
here we go all right so all right so

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:55.100
Justin had a cookie now he's a little

00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:56.060
older all right

00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:58.820
Justin's a big boy now so he knows what

00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:00.530
a cookie is he's learned to derive extra

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:04.190
he's learned to reverse the relation of

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:05.960
information I just like to put it like

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:07.550
deriving extra information out of a

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:09.800
single stimulus or event he's learned

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.220
how to do that right so and in the

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:14.600
gub-gub thing and maybe doesn't seem

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:15.800
that impressive but now consider

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.470
eight-year-old Justin right without it

00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:20.090
ever being explained to him justin has

00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:22.220
fully grasped and comprehended the I

00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:25.010
here now that is conceptualize self

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:26.630
along with some knowledge about a place

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:28.490
it's called Hill that bad people go to

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:31.160
the notion of ghosts and also that his

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:32.480
mom and dad argue sometimes it gets

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:33.920
really loud and scary so this is what's

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.530
like you're eight years old you're four

00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:38.210
years into the game of just being

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:40.190
yourself you know you're that's why kids

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:42.260
are also usually pretty uninhibited

00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:43.070
because they're just you know they're

00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:45.020
not really hung up on a lot of [ __ ]

00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:47.090
they're just like I'm gonna jump and do

00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:48.680
a circle it's just you know we're doing

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:49.880
with but we also are you know again we

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:51.410
heard about Hill it's kind of freaky

00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:53.090
Hurlock ghost like that's pretty [ __ ]

00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:57.290
scary we kind of know what dying is what

00:52:57.290 --> 00:52:58.760
we're silly you know so go on to the

00:52:58.760 --> 00:52:59.930
simple days of seeing a gub-gub and

00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:02.480
naming it you know just II can compare

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.670
now since the past in the future he has

00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:07.640
real fears and regrets some regrets they

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.260
don't last long but either way he can

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:11.720
regret a thing surrounded by peers and

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.700
constant media images he is beginning to

00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:15.680
construct the story of who he is based

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.380
on how he relates to others in the world

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:20.630
around via the information he

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:22.670
automatically derives through experience

00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:25.490
does the gum says whoo who says we were

00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:27.560
the gum so he's seeing things and he's

00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:28.369
pulling out if

00:53:28.369 --> 00:53:29.569
pieces that aren't being directly

00:53:29.569 --> 00:53:31.220
presented to him but his mind is doing

00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:32.869
that automatically just like again

00:53:32.869 --> 00:53:37.069
two-year-old nose - gulping and again it

00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:38.359
like at the gub-gub it doesn't seem that

00:53:38.359 --> 00:53:40.490
big of a deal with when you put a kid

00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:43.460
and give them experiences little kids

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:45.140
are downloading different bits of

00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:46.309
information about themselves that

00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:47.420
nobody's checking them on they're just

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:49.069
doing this automatically so one day a

00:53:49.069 --> 00:53:51.259
lady comes into Justin's classroom tells

00:53:51.259 --> 00:53:52.730
everyone that she is taking a certain

00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:54.200
number of students out of class and say

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:56.480
tested into advanced math bunch of his

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.849
classmates get up follow a lady and the

00:53:58.849 --> 00:54:01.220
usual math class resumed - the chosen

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:03.890
peers this is an experience Justin's

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:05.480
peers selected for the experience as

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:06.950
Justin's peers being selected for

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:08.539
advanced math derived information by

00:54:08.539 --> 00:54:11.059
Justin I am not as good at math as them

00:54:11.059 --> 00:54:14.450
they are smarter than me I am dumb they

00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:16.880
are nerds I am NOT a nerd I'm a cool kid

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:18.380
and cool kids aren't good at math anyway

00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:19.549
so that's kind of like the derived

00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:21.230
information and you'll see it kind of

00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:23.119
slowly gets filtered into his story of

00:54:23.119 --> 00:54:25.009
himself you know the fact that they're

00:54:25.009 --> 00:54:26.509
smarter than me so what does he do kind

00:54:26.509 --> 00:54:27.680
of like this gets in like defense

00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:30.109
mechanism you start being like well but

00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:31.609
[ __ ] nerds you know and I've been

00:54:31.609 --> 00:54:33.589
told by the world that I'm not good at

00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:35.960
math and I made this other again so I

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:37.039
talked about when like you know the

00:54:37.039 --> 00:54:38.960
nickel versus the dime we become

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.670
unmoored from physical reality to the

00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:41.869
point where it's like well I heard

00:54:41.869 --> 00:54:43.670
people who are smart or nerds you know

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:45.259
just as feeling a little salty and not

00:54:45.259 --> 00:54:46.549
getting advanced math feels a little

00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:48.950
overall about that so he starts to know

00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:50.299
offending the ego he goes well I'm not a

00:54:50.299 --> 00:54:52.009
nerd I'm cool and cool kids aren't good

00:54:52.009 --> 00:54:54.470
at math anyway so later on one of the

00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:55.789
advanced students comes back into the

00:54:55.789 --> 00:54:58.579
room feeling a little ornery justin

00:54:58.579 --> 00:55:01.039
sticks his foot out in trypsin the

00:55:01.039 --> 00:55:02.779
teacher sees this and writes him a

00:55:02.779 --> 00:55:04.549
demerit when justin gets home and shows

00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:06.319
his parents they tell him to go to his

00:55:06.319 --> 00:55:07.579
room and then they get into a heated

00:55:07.579 --> 00:55:08.989
discussion about it to the point where

00:55:08.989 --> 00:55:10.819
his mom cries and slams the door so

00:55:10.819 --> 00:55:12.890
what's the experience now witnessing the

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:15.079
ruckus of a domestic argument derived

00:55:15.079 --> 00:55:17.239
information if I didn't get into trouble

00:55:17.239 --> 00:55:18.859
then they wouldn't have fought remember

00:55:18.859 --> 00:55:20.779
all the you know the cause rule frames

00:55:20.779 --> 00:55:22.309
were automatically filtering our

00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:23.539
experiences through these relational

00:55:23.539 --> 00:55:26.809
frames so again just a thing happened

00:55:26.809 --> 00:55:29.480
but again Justin's downloading this

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:30.920
information automatically well if I

00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:32.059
didn't get in trouble then they wouldn't

00:55:32.059 --> 00:55:34.220
have fought my parents would be happy my

00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:35.599
parents would be happier without me

00:55:35.599 --> 00:55:37.970
everything was fine yesterday therefore

00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:40.770
I'm problem I must be bad

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:44.040
bad start Justin no ice let's get into

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:47.640
his teenage years right so all right now

00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:50.910
Justin's 14 his parents divorced and his

00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:52.320
dad hasn't exactly remained in the

00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.850
picture which he automatically assumes

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:55.230
responsibility for even though

00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:57.120
unbeknownst to himself his dad is a

00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:59.250
serial philanderer cheater basically in

00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:02.070
a pillhead Justin's got a real chip on

00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:03.420
her shoulder confused why everything

00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:05.280
seems too unfair not to mention he's a

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.900
freshman now and lost all his cool

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:08.160
points as soon as he started a new

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:10.050
school some of the kids actually pitch

00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:12.270
on pick on him which causes Justin a

00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:13.740
great deal distress since his former

00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:15.390
story of self included being you know

00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:18.090
the cool kid and not the bully nerd but

00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:19.920
now he's in a new environment

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:21.510
you know his dad's not around which

00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:23.370
again he internalized not knowing the

00:56:23.370 --> 00:56:24.630
full picture and again this is why I

00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:25.830
like when kids don't know what's going

00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:27.360
on they typically blame themselves you

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:29.550
know he's 14 so it's a little old for

00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:31.830
that but whatever so this causes this

00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:33.630
all this huge change this whole reverse

00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:35.760
this whole like you know his story of

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:37.830
self being contested by his environment

00:56:37.830 --> 00:56:40.440
now it's it's it's throwing Justin off

00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:41.970
big time so you know it's like [ __ ] math

00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:44.220
[ __ ] school cue the Papa Roach then his

00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:46.500
mom remarries a local landscaping mag

00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:50.880
like a landscaping tycoon I'm talking

00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:52.350
like you know 400 lawns per season

00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:54.360
commercial mulch jobs the real deal and

00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:56.880
the guy to the right as you see in the

00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:59.880
picture is his son excuse that picture

00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:02.490
that's kind of graphic that's ridiculous

00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:05.520
actually stepdad makes Justin work on

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.710
the weekends with the son Chad jr. and

00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:10.140
instantly Justin realizes how bad he is

00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:12.000
at manual labor the wheel barrels heavy

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.340
the Sun burns his skin the dust the

00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:15.960
pollen weed whackers kicking up rocks

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:17.250
and hitting him in the eye he gets

00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:18.960
poison ivy twice and burns multiple

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:19.290
lawns

00:57:19.290 --> 00:57:20.820
I mean you burn a lot it means you the

00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:22.320
decks too low and you cut it so low that

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:25.050
the wand dies one of the Mexican dudes

00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:27.300
calls me word he learns means [ __ ] later

00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:28.920
in the wolf ride home and everyone

00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.860
laughs at him that's where this well you

00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:33.510
know some of this stuff's happened to me

00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:34.680
but this isn't about myself

00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:37.890
uh-huh so Justin stepdad

00:57:37.890 --> 00:57:40.320
Chad jr. ride home together every day in

00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:42.210
the truck Justin in the middle of course

00:57:42.210 --> 00:57:45.090
while stepdad praises Chad jr. and

00:57:45.090 --> 00:57:47.100
either reprimands or ignores Justin's

00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:48.570
this is the experience for summer going

00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:50.280
into a setting he's in school people are

00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:51.540
picking on him you know I thought I was

00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:53.310
cool apparently I'm a nerd I guess I'll

00:57:53.310 --> 00:57:54.599
do landscaping

00:57:54.599 --> 00:57:55.979
I'm a total [ __ ] [ __ ] this is the

00:57:55.979 --> 00:57:57.329
information he's deriving just because

00:57:57.329 --> 00:58:00.059
he's a [ __ ] kid doing this work with

00:58:00.059 --> 00:58:02.640
grown men and then in the whole way home

00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:06.329
stepdad is ignoring Justin and either-or

00:58:06.329 --> 00:58:07.589
just being like dude man you got you

00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:08.759
know you guys start doing this you know

00:58:08.759 --> 00:58:10.140
you were lazy today you can't sit down

00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:11.700
you can't take breaks blah blah blah

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:12.119
blah

00:58:12.119 --> 00:58:13.890
in the meantime Justin's his biological

00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:16.140
son so he's like Chad excuse me Chad his

00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:17.999
biological son so he's like yo CJ man

00:58:17.999 --> 00:58:19.710
you're [ __ ] killing it out there how

00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:21.119
about I'll drop off Justin you and I

00:58:21.119 --> 00:58:22.470
will go look at it you know go look at

00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:23.759
jobs together blah blah blah blah blah

00:58:23.759 --> 00:58:26.509
again so the experience Justin's having

00:58:26.509 --> 00:58:29.400
he's deriving this information out of it

00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:31.380
like okay so the experience is working

00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:33.809
in a summer landscaping job dr2 info I'm

00:58:33.809 --> 00:58:35.640
less capable of handling the elements

00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:37.619
and like physical labor than others I

00:58:37.619 --> 00:58:39.059
suck at everything I do

00:58:39.059 --> 00:58:41.460
I am weaker than Chad jr. I don't belong

00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:43.410
I'm a [ __ ] I have a tina's compared to

00:58:43.410 --> 00:58:45.989
CJ's perma bulge I don't deserve the

00:58:45.989 --> 00:58:47.400
lover attention of male authority

00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:48.809
figures considering my dad doesn't talk

00:58:48.809 --> 00:58:51.089
to me and Chad senior ignores me and can

00:58:51.089 --> 00:58:52.559
we're driving this information based on

00:58:52.559 --> 00:58:54.989
this you know this I hear now because

00:58:54.989 --> 00:58:58.559
you know the Chad senior could just be

00:58:58.559 --> 00:58:59.700
weirded out about having a [ __ ]

00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:01.380
stepson he might be like I don't know

00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:03.479
how to like I I'm I'm sitting here

00:59:03.479 --> 00:59:05.999
trying to father CJ I'm I'm having a

00:59:05.999 --> 00:59:08.099
hard time and that it's like I just

00:59:08.099 --> 00:59:10.200
[ __ ] I just like CJ CJ's my

00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:12.059
biological son I like him more even

00:59:12.059 --> 00:59:13.559
though maybe I'm saying you know like I

00:59:13.559 --> 00:59:15.359
love your kid but when it comes down to

00:59:15.359 --> 00:59:17.039
it it's like god this kids such a

00:59:17.039 --> 00:59:19.079
[ __ ] [ __ ] I don't like the steps I

00:59:19.079 --> 00:59:20.430
don't know I got to deal with them and

00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:23.640
it really has nothing to do with Justin

00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:26.700
it says this is the actions of a you

00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:28.769
know unsophisticated step parent but

00:59:28.769 --> 00:59:29.999
again what happens it becomes

00:59:29.999 --> 00:59:32.430
internalized the information because it

00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:35.839
there's the I hear now that is just in

00:59:35.839 --> 00:59:38.009
interpreting the VINs the events they're

00:59:38.009 --> 00:59:39.900
personally of just Chad's senior which

00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:41.819
is just like you know I just I have a

00:59:41.819 --> 00:59:42.989
million things on my mind I'm trying to

00:59:42.989 --> 00:59:44.069
run this thing I can't think of this

00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:45.660
little kids feelings then again we're

00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:47.219
deriving multiple sources of information

00:59:47.219 --> 00:59:49.920
from one experience so whoa I say I'm

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:54.360
starting to get it alright so again

00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:56.340
this is the overarching moral of the

00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:58.530
story so the gub-gub goes woo somewhere

00:59:58.530 --> 01:00:00.180
once we begin to derive extra

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:01.560
information from our experiences which

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.240
we cannot help but to and it's honestly

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:05.430
the reason why we as a species I kind of

01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:06.840
really harps in the negative here but

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.760
this is like tons of helpful

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:11.850
implications it helps us like hold a

01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:13.620
problem in our mind solve it in our

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:15.990
minds like plan for the future take

01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:17.490
information on the past so it's good so

01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:19.110
there's no stopping it okay like I said

01:00:19.110 --> 01:00:20.610
it's like a calculator with no subtract

01:00:20.610 --> 01:00:22.410
or delete button just keeps going and

01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:23.820
going and building and expanding so

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:25.710
these so it starts off innocently enough

01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:27.240
we're like oh my toy trucks bigger than

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.650
my toy car has two relational frames

01:00:28.650 --> 01:00:31.800
this thing is called milk but then as

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.540
these things please grow exponentially

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:35.100
because if your every one piece of

01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:37.110
information you take in your brain is

01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:38.340
converting into like four or five

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:39.780
different bits of information about

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:41.820
yourself in the world eventually what

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:44.460
can happen is you build out all these in

01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:46.140
this picture there's so that one picture

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:47.850
is a smiley face with two little

01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:49.440
triangles over it sighs that's when you

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:50.940
like you know don't really have your

01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:52.140
conception of self and all the

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.550
experiences that go along with building

01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:55.470
that and you know if you're not careful

01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:57.450
or there's no like kind of guidance or

01:00:57.450 --> 01:00:59.400
you know people looking out for you in

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.740
certain ways that those relational

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:04.440
frames can eventually become since they

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.730
started so young they happen

01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:07.530
automatically they become and they're so

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:09.240
ubiquitous everyone else does it they

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.610
can then define a reality and paint you

01:01:11.610 --> 01:01:13.110
into a picture of yourself that could be

01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:15.000
like I'm a [ __ ] loser nobody likes me

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.530
a weak dumb and I'm not worthy of

01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:18.870
positive regard but that whole story was

01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:21.720
just derived wrongfully you could say

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.000
through experiences with nobody there to

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.620
check or be like well that's not the

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.900
case which again if that happens that

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:29.280
can totally alter or change a lot of

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.810
that stuff again just having a bunch of

01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:34.410
positive experiences so it's like it

01:01:34.410 --> 01:01:36.750
just shows you how our sense of reality

01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:39.360
our story of self our story of others

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.740
sort of society however you want to put

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:43.500
it has been constructed through us

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.680
deriving information via language right

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.390
this is the why again this is just like

01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:50.970
the theory and this is like a very basic

01:01:50.970 --> 01:01:52.680
understanding of this theory it's really

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:55.080
[ __ ] weird but again it's like we can

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:57.000
really paint ourselves into it we can

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.500
kind of imprison ourselves in a very

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.690
negative story of self but then we

01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:02.460
convince ourselves that we have to like

01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:05.760
overcome and change by a certain course

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.680
of actions when in reality we can just

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.270
stop telling ourselves were a piece of

01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:10.800
[ __ ] which is harder you know easier

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.050
said than done obviously so just in the

01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:16.310
epilogue what happens to Justin alright

01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:19.860
Justin is 27 wanting badly to be cool in

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:23.220
high school you know due to his rigid

01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:25.290
adherence to his story of self built so

01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:27.650
long ago after that ill-fated math class

01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:29.880
Justin spent the rest of his high-school

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.470
years being a badass trying to be a

01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:32.970
badass he took drugs

01:02:32.970 --> 01:02:35.160
he fought Chad Chad jr. twice and lost

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:38.250
fought a stepdad once ty but chad senior

01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:40.230
was hella drunk got a girl pregnant who

01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:42.660
left him and took full custody of their

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:44.220
kids since justin turned out to be a

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:45.560
raging cokehead with an anger problem

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.670
under lied with a deep sense of shame

01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:50.340
and insecurity after unsuccessfully

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:51.900
trying to rise to the top through

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.430
multiple pyramid schemes in order to

01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:54.720
show everyone that they were wrong

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:58.020
justin ended up losing almost all of his

01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:00.210
christmas money that his rich stepmom

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:02.160
who for some reason married his bio dad

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.230
who is now a born-again christian but

01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:05.790
still emotionally distant from justin

01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:06.870
and pretty much everyone else in his

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:08.850
life gave him so the stepmom a married

01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:10.590
you know a rich stepmom who was just

01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:13.260
like gives justin a bunch of money you

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:15.830
know once the season checks in on him

01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:17.670
but justin the rest of justice

01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:19.170
relationships are completely frayed and

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:20.790
[ __ ] up and even the one the stepmom

01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:23.010
ones not the best but all right so

01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:25.860
justin with his few dollars left over

01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:28.650
stumbles upon the ACT workbook desperate

01:03:28.650 --> 01:03:29.880
to figure out a way to change his

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.590
enduring hell he has known as his life

01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:36.090
he tried another book oh so sorry he

01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:38.580
came across the ACT workbook because one

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:40.590
of the things he does he caught he like

01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:43.380
hole read business inspiration books

01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:45.360
like gary vaynerchuck type stuff

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:47.370
he's been reads that kind of stuff

01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:48.960
compulsively trying to like because he

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.400
has this chip on his shoulder he's i got

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.660
to show everybody on the [ __ ] bag

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:52.830
gotta show every i'm not a piece of [ __ ]

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:55.440
a lot cuz you know he's he's derived the

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.640
message from a young age that he's

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.620
unworthy of love and attention he's

01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:00.810
trying to overcome that through becoming

01:04:00.810 --> 01:04:02.670
something larger than life and anything

01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:03.990
less than in becoming larger than life

01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:07.650
is a failure to validate his problematic

01:04:07.650 --> 01:04:09.240
existence since he seems he's told

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:10.440
himself from a young age that all he

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.820
does is cause problems where he goes

01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:13.560
which is something he automatically

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.720
derived the things that you know we're

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:17.070
really no fault of his own they should

01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:19.230
have been up to adults okay sorry

01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:22.560
um okay so yeah so he comes across the

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.850
act work book through his you know

01:04:23.850 --> 01:04:25.260
through going through business

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:28.670
inspirational books kind of compulsively

01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:30.600
but you know but the business

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.010
inspirational books didn't work because

01:04:32.010 --> 01:04:33.420
you know consciously telling yourself to

01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:35.040
think positive thoughts reminds you of

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.570
all your negative ones do the way that

01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:39.210
our minds work relationally plus the

01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:40.470
fact that we just can't unlearn our

01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:42.810
negative thoughts own response you know

01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:44.130
so justin the books don't really work

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:45.420
and he has the act book so he's kind of

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:47.340
stumbling upon some of the exercises but

01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:49.200
you know his other the things he's been

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.550
doing to kind of mitigate his pain is

01:04:50.550 --> 01:04:52.050
justin stopped hanging around his family

01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:53.550
since they'd been the source of a lot of

01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:56.160
his pain he masturbates nightly to porn

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.720
that is increasing in terms of hard

01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.700
cornice said he can sleep without being

01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:02.550
beset about anxiety related to his new

01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:04.109
life story about an unwanted and

01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:06.810
unlovable lifetime [ __ ] again he kind

01:05:06.810 --> 01:05:08.640
of compulsively reads these garyvee type

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.770
business books which usually end up

01:05:10.770 --> 01:05:12.359
reminding him about his lack of wealth

01:05:12.359 --> 01:05:15.540
and he is also taking kratom smoking

01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:17.070
weed daily so that he can function in

01:05:17.070 --> 01:05:19.890
his new job as a gas station clerk also

01:05:19.890 --> 01:05:22.680
you know in the in this theoretical

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:25.200
vignette justin had a girlfriend but she

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.180
left him because he was looking at too

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:28.380
much porn alright

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:33.330
he's a porn addict alright okay so then

01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:34.800
the other thing he does to kind of

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.030
mitigate his pain and his sense of

01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:36.480
loneliness

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.820
he's romantically he's romantically

01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:40.800
lonely and he's ruthlessly scouring all

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:43.320
the dating apps but purposely selects

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.670
woman who he doesn't think are too a

01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:46.140
pretty quote-unquote since he figures

01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:47.400
that leaves him less of a chance of

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.800
being left or betrayed now this will

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:51.630
make more sense on the next slide so job

01:05:51.630 --> 01:05:53.790
but justin sorry i wrote this last night

01:05:53.790 --> 01:05:55.950
it wasn't too well organized but so

01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:58.170
justin hat he's a compulsive business

01:05:58.170 --> 01:06:00.510
book reader we didn't create him every

01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:02.730
day he doesn't hang ready refuses

01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:05.490
hanging on his family he's he needs to

01:06:05.490 --> 01:06:07.200
watch porn in order to go to sleep any

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.820
scowers dating apps and he kind of like

01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:10.350
he's like yeah but i'm gonna like you

01:06:10.350 --> 01:06:13.020
know i'm gonna do the plenty of fish and

01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:16.350
you know kind of filter for non-athletic

01:06:16.350 --> 01:06:17.910
frames or whatever [ __ ] you're doing

01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:21.420
alright sorry so but he has alright so

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:22.680
here this is this is the whole point of

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.160
this i'm sorry

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:27.550
so three gets the act book and this is

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:29.620
kind of where relational frame theory

01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:35.020
jumps into act so it's like one of the

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:36.520
if you're not if you're listening this

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.110
this is from the book itself as a coping

01:06:38.110 --> 01:06:41.710
strategies worksheet so there's I am a

01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:43.210
loser that's a painful thought or

01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:45.490
feeling you know and in order to get

01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:47.890
through the day justin smokes weed and

01:06:47.890 --> 01:06:51.070
takes kratom so he can function at his

01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:52.810
job at the gas station painful thought

01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:55.390
or feeling number two I am unlovable so

01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:57.670
what does Justin do he ruthlessly seeks

01:06:57.670 --> 01:07:01.000
meaningless sex online painful thought

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.650
her feeling my family hates me what does

01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:05.110
he do chooses to see he chooses to spend

01:07:05.110 --> 01:07:07.780
holidays alone he gets anxiety at night

01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:09.540
so he did porn and masturbating

01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:11.590
depression and negativity he tries to

01:07:11.590 --> 01:07:13.750
ward those off by reading these business

01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:15.850
books and hoping they kind of like merge

01:07:15.850 --> 01:07:17.470
with that like winner author he's

01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:19.960
reading about alright so let's start the

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.610
so and again on this sheet it's a

01:07:21.610 --> 01:07:22.750
painful thought or feeling coping

01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:23.830
technique it says short-term

01:07:23.830 --> 01:07:26.710
effectiveness long-term effectiveness so

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:28.990
painful thought I'm a loser daily reader

01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:30.880
kratom I mean it works against him to

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.380
his job but you know if you think about

01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:33.850
long-term effectiveness it's like well

01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:35.560
Justin's don't eventually want a better

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:37.410
paying job but that typically requires

01:07:37.410 --> 01:07:39.490
you know being able to pass a drug test

01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:42.010
for them for a lot of jobs so it's like

01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:43.870
you know it's getting the gas station

01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:45.550
it's it's helping that short-term need

01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:47.950
but it's kind of boxing him in in terms

01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:50.020
of long term effectiveness so it's like

01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:51.450
sometimes things work in the short-term

01:07:51.450 --> 01:07:54.790
they don't work in the long term on the

01:07:54.790 --> 01:07:56.470
next one I am a lovable he seeks out

01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:58.630
meaningless sex online which is rarely

01:07:58.630 --> 01:08:00.790
successful in finding short getting

01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:02.380
short-term effectiveness it's helping

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:03.940
him like you know he can have sex he can

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:06.370
you know like a weird [ __ ] in [ __ ]

01:08:06.370 --> 01:08:09.460
Bennigan's parking lot but the deep kind

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:11.320
of soul ache of loneliness in terms of

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:12.910
like long-term effectiveness of

01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:16.600
addressing you know romantic loneliness

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.040
getting a [ __ ]

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.410
what twice a year it isn't really kind

01:08:20.410 --> 01:08:23.170
of cutting the cake and it's also you

01:08:23.170 --> 01:08:26.719
know distracting him from like

01:08:26.719 --> 01:08:28.040
doing what he needs to do to get some

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.180
sort of meaningful relationships you

01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:30.589
could say the long-term effectiveness of

01:08:30.589 --> 01:08:33.560
a short-term reaction to pain is also

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:36.020
not working I give that a 2 so again I'm

01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:38.029
a loser short-term effect admit or

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:39.500
weeding create I might give that a 5 of

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.390
short-term effectiveness meaningless sex

01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:42.830
online I give that a 5 I'm short term

01:08:42.830 --> 01:08:44.420
effectiveness but in long term I'd give

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.580
that about it to the idea my family

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:48.350
hates me so I'm gonna you know what I'm

01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:50.000
gonna on holidays I'm not going there

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.160
short I'm effectiveness 7 you know you

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:53.420
know that's a very painful thing for

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:54.529
people who have problems with their

01:08:54.529 --> 01:08:55.880
family you know I [ __ ] man I'm gonna

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:58.040
stay here but in a long term

01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.779
effectiveness I'm gonna give that a 4

01:08:59.779 --> 01:09:01.040
because it's like you know then you're

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.449
lonely it's like you think about well

01:09:02.449 --> 01:09:04.160
why does it bother me so much that my

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.989
family hates me oh because I want to

01:09:05.989 --> 01:09:08.120
relate to my family but by spending

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:10.460
holidays alone I'm consciously I'm

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:12.319
satisfying my short-term needs to not

01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:14.480
feel anxious or depressed or angry on my

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:17.600
family but in the long term I'm keeping

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.520
myself from ever making that right or

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:22.790
fixing that anxiety porn masturbating

01:09:22.790 --> 01:09:24.080
short term effectiveness I'm gonna give

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:25.219
that eight because you will fall right

01:09:25.219 --> 01:09:27.830
asleep long-term effectiveness not the

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:29.029
best thing in the world because again

01:09:29.029 --> 01:09:30.650
his his girlfriend broke up with them

01:09:30.650 --> 01:09:31.880
because of his porn addiction and then

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.920
it's like you know kind of weird stuff

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.630
out if you're like looking at real crazy

01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:37.430
porn and then going on dates getting it

01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:38.900
just it's not really the you know this

01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:41.569
is I'm out on a soapbox but it's kind of

01:09:41.569 --> 01:09:43.670
hard it kind of excuse your kind of

01:09:43.670 --> 01:09:46.100
search for finding a woman who or

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:48.290
whoever that like you can actually get

01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:50.630
along with rather than like like you

01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:51.949
know if you're out trying to just like

01:09:51.949 --> 01:09:54.049
I'm gonna [ __ ] hot chicks and then live

01:09:54.049 --> 01:09:55.790
with them it's like yeah good luck dude

01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:57.170
cuz you're basically just like you're

01:09:57.170 --> 01:09:58.610
gonna learn how to like get along with

01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:00.440
like your boner basically which you know

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.430
it's not fun to talk to

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:05.870
um and okay depression negativity Reid's

01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:07.219
business books you know short term

01:10:07.219 --> 01:10:09.230
effectiveness about five long term I

01:10:09.230 --> 01:10:10.699
mean is it really doing anything for his

01:10:10.699 --> 01:10:11.960
mental state no not really

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:15.230
alright let's go in here so this is this

01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:16.550
is what we're talking about that might

01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:17.870
have been a little bit convoluted but

01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:21.680
the idea here is short term high the

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:24.050
short term the reward for short term

01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:28.340
behaviors can be high but also low long

01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:29.480
term it's the problem this is a

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:31.850
dangerous trap since short-term effects

01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:34.160
are far more reinforcing than long-term

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:37.040
effects right so when we give in to

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.260
something out of like a short term you

01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:40.489
know avoiding when we avoid

01:10:40.489 --> 01:10:41.900
in the short-term again remember that

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:45.230
weird like shark whale with legs bumping

01:10:45.230 --> 01:10:47.809
into a electrified barbed and moving

01:10:47.809 --> 01:10:50.150
away this idea of avoidance goes about

01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:52.010
is building to us a half a million years

01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:53.389
so it's very powerful and it's hard to

01:10:53.389 --> 01:10:56.059
ignore but again it's like in a modern

01:10:56.059 --> 01:10:58.849
context of language and cognition using

01:10:58.849 --> 01:11:01.280
these like Cambrian avoidance strategies

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.199
doesn't serve you you know and in you

01:11:03.199 --> 01:11:05.840
know year 2020 so it's like yeah these

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:08.059
things work in the short time but like

01:11:08.059 --> 01:11:09.920
with coping strategies you know Justin

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:12.110
and the rest of us the coping strategies

01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:13.789
we've developed to combat or anger

01:11:13.789 --> 01:11:15.860
anxiety or depression or they probably

01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:17.869
do cause these feelings go away for a

01:11:17.869 --> 01:11:22.099
short while sorry I'm gonna bread did

01:11:22.099 --> 01:11:24.590
this last night at like 10 p.m. so that

01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:27.019
the idea is it's like yeah we do these

01:11:27.019 --> 01:11:28.579
short-term things because they work

01:11:28.579 --> 01:11:30.860
awesome in the short term otherwise we

01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:33.499
wouldn't do them but it's like how

01:11:33.499 --> 01:11:35.480
powerful is the long-term effect of

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:37.280
giving in to the avoidance of short-term

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:39.440
pain how much do our coping strategies

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:40.999
really change our condition in the long

01:11:40.999 --> 01:11:45.170
run right so then again this is the the

01:11:45.170 --> 01:11:46.849
answer is they don't they typically make

01:11:46.849 --> 01:11:48.650
things worse so it's like you look at

01:11:48.650 --> 01:11:49.670
the picture of the video for your

01:11:49.670 --> 01:11:50.900
two-point-four it's like we have natural

01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:52.579
pain just in being a human being and you

01:11:52.579 --> 01:11:53.900
know being in this weird network of

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:55.940
comparison and language one another but

01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:58.460
when we avoid that orb of natural pain

01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:01.190
we just we radiate more pain out of it

01:12:01.190 --> 01:12:02.539
so it's like human beings have a core of

01:12:02.539 --> 01:12:04.309
pain because life inherently contains

01:12:04.309 --> 01:12:06.679
difficulties such as disease once or

01:12:06.679 --> 01:12:09.260
loss but language keeps amplifying these

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:11.030
difficulties into larger patterns of

01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:14.210
human suffering like the figure shows we

01:12:14.210 --> 01:12:15.949
build out that core of pain through

01:12:15.949 --> 01:12:18.199
cognitive entanglement and avoidant

01:12:18.199 --> 01:12:20.360
behaviors so we make things worse yeah

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:22.400
we had a fucked-up childhood I [ __ ]

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.499
Chad senior as a [ __ ] my dad's a

01:12:24.499 --> 01:12:26.510
[ __ ] pill head [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:27.920
born-again Christian I see right through

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.679
that [ __ ] it pisses me off but by not

01:12:30.679 --> 01:12:32.300
going to family dinners I just make

01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:34.460
myself feel more lonely and unloved and

01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:36.499
blah blah blah so again that's it's a

01:12:36.499 --> 01:12:37.639
short-term Bowl because I don't have to

01:12:37.639 --> 01:12:39.110
deal with a weird family dinner but in

01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:41.360
the long-term I'm separating myself from

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.489
the only support network I can hope to

01:12:43.489 --> 01:12:45.380
have you know at least for now this is

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:47.630
my other relationships pretty bad when

01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:48.949
we try to run away from a painful

01:12:48.949 --> 01:12:50.659
thought or feeling or bodily sensation

01:12:50.659 --> 01:12:53.119
it becomes more important to us so if we

01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:54.320
honor it by trying to run

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:57.410
from it it becomes validated to us and

01:12:57.410 --> 01:12:59.900
then it tends to occur more intensely or

01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:02.360
frequently because running away also

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:04.070
means we are taking our fearful or

01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:06.230
uncomfortable thoughts literally making

01:13:06.230 --> 01:13:08.240
them even more believable and entangling

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:10.580
as a result the pain of presence grows

01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:13.250
so our anxiety gets worse the more we

01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:14.600
kind of feed into it or our depression

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.070
or whatever it gets worse the more we

01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:19.040
feed into it and meanwhile just you know

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.150
the things we're doing in the short-term

01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:22.670
to relieve it temporarily end up making

01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:24.380
that immediate pain of presence worse

01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:25.580
the immediate feelings of anxiety

01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:27.950
meanwhile our actual life we'd like to

01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:30.140
live is put on hold while we struggle

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:31.760
with these language-based internal

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:34.400
battles as a result the pain of absence

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:37.310
meaning the things that we don't do out

01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:39.920
of result of trying to fulfill this need

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.440
for short-term comfort grows as well

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:44.390
that that black dot of natural pain

01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:46.730
grows bigger and bigger and bigger so

01:13:46.730 --> 01:13:48.590
that the pain of avoidance makes our

01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:50.750
natural pain grow larger over time

01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:53.030
because we're diverting all of our

01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:54.050
attention this is why I said in the

01:13:54.050 --> 01:13:56.180
beginning it's like learning how to pull

01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:57.770
our attention out of these like

01:13:57.770 --> 01:13:59.960
cognitive based verbal battles with

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:02.030
ourselves into like what do I actually

01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:03.680
like and what is actually important

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.420
towards me which involves me turning

01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:07.190
usually towards those painful things I'm

01:14:07.190 --> 01:14:09.230
trying to avoid and kind of like working

01:14:09.230 --> 01:14:10.610
towards them I think this is what the

01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:13.370
whole this is just a very beginning act

01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:15.800
is the basically manual for how do you

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.420
face the things that are too painful for

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:20.330
you to face and then derive meaning and

01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:23.750
you know good things out of them alright

01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:25.850
then we're getting towards the end thank

01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:26.500
God

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:29.300
alright so this is the mind in the book

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.010
he uses the example of the mind train

01:14:31.010 --> 01:14:32.810
says you know all aboard the mine train

01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:35.510
and the idea is to get off of the mine

01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:37.370
train which sounds like a cheesy analogy

01:14:37.370 --> 01:14:38.960
but I thought it was pretty good so

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:42.020
alright so the moral of our relational

01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:44.150
frame story is this the reason our

01:14:44.150 --> 01:14:45.830
thoughts are so hard to control is

01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:47.690
because they are tightly bound to our

01:14:47.690 --> 01:14:49.970
use of language essentially creating

01:14:49.970 --> 01:14:51.830
this condition where we automatically

01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:54.590
live in our minds the author likens this

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:56.720
to riding a train the train has his own

01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:58.880
tracks and they go where they lead which

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:00.680
is fine if those tracks are where you

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:02.630
want to go but assuming that's not the

01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:04.640
case and the life you'd like to live is

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:07.040
quote-unquote off the tracks then you're

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:07.610
only

01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:08.750
option is getting off the train

01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:11.600
altogether at least sometimes getting on

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.280
the train happened innocently enough you

01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:15.500
learned language but now there's no way

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.780
to stop thinking and generating thoughts

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:20.510
but how do we get off now how can we

01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:22.010
you're telling me like we I can't get

01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:23.300
off this I can't stop using language

01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:25.940
it's like well but there's rules to

01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:27.199
those thoughts and rules to those

01:15:27.199 --> 01:15:28.580
languages the way you can get off the

01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:30.290
mind train quote unquote this is a kind

01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:32.330
of restrained analogy is by breaking the

01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:34.610
rules right so the rules to conditions

01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:36.050
created by our minds through language

01:15:36.050 --> 01:15:38.330
are simple but powerful they act on the

01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:40.969
basis of belief / disbelief this tells

01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:42.710
us we can only interact with our minds

01:15:42.710 --> 01:15:44.570
by either agreeing with our thoughts or

01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:46.880
arguing against them but both of those

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.560
reactions demand that we take our

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.600
thoughts literally rather than seeing

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:51.949
your thoughts merely as an ongoing

01:15:51.949 --> 01:15:54.619
process of relating they are reacted -

01:15:54.619 --> 01:15:56.719
based on what they relate to whether

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:58.900
they are factually correct or incorrect

01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:01.730
right so we can sit here like I'm off

01:16:01.730 --> 01:16:03.380
the mind train I don't believe all this

01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:05.119
it's like no dude you're not you're

01:16:05.119 --> 01:16:06.469
still playing that games like when we

01:16:06.469 --> 01:16:08.810
take our thoughts literally we are like

01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:11.150
literally riding the mind train meaning

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:12.980
we are responding to the thoughts our

01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:15.619
mind presents us purely in terms of the

01:16:15.619 --> 01:16:17.810
quote-unquote facts they are about but

01:16:17.810 --> 01:16:20.119
agreeing and disagreeing are both within

01:16:20.119 --> 01:16:22.520
the rules so neither response gets us

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.320
off the train but if we can learn to

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:25.550
break those rules that we've

01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:27.619
automatically adopted that we might have

01:16:27.619 --> 01:16:30.110
a shot of getting off our personal mind

01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:32.480
train or you know are like what seems

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:35.179
like an uncontrollable acceleration

01:16:35.179 --> 01:16:37.460
towards just pain and misery and some

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:40.610
nonsensical death of course this is

01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:42.530
easier said than done and it takes it

01:16:42.530 --> 01:16:44.090
takes actual practice and again that's

01:16:44.090 --> 01:16:46.639
where Act comes in it's here to teach us

01:16:46.639 --> 01:16:47.989
how to break the rules we've

01:16:47.989 --> 01:16:49.969
automatically adopted and view as real

01:16:49.969 --> 01:16:52.219
quote/unquote but once we can get good

01:16:52.219 --> 01:16:53.719
at breaking out of these networks of

01:16:53.719 --> 01:16:55.790
thought perhaps we can gain a more

01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:57.650
stable perspective to operate out of

01:16:57.650 --> 01:16:59.719
rather than the ceaseless torrent of

01:16:59.719 --> 01:17:01.250
cognition that comes with our verbal

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:04.100
conditioning of comparison etc I might

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:05.570
take a while to do this but that's the

01:17:05.570 --> 01:17:07.040
direction we're headed so again this

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.840
isn't about act this is rft this is a

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:12.770
theory underlying act but personally so

01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:14.330
I'm reading all this stuff and then I

01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:16.099
also do the church of dogology every

01:17:16.099 --> 01:17:18.920
Sunday so the Church of dogology which

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:20.179
is still kind of be informed I'm not

01:17:20.179 --> 01:17:21.079
sure exactly what it

01:17:21.079 --> 01:17:22.489
I just want a space where people can go

01:17:22.489 --> 01:17:24.229
and just kind of like once every Sunday

01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:26.209
[ __ ] and typically the idea is like

01:17:26.209 --> 01:17:29.019
people [ __ ] about the the the

01:17:29.019 --> 01:17:32.209
discussion typically revolves around you

01:17:32.209 --> 01:17:33.800
know self-transformation or kind of

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.449
expanding people's consciousness in ways

01:17:35.449 --> 01:17:37.369
that work practical ways people were

01:17:37.369 --> 01:17:39.139
ways that work practically for people

01:17:39.139 --> 01:17:42.919
and so I you know before that I was I

01:17:42.919 --> 01:17:45.109
would do like my THC deep dive and right

01:17:45.109 --> 01:17:46.729
from the THC deep dive I go right into

01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:49.070
the Church of dogology which is a

01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:50.839
[ __ ] lot man honestly like I did it

01:17:50.839 --> 01:17:52.309
for two weeks then this the second week

01:17:52.309 --> 01:17:54.050
I did it I like you know I'm like

01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:55.459
rushing oh my god just quick think I'd

01:17:55.459 --> 01:17:56.959
run and do this but I'm on my I'm on my

01:17:56.959 --> 01:17:59.959
roof deck stoned as [ __ ] and you know

01:17:59.959 --> 01:18:01.729
I'm like oh my god is so cool I'm doing

01:18:01.729 --> 01:18:02.959
a deep dive about to do Church of

01:18:02.959 --> 01:18:04.699
dogology this is [ __ ] sick on the man

01:18:04.699 --> 01:18:08.149
so sick that I can do this now soon as

01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:09.229
they're thinking about that stuff and

01:18:09.229 --> 01:18:10.429
fluff in my house up I get a wave of

01:18:10.429 --> 01:18:12.469
anxiety and again I'm like stone as [ __ ]

01:18:12.469 --> 01:18:13.909
meditating so like I just get I'm

01:18:13.909 --> 01:18:15.169
getting flashes of all these weird

01:18:15.169 --> 01:18:16.669
thoughts then I just got this one

01:18:16.669 --> 01:18:18.409
thought that's like dude what the [ __ ]

01:18:18.409 --> 01:18:19.820
are you doing this is insane this is

01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:21.679
crazy you're gonna drive yourself nuts

01:18:21.679 --> 01:18:24.530
and I'm like no I'm not and so I start

01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:25.609
getting a little anxious and then you

01:18:25.609 --> 01:18:27.050
know again this is like the next level

01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:28.669
of thing I think I'm off the mind train

01:18:28.669 --> 01:18:30.439
I'm like yeah right dude that's just

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:32.449
fear I don't honour fear and it was

01:18:32.449 --> 01:18:33.829
almost like a street fighter around I'm

01:18:33.829 --> 01:18:35.269
like all right fear had that round now

01:18:35.269 --> 01:18:36.679
for the will and I would just like will

01:18:36.679 --> 01:18:39.499
myself did not feel anxiety which was

01:18:39.499 --> 01:18:40.999
like work for a second I'm like god damn

01:18:40.999 --> 01:18:42.499
I'm so [ __ ] sick dude I'm basically a

01:18:42.499 --> 01:18:44.389
Dragonball Z character and then the

01:18:44.389 --> 01:18:45.619
convenings idea would come [ __ ]

01:18:45.619 --> 01:18:47.989
rippling back this is again this is like

01:18:47.989 --> 01:18:49.219
20 minutes before I have to do the

01:18:49.219 --> 01:18:51.499
church or dogology so it's like I'm

01:18:51.499 --> 01:18:53.659
doing this thing in my head I'm stoned

01:18:53.659 --> 01:18:55.369
and I'm meditating and I'm doing this

01:18:55.369 --> 01:18:57.709
thing where it's like I'm feeling a wave

01:18:57.709 --> 01:18:59.780
of anxiety I'm like stealing myself

01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:01.159
against it and this is like the

01:19:01.159 --> 01:19:03.379
disbelief belief thing where it's like

01:19:03.379 --> 01:19:05.059
I'm still on the language train because

01:19:05.059 --> 01:19:07.579
I'm still being like I can fight this

01:19:07.579 --> 01:19:10.249
off I can overcome this if I meditate

01:19:10.249 --> 01:19:12.289
like this or if I close my eyes or if I

01:19:12.289 --> 01:19:15.050
start doing breathing stuff all that

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:16.820
stuff is still a language based thing

01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:19.070
above me trying to over I'm still in

01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:21.289
this weird binary of like anxiety no

01:19:21.289 --> 01:19:23.839
anxiety you know I'm like you know so it

01:19:23.839 --> 01:19:25.039
starts getting kind of severe I started

01:19:25.039 --> 01:19:26.599
like I I've had any I've had anxiety

01:19:26.599 --> 01:19:28.280
since I was like 23 like you know panic

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:30.439
attacks stuff so I know when it's coming

01:19:30.439 --> 01:19:32.149
I feel it on my damn I'm like I'm

01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:33.979
getting up there to like you know level

01:19:33.979 --> 01:19:35.210
10 panic attack and

01:19:35.210 --> 01:19:36.860
starts being like dude you got to go to

01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:37.969
the church or dog you're not gonna be

01:19:37.969 --> 01:19:39.230
able to [ __ ] to you Lister [ __ ]

01:19:39.230 --> 01:19:40.640
high dude your [ __ ] mind you're gonna

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:44.060
bug out now you know again that's this

01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:45.530
is the Wizard of Oz in my head being

01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:46.520
like you can't do this what are you

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:49.489
doing this is crazy you can't do this so

01:19:49.489 --> 01:19:51.110
then it's like I should and then my

01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:52.790
brains like I should go downstairs and

01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:54.830
just this was the what I had

01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:56.540
rationalized I'm like alright the mind

01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:58.370
the will versus fear battle is not

01:19:58.370 --> 01:20:00.500
working I'm gonna go downstairs and just

01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:02.360
tell Brittany be like Brittany I'm

01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:04.610
stoned I'm bugging out cuz that's the

01:20:04.610 --> 01:20:06.140
answer you need you don't tell people

01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:07.250
when you have problems can you go tell

01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:08.810
people you have you know your let

01:20:08.810 --> 01:20:11.150
someone else take care of you and I got

01:20:11.150 --> 01:20:12.290
up and sorry to do that it's a wait a

01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:13.640
second no no I can't do that that's

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.320
still you know that's still taking

01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:17.750
action because of anxiety in order to

01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:20.030
kind of get off of anxiety and this is

01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:21.200
what getting off the mind train was for

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:23.030
me I checked my watch I was like should

01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:24.530
I have ten minutes now like [ __ ] it I'm

01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:25.580
just gonna go do the trigger dogology

01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:28.790
and stop even trying to do will verse

01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:30.260
anxiety you're like well maybe if I do

01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:31.850
this that'll happen I just [ __ ]

01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:33.260
ignored it all and I was like I have to

01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:34.940
go do a thing that I want to do that's

01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:35.690
important to me

01:20:35.690 --> 01:20:37.219
I went did that thing you know it just

01:20:37.219 --> 01:20:38.660
all fell away it was like I literally

01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:40.940
could feel myself and again you know

01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:42.890
this is what the help of you know the

01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:46.190
Blessed over Santa Maria I felt myself I

01:20:46.190 --> 01:20:48.110
could kind of grasp but they're talking

01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:50.360
about of like you know if it's like well

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:52.219
you know uh say you're thinking like I'm

01:20:52.219 --> 01:20:53.810
a loser and you're like I'm not a loser

01:20:53.810 --> 01:20:55.850
I'm not a loser you're still playing

01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:57.980
that language-based game like the fact

01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:01.219
telling yourself you're not a loser it's

01:21:01.219 --> 01:21:03.830
still within the like being a losers

01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:05.690
right around the corner versus just

01:21:05.690 --> 01:21:08.360
being like whether rather than develop

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:11.200
dedicating my mental energy to like

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.670
justifying or figuring out or proving

01:21:13.670 --> 01:21:15.530
that I am or am not a loser

01:21:15.530 --> 01:21:17.570
let me figure out what's actually

01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:19.130
important to me and just dedicate all my

01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:20.360
energy towards that and when these

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:22.520
frames of comparison come up they can

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:24.080
come up and think oh man that thing you

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:25.580
have sucks and the thing that guy has is

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:27.200
awesome or bobbler things better than

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.239
that guy they'll still pop up you can't

01:21:29.239 --> 01:21:30.770
get away from that but leaving the mind

01:21:30.770 --> 01:21:32.540
train is just being able to like not

01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:34.250
take those thoughts literally like

01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:35.420
alright this is a thought my brain

01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:36.880
produced

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:39.250
and again they say it helps to by giving

01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:41.110
your brain a name you can just name your

01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:43.650
brain Bob and you're like all right Bob

01:21:43.650 --> 01:21:46.510
you know I hear that you think I'm a

01:21:46.510 --> 01:21:48.880
loser but I'm busy doing the things that

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.110
I find important to me said that's like

01:21:50.110 --> 01:21:51.490
yeah I'm not gonna get ahead of myself

01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:55.030
but hopefully this has been helpful this

01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:58.750
is a kind of poor man's deep dive into

01:21:58.750 --> 01:22:02.860
rft Chad Yunior what up bro this was the

01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:04.000
other thing too and if you think about

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.290
it to like forget about your personal

01:22:05.290 --> 01:22:08.110
relations this is why advertisers do

01:22:08.110 --> 01:22:10.060
this by the way they know this is a

01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:11.530
stimulus this is the Xperia there's an

01:22:11.530 --> 01:22:13.210
experience in seeing an ad if you're

01:22:13.210 --> 01:22:15.760
looking to have ads up and what do we do

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.260
as human beings what do we automatically

01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:18.880
do we derive extra information

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.260
of course we doesn't look at coca-cola

01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:22.960
demmick oh come on like the one atom

01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:26.080
looking at is just a guy pretty cool

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:29.290
haircut getting a kiss in the snow from

01:22:29.290 --> 01:22:31.480
like a hot chick and she's just happens

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.100
to be holding a coca-cola bottle no big

01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:34.450
deal but it's again think about

01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:36.070
automatically driving information what

01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:37.420
are you telling you see that and part of

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:38.800
your brain you know again if you're not

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:41.140
like being like [ __ ] advertisers I don't

01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:42.850
want to see this [ __ ] you know you if

01:22:42.850 --> 01:22:43.990
you're just out kicking around not

01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:45.670
really thinking about this [ __ ] you

01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:46.930
might see that and all of a sudden your

01:22:46.930 --> 01:22:48.670
brain automatically you know again

01:22:48.670 --> 01:22:51.040
relates coca-cola to like romantic love

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:53.320
and a beautiful snow flurry where you're

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.210
getting a kiss dressed like you're just

01:22:55.210 --> 01:22:56.770
like Ed Sheeran or whatever there's

01:22:56.770 --> 01:22:58.330
another picture coca-cola of there's a

01:22:58.330 --> 01:23:00.700
woman shoulder on it on a woman's face

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:03.130
on a guy's shoulder there's a picture of

01:23:03.130 --> 01:23:04.930
Nicki Minaj holding a Pepsi can and a

01:23:04.930 --> 01:23:07.530
look looks like $2,000 showing her tits

01:23:07.530 --> 01:23:10.270
there's another picture here it's a

01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:12.550
marble ad it's just more Marlboro I know

01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:15.040
her say that it's a cigarette ad with

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.840
just like a cowboy it's like you know

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:19.360
it's again what you see this and the

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:21.400
advertisers know this we derive extra

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:22.900
information from stimuli so we see a

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:24.640
Marlin or whatever then we were

01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:26.080
associate now we're relating like

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:27.790
cigarettes to like the rugged individual

01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:30.280
the cowboy the symbol of like no one

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:31.630
tells them what to do as a man's man

01:23:31.630 --> 01:23:34.090
nicki manaj you know if we drink Pepsi

01:23:34.090 --> 01:23:37.210
you know tits and [ __ ] 2,000 bucks I

01:23:37.210 --> 01:23:38.890
don't know but this is like me and we've

01:23:38.890 --> 01:23:40.300
been bombarded with this messaging that

01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:42.820
we've been constantly again even even if

01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:45.040
you don't buy into this [ __ ] it's like

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:48.599
you just see we're being bombarded by

01:23:48.599 --> 01:23:50.039
pictures of people who are typically

01:23:50.039 --> 01:23:53.099
more attractive than 99.9 of the rest of

01:23:53.099 --> 01:23:54.179
people on the planet and we're getting

01:23:54.179 --> 01:23:55.739
this in our faces constantly boom boom

01:23:55.739 --> 01:23:57.539
boom boom and it's like after a while I

01:23:57.539 --> 01:23:58.889
don't care how savvy you are with like

01:23:58.889 --> 01:24:00.719
ads and not buying into like subliminal

01:24:00.719 --> 01:24:02.459
messaging you're still gonna be

01:24:02.459 --> 01:24:03.749
comparing yourself to these people you

01:24:03.749 --> 01:24:05.879
see like that's just the [ __ ] that's

01:24:05.879 --> 01:24:07.079
just going to happen and when you

01:24:07.079 --> 01:24:08.309
compare yourself constantly what do you

01:24:08.309 --> 01:24:10.859
do you derive extra information Oh Nicki

01:24:10.859 --> 01:24:13.139
Minaj is doing this and that means I'm

01:24:13.139 --> 01:24:14.699
not doing that if she's a star that

01:24:14.699 --> 01:24:16.979
means I'm mediocre you know that's where

01:24:16.979 --> 01:24:17.729
these things come from

01:24:17.729 --> 01:24:22.399
either way yeah so I think that's it

01:24:22.399 --> 01:24:24.599
yeah I think that's a that's a

01:24:24.599 --> 01:24:26.550
satisfying thing sorry if the water was

01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:29.099
running my wife had the nerve to take a

01:24:29.099 --> 01:24:31.260
shower while I'm presenting my rft thing

01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:34.439
in my basement and all right I'm done

01:24:34.439 --> 01:24:37.229
goddamn it that took two weeks and I

01:24:37.229 --> 01:24:40.409
hope that makes sense if it doesn't [ __ ]

01:24:40.409 --> 01:24:42.090
this it would suck so bad but I think it

01:24:42.090 --> 01:24:46.519
does so alright goodbye
