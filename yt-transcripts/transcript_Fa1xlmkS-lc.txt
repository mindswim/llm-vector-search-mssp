while you still can

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.240
you know we do

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.759
everything on our phones nowadays some

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:00.240
of you uh watch kill tony some of you

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.560

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.280
things you get groceries now you can

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.280
order a car you send pics to your

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.919
friends the scary part is that your

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.800
phone carrier collects data on whatever

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.440
it is you're doing verizon is even

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.680
admitted to it they say it so that they

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.560
can better understand your interests but

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.800
really all they want is to sell your

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.440
activity to advertisers stuff like the

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.199
sites you've visited and what you've

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:29.919
been up to online the more they can get

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.639
on you the larger their paycheck becomes

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:37.560
which is why we use expressvpn

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:40.000
expressvpn is an app that prevents your

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.319
phone carrier from being able to see the

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.240
sites you visit and then they turn

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.720
around and sell it to the third parties

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.039
all it takes is one tap of a button and

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:51.280
all of your network data gets encrypted

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.560
and rerouted through expressvpn secure

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.440
servers and that's for ultimate privacy

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.199
not only does it shield your web

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:01.440
browsing expressvpn protects all your

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.840
network data so you can stay private

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.759
even when you're using your favorite

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.319
apps whether you're on an iphone android

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:10.960
or even a tablet expressvpn works on all

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.199
your devices the best part is one

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:16.080
subscription can be used to up to five

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.560
devices at the same time uh me and my

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.440
girlfriend have expressvpn and my mom

she fell asleep hey come on

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.919
when your phone carrier tracks you

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:33.759
that's a gross invasion of privacy you

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:35.280
can either keep letting them cash in on

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.280

to your business

00:12:44.079 --> 00:12:45.600

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.880
and they make you bring in a piece of

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.200

it gets you yeah

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.960

so you got t-boned by a cop where is

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.480
like lights and sirens not until the

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.960
point of impact what not until the point

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.679
of impact like the lights and sirens cut

00:25:53.679 --> 00:25:56.000
on as he hit me really yeah he was

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.400
blowing through a red doing like 55 down

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.559
king street that's like a 25 and they

00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:02.000
have it on me they're over there they

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.080

normally when cops are just driving

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.080
around they're just repeating the n word

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.919
over and over again they don't want that

00:26:23.919 --> 00:26:25.679
they don't want that out on videos yeah

00:26:25.679 --> 00:26:28.000
they started the video with gur yeah

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.679

early to bed early to rise

01:21:52.719 --> 01:21:55.760
makes you healthy wealthy and wise

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:58.080
and then what you get to [ __ ] the slaves

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.480
or whatever

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:06.639

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:35.360
but

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:38.239
you you might want to run this by wiser

01:22:38.239 --> 01:22:41.360
people before you present it publicly

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:44.719
it's not a bad premise it's just flawed

01:22:44.719 --> 01:22:47.679
your execution is cumbersome

01:22:47.679 --> 01:22:49.520
but there's a lot going on there are you

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:51.199

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:05.840
place in the world it's one of the perks

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:08.239
of having slaves i assume yeah but you

01:23:08.239 --> 01:23:10.159
