like it's

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.000
worst case scenario he was ordering up

young sniss

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.599

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.040
a 200 sink and then when you called her

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.879
on it and she realized how stupid it was

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.000
instead of being like oh yeah

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.280

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.759
you know but it was just like

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.680
jesus christ man just looking a lot of

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.360
people just do the things they know

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.720
they're like they'll make a big kitchen

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.320
but everything in it's cheap as [ __ ]

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.639
yeah and like the drawers bang against

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.080
the other drawers and nothing works and

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.280
i was just like trying to explain that

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.880
[ __ ] to you kitchens are expensive too

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.039
super expensive i used to sell i used to

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.800
sell cabinets did you trick old people

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.400
into the cabinets yeah well i tried and

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.080
i couldn't trick it i couldn't trick

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.520
anybody because this is what would

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.360
happen you would i would design it it

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.080
was in-home in-home sales and you would

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.080
design these [ __ ] things

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.520
like a new kitchen

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.440
and then when i would click on the

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.680
laptop like what the final price is

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.120
every single time when the price came up

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.639
i'd be like oh

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.880
i think this has to be a mistake

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.680
yeah it'd be like 47 000 in somebody's

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.360
shitty house

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.639
and i'd be like all right well this is a

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.280
mistake yeah

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.800
and then i couldn't lower the price and

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.080
i'm like well no it wasn't it wasn't a

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.720
mistake it's 47 thousand dollars

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.320
for you and they're like all right it's

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.919
funny that like if i'm being sold on

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:51.120
something and they pulled the price the

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.199
person goes whoa whoa yeah yeah super

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.280
high and i'm just like i'm out yeah i

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.720
did that every single time like this is

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.320
too high you shouldn't buy this yeah i

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.240

caravan set up on 76 dude just do i have

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.319
to say dude

yeah now he's selling kids it's funny

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.199
because that interrupts my other point

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:24.960
i'm like every time if he's listening to

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.759
this i always wonder what your

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:27.199
brother-in-law thinks when you're like

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:30.800
my arabian lover

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.280
he's a dork though so it's funny i love

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.039
him but he's a [ __ ] he's an arab he's

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:41.280
an arab arabs are [ __ ] dorks

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.400
do you think so yes across the board

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.080
yeah every arab is a [ __ ] i think

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.560
they're up on the uh pyramid of coolness

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.039
they're up from asians a little bit

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:53.840
no way you think arabs or asians are

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.599
cooler than arabs you're thinking

00:07:55.599 --> 00:07:58.160
like dubai arabs that's a very small

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.120
percentage

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.440
i mean we're talking egyptian how deep

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.879
are you trying to go

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:04.639
the majority of arabs egyptians pretty

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:06.479
egypt's pretty chill egypt's not chill

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:08.240
at all really yeah

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.759
[ __ ] they're [ __ ] beheading people

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:11.759
blowing up mosques and [ __ ] yeah that's

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:12.800
not good

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.080
but uh

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.919
i i still think they're cooler than

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:17.759
asian people asians asians are making a

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:20.400
run lately well arabs and asians are

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.680
basically in the same i think they're in

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.440
the same level of the coolness pyramid

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.360
i'd give arabs a little bit up they both

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.639
wear those

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:27.840
tapered

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.319
pants you know what i'm talking about

00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:32.320
a lot of silky they're both doing cool

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.440
hair cool haircuts now

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.039
all right anyway

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:39.919
here's an idea my arab uh my arabian

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.360
brother-in-law thought that dave

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.680
matthews band because when he moved to

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.760
america it was like

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.600
he still he still struggled figuring

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.000
things out and in school somebody was

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.680
like we're going to see dave matthews

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.200
band tonight

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.959
and he thought dave matthews was a

00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:57.360
student

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.360
in his school

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.880
so he went around looking for dave

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.480
matthews to ask if he could go to

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.760
wisconsin

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.360
wait did he ever go to the like i want

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.480
to know if he went to the dave matthews

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.000
[Laughter]

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.040
my favorite story and i've told it

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.399
before

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:18.000
my brother-in-law

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.640
uh showed up on the first day of school

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.480
his parents just dropped them off at the

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.800
bus stop and they didn't know they

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.880
didn't know the color the colors that

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.000
people were allowed to wear so he was

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
wearing a big purple

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
fluffy jacket

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.279
they didn't know that that was a girl's

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:35.600
color so he's a little arab kid that

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.120
can't speak english

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.560
he can't speak english he can't speak a

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.480
[ __ ] word in english in a purple

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.080
jacket and then he got on the wrong bus

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.920
and went to the wrong school

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.000
and no one knew who he was so he's just

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.760
walking around and they're like are you

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.880

00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:00.800

good to know but a lot of people i was

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.040
like why don't why don't we recognize

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.760
that why is that a genocide that america

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.360
won't and it was something to do with

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.040
like russia and iran

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.040
it would like be insulting to them but

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.800
that was that's another muslim genocide

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.120
keep that in mind what the armenian

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.200
empire yeah that was ottoman that was

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.320
some turkish some boys dude killed 1.5

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.519
million

00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:46.800
people that's pretty what do you think

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.399
of that stephen what do you think about

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:49.440
those numbers

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.600
those are high numbers to be of death do

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.440
you think it counts as full genocide i

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.880
think so but i think that the the

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.519
political considerations are what keep

00:11:57.519 --> 00:12:00.240
them from actually calling it that oh

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.600
they call the armenian it's good to have

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.200
steve here

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.040
well i don't know i know i mean shane

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.480
knows more than i know no i don't know

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.000
ottoman empire world war one pre you

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.839
know just spitballing steve what would

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:16.000
you say your favorite genocide is

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.839
favorite genocide like which one are you

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:20.000
most drawn to the one of your people

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.120
well

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.959
i mean your people got [ __ ] like if

00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:25.760
you pick one yeah yeah well ideally i'd

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.200
want to do a book report on which one

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.560
would you pick well my favorite would be

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.079
the one where the fewest amount of

00:12:30.079 --> 00:12:31.680
people got killed i just don't know what

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.639
a [ __ ] [ __ ] answer but she like them

00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:38.040
quick and easy

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:40.880
yeah i don't have a good answer to that

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.320
i think that's a bad ass event yeah

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.440
that's a good question what's your

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.720
favorite genocide

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.320
i'm thinking i think

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.639
i think an underrated one is australia

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:50.959
getting rid of the aborigines

00:12:50.959 --> 00:12:52.639
that's an underrated one really yeah

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:54.079
imagine those boys you talked about a

00:12:54.079 --> 00:12:55.519
lot or you mean yeah we don't we don't

00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:57.279
talk about it what do they do they just

00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:59.440
went down there and wiped out the native

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.519
native australians yeah

00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:03.120
then it was a bunch of [ __ ] bad boys

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.040
in australia yeah you know what i mean

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.200
that's criminals and [ __ ] english

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.880
like [ __ ] they're just guys wandering

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.639
around being like [ __ ] off yeah yeah

00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:13.120
yeah yeah so that was

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.240
that's pretty great that's probably

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.839
pretty that's probably pretty brutal

00:13:15.839 --> 00:13:17.200
like yeah

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.440
people moving next to you and then like

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.880
they come [ __ ] kill you and you're

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.959
like yeah what the [ __ ]

00:13:22.959 --> 00:13:24.800
because a lot of the american ones they

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.320
put up a pretty good fight so the

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.639
genocide was more of just us dominating

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:30.959
a war yeah

00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:32.560
oh you're saying these guys it's like

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.440
dude america america won the indian wars

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.440
plumper indians down there don't they no

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.800
they got blacker indians i thought they

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.639
were plump i thought they were like oh

00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:41.760
those ones

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.760
no they were just like inuit almost no

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.360
aborigines are like

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.040
those hot inuits down there they don't

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.480
have hot inuits

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.079
the samoans are plump though yeah those

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:51.760
are big boys i just

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.959
[ __ ] me up one time that'd be a

00:13:52.959 --> 00:13:55.040
negative fight

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.160
you're trying to go to war with a bunch

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.079
of samoans all you got is like a musket

00:13:58.079 --> 00:13:59.839
yeah it's tough yeah the next thing you

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.440
know the rocks coming out i always

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.720
picture what they call when they say

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.240
aboriginals i always picture like the

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.160
shorter stouter no they're like lanky

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.240
black people really yeah i didn't know

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.079
that you know what scene well i think

00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:11.120
it's just like

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.199
yeah no i didn't know it

00:14:13.199 --> 00:14:14.880
it's good to know what that you know i

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.639
always picture like an eskimo

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:20.240
no because isn't that term for any

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.079
group of people indigenous to a

00:14:22.079 --> 00:14:24.720
particular place i'm not sure aboriginal

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.680
just means like before white dudes okay

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.600
you

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.079
it's know

00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:31.760
great it's pretty funny when you think

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:32.880
about it

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.399
all right all right enough of this uh

00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:35.920
you know white people apparently evolved

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.839
like 8 000 years ago what are you

00:14:37.839 --> 00:14:40.000
talking about that like whiteness in the

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.680
cave you're talking about

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.120
just like

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.519
white skin ate that it's only 8 000

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:47.120
years old something like that we got to

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.160
google but it's incredibly recent really

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.000
it was one of those things

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.399
well i'm assuming it was something about

00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:56.800
living in a cooler climate or not you

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.560
know like yeah less sun so you need more

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.480
like albinism to

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.639
gather more vitamin d

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:04.639
this is by the way google this i have

00:15:04.639 --> 00:15:05.920
literally no idea

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.079
we say we say garbage never stopping but

00:15:08.079 --> 00:15:09.680
yeah i think yeah you know in order to

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.560
capture

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.160
yesterday sort of like a solar panel do

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.440
you think that we're then just like

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.440
albino black people

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.839
well sure i mean i mean not black we're

00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:20.000
just albino people met people we're

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.680
supposed to be black

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.360
no it's an evolution it's an evolution

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.120
to where you live just like black people

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.480
evolved because they were close to the

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.279
equator so they'd need less sun

00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:31.199
yeah that's all

00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:32.720
it's when people spread it you wouldn't

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.160
if you had the melon and you wouldn't

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.600
die off either so it's like it's not

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.360
like it would be encouraged to be

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.360
lighter skin it would

00:15:43.199 --> 00:15:45.120
the further north you go you get you can

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.120
people get sick from laughing

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.040
black people get sick white people get

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.560
sick so imagine

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.320
you know you're talking about a couple

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.800
aboriginals

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.240
effective disorder and all that stuff

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.240
although inuits are pretty [ __ ] so

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.839
you think whites can take darkness

00:15:59.839 --> 00:16:01.519
better than black people you're saying

00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:03.920
obviously

00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:05.600
yes

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.320
i had to do the math

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.399
and black people can take sunlight more

00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:13.279
[ __ ] yeah yeah so true keep that in

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:14.880
mind

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.920
interesting

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.720
you know well how's new york going

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.240
how's new york going yeah yeah it's all

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.279

00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:24.399

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.320

guy going on and just being like oh like

00:17:17.439 --> 00:17:18.640

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.919
start doing podcasts and you're

00:17:19.919 --> 00:17:21.280
essentially doing podcasts with people

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.120
you don't know it all and it's like

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.400
that was always weird to me yeah if you

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.799

crocodile yeah yeah and it was the

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.640
funniest thing i've ever heard yeah

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.320

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:42.480
what's funny about that what's fun about

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.440
it yeah

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.880
yeah you're just [ __ ] around juices

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.280
dude you get it going no way

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.080
with the video itself oh no oh the

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.919
explain the circumstances all right so

00:17:51.919 --> 00:17:54.320
it was a crocodile it was in australia

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.200
and

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.280
this guy who owned like a restaurant or

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.120
something that people would come watch

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.840
him feed this crocodile that he named

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.840
casey he would throw chicken off his

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.720
deck

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.480
and the crocodile come up and eat it and

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.240
then when the crocodile was

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.039
supposedly full he would send down his

00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:13.760
little terrier dog this little

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.760
yorkie named pippa

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.440
and it would run and bite the crocodile

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.120
and chase it back into the water

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.720
and the crocodile is huge yeah there's a

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.240
little dog like biting its tail and

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.840
barking at it and it runs away so it was

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.400
like this fun trick that everybody loved

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.919
and this australian dude would do it all

00:18:27.919 --> 00:18:31.120
the time like daily for 10 years

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.520
10 years this [ __ ] pippa was biting

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.880
casey the crocodile yeah then one day

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.880
old casey

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.039
had enough but the audio it's you would

00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:42.160
think it's sad until you hear an

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.520
australian dude

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.840
it's like oh go get that peppa

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.840
no

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.000
it's so [ __ ] funny

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
and he's like oh oh [ __ ]

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.240
the dog just goes straight into the

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.120
water

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.120
and it's pretty funny just it's it's

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.440
just placid the water like pip is just

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.799
going like it's literally an issue just

00:19:02.799 --> 00:19:04.400
one little bubble probably there's one

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.919
of those guys just standing on his deck

00:19:05.919 --> 00:19:08.160
with a bunch of people behind him like

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.039

people even swallow desserts it's like

00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:06.559
just chew them up and spit them out

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:08.480
there's no benefit like actually

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.919
consuming them i mean it's kind of

00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:11.679
bulimic it's like lightly bulimic but i

00:27:11.679 --> 00:27:13.279
used to do it when i was younger

00:27:13.279 --> 00:27:14.559
when i was younger i said like eat a

00:27:14.559 --> 00:27:16.400
dessert just go and spit it out so i'm

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.080
like i don't need to swallow it really

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.600
yeah it's like why not just i'm like

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.960
it's not going to do me any benefit by

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.480
like i don't know why you have to

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.240
consume it and like make it part of

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.480
yourself just chew it up taste it go

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.240
that's why i dip

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.840
why that's what chewing tobacco is it's

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.760
just a sweet treat it's a sweet treat

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.600
this is citrus splend

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.880
that's true

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.080
that's what i don't understand why you

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.760
have to like eat a reese's cup you can

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.360
chew it up and just like let it kind of

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.000
melt and just spit it

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.520
i don't know i think i think it feels

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.039
good why are you sliding down your

00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:47.440
throat i was wondering like so it's like

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.200
do people really like it is it like do

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.960
you like swallowing candy too i mean

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.400
like

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.240
yeah that's so weird yeah what are you

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.159
talking about swallow a piece of cake

00:27:56.159 --> 00:27:57.760
just chew it up and enjoy i mean these

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.279
are these are the questions of the ages

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:00.640
that you're asking

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.960
why do we

00:28:09.919 --> 00:28:10.960
i don't know how interesting this would

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.120
be but so the anthony bourdain thing

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.919
yeah you know i i didn't really know

00:28:15.919 --> 00:28:18.159
of him too much like i knew of him by

00:28:18.159 --> 00:28:20.320
name but my brother and i were talking

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.440
about that and it's kind of one of those

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.679
things that i had my reaction to that in

00:28:23.679 --> 00:28:25.919
a very narcissistic way

00:28:25.919 --> 00:28:27.200
is like

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.080
almost a hair of relief not about that

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.960
he's not him in particular so it's not

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.320
that i don't want to i don't want to

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.600
have to be running a lot of dirt on the

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.520
clintons no no no no

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.880
i think he probably did it let me just

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.960
say i don't want anybody to kill

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.880
themselves i'm very unhappy that he

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.120
killed himself a dog that's a tragedy

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.000
but

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.320
it reaffirms this thing where it's like

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.799
no matter how much you

00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:52.320
think something's gonna make you happy

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.960
in the future it's just not you're

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.279
saying he reaffirmed your hypothesis

00:28:57.279 --> 00:28:58.559
correct

00:28:58.559 --> 00:29:00.480
that's i wish i could take it back and

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.320
say it the way you just raised it i

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.600
don't know maybe

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.600
he was what he was what sixty one or

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.799
fifty one

00:29:06.799 --> 00:29:08.960
sixty one six six yeah all right so he

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.840
lived a pretty [ __ ] wild good life

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.320
yes so i don't know maybe suicide at

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.760
that age

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.840
the happiness thing i mean i'm sure he

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.559
was upset when he killed himself but

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:23.279
he was probably also on chantx too dude

00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:24.880
i'm telling you these drugs dude chan

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.320
chantix is that [ __ ] you take to quit

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.080
smoking and apparently it like really

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.279
[ __ ] up with your

00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:30.880
it really messes with your pleasure

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.399
pleasure receptors and like it's one of

00:29:32.399 --> 00:29:34.720
those like suicidal ideation may occur

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.600
okay

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.600
but but he's also

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.520
go ahead i don't know sometimes i think

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.399
you can

00:29:40.399 --> 00:29:42.480
this is i don't know i could be way off

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.279
here

00:29:43.279 --> 00:29:44.480
but

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.080
the happiness thing he could have still

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.480
had a pretty [ __ ] great life

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.320
and just no steve's saying that just

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.919
clocked out steve saying that he had a

00:29:51.919 --> 00:29:54.000
thing being like no matter how what

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.039
level of

00:29:55.039 --> 00:29:56.799
success you attain

00:29:56.799 --> 00:29:58.399
it you know it's not every it's not the

00:29:58.399 --> 00:30:00.000
end-all be-all

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.919
right yeah yeah well if you have this

00:30:01.919 --> 00:30:04.799
underlying condition which he had yeah

00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:06.159
you know he was like addicted to drugs

00:30:06.159 --> 00:30:09.440
for a long time um it's not going away

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.320
and for me i and matt and i had talked

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.919
about this like i'm so prone to

00:30:13.919 --> 00:30:15.679
fantasizing and i've been doing that

00:30:15.679 --> 00:30:16.960
since i was like

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.760
you know 20 about my career yeah it was

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.640
always just like fantasizing about

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.120
we will i would be famous or i'll be on

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.440
this show and then everything suddenly

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.440
i'll be like the tommy pope of you know

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.240
just

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.000
like [ __ ] people

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.440
you know you know what i mean well you

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.480
know

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.000
i wasn't i wasn't talking about [ __ ]

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
people i was talking about tommy jacking

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.279
off oh okay

00:30:39.279 --> 00:30:41.200
well whatever

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.600
a success level of that kind you want to

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.480
be the tommy pope of jacking off well

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.720
let me just keep going so then

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.039
we get to that and

00:30:51.039 --> 00:30:52.640
he wanted the whole kitten caboodle dude

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.880
money [ __ ] power dude

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.039
but i'm just saying that right

00:30:57.039 --> 00:30:58.880
it's clear that those problems need to

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.679
be addressed now yeah and that

00:31:01.679 --> 00:31:03.600
that was just would never make it go

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.240
away no i got exactly what you're saying

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.600
i know what you're saying

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.679
and you were saying his death

00:31:09.679 --> 00:31:11.840
a positive you got out of that was like

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.520
yup yeah because i mean i i i can

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.200
imagine what shane's potentially saying

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.039
which is like you're just fulfilled

00:31:19.039 --> 00:31:20.559
you're still happy but you go well i

00:31:20.559 --> 00:31:22.000
have nothing else to do so i'm going to

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.600
kill myself like hemingway eating that

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.799
shotgun

00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:27.360
but i i don't i don't know enough about

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.279
that particular case but i'm sure he was

00:31:29.279 --> 00:31:30.720
pretty bummed

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.799
if he was on some sort of like uh yeah

00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:33.919
yeah

00:31:33.919 --> 00:31:34.960
yourself

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.640
that's not like a

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.440
i've seen enough let me [ __ ] brutally

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.519
i do take back any yeah i doubt there's

00:31:41.519 --> 00:31:42.960
been too many hat like you know what

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.080
it's been a good one right

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.760
he apparently like said like i'm gonna

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.519
shoot myself the day i turned whatever

00:31:49.519 --> 00:31:51.519
and went out and but i think he had he

00:31:51.519 --> 00:31:52.960
was losing his mind yeah he was

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.720
definitely having his [ __ ] skull

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.720
there was i was reading a book uh

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.080
about this

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.559
robber jack black it's a book called you

00:32:00.559 --> 00:32:02.720
can't win and i'm sure he gave it to me

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.720
there's this guy in like the 30s and

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.320
basically 20s and 40s who went around it

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.240
was like a burglar and it's like was a

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.399
house thief stole uh

00:32:10.399 --> 00:32:12.799
like [ __ ] from like like a safe cracker

00:32:12.799 --> 00:32:14.640
and all that stuff yeah and he

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.159
eventually you know it's like an

00:32:16.159 --> 00:32:18.559
autobiography but he goes legit and they

00:32:18.559 --> 00:32:20.399
talk about like in the afterward of like

00:32:20.399 --> 00:32:22.080
how he got paid to write for hollywood

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.080
after that he was like he was doing all

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.080
this stuff you know he had a pretty good

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.559
life and uh he told people like if i

00:32:28.559 --> 00:32:30.640
don't if i start feeling like shitty or

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.640
you know if i if i turn a certain age

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.480
i'm gonna tie weights to myself and jump

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.399
into a river and then one day he just

00:32:36.399 --> 00:32:38.880
disappeared no one's ever seen him since

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.320
so it's like yeah he was doing pretty

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.159
well okay so then there goes my

00:32:42.159 --> 00:32:44.320
hypothesis no no i'm just saying it's

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.760
the same thing it's like this guy you

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.360
know he did everything

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.720
you could possibly do and he at the end

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.320
of it he was like yeah just [ __ ]

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.600
killed himself

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.600
i'm not attacking your hypothesis i'm

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.720
saying i'm just i thought i was

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.399
reinforcing it but i guess it wasn't

00:32:56.399 --> 00:32:57.760
i just want to say the guy put weights

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.159
on himself and jump in a river i thought

00:33:00.159 --> 00:33:01.600
that's a good way to go that's the whole

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.360
point of that this is that's actually

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.440
probably a horrific way to go

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.480
yeah

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.200
but so i uh i had a

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.440
i was talking to matt also too then

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.120
trying to address this anxiety issue

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.080
because i got

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.480
very bad anxiety and it tends to be in

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.399
like very specific areas

00:33:18.399 --> 00:33:19.519
so

00:33:19.519 --> 00:33:22.799
like a large indoor open places

00:33:22.799 --> 00:33:25.600
is just like mayhem for me like target

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.760
walmart yeah the mall 30 30th street

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.679
yeah the mall [ __ ] kills me i'll give

00:33:29.679 --> 00:33:31.679
you that yeah yeah there's something

00:33:31.679 --> 00:33:33.440
about not getting be able to get

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.120
purchased on the sound around you where

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.720
it's all kind of ambient but it's all

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.440
there and everything feels very far away

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.880
um well you know what i bug out about

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.640
about how many strangers we have to deal

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.240

so that's weird yeah it's something i

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.159
bug out about i'm like jesus christ i

00:34:00.159 --> 00:34:02.000
don't know any of these [ __ ] i

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.840
gotta move to a small town i would love

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.159
to yeah eventually but yeah

00:34:06.159 --> 00:34:07.519
stranger danger dude you got to watch

00:34:07.519 --> 00:34:08.800
out for that yeah you can move to a

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.399
small town and kill yourself that's not

00:34:10.399 --> 00:34:12.320
a valid just sink into it like well i

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.560
know everyone here

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.239
they're all going to miss me yeah

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:18.320
[Laughter]

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.919
i don't know i do i used to get anxiety

00:34:19.919 --> 00:34:22.159
a lot man it's [ __ ] it sucks and so i

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:25.280
get this book called dare which uh it's

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.040
silly but it's a lot of what you talked

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.480
about in so far as the general idea is

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.800
you want to go towards the anxiety as

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.119
opposed to trying to control it yeah and

00:34:35.119 --> 00:34:37.280
so that was something

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.839
what oh finn's fin man yeah he does i'm

00:34:39.839 --> 00:34:42.480
sorry my dog is on my bed in the in the

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.320
studio

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.800
he whenever he lays down he like

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.800
tries to like pull blankets underneath

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.839
them

00:34:49.839 --> 00:34:50.800
and uh

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.919
it's pretty great to watch yeah i like

00:34:51.919 --> 00:34:53.520
watching dogs get comfortable yeah

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.119
anyway but anyways just that little

00:34:55.119 --> 00:34:57.040
switch uh was was pretty

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.040
uh big because every time i start to

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.960
feel the feelings come on dizzy or i

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.960
can't breathe or you know derealization

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.119
things don't feel i'm just desperately

00:35:05.119 --> 00:35:07.119
trying to get control of it like

00:35:07.119 --> 00:35:08.079
thinking about my breathing thinking

00:35:08.079 --> 00:35:10.640
about this and the idea with this book

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.480
was no you want to run at those

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.760
sensations so yeah cheesy as it sounds

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.119
like if you're feeling your chest

00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:18.240
tightness you're like all right well

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.160
make my chest tighter like i want to

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:23.599
pass out yeah let's just do it yeah and

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:25.040
that's kind of what you talked about

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.640
although it doesn't recommend like the

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:30.880
taking cbd to the frequency i'll

00:35:31.119 --> 00:35:32.720
and then i'd be like

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.560
you know right in that spot of like

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.280
everything's wrong oh my god

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.040
just weather it out dude weather out the

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.480
stormy daniels

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.480
and so and at the end of the day what he

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.480
says is like it's not about you it'll

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.560
never go away you know it's just about

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.320
how you interact with those sensations

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.000
when they do arise yeah and that they're

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.359
very normal

00:35:51.359 --> 00:35:53.599
yeah it's it is funny to think about

00:35:53.599 --> 00:35:55.040
when you have a panic attack it's just

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.960
you're like in a party and it's just you

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.320
there's a dude who's so in his head that

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.079
he's like i gotta get the [ __ ] out of

00:36:00.079 --> 00:36:02.400
here this is this pure thing of like

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.520
whatever you're talking about to

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.720
yourself you're like i need to go

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.800
outside dude this is too [ __ ] up yeah

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.160
it's funny how you have like a slight

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.000
like a just like a windows arrow you're

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.320
just like oh god i gotta get the [ __ ]

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.160
out of here yeah because i walk to the

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.079
act now i couldn't go in the acme and it

00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:16.960
was like sitting there like kind of

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.200
pacing like scratching my head yeah and

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.040
people walking by probably you know

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.280
nobody knows it's like i'm having such

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.320
trouble going to pick up eye drops

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.640
you're like just a storm

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.119
dude i used to do when i used to have a

00:36:31.119 --> 00:36:33.040
uh i was convinced i was having a heart

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.000
attack i'm gonna have a heart attack

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.119
because my heart had like a weird

00:36:35.119 --> 00:36:36.720
arrhythmia yeah definitely have a heart

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:37.839
attack and like i would go to the

00:36:37.839 --> 00:36:40.160
treadmill and i had to like it's i'd

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.920
watch the heart rate monitor and it

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.440
would just like if it hit like triple

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.200
digits i'd be like

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.880
oh god and i'll just get off the track

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.480
like a minute the treadmill would get

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.760
off and then like go do another thing

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.440
and be like oh i gotta take a break i

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.960
would i must look like a psycho at the

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.800
gym for like six months yeah i got out

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.079
of it you know i did a little more every

00:36:56.079 --> 00:36:58.079
day this is back when you had a ponytail

00:36:58.079 --> 00:36:59.920
yeah dude that must have looked like a

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.839
real that was me coming out of it that

00:37:01.839 --> 00:37:03.520
was me conquering my health anxiety the

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.040
whole time i grew my hair was pretty

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.359
much like two years and uh this is a

00:37:07.359 --> 00:37:09.040
girl grow it back yeah

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.119
yeah jiu jitsu dudes now it's the same

00:37:11.119 --> 00:37:12.320
thing with a heart attack you're like

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.599
i'm gonna have a heart attack and i'm

00:37:13.599 --> 00:37:15.440
just like dude bring on the big one dude

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.040
hook me up to the machines

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.560
let's do it and dude

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.480
stop have you gotten deeper like that

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.240
derealization feeling deep

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.079
depersonalization yeah yeah have you

00:37:24.079 --> 00:37:25.839
gotten that chain what's that it's just

00:37:25.839 --> 00:37:27.839
like reality starts to feel more like a

00:37:27.839 --> 00:37:29.359
dream like you can't tell is this real

00:37:29.359 --> 00:37:31.119
as it's not yeah it just starts to feel

00:37:31.119 --> 00:37:32.480
very weird

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.079
like you get so anxious that every it's

00:37:34.079 --> 00:37:37.040
almost like you're like

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.640
almost like cinematic in a way where

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.520
you're like walking if you're walking

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:40.400
through a bunch of people it almost

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.839
feels like you're in a music video

00:37:41.839 --> 00:37:43.680
almost like yeah it's weird and he he

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.760
described it in the in the book he was

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.520
saying that now i don't know whether

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.359
this is true or not but

00:37:49.359 --> 00:37:52.079
his theory is that your brain is being

00:37:52.079 --> 00:37:54.079
is so focused on let's say your

00:37:54.079 --> 00:37:57.119
heartbeat or your breathing that all

00:37:57.119 --> 00:37:58.720
that other information is still coming

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.240
in but it's just being processed

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.920
different because you're so focused on

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.960
the other thing

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:05.920
so then it just seems very weird

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.240
yeah that makes sense and i but the

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.720
larger point is that everybody feels it

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.000
so it's like yeah because when you're

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.359
experiencing that for the first time

00:38:13.359 --> 00:38:15.359
you're like i'm seeing through something

00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:18.000
here yes my vision will get fuzzy i

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.599
would be in a place my vision gets fuzzy

00:38:19.599 --> 00:38:21.920
i'm kind of tingly and i'm just like

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.920
oh boy something bad's happening you

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.720
know then you just [ __ ] [ __ ] out

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.640
yeah that's you get that

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.480
i mean i i don't know about fuzzy i get

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.800
like a loss of focus

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.320
does that make sense with your eyes like

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.160
it seems like it's out of

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.720
yeah i don't know you bug out too hard

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.240
yeah i've had that i've had that since i

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.440
was like a kid

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.160
but bugging out yeah like

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.000
i don't know when you stare at something

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.760
for a long time

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.920
no uh it's tough to describe yeah i

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.280
don't know how it is you try to

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.119
articulate your subconscious

00:38:53.119 --> 00:38:55.280
yeah thank you

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.720
but uh

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.320
yeah anxiety i mean

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:01.040
i i have no i have no plan of attack i'm

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.480
just you just

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:05.119
like [ __ ] riding the wave well

00:39:05.119 --> 00:39:07.040
do you get like hard i would get like

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.960
hard out of the blue life anxiety out of

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.160
nowhere do you think you're just getting

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:10.880
yeah

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.560
i get that real bad just a bit like a

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.680
look down the well where you're just

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.400
like

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.240
yeah what does it feel like what do you

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.560
it just feels like if if i have it's all

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.200
about stand up okay that's all it is

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.119
like if i if i don't have

00:39:23.119 --> 00:39:24.640
shows or if i don't have anything good

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.920
for a while

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.200
i i'm all [ __ ] yeah i'm like my life

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.359
is a [ __ ] failure

00:39:31.359 --> 00:39:33.200
yeah which is a frustrating point to be

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.800
in because it is something you would

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.880
need to worry about yeah but then it's

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.560
it's it's almost bipolar because then

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.880
i'll do something like i did last week

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.440
and i'm like holy [ __ ] dude

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.040
everything's going well this is

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:46.720
unbelievable yeah you do the bonfire

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:48.000
yeah and then

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.520
you know a week of not really doing

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.520
anything like last night i was doing

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.599
philly's funniest competition i'm just

00:39:53.599 --> 00:39:54.960
in the green room talking to a [ __ ]

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:57.520
weirdo after weirdo like

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.320
oh my god like i was tired during stand

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.040
up

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.040
and that's a weird that's a weird thing

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.280
i'm excited and happy to be there like i

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.079
think it's a good gauge though of your

00:40:08.079 --> 00:40:09.680
i would say uptick since now you're in

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.119
helium and you're like jesus christ give

00:40:11.119 --> 00:40:12.560
me the [ __ ] you know what i mean like

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.160
this is [ __ ] but it's also here like

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.520
remember how stoked that you were like a

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.200
year before being like oh most of the

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.720

like jesus christ this [ __ ] thing so

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.839
that's that's a good sign almost yeah

00:40:21.839 --> 00:40:22.960
and it's exhausting to have

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.160
conversations with people that you're

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.240
not interested in

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.920
that was the only time i used to always

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.599

staring in a mirror and reciting their

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.599
sight to themselves they're set to

00:42:33.599 --> 00:42:35.520
themselves always bombed that was my

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.040
rule that's my

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.800
as strong as my

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.240
taking a [ __ ] in a home depot bathroom

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.680
every time you own a home negro bathroom

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.839
someone's taking a [ __ ] yeah every time

00:42:43.839 --> 00:42:45.119
i'm like

00:42:45.119 --> 00:42:47.200
100 for a hundred on that one

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.800
i'm like six or six i'm like any guy

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.400
who'd be like in the mirror like

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.920
practicing i'd be like oh dude you're

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.640
about to go out there and [ __ ] eat it

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.560
yeah it's it's oh it's a guarantee

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.160
anytime you're taking stand up that

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.440
seriously

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.760
yeah and reciting it it's like it's

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.079
gonna suck yeah it's gonna be pretty bad

00:43:04.079 --> 00:43:06.160
because what happens is when they recite

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:06.960
it

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.640
verbatim like that

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.960
that you include when you write it like

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.680
talking as if you're not reciting

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.000
something yeah so there's words in there

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.760
that are like

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.040
so anyway

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.960
like i was at the grocery store what's

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:22.720
with the grocery store

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:24.560
yeah and it doesn't come out natural at

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.079
all so it's everybody in the room's like

00:43:26.079 --> 00:43:27.440
this is weird

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.599
you know yeah for sure it's a mom

00:43:29.599 --> 00:43:32.560
spaghetti sort of eminem thing yeah but

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.119
it just doesn't translate into it but um

00:43:35.119 --> 00:43:37.839
so stephen you have a talk coming up you

00:43:37.839 --> 00:43:39.280
don't want to talk about that dude well

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.960
no i mean i i

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.880
i talked about it last time you know um

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:46.720
yeah but no one remembers no

00:43:48.079 --> 00:43:50.000
it was yes so there's a talk coming up

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.640
there's a date to still be to be uh

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.800
determined yeah but

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.119
it's uh talk about

00:43:57.119 --> 00:43:59.920
how we make progress as humans and the

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.040
reach of human progress which i'll argue

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.560
is unbounded

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:07.520
and uh oh so we're going to space sure

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.359
if we choose to it doesn't guarantee

00:44:09.359 --> 00:44:11.040
that we will but we can

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.000
nice

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.119
we are looking for i'm looking forward

00:44:13.119 --> 00:44:14.640
to that yeah yeah

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.319
i thought if you wanted to we could i

00:44:16.319 --> 00:44:18.480
could maybe argue out like a potential

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.160
middle ground on the jordan peterson

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:23.160
thing

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:25.359
well hold on hold on before we do that

00:44:25.359 --> 00:44:27.920
let's take a second let's take a break

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.119

go ahead so about your butthole

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.760
hemorrhoids is a very serious condition

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.520
that's right and as i was i was saying

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:48.800
that i think that this is something that

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.960
children should be taught

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.040
about hemorrhoids yes if you're gonna do

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.520
sex education you just have like 15

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.760
minutes where you go don't strain when

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.480
you poop when you lift things suck you

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.240
know your [ __ ] in so is that what

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:04.000
hemorrhoids are from pushing too hard

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.079
yeah or like you know if you squat and

00:48:06.079 --> 00:48:08.560
you're you're not tight down there if

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:11.760
you lose ass yeah it's for real yeah you

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.040
get them

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:15.359
you got loose ass the one at all

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:17.280
you got tight butt yeah steve what are

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.880
you doing your ass that your butt's so

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.359
loose well old guys get hemorrhoids too

00:48:21.359 --> 00:48:23.119
oh yeah geezers get it don't you get

00:48:23.119 --> 00:48:25.680
heavies yeah i got hemmies well so what

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.880
are you are you pushing too hard bruh

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:30.800
yeah i do i push farts all day

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.960
yeah you can really

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.559
yeah it's from pushing it push hair in

00:48:34.559 --> 00:48:37.359
your ass tissue no no it's like a isn't

00:48:37.359 --> 00:48:38.319
it like a

00:48:38.319 --> 00:48:40.559
vein yes it's like a vein that's popping

00:48:40.559 --> 00:48:42.800
out from when you push too hard yeah and

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:45.200
it can bleed too right sure

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.720
yeah and so like even if you're doing

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.920
sit-ups and you're just straining

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:51.599
then that'll get it so that's how i get

00:48:51.599 --> 00:48:52.800
it from like doing any sort of like

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.720
physical activity because i don't

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.960
remember to like clench as if i'm

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.640
sucking in a poop well

00:48:58.640 --> 00:48:59.920
honestly though

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:03.119
i nobody who's i've lifted for a long

00:49:03.119 --> 00:49:04.960
time and never

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.280
made an effort to clinch my [ __ ]

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.040
you might be doing it naturally though

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:09.839
true

00:49:09.839 --> 00:49:11.760
yeah because it's such like a [ __ ]

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.760
masculine activity

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:16.640
you might have just you might

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.599
no but i get it from ripping hard farts

00:49:19.599 --> 00:49:21.119
for sure get them just for like having a

00:49:21.119 --> 00:49:22.720
dirty ass and then dumping too hard no

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.319
it's not from dirty ass

00:49:24.319 --> 00:49:25.760
so just from pushing right it has

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.520
nothing to do with cleanliness

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:30.240
wow and i'm fat so that's another

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.280
contribution why do you get it i don't

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:33.359
know fat people get hemorrhoids

00:49:33.359 --> 00:49:36.160
it's more like weight on it on your

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:37.920
i don't know all my weight is centered

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.119
on my [ __ ]

00:49:39.119 --> 00:49:40.800
what's your that thing

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.559
once your belly fat covers your dick you

00:49:42.559 --> 00:49:44.960
get you get hemorrhoids immediately

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.800
i mean that definitely the correlation

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.800
there i mean that's not the cause but i

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:50.720
guarantee anybody whose belly hangs over

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.720
their dick definitely the last petal and

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.400
beauty of the beast once you get full

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:56.640
[ __ ] like don't get a full eclipse of

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:57.599
the gut

00:49:57.599 --> 00:49:59.599
my my dad when i told him i had

00:49:59.599 --> 00:50:03.280
hemorrhoids once he was so happy why

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.520
because he knew how much that hurt me

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:08.240
he was laughing so hard

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:10.079
it was just like because i had it i've

00:50:10.079 --> 00:50:12.240
only had it like bad once yeah we're

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.119
like

00:50:13.119 --> 00:50:16.720
it hurt to [ __ ] like so bad oh do you

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.400
ever have them that yes yes yeah dude

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.319
where it like you feel sick it hurts

00:50:20.319 --> 00:50:21.760
that bad

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.599
okay i definitely don't have yes

00:50:23.599 --> 00:50:25.760
yeah i mean i only had it like that once

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:26.640
still

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.559
but what were you eating like i have no

00:50:28.559 --> 00:50:30.480
idea

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:32.559
i have no idea but

00:50:32.559 --> 00:50:36.079
it's like an ass migraine hemorrhoids is

00:50:36.079 --> 00:50:37.680
that's something you're exactly right

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.359
steve the public it's it's such a

00:50:39.359 --> 00:50:41.920
shameful problem to have

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:43.440
so they should teach that yeah because

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:46.000
you do you feel gross

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.920
yeah does it feel anything like having

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.280
it so it's nothing it doesn't feel like

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:50.960
dirty ass it just feels it's not dirty

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.040
yes gaping sore well it can smell like

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.359
that like small ones can feel like a

00:50:55.359 --> 00:50:56.720
real itch

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.960

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:00.480
yeah you get an itchy butthole man i

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.400
thought here i was thinking my butthole

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.079

or is that just bloody ass that's

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:10.720

front to back i'm back to front that's

00:51:17.839 --> 00:51:19.760

that's totally what i it's just not it's

00:51:58.559 --> 00:52:00.640

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.839
just gotta get the there's a little

00:54:37.839 --> 00:54:39.440
damage control right

00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:41.440

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:43.359
hershey kisses kissing around

00:54:43.359 --> 00:54:44.960
then you get in there with either your

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:47.839
voice toilette or your

00:54:47.839 --> 00:54:50.880
wallet dude you are a [ __ ] lunatic

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.520
god damn it

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:56.000
it's dry the dry hand so you hit him

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.760
with the first dry mummy you do a mummy

00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.000
wrap to the [ __ ] i don't i don't wrap

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.520
it around my hips

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:04.000
do mommy wrap your hands up that's why i

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.960
love mummy wraps

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:10.640
drive me insane if i knew that

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.880
he lived with my brother and he [ __ ]

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.800
saw through toilet paper

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:17.760
give it the man what claw

00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:20.240
so you're like a nice square fold yeah

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:22.000
you attack yep

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.599
and then you hit it with this

00:55:23.599 --> 00:55:26.000
hand soap yes and wipe your [ __ ] with

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.680
hand soap yes

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:29.839
and then back to a dry no then then do

00:55:29.839 --> 00:55:30.559
it

00:55:30.559 --> 00:55:31.599
no

00:55:31.599 --> 00:55:33.119
because you use a hand soap that's got a

00:55:33.119 --> 00:55:35.760
little bit of like moisturizer in it

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.760
and then uh then i go back to

00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:38.640
wet

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:40.559
then i'd go back to wet

00:55:40.559 --> 00:55:42.319
and then i put hemorrhoid cream in there

00:55:42.319 --> 00:55:44.880
by the way this is the hang on this is

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:46.800
pretty funny because o'connor was over

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.040
at my house one one day and i farted and

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.559
he was just like boy that sounded a

00:55:50.559 --> 00:55:53.119
little wet and i was like no that was

00:55:53.119 --> 00:55:54.960
just all the lube right away this i

00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:56.160
found out later because then the next

00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.839
day my cousin was over i fart and he was

00:55:57.839 --> 00:55:59.440

he's like

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:08.079
it's just preparation age

00:56:08.079 --> 00:56:10.160
steve

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:17.599
discredited

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.799
you seem like an expert on that but

00:56:22.799 --> 00:56:25.119
now any topic you discuss

00:56:25.119 --> 00:56:26.799

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.000
you know

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.200
you've opened the door to it does it

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:38.720
sound like squeezing silly putty

00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:40.400
yeah yeah yeah

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.240
it's exactly what it sounds like yeah

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:43.680
that doesn't discredit you either in my

00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:44.880
eyes steve

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.400

haters the haters and the losers will

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:50.799
come down

00:56:50.799 --> 00:56:52.240
a thousand haters and twelve disciples

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:54.400
dude how'd that work out for him

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:55.839
he's the lord of the universe dude

00:56:55.839 --> 00:56:57.520
that's how it worked out for him

00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:59.760
he rose again the lord of the universe

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:04.240
pretty good maybe definitely not in saul

00:57:04.799 --> 00:57:06.160
steve's a jew

00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:08.640
so what i'm not non-practicing

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:09.440
would you

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.440

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:14.160
well i mean he thinks jesus dad's lord

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:15.599
of the universe i don't know

00:57:15.599 --> 00:57:17.839

00:57:17.839 --> 00:57:20.400
divine that's fair i don't care

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:23.280

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:24.559
with their gross bodies i was trying to

00:57:24.559 --> 00:57:26.480

the shop you guys should combine forces

00:58:00.559 --> 00:58:03.119
constantly working on it

00:58:03.119 --> 00:58:05.280
with your [ __ ] dong wax and his lubed

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:07.200

for a penis uh product

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:14.799
what happened

00:58:14.799 --> 00:58:18.079
oh what is it it was it it was it uh you

00:58:18.079 --> 00:58:19.280

you to see if i remember it go ahead oh

00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:26.559
this the idea was yes

00:58:26.559 --> 00:58:28.799
yes all right let me hear it what was it

00:58:28.799 --> 00:58:30.799
well you would you would you would

00:58:30.799 --> 00:58:33.520
lubricate the outside of the condom okay

00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:35.359
with something that made the vagina

00:58:35.359 --> 00:58:36.559
contract

00:58:36.559 --> 00:58:38.400
oh yeah this is the craziest [ __ ] i've

00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.640
heard oh

00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:43.280
yeah you hit me with this before yes

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.440
i mean explain it explain it more well

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:47.040
it's just

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.400
just the idea of instead of taking

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.400
something to make the penis feel bigger

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.079
or your penis bigger you'd make the

00:58:52.079 --> 00:58:54.000
vagina feel tighter yeah you just gotta

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.440
whisper the right stuff in their ear

00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:57.280
dude he's gotta be like

00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.520
scared

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:02.799
my [ __ ] is lubed up right now

00:59:02.799 --> 00:59:04.319
don't worry about my don't worry about

00:59:04.319 --> 00:59:06.079
my tiny dick your [ __ ] is about to

00:59:06.079 --> 00:59:06.930
contract

00:59:06.930 --> 00:59:10.160
[Laughter]

00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:11.920
but like it'd be tough you'd have to

00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:14.319
brand them

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:17.119
it's probably scientifically possible

00:59:17.119 --> 00:59:19.119
but you have to the branding would be so

00:59:19.119 --> 00:59:21.119
tricky because like if you run out to

00:59:21.119 --> 00:59:22.720
buy condoms and your girlfriend found

00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:24.960
that you bought the vaginal contracting

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.960
concepts right right that's like a girl

00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.720
coming home and buying you like extra

00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:30.559
small condoms it's like right you have

00:59:30.559 --> 00:59:32.960
to market it two women

00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:34.880
under the slogan make him make him feel

00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:36.960
bigger girls probably would like that

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:37.920
you're right

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:40.559
but or you people say as hey you got a

00:59:40.559 --> 00:59:43.440
giant [ __ ]

00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:44.960
you have like martha stewart come out

00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:48.559
like hey you whale [ __ ] horse

00:59:48.559 --> 00:59:50.480
and i think for the record i'd like to

00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:52.559
say that i'm not advocating making this

00:59:52.559 --> 00:59:54.319
product are you a [ __ ] with a giant

00:59:54.319 --> 00:59:55.359

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.720
yeah dude

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:14.240
well i mean the concern with that would

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.079
be because then it would exacerbate the

01:01:16.079 --> 01:01:17.280
problem then the problem you wouldn't

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.200
even feel the problem no no i'd write it

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:21.359
out like being all painkillers yeah

01:01:21.359 --> 01:01:24.079
it would come back worse

01:01:24.079 --> 01:01:25.839
so what's like is there any long-term

01:01:25.839 --> 01:01:27.680
cures or like

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.040
uh i think you could potentially get

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:30.400
surgery but i've got them like inside

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.640
and outside so you gotta jesus christ i

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:33.760
don't even know what that is well

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:36.160
there's external and internal roids

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.960
you can get inside your butthole roids

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.720
deep in the colon where is it out what's

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.640
it what's an alpha outer is like on the

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.400
uh on the butthole right you can see

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.400
like a bulge which is probably a

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.079
girlfriend that's what i was saying if

01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:50.160
she's getting in there yeah she hasn't

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.440

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.480
of like a she's on the poo patrol okay

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:56.079

01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:57.440
hemorrhoids you got someone you got a

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:00.160

you think that women are trying to take

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.599
things from you yeah just to be like i

01:02:33.599 --> 01:02:34.799

01:02:34.799 --> 01:02:35.920
ass and you're like

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.400

like if i'd figured your ass

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.400
there would be a secret bond we'd have

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.200
would you ever get pegged no no

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.720
you would that's how you get hemorrhoids

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.240
steve you would get paid yeah i feel

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:54.240
like i if i feel like i could take it i

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.359
would have to like jesus christ dude

01:02:57.359 --> 01:02:58.880
this is there's nothing wrong with

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.640
taking pleasure from your butt

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.720
from getting pegged i do have a problem

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:06.000
with that why it's [ __ ] weird

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.720
okay anytime i hear a dude and i've and

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.720
i'm not [ __ ] on you here no no you

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.520
you can

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.079
i've heard this too many times lately

01:03:14.079 --> 01:03:15.760
about dude from dudes that i'm sitting

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.839
down with talking either getting pegged

01:03:17.839 --> 01:03:19.440
or being like yeah i would get pegged i

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.520
think oh really i think they could but i

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.520
think once the push comes off dude i

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.680
think once a peg comes out interesting

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:27.599
so here is my thought process on this

01:03:27.599 --> 01:03:30.400
yeah that it's really just

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.319
it's not a physical sensation that i i

01:03:32.319 --> 01:03:34.720
think i would enjoy like when i put a uh

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:37.200
like supposed story at my ass i'm like i

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.760
it feels weird it does feel good when

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.599
your butthole sucks it up that's an

01:03:41.599 --> 01:03:44.480
interesting feeling yes yeah

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:45.920
your butthole just snatches it and you

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.319
like it that does it is a it's a nice

01:03:48.319 --> 01:03:50.319
it's a reverse turret yeah it feels

01:03:50.319 --> 01:03:51.599
great the first time i did that i

01:03:51.599 --> 01:03:53.280
giggled

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.160
but

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:58.559
i didn't the way i the way i would do it

01:03:58.559 --> 01:04:01.119
if it really turned her on

01:04:01.119 --> 01:04:02.079
and this is somebody that was going to

01:04:02.079 --> 01:04:04.240
be with long term oh if it really turned

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.160
her off right yeah

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:08.079
then i would say we got to start with

01:04:08.079 --> 01:04:09.680
something that would be like suppository

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.920
size yeah something that's not you know

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:15.200
and i just said you're a dick

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.240
i just have to endure an uncomfortable

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.760
physical sensation that's not that

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.920
uncomfortable but it's getting her off

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:24.000
because the thing is is that

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:24.720
i

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.079
if if you have something that really

01:04:26.079 --> 01:04:27.760
turns you on and she's kind of like uh

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:29.839
you're like [ __ ] come on that's true

01:04:29.839 --> 01:04:32.720
just like tough it out give up the ass

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:35.119
right so if she really wanted it

01:04:35.119 --> 01:04:36.720
then you know something very small

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.319
wouldn't nothing anything that adds to

01:04:38.319 --> 01:04:40.160
the element of eroticness her commanding

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.480
to get into your butt a little or no

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.079
what is that what do you mean the fact

01:04:44.079 --> 01:04:45.599
that she's like totally dominating your

01:04:45.599 --> 01:04:47.599
butt you're just a piece here

01:04:47.599 --> 01:04:48.480
yeah

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:50.000
that's what it's called

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
that's a butt queen if someone has a

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.440
butt queen there's like a girlfriend who

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:56.400
like demands entry into your [ __ ] oh

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.960
well i mean as long as that personality

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.880
i don't know it's always good

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.880
don't do it they have enough

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.720
you can't i'm not looking for it i'm

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:09.319
just saying if your girlfriend dude

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.960
relationship with somebody with a good

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:15.359
family

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.760
that's how you solidify land you'll see

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.920

so you're gonna this is this would be

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:35.599
hypothetically with somebody that you

01:05:37.359 --> 01:05:40.240

battery when i conceived

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.760

she i want to say

01:06:33.119 --> 01:06:36.480

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.720

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.960
that's so little yes i want to start

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.880
small i don't [ __ ] jump in shallow

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.280
ends you're no size queen then

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:48.079
you are not a size queen definitely not

01:06:48.079 --> 01:06:50.400
okay but would you do it would you do it

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.000
yeah totally oh okay this thing you're

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.319
talking like a visine container i could

01:06:54.319 --> 01:06:56.799
yeah i'll take a vitamin on my ass right

01:06:56.799 --> 01:07:00.760
now i won't even notice it

01:07:01.039 --> 01:07:02.319
my question here's my question to you

01:07:02.319 --> 01:07:03.680
what if she wants to strap it around

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.200
herself

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.440
yeah oh like like like

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.200
what if you have a choice between like a

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.119
a large

01:07:11.119 --> 01:07:13.920
like non-phallic object or a tiny penis

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:16.079
but for the tiny bit she has to like

01:07:16.079 --> 01:07:17.520
literally [ __ ] me with it

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.720
that's a tough one i definitely think

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.960
the smaller one again i just you take

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.400
the tiny penis yeah i think i can get

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:24.000
myself a little mental state

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.200
you have to get something off your butt

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.960
it's like a big like

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.559
a floaty almost

01:07:28.559 --> 01:07:30.000
something like that like totally

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.480
non-phallic or just a teeny penis but

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.960
she's a teeny penis on a man no no i

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.720
mean jesus you can if you want wait it's

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.559
just a tiny object that's shaped like a

01:07:38.559 --> 01:07:40.960
penis she straps it on well i think

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.680
straps on getting pegged is a strap on

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:46.079
it doesn't have to be oh really yeah

01:07:46.079 --> 01:07:48.079
i thought getting pegged was strap-on

01:07:48.079 --> 01:07:49.440
that was my understanding as well could

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.039
be but you i mean they can totally just

01:07:51.039 --> 01:07:52.880
sit there that's just getting butt dildo

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:54.400
double dildo

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.400

01:08:14.079 --> 01:08:16.719
of your children um i mean that's a

01:08:16.719 --> 01:08:18.000
saturday night

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.839
it's a wild time a little back-to-back

01:08:19.839 --> 01:08:21.679
dude it's like let's toss on some

01:08:21.679 --> 01:08:23.520
[ __ ] stranger things and then

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.440
afterwards we'll [ __ ]

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:27.759
do ask to ask dildo each other but uh

01:08:27.759 --> 01:08:29.600
that's funny thinking about like you

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.759
know like the grade school cio events

01:08:31.759 --> 01:08:33.279
how many of the parents like just really

01:08:33.279 --> 01:08:37.000
eating each other's asses

01:08:38.319 --> 01:08:40.799
oh man but yeah no i would go with this

01:08:40.799 --> 01:08:42.239
smaller object you go off the table

01:08:42.239 --> 01:08:44.480
phallic's designed to okay designed for

01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:46.239
entry i'm going to step it up

01:08:46.239 --> 01:08:47.920
that's true and so that would be for

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:48.799
pleasure

01:08:48.799 --> 01:08:50.239
and for plunging okay so if you're going

01:08:50.239 --> 01:08:53.520
to go just like a like a pretty size

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.759
like an eight inch peg

01:08:55.759 --> 01:08:57.120
you're this is both penises at this

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.640
point you have a choice between like an

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:01.440
eight inch fat [ __ ] pegger or like a

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:04.480
standard [ __ ] like five

01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:06.319
but that also squirts inside you at the

01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:07.920
end

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:09.759
squirt again i mean if i'm already

01:09:09.759 --> 01:09:11.440
if i'm already going all in on this the

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:13.040
square the square inside would probably

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.319
be great

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:16.400
it would probably feel great it squirts

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:17.920
hands

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.719
hands open your butt

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:26.000
yeah this is uh all right this is trash

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.199
do you think we're gonna get to mars

01:09:27.199 --> 01:09:29.359
talking about [ __ ] like this steve yeah

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:30.719
you know what's gonna be interesting

01:09:30.719 --> 01:09:32.839
about getting to mars

01:09:32.839 --> 01:09:34.799
yeah first guy's talking first person to

01:09:34.799 --> 01:09:37.440
do everything true that i just i came

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.040
the first person to beat off on this

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.640
that's pretty tight forever

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.400
you know do whatever any weird thing

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:43.920
that you do you think the space race is

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:45.520
to see who can jerk off

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.719
first

01:09:46.719 --> 01:09:49.719
is

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:54.400
who got the first moonshot technically

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.159
that hasn't happened yet though i bet it

01:09:56.159 --> 01:09:57.840
has this i guarantee one of those

01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.440
astronauts crashed

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:03.120
definitely moon landing when they faked

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.159
dude [ __ ] it

01:10:06.159 --> 01:10:09.600
why do you think the flag was so stiff

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:11.840
uh

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:14.840
did you say we put my [ __ ] covered

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.560
yeah

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.320
astronauts have definitely jerked off

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.840
there's been several someone's jerked

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:20.719
off in space well there's been

01:10:20.719 --> 01:10:23.120
definitely several nuts in space yeah in

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:24.880
space for sure think of that just

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:26.560
floating around the room when you finish

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.159
just floats around everywhere gets into

01:10:28.159 --> 01:10:30.960
like a computer

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.360
quietly jerking off in your little pod

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.560
you have people next to you like all

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:43.840
sudden your nut starts flying up in the

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.679
air oh [ __ ] you gotta like swim around

01:10:45.679 --> 01:10:47.199
and snap back floats into the other

01:10:47.199 --> 01:10:49.679
guy's room

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.640
oh man

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.800
yeah so i mean if i became a millionaire

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.080
the first thing i did was the first

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.480
thing i did

01:11:01.930 --> 01:11:06.710
[Laughter]

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:13.679
pre-cum well

01:11:13.679 --> 01:11:15.120
i don't know if it's pre-cum but i you

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.360
know if i if one day i want a father so

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.960
you know yeah yeah it's like if you want

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.800
to sigh or a boy you're saying you need

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.800
that cloudy yeah i think that that

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:26.320
that's a milky substance yes sometimes

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:27.840
it turns yellow too you gotta watch out

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.120
for that you gotta watch out for that

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.960
old yeller yeah sometimes you gotta put

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.560
that down i don't know why he does that

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:34.640
i read about it like three times but you

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:37.330
still don't know

01:11:37.330 --> 01:11:40.320
[Laughter]

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.760
something like google like once a year

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.760
ago okay and then i totally forget as

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.360
soon as i did yeah

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.320
so

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:47.840
i think if it stays in you too long it

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:50.640
starts turning yellow

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:53.280
maybe yeah maybe that's because you go

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:55.920
on several you go on nofaps steve you

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:58.000
ever know fap you have tried how'd it go

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.679
yeah with your record no not not not

long at all yeah several hours no like

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.080

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:06.560
really yeah it's a good healthy boy

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.480
yeah that's about right

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.640
three three days is good

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:12.159
yeah but i was trying to do like two

01:12:12.159 --> 01:12:14.960
weeks oh well that's no good no i had

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:16.960
it's hard willpower and it was it was

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.239
like when i was like walking to the

01:12:18.239 --> 01:12:19.440
toilet papers like you know you're

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:20.800
breaking your willpower right now and i

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.560
was like whatever you know like having

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:24.480
that conversation in my head yeah just

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:27.120
like marching back and i go

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.159
all the time

01:12:28.159 --> 01:12:30.239
i do when i finally just let my defenses

01:12:30.239 --> 01:12:31.840
down and i'm jerking off it's such a

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:32.800
sadness

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:35.040
like i'm trying not to do it at all

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.199
and just jesus christ man when you when

01:12:37.199 --> 01:12:39.120
you do it and afterwards you just go i

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.560
need to do that sometimes though i go

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:42.640
like i [ __ ] needed that

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.880
i don't care i needed that

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.480
exactly right sometimes you need a crack

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.400
once you of course you do i hit a level

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.120
where i'm just like [ __ ] dude you're

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.800
on a different level you're on a new

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.120
you're on a plane there nervous [ __ ]

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.280

01:13:02.719 --> 01:13:04.480
time that's kind of not a guy i hit

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.159

female bus drivers hang out with thugs

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:48.800
again again we're assuming that that

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.639
information is correct it basically is

01:26:50.639 --> 01:26:52.800
like prostitutes thieves drug dealers

01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:55.120
bus drivers whatever this is the next

01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:57.199
tier of like

01:26:57.199 --> 01:27:01.040

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:30.000
like female suicide bombers because

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
heaven would last like five seconds just

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.320

01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:42.000
it is yes uh what the oh like 73 out of

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.080
72 virgins well first off any joke about

01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:46.159
72 virgins is usually hacked now yeah

01:30:46.159 --> 01:30:48.960
yeah but it is a strange question

01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:50.639
it's funny because one of my first jokes

01:30:50.639 --> 01:30:53.760
was also like 72 huh that's a particular

01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:56.239
number yeah what were they like i'll do

01:30:56.239 --> 01:30:57.120
it

01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:58.320
they're like i'm not gonna do it they're

01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:00.960
like 70. pesky and the guy was like nah

01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:02.800

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.080
it yeah

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:06.320
so yeah there's a bunch of that but uh

01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:07.760
you were you were one of the originators

01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:08.719
that's good that's actually you were

01:31:08.719 --> 01:31:10.080
ahead of the curve on a hackathon i

01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:12.159
wonder uh

01:31:12.159 --> 01:31:13.600
just from like recruiting dudes into

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:15.040
heaven it's like okay that makes sense

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:16.239
but then like to the girls they'd be

01:31:16.239 --> 01:31:18.159
like

01:31:18.159 --> 01:31:20.239
yeah you guys are all gonna share some

01:31:20.239 --> 01:31:21.840
dude

01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:23.679
yeah whoa that's not that motivating

01:31:23.679 --> 01:31:24.639
they've been

01:31:24.639 --> 01:31:26.639
in that religion if you're following it

01:31:26.639 --> 01:31:28.800
strict enough to suicide bomb you're

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:30.880
like all in on sharia law and all that

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:33.280
[ __ ] so you're like women are submitted

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:34.960
like you are

01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:37.120
your goal is to serve men that makes

01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:39.520
sense so like they're like yeah

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:41.280
seem nice too then you have like 72

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:43.199
helpers yeah you only have to [ __ ] once

01:31:43.199 --> 01:31:46.080
every like 72 days that's not yeah

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:49.199
that's a that's a female paradise dude

01:31:49.199 --> 01:31:51.360
i never have to [ __ ] yes you can split

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:53.920
the chores with seventy two other man

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:56.000
yeah i i brought this up to shane he

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.840
didn't seem that uh interested in the

01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:59.120
idea but i'll just throw it at you

01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:01.040
really quick is that it though i think

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:03.120
what's interesting about nazis is that

01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:05.199
there was there's no like

01:32:05.199 --> 01:32:06.239
moderate

01:32:06.239 --> 01:32:09.280
or like reform nazis so you couldn't run

01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:11.360
into a scenario where it's like

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:14.080
these aren't true nazis this is a

01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:16.480
perversion of nazism that's not our

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:17.600
thing

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:18.960
true that like you know because then you

01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:20.960
attack then you invade nazis you're like

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:22.639
all these not you're you're grouping us

01:32:22.639 --> 01:32:24.080
in with all these nazis those are

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.120
perversions

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:27.440
yeah we just like the economic things of

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:28.880
nazism

01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.239
right right

01:32:30.239 --> 01:32:31.520
okay so

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:33.760
it's kind of like people being like

01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:35.520
with marxism they're being like well

01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:37.440
they're just doing it wrong

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:39.040
yeah maybe if somebody believed in

01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:40.560
national socialism like that where

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:42.400
they'd be like yeah no it's a good

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:45.199
theory it just germany did it wrong

01:32:45.199 --> 01:32:46.560
yeah well i was actually i was just

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:48.800
relating more to like how tough it is to

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:49.679
fight

01:32:49.679 --> 01:32:52.000
radical jihadism

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.760
because they'd be like this isn't real

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:56.239
islam this is it yeah it's strange and

01:32:56.239 --> 01:32:57.600
and but yeah with nazism they're just

01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:00.159
like all blanket horrible people so you

01:33:00.159 --> 01:33:02.400
can't run that confusion oh so you're

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:04.719
calling muslims nazis

01:33:04.719 --> 01:33:06.880
not even close

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:09.040
i

01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:14.239
you can't even bring up muslims and

01:33:14.239 --> 01:33:16.560
nazis in the same paragraph

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:17.679
okay here's what i'm saying here's

01:33:17.679 --> 01:33:19.280
another very highly

01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:21.280
regret i'm saying that's like a

01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:22.800
that's a high wire act if you've got the

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:24.400
muzzies up here the nazis and you're

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:26.239
just like well you're right there's no

01:33:26.239 --> 01:33:27.840
reason for me to say that and it's not

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:29.120
that interesting but you shouldn't have

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:30.639
said it you could what you're being

01:33:30.639 --> 01:33:32.880
racist go ahead i'm just saying that the

01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:34.560
the last one i was saying is that if

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:36.400
you'd say the greatest generation is the

01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:38.159
generation that fought the nazis but

01:33:38.159 --> 01:33:41.440
great greatest it's like no no and again

01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:44.480
i love the vets

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:47.280
no you're about to get impeached well

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:49.360
it's just that you fought nazis like

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:51.280
this pure evil yeah you didn't really

01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:54.000
have a choice yeah so you know greatest

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.760
would almost be it's just like

01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:57.679
you know you didn't have to but you did

01:33:57.679 --> 01:33:58.480
but

01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:00.159
yeah you kind of you're fighting pure

01:34:00.159 --> 01:34:02.239
the incarnate damn so you hate nazis

01:34:02.239 --> 01:34:04.639
okay i

01:34:04.639 --> 01:34:06.560
you hate nazis and

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:08.320
muslims

01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:10.239
you are a true well you're saying is

01:34:10.239 --> 01:34:12.880
islamic jihadists they're just as bad as

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:15.840
what are we saying you're such a zionist

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:17.679
you are such a classic zionist it's

01:34:17.679 --> 01:34:19.920
difficult because the ideology of islam

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:22.639
can be perverted by radicals yes and

01:34:22.639 --> 01:34:23.600
then

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:25.840
some people can lump all muslims in

01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:26.880
under that

01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:29.440
thing yes but nazism didn't have that it

01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:31.040
was just like pew it was just there was

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.920
no venn diagram of sort of it was just

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:37.600
like nazis bad yes yeah

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:39.920
useless comment there well

01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:42.480
all right it's out there it's good

01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:43.679
it gives the listener something to think

01:34:43.679 --> 01:34:44.800
about

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:47.600
is dr steve gerben

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:49.920
as racist as he sounds

01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:52.239
as islamophobic as he

01:34:52.239 --> 01:34:53.920
so far every episode you've been quite

01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:55.120
islamophobic

01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:56.800
very racist yeah

01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:58.560
his last his new talks about like

01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:00.080
western thought and progress and how we

01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:01.600
need to do away with israel what's your

01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:04.320
what's just not it's just not but it is

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:05.679
about the first part

01:35:05.679 --> 01:35:07.520
yeah what's your least favorite religion

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:08.410
um

01:35:08.410 --> 01:35:10.719
[Music]

01:35:10.719 --> 01:35:13.679
i really dislike uh i mean islam for

01:35:13.679 --> 01:35:16.560
sure but uh islam is a no-brainer that's

01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:18.480
clearly the gay the gay is religious

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:20.480
yeah but uh it's

01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:24.239
soda's like like evangelical christian

01:35:24.239 --> 01:35:26.800
like a southern christian like

01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:28.560
methodist i forget which one it is the

01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:30.320
evangelical [ __ ] where it's like i know

01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.679
what you're talking about creating

01:35:31.679 --> 01:35:33.040
churches and [ __ ]

01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:35.360
like where they're like the earth is

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.520
2 000 years old like that 5 000 years

01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:40.000
old or whatever that shit's really yeah

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.719
she like shut the [ __ ] up yeah and the

01:35:42.719 --> 01:35:44.480
westboro baptist like along those lines

01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:47.120
i mean westbrook baptist is a small sect

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:48.400
but

01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:50.400
that like seri because then that gives

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:52.800
catholics even even a worse name i mean

01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:54.719
we're about [ __ ] kids but then also

01:35:54.719 --> 01:35:56.800
we get lumped into like

01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:59.040
christianity yeah you know and i hate

01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:00.719
when people just lump

01:36:00.719 --> 01:36:02.880
all the bad apples of one religion into

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:04.400
the whole thing the way steve does with

01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:06.800
islam well it was interesting that shane

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:07.920
brings up because

01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:10.000
in conversation with you i got to parse

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.159
out that difference between catholicism

01:36:12.159 --> 01:36:13.679
and christianity that i didn't really

01:36:13.679 --> 01:36:16.000
understand yeah yeah and it is true

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.600
because i would always have thought

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:21.280
catholicism would have been the far more

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:23.600
conservative of the two but it almost

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:26.880
doesn't seem that way in so far

01:36:28.639 --> 01:36:30.880
like they're more willing to change

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:32.000
yeah

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.920
like you see the pope recently was uh

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:38.000
he said he's like god made you that way

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.320
to get him gay people yeah i don't like

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:43.040
that piss alex jones off did it well

01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:44.800
alex jones is one of those you know he's

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:47.199
a christian like what he's been like you

01:36:47.199 --> 01:36:48.880
made him that way you touched him

01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:50.719
goddamn yeah he hates catholics and

01:36:50.719 --> 01:36:52.320
that's another thing the the a lot of

01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:54.159
racists in this country hate catholics

01:36:54.159 --> 01:36:55.520
interesting i never that's insane i've

01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:57.600
never heard that really yeah like the

01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:59.440
clan

01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:01.520
i'd love to see him get me dude [ __ ]

01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:02.639
white belt bro they're going to come up

01:37:02.639 --> 01:37:04.400
to me he would roll on them

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:05.440
they'd be

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:07.520
i tapped the clan out hard dude i heard

01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:08.880
you guys don't like catholics but you

01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:10.719
said everybody cares about catholics

01:37:10.719 --> 01:37:12.080
yeah well we don't care about catholics

01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:13.760
anymore but that's in there that's in

01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:15.119
great that's the anointing yeah when

01:37:15.119 --> 01:37:16.400
they're all like old southern

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:17.760
protestants they're probably and i'm

01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:19.520
catholics too yeah

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:21.760
back when beckham catholics were

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:23.440
back in immigration back when uh dairy

01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:55.360
arm

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:57.440
and she's like it's a robo arm it's just

01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:59.440
a chick and then like the cover art for

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:00.880
the [ __ ]

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:02.960
it's a world war ii game but it's like

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:05.040
here's a chick well

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:06.560
i'm not as hung up on the arm as much as

01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:08.239
i am some [ __ ] broad in the middle of

01:38:08.239 --> 01:38:10.320
a [ __ ] fire fight

01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:11.119
in

01:38:11.119 --> 01:38:13.360
it's just like sure

01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:15.360
but then uh dairy queen this this guy

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:18.239
who he's a liberal listener

01:38:18.239 --> 01:38:19.600
he's a liberal

01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.119
he's an edgy liberal

01:38:21.119 --> 01:38:22.960
he's a real edgy liberal like he's not

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:25.440
afraid to toss around some anti-pc slurs

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:27.360
dude okay but uh

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:28.800
he's i mean he's edgy as [ __ ] for a

01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:30.880
liberal but he

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:32.560
in in this [ __ ] gamer threat because

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:34.800
he's heard me on here complain about it

01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:36.320
there's this thread on the main board

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:38.159
about e3 which is a video game

01:38:38.159 --> 01:38:39.199
convention

01:38:39.199 --> 01:38:40.320
and

01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:42.080
he's like somebody said something about

01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:42.960
like

01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:44.480
it's amazing that people are complaining

01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:46.320
that there's female characters in this

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:47.199
game

01:38:47.199 --> 01:38:49.679
and then he was like [ __ ] he's like this

01:38:49.679 --> 01:38:51.679
this guy has [ __ ] meltdowns over this

01:38:51.679 --> 01:38:53.600
all the time talking about me

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:55.760
and like i started to comment back on it

01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:56.960
and i was like i'm not gonna i'm not

01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:59.040
gonna fall into this trap but then this

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.880
other guy was like yeah it's not about

01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:02.560
social justice warriors it's about the

01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:04.080
bottom line it's like they're just

01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:05.600
trying to make money because females are

01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:06.880
gamers too

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:08.239
and they want to be represented in the

01:39:08.239 --> 01:39:09.360
game

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.040
and then

01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:14.159
i looked it up and the stats are like

01:39:14.159 --> 01:39:16.000
gamers 48

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.560
of gamers are female

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:21.760
but the study was counting like

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:23.679
candy crush

01:39:23.679 --> 01:39:26.400
and like that is gaming

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:27.679
it's just it was just

01:39:27.679 --> 01:39:29.760
[ __ ] it was just a weird thing sure

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:31.520
and also i mean i'm i'm losing what the

01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:32.719
[ __ ] i'm trying to talk about here

01:39:32.719 --> 01:39:34.719
because this it does [ __ ] annoy me

01:39:34.719 --> 01:39:35.920
and i don't want to come off it they

01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:38.239
skew the snack well they use that yeah

01:39:38.239 --> 01:39:40.320
to make it be like see women love video

01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:41.440
games too

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:43.520
it's like no they don't why why are we

01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:45.920
pretending that they do yeah

01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:47.199
i don't get it

01:39:47.199 --> 01:39:48.960
but then anyway there shouldn't be girls

01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:51.280
in world war ii games right

01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:52.480
what do you think of that yeah that's

01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:55.199
fine i mean uh

01:39:55.199 --> 01:39:56.800
let's

01:39:56.800 --> 01:39:58.880
say something about it steve well i'm

01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:00.400
smart what if i told you that the women

01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:02.400
i'm more hung up about the robot arm i

01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:03.600
don't understand well the robot arm is

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:05.199
ridiculous i said the shane they had to

01:40:05.199 --> 01:40:06.880
give her a robot well she would know the

01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:09.199
only question fantasy aspect was there

01:40:09.199 --> 01:40:11.920
some sort of brigade of women british

01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:14.159
women that fought and then would that

01:40:14.159 --> 01:40:15.440
okay then dude

01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:17.600
and to get out of the even the it's not

01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:18.480
even a

01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:20.880
it's not even necessarily that it's a

01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:22.159
woman it's like remember when you played

01:40:22.159 --> 01:40:24.800
the metal or not metal uh call of duties

01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:26.560
and it turned into like weird zombie

01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:28.560
apocalypse [ __ ] yeah i know

01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:30.320
that was like yeah this sucks yes you

01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:31.040
know what i mean like when you're

01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:32.159
shooting i'm like i don't want to shoot

01:40:32.159 --> 01:40:33.760
robots the whole time so it's not even

01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:35.520
like it's a girl it's like it's just

01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:37.119
weird yeah it's

01:40:37.119 --> 01:40:38.639
and it's just preference like i wanted

01:40:38.639 --> 01:40:40.960
to play a realistic world war ii

01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:42.320
video game

01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:43.440
not

01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:44.560
you don't want a girl i don't want to

01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:46.960
pretend pretend world yeah i wanted to

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:48.880
be but then again i mean there's there's

01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:50.320
holes all over this thing it's a [ __ ]

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:52.639
it's a video game and it's like yeah i

01:40:52.639 --> 01:40:54.480
didn't have a problem with nazi zombies

01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:56.639
so it's weird to be like there were no

01:40:56.639 --> 01:40:59.679
women on the front lines

01:40:59.679 --> 01:41:01.119
but uh

01:41:01.119 --> 01:41:03.040
yeah anyway let's go back to weird [ __ ]

01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:05.040
you do no no i i yeah it's a tough one

01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:07.440
so not addressing the haters dude

01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:08.960
yeah that's a tough one i don't i don't

01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:09.920
know how

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:11.679
you don't like it you don't like it yeah

01:41:11.679 --> 01:41:13.440
yeah that's fine it doesn't make you

01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:15.600
sexist for wanting

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:17.840
to be historically accurate bro i'm a

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:19.920
[ __ ] purist yeah exactly so that's

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:22.239
fine you're exactly right stephen it is

01:41:22.239 --> 01:41:23.119
fine

01:41:23.119 --> 01:41:24.639
it's that guy should stop making fun of

01:41:24.639 --> 01:41:26.080
you man i wish that guy would stop

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:27.520
online bullying me too yeah he should

01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:29.199
listen to our first lady

01:41:29.199 --> 01:41:31.520
our gorgeous first lady is she on

01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:33.199
bullying right now she was i think she

01:41:33.199 --> 01:41:36.000
was anti-bullying which is funny because

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.840
trump daddy is the ultimate

01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:39.119
yeah i mean

01:41:39.119 --> 01:41:41.040
yeah we're back to trump dude

01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:42.800
get away from it dude

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:44.840
steve you love trudeau

01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:46.960
trudeau i don't know enough about him

01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:49.440
but i'm not uh he would peg

01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:51.360
he would yeah he would definitely i just

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:53.679
know that he he addressed like women's

01:41:53.679 --> 01:41:55.280
day

01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:56.080
at

01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:58.000
a place that had segregated women

01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.440
because it was like they were muslim

01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:00.639
women so they had to be segregated from

01:42:00.639 --> 01:42:03.040
the men he was like upholding how great

01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:04.960
women's achievement was

01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:08.080
really gigantic irony of trying to be

01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:09.440
multicultural

01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:11.920
oh my include i got you that's hilarious

01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:13.600
so he went to like once like he gave a

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:16.000
speech to like a muslim brigade about

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.679
celebrating

01:42:17.679 --> 01:42:21.280
where the women were segregated

01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:23.920
what was he wearing

01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:25.840
he's known to don like this oh oh i

01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:27.840
don't know i don't know he probably went

01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:30.239
like a bunch of pakistanis like namaste

01:42:30.239 --> 01:42:33.360
everybody yeah women rule uh

01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:35.440
it's like what interactions have people

01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:37.840
had in their lives or they don't get

01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:39.520
positive feedback from being honest with

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:40.480
people

01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:42.159
if you if you like with your neighbors

01:42:42.159 --> 01:42:43.280
or anything like that like if you're

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:45.520
just honest you don't have to be mean

01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:47.040
but you can be honest

01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:49.920
and it's like why what the [ __ ]

01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:51.920
he clearly does not think that

01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:54.239
segregating women is a good idea

01:42:54.239 --> 01:42:56.159
why can't you just say i don't think

01:42:56.159 --> 01:42:58.080
this is a good idea yeah this is just

01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:59.679
not our you wouldn't say there no of

01:42:59.679 --> 01:43:01.040
course not he was like celebrating you

01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:03.440
know our differences and women and

01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:05.760
that's weird that sucks you know you i

01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:06.960
like the way you did that why do you do

01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:08.400
it on women's day though just to be like

01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:10.080

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:35.040
that what he was doing to an effect

01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:37.760
it's it seemed i mean certainly where

01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:39.600

speaking to him

01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:48.880
no no no who cares about them right

01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:51.360
yeah what was it speaking about women's

01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:52.960
equality

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:55.440
at at a mosque

01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:56.239

01:43:56.239 --> 01:43:58.239
segregating women

01:43:58.239 --> 01:43:59.119
oh because they got to sit in the

01:50:25.199 --> 01:50:26.880
beginning when i was talking boringly

01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:28.480
about it no no that wasn't you being

01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:30.639
boring that was me being insecure

01:50:30.639 --> 01:50:32.639
and neurotic that was me

01:50:32.639 --> 01:50:35.440
being unhappy with things um you wanna

01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:37.440
end it or take a break take a break

01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:39.760
let's take a break and decide yeah

01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:42.800
we back we're back be back live dude yes

01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:45.119
yo so i uh

01:50:45.119 --> 01:50:47.199
i've been reading this book this

01:50:47.199 --> 01:50:48.880
audiobook all week

01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:50.400
and it's all about

01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:53.199
it's all about um this like doctor who

01:50:53.199 --> 01:50:55.360
got really into like mushrooms and doing

01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:57.440
like mushroom and lsd research michael

01:50:57.440 --> 01:50:59.119
pollan

01:50:59.119 --> 01:51:00.880
yeah [ __ ] i forgot his name there's a

01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:02.400
couple of them but i think i think that

01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:03.520
is that might be his name it's called

01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:06.480
changing your mind yeah his book dude

01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:08.880
i want to do mushrooms so bad right now

01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:10.560
so i'm i'm a total mushroom head right

01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:12.080
now the way they describe this [ __ ] is

01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:12.880
like

01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:14.960
like they have centers where you go in

01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:16.800
this is what they're trying to legalize

01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:18.239
so they'll have a place where like

01:51:18.239 --> 01:51:19.840
you're with a doctor they got all your

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:21.280
vitals and everything taken care of so

01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:22.400
you're not you know you're like total

01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:23.920
medical hands and then you're sitting

01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:25.520
there with a therapist and then they

01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:27.360
give you like seven grams of mushrooms

01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:29.360
or whatever i think no it's five

01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:31.520
but it's like a total like um

01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:32.719
synthetic so you don't get like sick or

01:51:32.719 --> 01:51:34.159
anything they give it to you and they

01:51:34.159 --> 01:51:35.840
just guide you through like

01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:38.159
like a mystical experience it's like i

01:51:38.159 --> 01:51:39.520
want to do this it was like the point

01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:40.880
where i was like

01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:42.320

01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:44.080

01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:45.280
then i was like yes i was like

01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:46.480
explaining to someone how i want to set

01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:47.760
it up and they're like yeah you just

01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:49.119
need an apartment dude you could just do

01:51:49.119 --> 01:51:50.719
this interview yeah yeah i don't think

01:51:50.719 --> 01:51:52.560
you need a legal

01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:54.560
location because it's not legal yeah it

01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:55.520
would just be always like telling them

01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:57.040
like set up in like a warehouse you can

01:51:57.040 --> 01:51:58.480
like sit in it it'll be a couch and a

01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:00.080

that i'd throw around your ankle

01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:28.400
i'm just thinking about i'm thinking

01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:30.639
about the shock master dude at home

01:59:30.639 --> 01:59:32.080

his wife's talking [ __ ] he's in the

01:59:33.599 --> 01:59:35.199
recliner eventually he just gets up and

01:59:35.199 --> 01:59:38.270
does a full running clothesline

01:59:38.270 --> 01:59:40.560
[Laughter]

01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:44.400

01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:47.840
gonna let you off the hook on that

01:59:47.840 --> 01:59:49.760
corning [ __ ] you're a little kid you're

01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:51.599
having fun

01:59:51.599 --> 01:59:53.040
at least me my cousins used to make

01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:55.360
stuffed animals have sex in the basement

01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:59.040
like yeah yeah oh

02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:02.800
we were like

02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:04.560
little it was i mean i literally

02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:06.159
remember when i was kind of a little too

02:00:06.159 --> 02:00:08.080
old for toys i kind of still play with

02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:09.119
them for a little bit yeah once you

02:00:09.119 --> 02:00:13.320
start making them [ __ ] you're too old

02:00:15.199 --> 02:00:16.639
i got out of there just in time it's a

02:00:16.639 --> 02:00:18.159
good rule of thumb because i think we

02:00:18.159 --> 02:00:19.440
stopped playing with toys answers we had

02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:20.560
a bunch of stuffed animals on the

02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:22.320
basement i remember we were like it was

02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:24.639
like a bunny and like some other stuffed

02:00:24.639 --> 02:00:26.320
giraffe like it was my sister's beanie

02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:28.080
babies right now yeah i knew i was gonna

02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:29.199
be beating babies i was making my

02:00:29.199 --> 02:00:30.719
sister's beanie babies [ __ ] down my

02:00:30.719 --> 02:00:32.159
basement my two cousins were watching

02:00:32.159 --> 02:00:33.920
we're all taking turns making them [ __ ]

02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:35.119
and my dad came and i was like what are

02:00:35.119 --> 02:00:36.159
you doing with all these beauty babies

02:00:36.159 --> 02:00:37.679
and we were just like

02:00:37.679 --> 02:00:40.400
just playing baby

02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:42.639
oh i have one more story then before we

02:00:42.639 --> 02:00:44.880
go because no we're good speaking of

02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:48.320
that so my cousin and well like we had

02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:50.800
we tried to these stuff we had we had

02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:52.800
there's no easy way to say this you guys

02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:55.199
had sex when you wrestled no

02:00:55.199 --> 02:00:58.159
but we had there was some stuff

02:00:58.159 --> 02:00:59.360
that uh

02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:01.040
that was like my elementary school and

02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:03.760
yeah it was like save the kangaroos so

02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:05.599
we bought these wait save the kangaroo

02:01:05.599 --> 02:01:07.040
it was one of those things where it was

02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:09.280
like there's too many kangaroos i don't

02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:11.440
know what it was for whatever reason it

02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:12.719
was like donating money you get this

02:01:12.719 --> 02:01:14.800
stuffed kangaroo okay gotcha and that

02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:16.560
was like you know my brother and i each

02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:18.159
had one when we were like little for a

02:01:18.159 --> 02:01:20.639
while it's a good charity scam dude like

02:01:20.639 --> 02:01:23.280
just like save the squirrels

02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:24.239
yeah

02:01:24.239 --> 02:01:26.880
so then later like uh when my cousin and

02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:29.040
i were coming of age like we figured

02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:31.760
that you could [ __ ] the pocket of the

02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:32.719
cake

02:01:32.719 --> 02:01:34.880
[ __ ] the pocket yeah yeah

02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:37.040
to see what like a vagina

02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:38.639
so you [ __ ] this down i knew you

02:01:38.639 --> 02:01:40.159
[ __ ] the stuffed animal did i not say

02:01:40.159 --> 02:01:41.840
that i called it right away i was like

02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:43.599

02:01:43.599 --> 02:01:46.239
his mom like knocked on the door that he

02:01:46.239 --> 02:01:48.159

02:01:48.159 --> 02:01:51.040
he's digging a kangaroo pouch

02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:53.840
he answers the door and he like does he

02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:57.360

02:02:14.159 --> 02:02:15.599

[Music]

02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:36.800

02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:51.840
again yeah i'd like to hear i love

02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:53.119
hearing myself on other people's

02:05:53.119 --> 02:05:54.880
podcasts

02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:56.320
i'm every other week on this sometimes

02:05:56.320 --> 02:05:57.679

02:05:57.679 --> 02:05:58.880
yeah i didn't listen to last week's

02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:01.199
neither i i get anxiety sometimes with

02:06:01.199 --> 02:06:03.360
ours i don't care i don't listen to me

02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:05.599
on [ __ ] that i think i sounded like a

02:06:05.599 --> 02:06:07.280
pretentious douche well i made a vowel

02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:09.199
today to myself that i'm like i'm just

02:06:09.199 --> 02:06:10.960
totally going to stop trying i know as

02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:12.560
soon as as soon as i hear myself talking

02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:15.280
about anything serious i'm just like see

02:06:15.280 --> 02:06:16.719
when i listen to myself talking politics

02:06:16.719 --> 02:06:18.880
i'm just like query points matt great

02:06:18.880 --> 02:06:20.719
points and i don't really care i'm gonna

02:06:20.719 --> 02:06:22.800
dread listening to the part where i was

02:06:22.800 --> 02:06:25.199
like women in video games like that will

02:06:25.199 --> 02:06:27.360
bother you see i don't know but i just

02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:29.679
push back on that slightly because you

02:06:29.679 --> 02:06:30.639
you

02:06:30.639 --> 02:06:32.159
the way in which you kind of feather

02:06:32.159 --> 02:06:34.400
that is is really good i think and it's

02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:35.599
important to have a voice like that

02:06:35.599 --> 02:06:36.880
where it's just like

02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:38.960
you know it's it's not like an all-in

02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:40.400
scenario it's like i'm working through

02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:42.400
this idea and the price you have to pay

02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:44.880
for it is feeling insecure about it but

02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:46.800
that's what i like hearing you talk

02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:48.719
about things ah well thank you yeah

02:06:48.719 --> 02:06:50.400
because uh also

02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:52.800
now i'm back onto it i'm reliving me uh

02:06:52.800 --> 02:06:54.639
getting online shamed this past week

02:06:54.639 --> 02:06:56.480
they were like what's it like they were

02:06:56.480 --> 02:06:58.159
saying i was threatened by women which

02:06:58.159 --> 02:06:59.520
is why i didn't want that's the best

02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:01.199
part it's like dude i'm not threat i'm

02:07:01.199 --> 02:07:02.880
not threatened by there's there's plenty

02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:05.199
of female video games yeah i have no

02:07:05.199 --> 02:07:07.119
problem with that i'm not out here like

02:07:07.119 --> 02:07:08.800
tomb raider that should be a [ __ ] guy

02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:10.880
dude yeah you're not like you don't see

02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:12.239
like that when i when you told me that

02:07:12.239 --> 02:07:14.320
yesterday it's like i've never like seen

02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:15.599
a girl been like

02:07:15.599 --> 02:07:17.679
oh god i gotta go i'm threatened she's

02:07:17.679 --> 02:07:19.840
coming she's coming to take all my power

02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:22.079
exactly power that i have it's crazy

02:07:22.079 --> 02:07:24.079
that's insane yeah yeah and it's also

02:07:24.079 --> 02:07:25.840
like you're if they're the zombies that

02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:27.280
you don't like in the video game you're

02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:29.679
not upset that there are female zombies

02:07:29.679 --> 02:07:31.280
no you're just upset about the zombies

02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:32.639
yeah but see here's another thing here's

02:07:32.639 --> 02:07:34.079
another thing the zombie thing is a

02:07:34.079 --> 02:07:36.719
separate mode than the [ __ ] game

02:07:36.719 --> 02:07:38.560
in this game so it's like here's the

02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:40.560
science fiction version of world war ii

02:07:40.560 --> 02:07:42.480
right which is where the [ __ ] women

02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:44.480
should be right it's like hey here's

02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:46.079
pure fiction about world war ii right

02:07:46.079 --> 02:07:47.760
right but then again again you can punch

02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:48.880
holes in this whole time because then

02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:49.920
it's like you're a world war ii

02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:51.920
character you run around you kill 900

02:07:51.920 --> 02:07:53.679
[ __ ] people oh it's like all right

02:07:53.679 --> 02:07:55.280
well that's ridiculous

02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:57.360
but uh

02:07:57.360 --> 02:07:58.320
still

02:07:58.320 --> 02:07:59.360
yeah let's

02:07:59.360 --> 02:08:00.960
yeah i'm just saying you gotta dude i'm

02:08:00.960 --> 02:08:03.280
telling you i told shane this yesterday

02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:05.119
i'm a big present moment guy dude i'm

02:08:05.119 --> 02:08:06.960
all mindfulness now so yeah i stay in

02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:08.560
the present moment whatever i do put

02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:09.840
those hemorrhoids back down whatever i

02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:11.520

02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:14.639

i'm straight up i'm in my i've been in

02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:18.159

i mean i i aspire to get there i'm

02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:27.360
mentally kind of inhabiting like the

02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:29.440
future or even mostly the future i don't

02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:31.119
really dwell in the past but i'm more of

02:08:31.119 --> 02:08:32.320
like a future head where i'll start

02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:33.920
being like and then this is gonna happen

02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:36.560
and i'm gonna do this and then i just go

02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:38.079

02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:03.840
that again where i'm like laying i'll

02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:05.360

02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:07.679
lost in thought about either like what

02:09:07.679 --> 02:09:08.639
could be

02:09:08.639 --> 02:09:11.040
or you know blah blah and it's just like

02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:12.079

you're going to go at it or you're going

02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:20.320
to do this it's like stop

02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:22.639
yeah yeah stop how about if if we have

02:09:22.639 --> 02:09:24.320
time here and you're comfortable with it

02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:25.840
could you tell us what happened to your

02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:27.199
abs

02:09:27.199 --> 02:09:30.079
why what remember that date you were on

02:09:30.079 --> 02:09:31.360
yeah

02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:33.360
what they remember that girl who was

02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:35.840
like she liked dabs yeah

02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:37.440
oh but no but it turned out to be an

02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:39.599
actual issue i think well no but i think

02:09:39.599 --> 02:09:41.199
the story and then you guys aren't

02:09:41.199 --> 02:09:43.679
together anymore no no all right well i

02:09:43.679 --> 02:09:44.639
thought

02:09:44.639 --> 02:09:46.560
she said she liked absent i did so many

02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:49.040
sit-ups that i i like hurt my stomach

02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:50.560
she said she liked abs so steve went

02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:53.360
home and did ab work for like two weeks

02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:55.440
straight of non-stop ab work

02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:56.880
your abs are looking good though yes and

02:09:56.880 --> 02:09:58.239
then they went out today they went out

02:09:58.239 --> 02:10:01.360
to dinner and he had like stomach cramps

02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:04.239
he couldn't eat so she broke up with it

02:10:04.239 --> 02:10:06.079
yes but i had stomach cramps but then i

02:10:06.079 --> 02:10:07.679
assumed it was like other things so that

02:10:07.679 --> 02:10:09.679
i had a massive panic attack and then i

02:10:09.679 --> 02:10:11.760
was like i can't talk right now you have

02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:14.480
to do the talking it's too loud

02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:16.560
oh that's a missing part of the element

02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:18.239
so you were there like what you were

02:10:18.239 --> 02:10:19.920
just kind of bugging out quietly in

02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:21.679
front of this girl yes yes you can't you

02:10:21.679 --> 02:10:23.119
can't let you can't let your [ __ ] see

02:10:23.119 --> 02:10:24.560
you be weak like that that's what i'm

02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:25.599
saying you're right yeah that's what

02:10:25.599 --> 02:10:26.639
you're doing a lot of these like when

02:10:26.639 --> 02:10:29.679
you touch your chest you're like

02:10:29.679 --> 02:10:30.880
looking at her and she's like are you

02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:33.599
okay and you're precisely like i'm fine

02:10:33.599 --> 02:10:35.199
no i did tell her i was like i feel like

02:10:35.199 --> 02:10:38.079
i can't breathe so uh i'm gonna need you

02:10:38.079 --> 02:10:40.000
to do most of the talking and then i

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:41.760
complained about the noise and then i

02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:42.800

02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:45.119

02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:15.679

02:11:17.599 --> 02:11:19.920
period

02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:22.159

02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:27.040
yeah you know there's a lot of bumpity

02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:29.199
grinding was anybody in their underpants

02:11:29.199 --> 02:11:31.679
well she was what was she doing

02:11:31.679 --> 02:11:34.000
oh you know doing things what i'm sorry

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.840
i'm getting harder so i'm sorry i'll

02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:39.159
stop being successful

02:11:44.719 --> 02:11:46.400
so what kind of underpants they were

02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:47.440
like

02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:49.840
flannel

02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:52.079
dude

02:11:53.679 --> 02:11:55.280
there was a lot like she was doing some

02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:57.599
good stuff like she was working herself

02:11:57.599 --> 02:11:59.360
back yeah yeah yeah and that was really

02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:00.239
nice

02:12:00.239 --> 02:12:02.159
did you have an interaction of course

02:12:02.159 --> 02:12:04.000
yes did you was she touching it no she

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:05.440
wasn't so then i just started beating

off so you just started checking it off

02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:08.320
yeah

02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:10.000
yeah

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:11.199
that's the reason all that because she

02:12:11.199 --> 02:12:12.639
said because she goes oh you're just

02:12:12.639 --> 02:12:14.159
jerking off i was like

02:12:14.159 --> 02:12:15.920

02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:29.040
i would say you gotta you gotta like

02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:30.719

02:14:47.599 --> 02:14:49.119
i uh

02:14:49.119 --> 02:14:50.320

02:17:35.519 --> 02:17:37.439
things going on oh okay

02:17:37.439 --> 02:17:39.120
that's that's that's the old pleasant

02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:40.559
page how the old playbook i know you're

02:17:40.559 --> 02:17:42.399
talking about yeah man but i'll

02:17:42.399 --> 02:17:44.080
definitely think twice of it you see

02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:46.479
this look at this no women here but yet

02:17:46.479 --> 02:17:48.080
i'm i'm

02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:50.240
going to change the way that i sexually

02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:52.080
interact with them well i certainly

02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:52.960
would

02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:55.040
just because it was such a disaster it's

02:17:55.040 --> 02:17:56.479
not a disaster it wasn't a total

02:17:56.479 --> 02:17:58.960
disaster she how hard did you not when

02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:00.240
she left

02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:02.399
well i left once you got some alone time

02:18:02.399 --> 02:18:03.679
it doesn't work like that for me for

02:18:03.679 --> 02:18:05.200
something oh really yeah

02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:06.800
yeah i'm really into the interaction

02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:08.800
like i want like and i think that's what

02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:10.479
comes down to why i would take a peggy

02:18:10.479 --> 02:18:12.559
because it's like if she

02:18:12.559 --> 02:18:14.160
when she really likes it that's what i'm

02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:16.319
like yes i hear you

02:18:16.319 --> 02:18:18.559
