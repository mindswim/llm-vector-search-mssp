carrie von erich we were standing on top

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.159
of a

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.720

one i've now watched i never watched it

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.799
before but i remember him telling me

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.840
about this

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.799
he talked about the fantastic free birds

00:01:58.799 --> 00:01:59.439

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.439
kevin von erick and mike von erich and

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.479
fritz von eric

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.560
it's so funny he told me the story and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.079
this and this story

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.119
just grabbed my attention the way he

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.720
told the story of these matches

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.319
texas stadium 40 000 people

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.560
and i remember picturing the sun dome in

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.680
tampa

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.800
picturing that it happened there it

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.120
happened in texas stadium and 40

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.160
forty one thousand people and he walked

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.760
me through the map he told us all

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.840
about these two matches that i guess he

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.120
must have watched

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.640
on television and he told them so

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.640
engagingly i mean i was like hooked and

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.160
then when he told the ric flair carrie

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
von erick story

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.680
and he talked about the he talked about

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.360
the finish you know he was a real this

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.840
guy

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.000
drew mccall was a friend of mine growing

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.879
up and he's

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.440
recently passed away but he was a legit

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.080
fan of rat like obsessed with wrestling

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.480

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.920
then

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.959

so such obscure things i was trying to

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.360

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:20.800
from him from

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.200
something he said on a podcast like uh

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.160
earlier

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.800
it was i don't know if i ever talked

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.720
about it on my podcast i don't think i

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.519
did

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:31.440
if i did i don't know if i had said

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.640
anything

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.240
i don't remember what i said but all

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.839
i'll say is

00:11:35.839 --> 00:11:37.120
we've all said [ __ ] up stuff on

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.279
podcasts the i mean

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:40.560
it really makes it to the point where

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.480
you're like just the lesson is don't try

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.760
to get on snl

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.959
that's a [ __ ] up thing you know don't

00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:48.399
go for your dreams everybody if you've

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:50.000
ever been on a podcast like i have

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.279
for the [ __ ] past 10 years and spoken

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:56.079
thousands upon thousands upon thousands

00:11:56.079 --> 00:11:56.320
of

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.200
hours of [ __ ] half of which have

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.160
been drunk

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.200
half of which have been high i mean

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.440
god and and there will be stuff to sell

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.720
on this podcast so

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.760
taken out of context does not represent

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.000
me

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.720
to my fullest i'm certain of it um but

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.120
what

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.760
regardless

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.440
for those you that don't know

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.600
let me track back so shane was a part

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.480
of that obviously more importantly what

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.279
happened is

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:31.120
ari drugged big j ogresson imagining

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.560
that you as a fan can can understand

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.600
that i

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.240
have a dog in that fight when i heard

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.120
that happened

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.600
i had to watch it i bought the legion of

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.560
skanks

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.920
membership so i could watch it

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.560
immediately i was in my hotel room

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.000
already talked to me about it i talked

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
to big j about it and it was

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.040
interesting because obviously

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.519
i was drugged by ari i never released

00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:56.720
that podcast

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.120
i never released it for a number of

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.519
reasons

00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:03.600
mainly of which i didn't want to reward

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.440
that behavior i didn't want

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.079
to be celebrating something that i had

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:10.480
feelings about

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.959
adversely the second i find out big j

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:13.920
has been roofied

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.240
the first thing i do is run to that

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.120
podcast

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.480
and i will tell you it is

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.560
amazing content it is

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.720
riveting it is

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.560
[ __ ] i'm i'm i

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.360
i think i i called some people and i

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.959
facetimed them and i watched it with

00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:38.240
them

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.160
and i'll tell you why it's a little

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.560
different

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:45.839
than my uh drugging number one mine was

00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:47.199
molly

00:13:47.199 --> 00:13:50.880
jace jay got slipped lsd which

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.800
is we're fighting just so you know we're

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.639
fighting if you put lsd in my [ __ ]

00:13:54.639 --> 00:13:55.360
drink

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.480
i definitely don't want molly i i it's

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.279
amazing the

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:01.279
perspective i've come back with i'm very

00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:02.560
grateful that already slipped me molly

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.920
and not lsd

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.120
very very very grateful very grateful

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.000
uh lsd is an eight to ten hour trip i

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.440
would not have had the

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.040
wherewithal to be able to get on an

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.800
airplane on lsd

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.399
or got on an airplane on mali and was

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:21.440
less than thrilled about it uh but what

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.160
happened was

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.760
is lewis tried to slip lsd to ari

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.040
ari found out via our guest today

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.160
shane gillis and then

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.360
ari switched glasses with big j

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.320
and then pretended like he was on lsd

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.720
and then throughout the entire podcast

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.959
and this is why this is so riveting

00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:44.240
louis j gomez

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.519
is nodding on to people letting them

00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:48.240
know

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.279
he slipped arie lsd and arya's acting as

00:14:51.279 --> 00:14:53.279
if he's been slipped lsd

00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:55.360
and at the end during this election

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.480
lewis says ari says he stands for chaos

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.839
i stand for chaos ari you're on lsd

00:15:01.839 --> 00:15:03.600
i slipped it for i slipped to you about

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.199
an hour and a half ago

00:15:05.199 --> 00:15:06.800
it's really strong i'll see i did this

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.320
for burke chrysler and

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.199
ari laughs and takes the hit and then

00:15:11.199 --> 00:15:12.000
says do you

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.279
really think i'm that stupid j is on lsd

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:18.399
it is so [ __ ] fascinating and

00:15:18.399 --> 00:15:20.240
riveting

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.000
and heartbreaking because big j

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.440
is a innocent bystander in all of this

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.839
he didn't want ari to be slipped to lsd

00:15:29.839 --> 00:15:33.040
and then big j got slipped lsd

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.519
we did this podcast the morning after

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:36.720
that whole event

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.079
and so i talked to shane about that

00:15:38.079 --> 00:15:39.920
right up front that's what we talk about

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.680
a lot of and shane has

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.480
shane is very torn because he feels like

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.079
he betrayed jay

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:48.160
jay was good to him we talk about that

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.199
right up front

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:53.199
we talk a little bit about um

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:56.560
about uh the snl

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.600
firing and saying stuff and and then we

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.279
also talk in that and this is how this

00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:02.480
whole thing started is

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.320
we were on our tour bus by the way uh

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.079
hot summer night's tour is back

00:16:06.079 --> 00:16:08.800
out on the road we are going i should

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.240
have said this earlier

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.440
i'll say this right before i announce

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.199
his name um because i know you'll listen

00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:14.079
to that part

00:16:14.079 --> 00:16:18.000
but we were on tour and my cousin andrew

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
was like yo

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
have you seen shane gillis's special

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.839
olympics joke and i was like no and he

00:16:23.839 --> 00:16:25.360
goes it's actually a really [ __ ]

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.320
great joke

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.920
and you're like really you know

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.920
obviously special olympics

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.639
subject matters is tough to cover

00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:33.759
because it's you know it's pretty

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:34.959
volatile i've had friends that have

00:16:34.959 --> 00:16:36.639
gotten in trouble for it

00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:38.000
but we played it and it's a really

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.560
[ __ ] funny goddamn funny [ __ ] joke

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.000
really insightful

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.199
i would say sensitive it's not

00:16:45.199 --> 00:16:46.560
triggering or whatever i'm so

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.120
uncomfortable on this couch um

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.399
it was a good [ __ ] joke and then we

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:51.360
started listening to a bunch of his

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.199
material and we started laughing hard as

00:16:53.199 --> 00:16:54.959
[ __ ] and i was like you know what man

00:16:54.959 --> 00:16:56.800
you know everyone loves a good [ __ ]

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.279
underdog story a good comeback in our

00:16:59.279 --> 00:16:59.920
business

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.480
a comeback story is amazing and this is

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.720
a guy that kind of got

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.679
thrown to the woke mob it wasn't it was

00:17:07.679 --> 00:17:09.199
not the most hateful thing you could

00:17:09.199 --> 00:17:10.079
ever think to say

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.400
i didn't think i don't remem i i mean my

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.319
recollection it's been a while

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:16.240
um and i think he got thrown to the woke

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.000
mob because it was snl

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.839
and he took the hit and he took it a

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:21.360
really hard way and got the moniker of

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.640
being racist when

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.039
in fact he is not he's just a regular

00:17:25.039 --> 00:17:25.760
dude

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.160
who said some off-color [ __ ] him and his

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.600
buddy laughed and didn't think anyone

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.480
would hear about it

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.520
and then it did get heard of and and

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.160
and and and here he is and and i think

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.200
i'll tell you right now

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.520
i know shane is a good guy i've worked

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.400
with him before

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.520
he's a sweet dude he is a very very

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.799
talented comedian

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:48.640
a very talented comedian and uh

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.440

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.640
awesome redemption

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.960

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.880
years 10 years who knows how long he's

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.679
been doing it

00:17:57.679 --> 00:17:59.600
but when he's i hope when he's 47 he has

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.760
a [ __ ] amazing career that he's very

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.600
proud of and people look back and go

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.960

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.360
so silly so stupid it was dumb and he

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.480

i i would love to hear it from your

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.400
perspective from how

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.440
it started off because that is what

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.840
because i spent the whole show waiting

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:38.640
to find out

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.480
when you whispered to him that he was

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.919
being dosed

00:22:41.919 --> 00:22:44.960
i well i whispered all right all right

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.240
so i get there everybody was going down

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.559
to the stand with the intention of

00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:52.559
getting [ __ ] up like derosa on the way

00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:54.640
there he called me and was like

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.240
norman's coming we're all gonna get like

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.240
it was just like we all

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.280
you know it's one of those nights where

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.360
everybody kind of had the idea of we're

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.440
gonna get this is gonna be an ugly night

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.600
and uh so it was fun it was rowdy it was

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.120
a very fun night

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.679
um but when i got there i saw this it

00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:11.840
was all you know i saw a guy hand lsd to

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.640
lewis i was like jesus christ dude

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.159
this is i've never done it i was like

00:23:16.159 --> 00:23:19.360
this is a little wild and uh

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.720
then louis louis like louis is an idiot

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.240
so he was he looked at me and was like

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.840
i'm gonna dose ari don't tell him

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.480
and i was like oh okay i won't tell him

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:32.880
and i

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.480
immediately walked over and told him i

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.799
was like yeah louis is going to try to

00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:37.840
dose you

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.240
uh so this is before arya sat down this

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.120
is before the show

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.320
yeah it was right into the important

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.679
note that ari and your platform

00:23:45.679 --> 00:23:48.159
was for this we're talking so this is

00:23:48.159 --> 00:23:50.159
the day they're running for legion of

00:23:50.159 --> 00:23:51.600
skanks president

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.640
and aryan your platform was mayhem you

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.039
will

00:23:55.039 --> 00:23:58.000
incite mayhem or he dresses the joker

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.080
you i will bring mayhem there is no

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.039
order and i think if you know ari he

00:24:03.039 --> 00:24:05.600
loves mayhem he loves he does love chaos

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.200
i sometimes think he likes chaos more

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.640
than he likes comedy to be honest with

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.480
you

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.600
that's you know what i don't know

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.640
anybody would much rather your name on

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.000
zach d'amico

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.159
then go up into a set i think yeah yeah

00:24:20.159 --> 00:24:22.400
yeah

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.159
yeah that worries me that was this is a

00:24:26.159 --> 00:24:29.200
shaky alliance dude obsession with chaos

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:29.760
is

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.480
what's that or is i was worried the

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.799
whole time i asked

00:24:34.799 --> 00:24:37.360
okay okay so so you know ari's getting

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.640
dosed

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.480
yeah hold on hold on hold on my

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.640
connection isn't stable give me a second

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.480
also be good

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.440
okay so you know ari's getting dosed so

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.360
you go up to re and tell him

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.200
tell him he's getting dosed i mean with

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.360
the plan of obviously giving it back to

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.480
lewis

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.960
like sneaking it back to lewis dosing

00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.760
lewis

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.480
but uh while we're sitting there i see

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.240
it i see the cup of beer i didn't know

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.440
when it was going to happen or where it

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.640
was going to happen right when i sit

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.360
down

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.919
ari like kind of points to his beer and

00:25:09.919 --> 00:25:11.440
there's a tab of acid just

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.679
sitting on in the foam and i was like

00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:15.120
all right that's the one

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.600
and then uh here's where it got sad

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.640
because jay

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.159
jay's been having a rough week or two

00:25:22.159 --> 00:25:25.760
you know i got yanked off stage

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.880
that story in and of itself the fact

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.799
that the guy who yanked him off

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:36.559
his dad was like my son's a piece of

00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:39.279
[ __ ] [ __ ] bipolar alcoholic

00:25:39.279 --> 00:25:41.520
i'm a legionist gangster do or die

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.440
[ __ ] go mites go my skull mites and

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.200
you're like

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.440
jesus people yeah these are the worst

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.120
people

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.279
so he pulls him on stage they're the

00:25:51.279 --> 00:25:52.720
worst dude

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.600
it's like yeah but they're also the

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:56.159
funniest

00:25:56.159 --> 00:25:59.360
so he pulls jay off stage and jay lands

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.000
on him

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.640
and i mean hilarious and then lewis

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.080
comes out and beats him up so lewis gets

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.000
all the credit lewis is the hero jay's a

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.520
victim so it's kind of it's a shitty

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.400
look for jay

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.679
that sucks uh especially because lewis

00:26:11.679 --> 00:26:13.360
then was like yeah i'm the best

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.960
like but uh so then uh

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.799
the [ __ ] jay is talking last week and

00:26:20.799 --> 00:26:21.840
louis ruins the

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.960
76ers game for him that he was recording

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.000
uh just a pretty consistent level of

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.440
l's over and over again and then he got

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.559
last place in the

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:35.600
election he got 10

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.000
of the vote which is crazy i mean he got

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:38.640
like

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.240
you get like people like it was almost

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.520
like actively disliked him

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.919
yeah and by the way so poorly we should

00:26:45.919 --> 00:26:47.440
be we should be very clear to anyone

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.559
listening to this

00:26:48.559 --> 00:26:52.080
i am i am good friends with louis jay

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.760

coming brand new to the podcast and

00:27:04.799 --> 00:27:05.919
hearing this for the first time being

00:27:05.919 --> 00:27:06.400
like

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.039
what you can actually say what kind of

00:27:09.039 --> 00:27:10.880
animals are these but we love these

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.400
animals like that's part of the beauty

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.279
of it

00:27:13.279 --> 00:27:15.600
yeah i mean the story i'm i'm kind of

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.200
the bad guy in the story here

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.399
so you're you do not by the way you do

00:27:20.399 --> 00:27:21.520
not come out the bad guy

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:25.200
i've watched this you're hand rubbed

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.799
like a oh no

00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:30.080
is he is i dude

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.440
all right so i sit down jay loses and he

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.679
gets up to give his concession speech

00:27:35.679 --> 00:27:38.720
which is so funny such a funny time

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.120
to dose him so he's up in front of

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.960
everybody accepting his loss

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.840
and then i just watch ari put that cup

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.120
right in front of jay and i was just

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.399
like oh

00:27:48.399 --> 00:27:52.480
dude not jay this is not the guy

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.039
but yeah i had to i don't know i had to

00:27:55.039 --> 00:27:56.480
go with it

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.919
and then uh yeah i mean i was conflicted

00:27:59.919 --> 00:28:01.600
but

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.880
it had to be done it it

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.679
in you know

00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:11.360
it's crazy because i i will say you know

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.880
obviously everyone knows i was dosed by

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.480
ari um

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.799
the feeling is jay and i had a lot in

00:28:16.799 --> 00:28:18.320
common talking on the phone yesterday

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.760
a day about feelings of how you

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.559
feel when it happens to you and why it's

00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:24.960
you

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.279
why they picked you and and i think

00:28:27.279 --> 00:28:28.640
ari's defense is

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.799
it was whoever was closest to me at that

00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:33.200
time it was going to be whoever was

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.080
closest to me yeah and i think and i

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.320
think our ari also looks at dosing

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.679
people as like

00:28:39.679 --> 00:28:42.080
a good time like it's like that's the

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.279
fun of being

00:28:43.279 --> 00:28:45.760
a comic i know joe celebrates it like

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:46.720

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.399
there's also a part of me and i've been

00:29:56.399 --> 00:29:57.919
wrong about this so literally everybody

00:29:57.919 --> 00:29:59.440
i've talked to where i was like

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.559
if i was the one who got dosed i think

00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:04.080
i'd be like

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.840
okay with it and that that was funny but

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:08.399
everybody

00:30:08.399 --> 00:30:09.600
literally every single person i've

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.960
talked to have been like oh no i'd be

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:11.679
furious

i know you're serious everybody

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.880
everyone's gonna be furious and i'll

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.520
tell you why

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.960
yeah because it it it reaches

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.679
it's far further reaching than just a

00:30:21.679 --> 00:30:22.720
prank

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:26.000

it [ __ ]

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.240
it really did [ __ ] with me and ari's

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.320
friendship where

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.080
we had i i had to make a concerted

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:44.559
effort

00:30:44.559 --> 00:30:46.880
effort to forgive him where i didn't i

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.640

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:13.679
thread

00:31:13.679 --> 00:31:15.679
where we didn't include ari i think we

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.799

i'm defending ari to my daughter and

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.600
it's such a

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.399
[ __ ] up situation to be in that but

00:32:30.399 --> 00:32:32.320

sitting outside and somebody just went

00:33:52.399 --> 00:33:53.120
like this

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.640
like in front of my face while we were

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.240

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.880
and i was like oh [ __ ] i forgot about

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.440
so i text ari and i'm because he was

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.840

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:12.079
you feeling this and he was like no i'm

00:34:12.079 --> 00:34:13.760
fine and then a minute later he was like

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:17.119
oh never mind yeah it's it's very strong

00:34:17.119 --> 00:34:19.599
and uh it was it yeah it was pretty

00:34:19.599 --> 00:34:20.879
strong

00:34:20.879 --> 00:34:23.040
yeah i told jay i said go through uh

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.159
because he's like yo i got a lot of

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:24.879
feelings i said

00:34:24.879 --> 00:34:26.159
i said hold on to your feelings hold on

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:28.000
your feelings hold on to your thoughts

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.520
don't share them with anyone

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.839
because because that was the biggest

00:34:31.839 --> 00:34:32.800
mistake i did was

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.000
the biggest mistake i've ever done is

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.240
ever just go and be a hundred percent

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.560
candid on [ __ ] podcasts

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.359
it's my it's i regret it i regretted it

00:34:41.359 --> 00:34:42.240
a hundred percent

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:45.200
all the time but i it is who i am i

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:45.760
guess i

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:46.879
you know i don't know another way to

00:34:46.879 --> 00:34:48.879
operate but um what

00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:51.599
you just said is exactly what jay needs

00:34:51.599 --> 00:34:53.359
to know is that like

00:34:53.359 --> 00:34:56.079
you're not just like like yo man get

00:34:56.079 --> 00:34:56.879
over it

00:34:56.879 --> 00:34:58.640
like that's no see that that's that's

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.079
what i think

00:35:00.079 --> 00:35:02.240
really angered me was yo bird get over

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.280
it and i was like

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.640
hey look i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm an

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.320
adult i'm allowed to have feelings and

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.839
that's what's [ __ ] up about

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:10.560
when you talk about the group that we're

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:10.880
in

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.640
the group of guys that comics that we

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:16.400
hang with which has been maybe

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.800
rightfully blamed at times being toxic

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.839
masculinity

00:35:19.839 --> 00:35:23.280
but but is is that yo man get over it

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.240
is what's wrong with what's wrong with

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:26.720
us

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.760
in general you know yeah yeah yeah for

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.880
sure

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.000
uh yeah and jay like

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.839
i don't know it's it's obviously it's

00:35:35.839 --> 00:35:37.599
not for me to ever say like

00:35:37.599 --> 00:35:39.680
oh come on it's like dude he's never

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.320
done that drug and then he

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.599
he it's like raped dude he was like what

00:35:45.599 --> 00:35:47.760
he's like are you someone took advantage

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.599
of me what it was just like yeah your

00:35:49.599 --> 00:35:51.280
closest friends

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:56.480
anyway yeah yeah but go ahead

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.760
it was funny so

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:03.040
i'll tell you what that's where i'm if

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.359
if i didn't know

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.200
if i didn't know first of all if i

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.240
didn't know i probably wouldn't watch

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.359
the whole podcast

00:36:11.359 --> 00:36:13.119
i would have been like get to the

00:36:13.119 --> 00:36:15.520
election results two hours

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:19.119
but man knowing what i knew it was one

00:36:19.119 --> 00:36:20.560
of the most riveting things i've ever

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.200
seen

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:25.599
to watch ari to watch ari first of all

00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:28.880
plot he plotted for a solid 45 minutes

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:29.760
hour

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.520
and then once he struck to watch him

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:37.200
act for another hour to act

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.920
like he had gotten dosed so then to

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.320
watch

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.359
lewis to watch you was fascinating

00:36:43.359 --> 00:36:45.440
because you are the only one in on it

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.560

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:49.839
sides of the fence yeah to watch louis

00:36:49.839 --> 00:36:52.320
do these little nods like yeah i got him

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.240
i [ __ ] got him

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.359
i got him man i got him and then to

00:36:57.359 --> 00:36:57.920
watch

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:01.760
louis with all the bluster and

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.280
confidence of the puerto rican

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.800
rattlesnake

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.200
declare you want i'm not going to ruin

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.240
it for everyone

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.599
but the real because i want people to

00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:12.560
watch it the reveal

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.680
was i mean like

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.560
i facetimed i facetimed people last

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.079
night and watched it with them like it

00:37:20.079 --> 00:37:22.160
was like it's crazy

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.599
it really is crazy it really is crazy

00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:26.640
and that is what

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.720
network television will never allow that

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.839
like that that no

00:37:29.839 --> 00:37:32.960
that is one of that is the

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.920
law yeah that was illegal i don't know

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.000
that was very illegal

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.800
that was a crime

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:42.990
i mean i feel like you know

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:44.720
[Music]

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.880
you know what i thought was like as i

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.119
was watching it i was like

00:37:49.119 --> 00:37:51.359
you get you're such a nice guy and you

00:37:51.359 --> 00:37:53.440
get put in bad guys situations where

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.720
you're not a bad guy you're just

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.000
standing you're just in the right you're

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.040
in the wrong place

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.880
at the wrong time does that make sense

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:02.000
yeah i've been in a couple of those yeah

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.680
yeah i've been a couple situations where

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.320
i you know wrong place wrong time type

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.160
deal

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.400
uh but well that's the and here's what

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.000
sucks the most for me

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.119
is jay and christine have helped me out

00:38:15.119 --> 00:38:16.880
they've always helped me out they were

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.760
like they like brought me into the group

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.079
you know yeah i'm the i'm the new guy in

00:38:22.079 --> 00:38:26.240
the group and then to betray jay who's

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:29.200
yeah that's like a real [ __ ] up move

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.160
for like me to

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.079
jump in and be like yeah [ __ ] you and

00:38:32.079 --> 00:38:34.320
you know he brought me in

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:38.079
it's a hard call on your spot because

00:38:38.079 --> 00:38:39.680
it's it is a hard call because you

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:41.839
aren't the one doing it you aren't the

00:38:41.839 --> 00:38:45.359
you aren't the one doing it yeah it's

00:38:45.359 --> 00:38:46.320
it's it's a

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.079
and and then i don't know it's it's a

00:38:48.079 --> 00:38:49.520
tough spot all i know is that being in

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.720
jay's shoes

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.200
all he wants to hear is like not people

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.040
who say get over it that's all

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.320
yeah he wants people to go like hey man

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.160
if you're mad i get it

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:01.920
you know ari did i have to defend ari in

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.320
in my situation is he did do the right

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.760
thing and he gave me space and he

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.680
texted me he texted me every single day

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.280
and was like hey i don't want to ruin

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.560
our friendship over this

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.240
and in my head i was like in my wife's

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.680
my head she was like uh

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.599
it should definitely be ruined but in my

00:39:15.599 --> 00:39:16.800
head i was like

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.800
i was like it's not ruined i just don't

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.640
want to fix it right now like i don't

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:21.040
care

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.160
yeah to fix it now like i do want to fix

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:26.079
it i do love ari i do i

00:39:26.079 --> 00:39:27.680
talked to him for an hour yesterday

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.119
walking in this parking lot

00:39:29.119 --> 00:39:31.839
and and yeah there are redeemable i do

00:39:31.839 --> 00:39:32.640
think

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.800
that this behavior will catch up with

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.320
him and i want i wish i could be a

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.079
friend to him and say

00:39:38.079 --> 00:39:40.480
stop this is going to come back in a

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.960
really bad way like you can't

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.000
steal that much from the karma plate and

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.839
never get bit

00:39:47.839 --> 00:39:50.800
yeah i guess he's been bit ultimately

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.400
with the kobe stuff and like

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.359
you know death threats and doxings and

00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:56.960
yeah

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.800
i guess you know i guess he you know his

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.280
thing is is he loves chaos he loves that

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:01.760
[ __ ]

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.680
and you know i think my thing and i do

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.800
think it's your thing and

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.839
well and this is what i think this

00:40:07.839 --> 00:40:09.599
by default definitely probably jay's

00:40:09.599 --> 00:40:11.440
thing

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.480
i don't know if it's lewis's thing

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:17.280
i don't know if it's actually something

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:17.520
and

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.760
it's lewis's but no but i mean nobody

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.280
know what i'm when i'm when i say this i

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:21.920
mean

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.079
me and jay's thing and i will say your

00:40:24.079 --> 00:40:26.079
thing is i would rather sit at a table

00:40:26.079 --> 00:40:26.800
and just

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.680
find a way to giggle than the antics of

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.920
dosing people like the dosing part

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.319
i could get i could give two [ __ ] about

00:40:34.319 --> 00:40:35.680
like that's what really bothered me

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.319
about me

00:40:36.319 --> 00:40:38.960
already dosing me and said i had a great

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.560
[ __ ] podcast with him

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:43.920
like we had a great great podcast it was

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:47.200
funny as [ __ ] we were laughing and then

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.119
once i found out i was dosed it was no

00:40:49.119 --> 00:40:50.480
longer fun for me

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.800
and so i know jay's feeling is we had a

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.079
great [ __ ] show

00:40:54.079 --> 00:40:58.480
now granted i will say it was um

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.960
it's pretty enhanced it's and it

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.400
definitely is enhanced

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.480
but i think the the argument could be

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.839
you know lewis and ari

00:41:05.839 --> 00:41:09.280
love that [ __ ] second someone you know

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.960
takes a fake dick out and someone sucks

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.640
it that's the [ __ ]

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.599
take it further it's like you know yeah

00:41:15.599 --> 00:41:16.319
i

00:41:16.319 --> 00:41:18.720
yeah i agree and that's i totally agree

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:19.760
it's

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.520
their thing it's like pro wrestling that

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.680
show where it's like this is crazy this

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.119
is [ __ ] crazy oh [ __ ] they're going

00:41:25.119 --> 00:41:26.800
to do this they're going to do this

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.040
so i mean it's fun it's fun to be a part

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.240
of i don't know if i could do it every

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.760
week

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:34.400

and and but yeah you can be from the

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.680
outside looking in going

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.599
as especially as a professional comedian

00:41:55.599 --> 00:41:56.880
like this is

00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.000
[ __ ] insane i can't believe there's

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.520

milkshake these [ __ ] like that

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.280

00:42:13.839 --> 00:42:16.319

care about at all cancer culture

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:52.160
or corporate do you feel do you feel

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.119
like you'll ever

00:42:53.119 --> 00:42:55.119
find a way back into corporate comedy

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.040
like for the most part i'm very

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.640
confident about it and then every once

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.319
while i'll have enough of a hangover to

00:44:00.319 --> 00:44:01.280

and he's like ah you'll be all right so

00:44:13.599 --> 00:44:15.280
i mean the doubt creeps in

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.400
for sure but you're just you're just

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.400
putting in i mean

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.240
it's interesting that special olympics

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.000
joke has the teeth

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.920
that that that like good comedy has

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.839
but it's not hurtful and hateful it's

00:44:29.839 --> 00:44:30.960
not like a

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.560
hateful joke and and it comes from a

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:34.480
place of of working

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.520
i don't want to ruin the joke i want

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.000
people to hear it yeah but it really is

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.520
and it's an insightful it's an

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.119
insightful perception as a comic it

00:44:41.119 --> 00:44:42.079
really it

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:43.520
i saw and then and then all of a sudden

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.839

in you say you say things in a sports me

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.240
in a sports rhythm sometimes that makes

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:57.119
sense yeah of course

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:04.560
the year

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:47.440
uh it's embarrassing to quit but it's

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:49.520
the easiest thing in the world to quit

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.720
because it's like all

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.079
yeah i mean it's [ __ ] boot camp and

00:51:52.079 --> 00:51:53.440
all you have to do is say yeah i'd

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.040
rather go home

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.040
and i mean they make it difficult for

00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:59.119
you to quit they try to keep you

00:51:59.119 --> 00:52:00.880
they like you you got to interview every

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:03.599
single person

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:06.640
is it camp like army boot camp like like

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.400
do they shave your head like what what

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:08.960
is it i don't

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.640
know it's realizing no frame of

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.680
reference for any i don't even know

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.119
where west point is

00:52:13.119 --> 00:52:15.280
west point's uh it's a little north of

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:16.880
new york city like an hour north

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:19.280
it's the united states military academy

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.720
it's

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.640
it's an officer training school so it's

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:24.880
it's purely yes it's the army

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.599
it's the like it's boot camp now it's a

00:52:27.599 --> 00:52:29.599
little softer it's a little easier

00:52:29.599 --> 00:52:31.280
because it's for officers it's for dorks

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:33.200
it's for kids who got like

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.040
really really good sat scores you have

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:37.040
to be smart you got to get like a

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:39.040
congressman to recommend you for the

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:40.800
school like it's it's a very elite

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:41.920
school

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:44.960
and uh so i mean like it wasn't that

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:46.559
physically demanding now granted i was

00:52:46.559 --> 00:52:48.000
like 300 pounds i was playing

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.160
offensive line so boot camp's hard when

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:51.440
you're a big guy

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:54.480
but you can just not do [ __ ] and they're

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.960
like all right

00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:00.319

00:53:00.319 --> 00:53:01.599
just be like all right i'm gonna walk

00:53:01.599 --> 00:53:02.319
this stretch

00:53:02.319 --> 00:53:04.030
they just feel like all right fine

00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:06.160
[Music]

i couldn't do it anymore

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:17.599
just laying there

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.200

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:20.720
about

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:22.559
i would feel very guilty about it

00:55:22.559 --> 00:55:23.760

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:28.480

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:10.640
oh [ __ ] dude

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:14.000
i really just betrayed like one of my

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.839
mentors like this guy helped me

00:56:18.079 --> 00:56:20.720
yeah that was a tough one that hurt he

00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:21.359
literally like

00:56:21.359 --> 00:56:23.599
child like are we safe because jay's

00:56:23.599 --> 00:56:26.559
such a [ __ ] he's like a sweet guy

00:56:26.559 --> 00:56:29.599
he's the sweetest nicest dude and he

00:56:29.599 --> 00:56:31.920
when he said are we safe i was just like

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:33.359
oh [ __ ]

00:56:33.359 --> 00:56:36.160
just like hurt me this hurt by but then

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:38.000
i watched him tell

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.920
a tell like we were all laughing and he

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:41.599
told a telling to tell was like

00:56:41.599 --> 00:56:44.880
no he just i did he just said no

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:47.920
and i was like yeah that makes sense now

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:48.400
i'm

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.160
thinking yeah no no makes sense in that

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.440
situation

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:53.680
yeah what's somebody once there's like a

00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:55.119
you know a 50 year old

00:56:55.119 --> 00:56:58.160
six-year-old guy being like no

00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:01.200
what are you doing yeah i always

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.839
wondered i've always wondered uh you

00:57:03.839 --> 00:57:04.799
know people

00:57:04.799 --> 00:57:07.040
women let me phrase that because that's

00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:08.000
going to come out wrong

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.599
the internet makes it sound like sexual

00:57:09.599 --> 00:57:11.280
assault happens

00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:15.280
so often and i will say in my 47 years

00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:17.680
that no the by the way you went back to

00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:20.720
the drawing board on that one

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:26.720
let me let me rephrase this

00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:29.680
i'm [ __ ] god damn it maybe it's you

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:30.400
shane

00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.079
maybe it's you maybe you bring this to

00:57:32.079 --> 00:57:34.640
the people

00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:38.559
the the what i was gonna say is it makes

00:57:38.559 --> 00:57:40.160
it sound like guys joke

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.160
like hey i raped that girl and then guys

00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:43.440
laugh and like that's

00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:46.640
the common thing and i will say i i i've

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:49.200
often thought in college i thought how

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:51.440
would i react if one of my friends

00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:53.119
told me they raped somebody i've never

00:57:53.119 --> 00:57:55.040
heard anyone ever

00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:57.200
ever share a story that even sounded

00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:58.400
sketchy i mean

00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:00.559
even when i've called out people where

00:58:00.559 --> 00:58:01.680
i've been like

00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:03.520
i've called people out and said that

00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:04.960
sounds sketchy

00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:07.200
it was always two black dudes running a

00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:08.640
train on a girl and i was and they were

00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:09.359
like dude

00:58:09.359 --> 00:58:11.520
it's cool and i'm like i don't find that

00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:12.480
cool i

00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:15.920
find trains to be sexual assault

00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:17.520
personally i can't imagine there's a

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:19.440
woman that's like no no that's what i

00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:19.920
want

00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:21.599
two dudes just [ __ ] my mouth and my

00:58:21.599 --> 00:58:24.160
ass and then high-fiving each other

00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:25.680
i can't imagine there are women i guess

00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:27.520
there's women out there that love it

00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.680
i think there's yeah some women don't

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:31.680
like it

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:34.079
um i can't imagine my wife would like it

00:58:34.079 --> 00:58:36.480
it happens to a lot of sports teams

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:37.920
a lot of college football teams get in

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.760
trouble with that yeah and so

00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:42.720
the girl does yeah never mind but no but

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:44.240
i i say i said uh

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:47.359
jesus i was i always thought how i react

00:58:47.359 --> 00:58:48.400
when that happened

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.000
and then when someone told me that two

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.680
guys told me they had ran a train on a

00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:52.160
girl

00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:53.920
i was a young i was a young comic in new

00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:56.319
york and i didn't i didn't speak up and

00:58:56.319 --> 00:58:57.839
i was very bothered by that

00:58:57.839 --> 00:59:00.079
and but by the way everyone was laughing

00:59:00.079 --> 00:59:01.440
about it and i was like i was like

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.720
listening and i was like

00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:03.839
i should say something and then i'm like

00:59:03.839 --> 00:59:05.599
where am i where did my words go to say

00:59:05.599 --> 00:59:07.839
that when you were 32 i was 26

00:59:07.839 --> 00:59:09.520
and then you're like it is a weird place

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:11.280
to put a young man in is where you're

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:11.839
like i

00:59:11.839 --> 00:59:13.839
wanted to speak up and go that sounds

00:59:13.839 --> 00:59:15.119
like it

00:59:15.119 --> 00:59:17.200
and by the way they said she was into it

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:18.160
from all accounts

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:20.079
there are women that are into it i think

00:59:20.079 --> 00:59:21.280
if i had spoken up i probably would have

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:23.280
looked yeah there are [ __ ]

00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:27.040
there i guess so there are [ __ ]

00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:30.480
there are there are

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:33.200
there are women who i really can't i

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.400
mean i understand

00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.880
is an old patrice joke uh just so you

00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:37.760

he's like there's a big difference but

00:59:46.559 --> 00:59:48.160
it's cool to watch on the internet

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:50.559
sometimes so i can't shave him

00:59:50.559 --> 00:59:52.319
i can't but you know what i think i

00:59:52.319 --> 00:59:53.920

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.310
about sexual assault

01:00:38.310 --> 01:00:39.760
[Laughter]

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.920

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.000

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:48.880
up

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.040
right that's right it's like it's

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.079
amazing that

01:00:52.079 --> 01:00:54.160
they can take anything out of context on

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.280
a podcast now

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.920
and make it sound like and by the way me

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.839
and segura did a bit where we said

01:00:59.839 --> 01:01:01.359
it was called take it out of context and

01:01:01.359 --> 01:01:03.200
we just said horrific

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:06.160
things that we had no attachment to back

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:07.520
and forth to each other

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.440
and i know one day one of those is gonna

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.680
come up and be like yeah they said that

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:12.720
we're gonna have to be like yeah it was

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:15.359
a bit and no yeah luckily

01:01:15.359 --> 01:01:17.040
here's the thing you guys have enough

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.680
fans and you've put out work

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.079
so it'll be tough to cancel it'll be

01:01:22.079 --> 01:01:24.000
tough to cancel you guys

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
um i had nothing i had no

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
stand up out nobody still nobody's

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.760
really ever seen me do stand up

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.240
and so nobody knows if i'm funny or not

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.920
so then when a clip like that comes out

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.040
everybody's just like

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.799
oh that guy just sucks he's like an edge

01:01:38.799 --> 01:01:40.880
lord who sucks

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.599
and you know that's what happens so when

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:44.480
they take it out con

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.079
like all of a sudden people were acting

01:01:46.079 --> 01:01:47.839
like that was my material

01:01:47.839 --> 01:01:50.960
like where they were like yeah it's just

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.000
not funny it's like

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.680
yeah i'm not saying it was the greatest

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.839
thing ever it was in the i i was a

01:01:55.839 --> 01:01:58.400
average [ __ ] conversational joke

01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:59.760
during a podcast

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.880
like it wasn't some genius bit that i

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:03.760
worked on that

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:07.119
[ __ ] up anyway no it's

01:02:07.119 --> 01:02:09.119
it would be all right it was two it was

01:02:09.119 --> 01:02:11.359
two guys [ __ ] around on a podcast

01:02:11.359 --> 01:02:13.359
i listened to the podcast after it came

01:02:13.359 --> 01:02:14.480
out i listened to it

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:17.039
and i was like it's just it's just too

01:02:17.039 --> 01:02:17.520
it's

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:20.000
it what like it wasn't it definitely was

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.039
not a thought out bit

01:02:21.039 --> 01:02:23.280
and and and it was like just [ __ ]

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.039
around and by the way

01:02:25.039 --> 01:02:26.160
if they could do that with any of us

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.400
they go through there's i

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:29.520
i was saying you know i don't know how

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.760
much [ __ ] i've laughed at

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:35.119
that is now horrific you know where you

01:02:35.119 --> 01:02:35.680
go

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.079
nine years ago someone said something

01:02:38.079 --> 01:02:40.319
off color on a podcast that's really

01:02:40.319 --> 01:02:41.839
aggressive and i laughed at and then

01:02:41.839 --> 01:02:43.680
you're just like hey man just you know

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:45.440
like that's a hate crime you laughed at

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.520
you're like i didn't hear it that way at

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.839
the time

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.000
yeah i don't know i mean i'm working on

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.760
it but i don't think

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:57.119
i give a [ __ ] it takes a lot

01:02:57.119 --> 01:03:00.160
to not care really but i

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.680
especially when you were like when i was

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.839
just i was just so close

01:03:03.839 --> 01:03:07.520
to things being pretty [ __ ] cool but

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.960
and it's gonna be harder it's a lot

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:12.319
harder to not give a [ __ ] about like

01:03:12.319 --> 01:03:14.400
getting canceled and all that [ __ ]

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.760
because they do hurt like you

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.480
you i read comments and like articles

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.000
that are like

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.799
racist guy and it's like ah that [ __ ]

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:23.359
sucks

01:03:23.359 --> 01:03:25.599
like being ass see this is what you're

01:03:25.599 --> 01:03:27.520
talking about being candid

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.960
yeah i'm still i'm feeling myself

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.480
starting to be candid and i'm like ah

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.680
this sucks no no

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.760
be candid because that's i look i've

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.200
done it my whole career and i think

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.000
people

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.760
can i think people can empathize more

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.359
with a person that's not

01:03:39.359 --> 01:03:42.160
being guarded and trying to present a

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.359
brand to you

01:03:43.359 --> 01:03:45.359
and like if you just go hey man i say

01:03:45.359 --> 01:03:47.039
[ __ ] up things and i [ __ ] up and i

01:03:47.039 --> 01:03:47.520
don't

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.359
i'm not perfect and i and i have

01:03:49.359 --> 01:03:50.640
feelings that aren't

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:53.599
uh uh brand loyal to this like death

01:03:53.599 --> 01:03:54.480
squad

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.160
[ __ ] mentality like i'm just a

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:57.599
regular person

01:03:57.599 --> 01:03:59.839
but you were saying it it does it you

01:03:59.839 --> 01:04:01.200
redo readings

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.880
of course it affects you and then of

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.319
course like

01:04:04.319 --> 01:04:07.359
it affects like relationships and like

01:04:07.359 --> 01:04:10.480
like dude if i meet people and they

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.599
google me

01:04:11.599 --> 01:04:13.760
like if you google racist comedian i

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:16.079
come up like it's [ __ ] wild

01:04:16.079 --> 01:04:19.119
but that being said there's still

01:04:19.119 --> 01:04:21.280
and again i hate to be the guy that's

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.599
like this is an art that i care about

01:04:23.599 --> 01:04:25.119
because i understand what it is it's us

01:04:25.119 --> 01:04:27.520
[ __ ] around but it's also like

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:31.520
something that i am i care about so

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:35.039
not apologizing and being like look

01:04:35.039 --> 01:04:36.960
i i'm gonna keep trying i'm gonna keep

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.400
doing it and

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.359
hopefully it you know i don't know we've

01:04:41.359 --> 01:04:42.720
reached a point where all of a sudden we

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:44.880
care we're judging

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.680
everybody on like i need to have a

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.760
political platform now

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.000
it's like what are we doing i've had i

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
had a rant i did a rant in bed last

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.319
night about what like i got into an

01:04:58.319 --> 01:05:00.079
argument with someone the other day

01:05:00.079 --> 01:05:01.760
saying

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:05.359
i don't i don't i don't spend time

01:05:05.359 --> 01:05:06.799
reading about politics

01:05:06.799 --> 01:05:07.920
because i don't know anything about

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:10.079
politics and it doesn't interest me

vice president shane gillis right now

01:06:02.839 --> 01:06:05.839
um

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.240

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:14.400
ownership with dosing jay

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.680
how do you feel about that yeah lewis

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:20.160
was pretty wrong to do that to him

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.880
yeah that was [ __ ] up i did say louis

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:26.640
louis brought the gun to the fight dude

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:29.119
exactly um you know what they're talking

01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:30.720
about

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.680
shooting unarmed people and so i heard

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.760
uh somebody sam harris somebody go

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.240
no cop has a gun so once they're in a

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.039
fist fight

01:06:39.039 --> 01:06:41.280
there's a gun on the table nobody's

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.880
unarmed

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.960

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.720
away all right it was good talking to

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.039

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:55.119
all right bye yeah well what'd you think

01:06:55.119 --> 01:06:56.319
what'd you think

01:06:56.319 --> 01:07:01.680
what did you think was gonna happen he

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:04.960
uh interviewed one time

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.319
someone was like you know what do you

01:07:06.319 --> 01:07:08.160
think's going on with america

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:10.160
what do you think and i mean i remember

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.520
watching it and he was like

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:13.119
you know ari arms like this he was like

01:07:13.119 --> 01:07:14.400
violent revolution we need to murder

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:14.960
somebody

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:18.559
and you're just like yeah but you know

01:07:18.559 --> 01:07:20.960
i i blame hitler i don't blame hari i

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.160
blame hitler

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.839
his dad went through the holocaust it

01:07:23.839 --> 01:07:24.960
must been rough growing up with a

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.319
holocaust survivor

01:07:26.319 --> 01:07:29.599
this is all hitler's fault so in essence

01:07:29.599 --> 01:07:31.680
true you know that is uh if you're gonna

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.280
blame if you're gonna blame systemic

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.119
racism you gotta blame

01:07:35.119 --> 01:07:38.880
[ __ ] hitler epigenetic

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:41.440
uh trauma is what that's called i looked

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:42.720
it up

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:45.119
really yeah if you're if you're if your

01:07:45.119 --> 01:07:47.039
ancestors went through trauma

01:07:47.039 --> 01:07:50.319
you have ptsd

01:07:50.799 --> 01:07:54.079
so i don't know how real that is in fact

01:07:54.079 --> 01:07:54.480
i'm

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.799
fairly certain that's [ __ ] but it

01:07:56.799 --> 01:07:58.720
makes sense it makes sense uh

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.280
one generation away you know here's what

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.559
you're doing

01:08:02.559 --> 01:08:05.039
right sorry here's what i was gonna say

01:08:05.039 --> 01:08:06.720
to you before ari called and this is

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.000
what i think is

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.319
like the thing that i i'm seeing is that

01:08:12.319 --> 01:08:15.119
america uh hollywood especially but

01:08:15.119 --> 01:08:16.000
america

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.560
loves a comeback story and i i really do

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.000
believe that your

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.960
your if you're gonna call it can't i

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:23.679
don't think it was even

01:08:23.679 --> 01:08:27.199
canceling but like it wasn't really that

01:08:27.199 --> 01:08:27.679
bad

01:08:27.679 --> 01:08:29.359
at all like what you did comparatively

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:31.440
speaking to what people are doing and

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.640
what people have done

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:36.319
is so [ __ ] i mean it was just

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:38.880
it was maybe at worst if you're gonna

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.480
really own it you know it was

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:41.359
insensitive

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:44.560
you know yeah but but it was it was two

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:45.359
guys

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:47.920
trying to [ __ ] around about a premise

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:48.960
that

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:51.040
you wouldn't do now you would probably

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.560
go uh maybe

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.239
maybe i'll everything i don't know but

01:08:54.239 --> 01:08:55.600
it's it's it's like

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.279
it's already happened so you can't sit

01:08:57.279 --> 01:08:58.640
there and try to fight it yeah all you

01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:59.679
can say is like

01:08:59.679 --> 01:09:02.319
it's like that i think it in the scale

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:03.520
scope of things

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.279
that have happened with with when we've

01:09:05.279 --> 01:09:07.120
seen our peers get cancelled

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:09.520
it definitely wasn't predatory it

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.880
definitely wasn't

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:14.159
it was it was in insensitive

01:09:14.159 --> 01:09:16.239
at best ignorant if you want to say

01:09:16.239 --> 01:09:17.520
ignorant you can take that

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.080
but like it wasn't predatory you weren't

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:20.799
like

01:09:20.799 --> 01:09:22.799
saying you you know and once again i

01:09:22.799 --> 01:09:23.920
haven't i haven't heard this for like

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:25.920
two years whatever but i think

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:29.359
i think that is the thing that i think

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:32.640
is will be your story is

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.799
you your your perspective comes from a

01:09:34.799 --> 01:09:36.880
place of i really don't give a [ __ ]

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:38.799
this is what i love to do and i'm gonna

01:09:38.799 --> 01:09:40.560
do this as good as i can

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:44.560
and be better than most and i will

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:47.679
i will get your when you get a fan and

01:09:47.679 --> 01:09:49.440
when you get a fan i think people go

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.199
i actually love that dude man he's you

01:09:51.199 --> 01:09:53.199
know everyone loves a comeback story

01:09:53.199 --> 01:09:54.239
they they really do

01:09:54.239 --> 01:09:57.679
you know look at [ __ ] mel gibson

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:02.080
[ __ ] mean

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:06.080
gibson was is like by the way apocalypto

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:07.280
you cannot deny that's one of the

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:09.280
[ __ ] best movies you've ever seen

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:12.159
is so [ __ ] good it's so good and by

01:10:12.159 --> 01:10:12.800
the way

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.760
movies are i've always get subjective

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:16.800
and objective wrong

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.920
but but comedy is

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.760
comedy is the opposite it's like you

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:22.960
can't deny comedy

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:26.080
comedy is subjective oh wait no

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.600
if you can't i can't help myself from

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:30.159
laughing yeah

01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:32.960
i can't help it i just i just can't and

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.719
i think that's what's

01:10:34.719 --> 01:10:37.520
what i mean i mean what do you when when

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.159
you're on the

01:10:38.159 --> 01:10:40.159
you're on the other coast of it when you

01:10:40.159 --> 01:10:41.920
hear about all these la comics getting

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:42.560
canceled

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:45.199
and having gone through that process is

01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:46.000
there

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.320
what do you feel when you see that um

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:54.159
well first selfishly you know i do the

01:10:54.159 --> 01:10:54.719
thing

01:10:54.719 --> 01:10:57.520
internally where i'm like oh good i

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.000
didn't like

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.719
that person for no reason i i don't even

01:11:00.719 --> 01:11:02.320
know these people

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.080
yeah so that's the first thing i keep

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:05.360
that to myself

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:08.320
and then and then i realized some people

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:08.640
don't

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.480
like a lot of people just go online and

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.000
just go he was a

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.239
hack anyway that's just your own that's

01:11:14.239 --> 01:11:15.920
your own ego that's your own ego that's

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.120
not that has nothing to do with them

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.640
i've never i've never met

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.080
anybody that's been kid like all right

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:21.920
let's talk about dalia i've never met

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:22.480
him

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:25.679
i heard he murders i personally thought

01:11:25.679 --> 01:11:26.080
it was

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:29.280
comedy for hot chicks but

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:30.800
there's no like everybody that's been at

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:32.480
the store like tim dillon was telling me

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:33.280
he was like

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:36.560
guy [ __ ] murders murders so it's like

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.400
you know it's like i can use you as an

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.640
example but once

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:44.080
you go it like with you

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.360

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.640
trouble than it needs to be i don't you

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:41.120
know what i

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.120
don't really give a [ __ ] i and then

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.120
they're like you said on a podcast and

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.640
you're like okay i'm out i'm out

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.199
exactly exactly and so i think that's

01:12:49.199 --> 01:12:50.960
what happened with dalia

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:52.719
is that like i read the first couple

01:12:52.719 --> 01:12:53.920
things and then i was like all right man

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:55.280
i'm not um

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:58.480
you know what i i don't have any

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:00.640
emotional attachment to this and i can't

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.800
involve myself because if i get outraged

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:03.760
and get drunk

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:05.760
and write a tweet then all of a sudden i

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.280
mean you saw near brandon what neil

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:10.239
brennan wrote like you were like

01:13:10.239 --> 01:13:12.080
by the way i think neil brennan tried to

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.280
defend chris

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:14.960
and it came out that he was attacking

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:17.120
chris yeah

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:20.080
and then everyone swarmed on neal and

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:20.480
then

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.239
everything neil's ever done is is

01:13:22.239 --> 01:13:23.840
subject for

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:26.640
debate of like so now let's also talk

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:27.600
about you ex

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.560
you white-splaining black culture to us

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.320
and you're like and i was like

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.960
[ __ ] this man like i don't feel like and

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:35.520
by the way

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:38.480
it is ten percent of twitter that's

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:39.679
doing this

01:13:39.679 --> 01:13:41.600
yeah it's it's not even that it's like

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.040
10 it's like 10

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:48.239
[ __ ] people there's it's it's crazy

01:13:48.239 --> 01:13:52.560
uh and it is scary i admit with

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.880
it's though and especially you know like

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.480
you hear numbers like

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.320
when the chris stuff goes on she goes i

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.960
had 240 emails within the next 10

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:01.679
minutes

01:14:01.679 --> 01:14:03.600
and you're like holy [ __ ] there's no

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.360
really quantifiable

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.000
way to say that that is true so you just

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.440
sit back and go

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:11.440
you just sit back and that's i mean

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.440
maybe that maybe it's that old adage

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.280
like i didn't suppose speak up when they

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:15.600
come

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:17.520
came from the gypsies and then yeah yeah

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.199
yeah i was talking to burr about it

01:14:19.199 --> 01:14:22.080
yesterday i go what ended

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:25.280
the red scare like with mccarthyism and

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.719
burr was like it was an edr

01:14:26.719 --> 01:14:30.320
edward murrow speech have you no shame

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.360
and i was like yeah i don't think people

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:34.880
really give a [ __ ] about shame at all

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.640
like they're like

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.640
get rid of that guy i don't like him you

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.080
know yeah

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:41.600
and that's the other thing it's also

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.199
we're in this industry

01:14:43.199 --> 01:14:45.840
where man people are so happy to watch

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.120
their [ __ ] peers

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.990
get brought down like so happy

01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:51.280
[Music]

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:52.880
i've been witnessed it firsthand of

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:54.320
people celebrating it

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:56.159
like tests with they celebrate they

01:14:56.159 --> 01:14:59.120
literally celebrate it

01:15:00.239 --> 01:15:02.560
it's so and i think and i do i know that

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:03.280
there are

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.960
i mean you got to be honest there are

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.640
young comics that look at this as an

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:07.840
opportunity

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:11.120
they go all right so they look they do

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:12.080
the math they go

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:15.199
all right story used to have joey

01:15:15.199 --> 01:15:18.960
joe callan uh shaub

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:22.400
uh uh ed and dalia those are

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:25.520
five spots that have opened up now

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:28.640
five yeah i'm gonna move out there

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:32.239
dude i i mean there's five spots that

01:15:32.239 --> 01:15:33.440
have opened up at the store that because

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:34.560
they're all leaving and then

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.080
there's more by the way there's two

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:38.080
other [ __ ] humongous

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.239
comics are buying houses somewhere else

01:15:40.239 --> 01:15:41.199
two other

01:15:41.199 --> 01:15:42.880
huge comics are leaving that i haven't

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:45.360
said anything yet

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:48.640
that i know of and then and and and theo

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:50.159
von's moving to nashville

01:15:50.159 --> 01:15:52.000
like so there's i mean there's probably

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.920
going to be arguably 10 spots open at

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:55.679
the store and if you're a young comic

01:15:55.679 --> 01:15:58.719
and someone's like hey man uh

01:15:58.719 --> 01:16:02.719
uh [ __ ] you know um david spade

01:16:02.719 --> 01:16:03.840
i don't even want to say anyone's name

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:05.040
that's how weird this is i don't even

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.159
want to say anyone's name

01:16:06.159 --> 01:16:07.280
because then everyone's like wait what

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:09.280
do you know about him because that's the

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:13.440
way yeah i mean it already it's funny

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:14.159
because it's like

01:16:14.159 --> 01:16:15.760
it's like with coronavirus it's like if

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.360
you get it you can't get it again

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:18.640
you know it's like a disease so i

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.640
already got the i'm good

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:24.159
i'm immune they can take nothing from me

01:16:24.159 --> 01:16:25.679
i have nothing

01:16:25.679 --> 01:16:29.040
like it's so it's it's very interesting

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.199
to watch and also it puts you in a purse

01:16:31.199 --> 01:16:33.280
it gives me it gives me a position where

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:35.440
i can actually speak up

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.199
you know i can be like hey that's [ __ ]

01:16:37.199 --> 01:16:39.280
up that's weird um

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:41.040
but also sometimes i feel like i'm not

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:42.320
the right guy to do it

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.080
you know like if somebody's getting in

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:45.600
trouble i think the last person they

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:46.480
want

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.000
on twitter is for me to come out and

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.120
defend them and they'll be like oh look

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.199
the [ __ ] racist guy likes you

01:16:51.199 --> 01:16:54.480
you know so it's like uh it's yeah

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:57.920
it's it it is a weird thing because if

01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:58.640
like

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.880
if theoretically if there was like a

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.640
uh someone said someone acted

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:06.080
inappropriate the last thing you want is

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.840
like jeremy piven going hold on i got

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.600
this for you yeah yeah yeah

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:11.840
i'll take care of you get this one out

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.360
but i appreciate it just

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.199
i feel bad even bringing jeremy piven's

01:17:15.199 --> 01:17:16.719
name into the mix because

01:17:16.719 --> 01:17:18.880
i know that he feels like he told andrew

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.159
schultz that he is like

01:17:20.159 --> 01:17:23.199
the he's like the he fell on the sword

01:17:23.199 --> 01:17:24.320
for everyone

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:26.880
and you know i once again his was like

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:29.360
it's like allegations are

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.320
allegations are definitely the [ __ ]

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.239
law and i wonder i wonder what

01:17:34.239 --> 01:17:35.600
you know it's always there's one the one

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:38.159
thing that that shifts that no one saw

01:17:38.159 --> 01:17:41.440
like no one saw that happening because

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:44.080
we've changed the paradigm and i wonder

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:45.679
what that's gonna be

01:17:45.679 --> 01:17:47.199
with this where we're like oh wait i

01:17:47.199 --> 01:17:48.640
didn't mean that i didn't know that was

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:50.239
gonna happen oh [ __ ]

01:17:50.239 --> 01:17:53.679
this is a game changer you know yeah

01:17:53.679 --> 01:17:56.480
i don't i think it's i don't know it's

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:57.679
it's all of a sudden we've gotten to a

01:17:57.679 --> 01:17:58.560
point where

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:01.280
we're pretending all of us aren't very

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:03.679
[ __ ] up

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:05.600
like where it's like you have to be a

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:06.960
like

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:10.400
morally correct person at all times in

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.199
order to do

01:18:11.199 --> 01:18:14.560
comedy yeah i don't know whatever i

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:15.280
don't [ __ ]

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:17.600
i mean you don't you don't have to i

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.120
think i think that

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.760
i think that to play devil's advocate

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:23.520
there is a

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:26.719
code of conduct that i think that

01:18:26.719 --> 01:18:29.280
maybe wasn't super prevalent in the i

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:29.760
was

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.280
talking to someone about this the other

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:33.280
day but the admit that

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:36.000
there was a code of conduct that wasn't

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.600
prevalent

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:41.440
in like the early 2000s when it came to

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:43.920
being a female and company

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:47.280
and guys maybe and and

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.400
i any

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.400
say that maybe guys didn't understand

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.320
guys didn't know the metoo movement

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.080
reckon that all i'll say is i've never

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.159
really seen i've never seen it

01:18:58.159 --> 01:19:00.000
i've never seen anyone do anything

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.840
inappropriate but once again

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:03.360
i'm usually in and out of the clubs at

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:05.280
the bar like i'm not i've been married

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.520
for 18 years so like i'm not

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:09.199
i'm the wrong guy to ask i know sagura

01:19:09.199 --> 01:19:10.719
feels the same way as like

01:19:10.719 --> 01:19:12.480
we don't see guys taking their dicks out

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:13.840
in the green room and being like if you

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.120
want to get on stage you got to suck

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:16.159
this dick

01:19:16.159 --> 01:19:18.400
i i don't see that but i know it has

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.360
happened it has happened

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.280
yeah i've heard those stories but again

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:24.960
i you know i started

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:27.840
significantly later like i started i

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:28.159
mean

01:19:28.159 --> 01:19:32.320
doing like shows in like 2000

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:35.600
you know 12 or 13 like

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.679
and then yeah i haven't started doing

01:19:37.679 --> 01:19:38.880
clubs until like seven

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:41.760
2017. so like i haven't i've only been

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:42.800
around the

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:46.080

01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:50.000
and you're like oh i really appreciate

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.280
this man this is like such a cool

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:52.320
experience

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.400
and they bring me up this next guy all

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.159
the way up across the pond for this

01:22:56.159 --> 01:22:57.600
let's see if let's see if he can bring

01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.520
it all right

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:02.960
why do i look here's

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.040
i've got a strong theory on this that

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:06.880
was basically their apollo

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.719
all right they were talking [ __ ] it was

01:23:08.719 --> 01:23:10.000
a hostile

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.760
heated because they don't have enough

01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:13.440
black people over there

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.199
so there's there's clicks of white

01:23:15.199 --> 01:23:16.719
people in england and ireland that think

01:23:16.719 --> 01:23:18.159
they're the toughest

01:23:18.159 --> 01:23:19.760
and it's very annoying dude they need to

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:21.199
get some black people

01:23:21.199 --> 01:23:23.679
no it's dude all right never mind that

01:23:23.679 --> 01:23:25.280
[ __ ] see that was a missed bit that's

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:26.080
how that works

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:28.719
it's okay it's okay sometimes you take

01:23:28.719 --> 01:23:30.000
shots

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.239
you got to eat if you got to take a shot

01:23:32.239 --> 01:23:34.000
down field it was funny imagining that

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.360
was the british apollo

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:37.280
and it's like yeah this isn't this isn't

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:38.719
as scary as what we have

01:23:38.719 --> 01:23:41.920
stop um right before i went on stage i

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:45.840
said uh i said um

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:48.880
do i have to turn the mic on

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:52.560
and the guy goes are you being serious

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:53.920
and i said no will it be on when i get

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:55.199
on there and he goes yes it's on the

01:23:55.199 --> 01:23:56.719
whole thing's on oh my god

01:23:56.719 --> 01:23:58.000
and now they think they've got a rube on

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.159
their hands i go out and i will say

01:24:00.159 --> 01:24:02.800
in my defense i [ __ ] ripped that room

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:04.719
for seven minutes i did seven minutes

01:24:04.719 --> 01:24:05.280
they can just yeah

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:08.000
hell yeah i'll never go back there again

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.120
i

01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:13.600
um i ripped the room and i get off stage

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:16.400
and all three of these [ __ ] are sitting

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:17.440
on a mattress

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.280
on the couch and they're like one of

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.280
them says all right guess you've done

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:22.320

01:26:12.639 --> 01:26:15.600
me too is a great move no you did say it

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.040
if the cameras weren't on he would have

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.159
said it like that

01:26:18.159 --> 01:26:19.360
you guys should have seen it before we

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:20.639
started recording it was like look i'm

01:26:20.639 --> 01:26:22.000
gonna go pretty heavy-handed

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.920
on those me too [ __ ] i was like all

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:25.840
right man you can do whatever

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:27.760
i got in enough trouble but i don't know

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:30.159
if you should then he did it you know

01:26:30.159 --> 01:26:33.920
the uh it's funny because the um

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:37.280
it's like i i really i i feel

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:38.880
i feel stupid saying this but i really

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:40.800
am someone who tries to learn like like

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:41.679
where i go

01:26:41.679 --> 01:26:44.719
i want to learn because i my

01:26:44.719 --> 01:26:48.480
sometimes my initial thought isn't right

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:50.719
so like i remember the one i've the one

01:26:50.719 --> 01:26:53.760
that hit me the hardest was um

01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:55.040
yes all women do you remember that

01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:57.199
hashtag yeah

01:26:57.199 --> 01:26:59.360
and it was like and then immediately

01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:00.480
every guy was like no

01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:03.199
not not all men and i was like yeah not

01:27:03.199 --> 01:27:04.080
all men is my

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:07.840
head and the one that jen kirkman wrote

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:11.120
that changed my [ __ ] perspective was

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.400
yes all women are

01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:14.239
terrified when they order a pizza and i

01:27:14.239 --> 01:27:16.480
was like what i was like what the [ __ ]

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:17.920
you're getting a pizza what are you

01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:19.360
scared you're gonna choke and eat it by

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:20.480
yourself and then

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:22.000
i said to leanne and leanne goes oh no

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.239
no it's absolutely terrifying when a man

01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:25.679
comes to your house and goes

01:27:25.679 --> 01:27:27.840
small pizza for one and you're like yeah

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:29.520
and he's like looks over your shoulder

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:30.400
and he's like

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:32.800
in here by yourself and she's like it's

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:34.639
terrifying and i was like oh [ __ ] i bet

01:27:34.639 --> 01:27:35.760
that is terrifying

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:38.080
and then she was like and then the thing

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:39.760
the thing that

01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:42.159
shifted everything was like when the me

01:27:42.159 --> 01:27:42.800
too thing

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.560
happened i will say if you're ordering a

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:46.320
[ __ ] small pizza by yourself you're

01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:49.280
probably not the hottest lady

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:50.719
so you probably don't have to worry

01:27:50.719 --> 01:27:52.800
about it actually get it just

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:55.920
just a salad jesus christ or at least

01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.920
order like two larges and be like hold

01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:59.199
on everybody

01:27:59.199 --> 01:28:02.560
yeah hold on jacked men

01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:05.600

stop doing push-ups he's here um yeah

01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.440
the one thing louis when louis got in

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:12.159
trouble and

01:28:12.159 --> 01:28:15.120
i said but he they said yes i was saying

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:16.400
that to my wife

01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:18.639
she goes yeah because he's like twice

01:28:18.639 --> 01:28:20.159
her size and i was like what she goes

01:28:20.159 --> 01:28:23.040
let me ask you something if uh who's the

01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:24.159
[ __ ]

01:28:24.159 --> 01:28:27.520
who's the the mma fighter that has a

01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:29.440
she goes oh you've heard me say this for

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:30.960
halston she goes

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:32.800
if brock lesnar and you're in a hotel

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:34.719
room he's like hey do you mind if i jack

01:28:34.719 --> 01:28:37.280
off you'd be like i'm cool with it

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:40.000
and then you leave that room and go oh

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.960
still alive

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:45.440
and i was like oh good point good point

01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:47.520
that's a decent point

01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:51.280
that's a decent point yeah decent point

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:54.639
but i i that's like that's just assuming

01:28:54.639 --> 01:28:56.880
[ __ ] louis would be prone to he's

01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:57.840
going to [ __ ]

01:28:57.840 --> 01:28:59.600
physically assault someone if they were

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:01.360
i don't think i don't think no thanks

01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:03.679
i don't think louis i don't personally i

01:29:03.679 --> 01:29:04.480
know he does

01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:06.239
well obviously you can't say i know

01:29:06.239 --> 01:29:07.920
anymore

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:10.239
but i don't think that guy would ever do

01:29:10.239 --> 01:29:11.600
that

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:12.880
my experience with louie's always been

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.719
that he's been a very sweet guy

01:29:14.719 --> 01:29:18.960
but uh but yeah you know and

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:21.600
it's interesting i think you know what

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:23.600
it's time for us to ignore our personal

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:25.040
interactions with people

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:27.199
and fully rely on gossip we hear on

01:29:27.199 --> 01:29:28.639
twitter

01:29:28.639 --> 01:29:30.320
so it's like yeah maybe i can trust him

01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:32.159
as a person when i've been out and hung

01:29:32.159 --> 01:29:33.600
out with him but

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:35.520
i did read this [ __ ] tweet about him

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:36.880
so [ __ ] him

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:39.120
that is really interesting is that you

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:40.000
know you

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.360
you do have a really interesting

01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:43.760
perspective shane because that is

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:47.120
how people treated you

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:49.199
they're like yeah i met him i i never

01:29:49.199 --> 01:29:50.560
saw him to be racist

01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:51.600
and then people were like but i guess

01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:54.159
he's just racist

01:29:54.159 --> 01:29:55.840
and you're like yeah no i've treated

01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:57.280
everyone the same like what are you

01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:58.080
talking about

01:29:58.080 --> 01:29:59.280
i'll tell you what really happened no

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:00.880
i've i mean i've definitely done racist

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:02.239
[ __ ]

01:30:02.239 --> 01:30:04.880
i have like there's i've been dude get

01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:05.600
hammered

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:09.120
at an open mic there's it's a mixed race

01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:11.280
[ __ ] group of comedians sometimes i

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:12.560
get too comfortable and think we're all

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:13.760
[ __ ] good friends

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.679
or these are my friends from home or

01:30:15.679 --> 01:30:17.520
[ __ ] like that where i can say anything

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:18.960
now it's not like i'm [ __ ] out there

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:20.719
screaming the n-word or something

01:30:20.719 --> 01:30:22.800
but you get too comfortable you say

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.080
something stupid

01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:26.400
but i don't know is that is that

01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:27.600
something that should

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:30.560
then therefore make me a literally a bad

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:31.840
person i don't know

01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:33.600
that's up to you if you're a psycho and

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:35.040
want to hold people to those standards

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:35.920
you can

01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:37.840
but uh here's what happens and i it

01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:39.440
happens every single time

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:42.719
is i got can't i got started to get in

01:30:42.719 --> 01:30:43.120

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.760
[ __ ] i'd done

01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:53.840
just a me dude there was one guy that

01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:54.880

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:57.120
one of our fellow comics on stage at an

01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:58.080
open mic who

01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:00.000
he left out the part that that was one

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.520
of my very good friends and we were

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:02.880
[ __ ] around

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:05.360
um there's people that were like i heard

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.679
he was creepy to women which is like

01:31:07.679 --> 01:31:09.840
i i've never i don't think i've ever

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.600
talked to a woman in a green room

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:12.800
i don't talk to any i'm not trying to

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.199
get [ __ ] laid before i go on stage

01:31:15.199 --> 01:31:19.040
no like that's insane but like

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:21.280
it's just once you once you get that

01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:22.960
like the green light over your head

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:24.639
where everybody's allowed to [ __ ] on you

01:31:24.639 --> 01:31:27.040
and they'll go [ __ ] walk you if you

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:28.560
if you're allowed to [ __ ] on people

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:29.199
publicly

01:31:29.199 --> 01:31:30.560
you'll do it and that's what everyone

01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:32.719
does as soon as it's the same reason

01:31:32.719 --> 01:31:33.440
like

01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:35.440
everybody on the left calls [ __ ] mike

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:37.600
pence gay like that's a joke to make fun

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:38.960
of a guy for being gay

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:40.800
he's not gay but they use it as an

01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:42.239
insult they're like yeah mike pence i

01:31:42.239 --> 01:31:44.159
heard that guy's [ __ ] gay and it's

01:31:44.159 --> 01:31:44.880
like

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:46.159
you're allowed to make fun of him so

01:31:46.159 --> 01:31:48.000
you're allowed like does that make sense

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:48.639
what i'm saying

01:31:48.639 --> 01:31:50.800
yeah no i i've never found if you feel

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:52.080
like you have the moral high ground on

01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:52.719
somebody

01:31:52.719 --> 01:31:54.880
you can publicly just destroy them and

01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:56.080
say

01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:58.480
you can use like homophobia against them

01:31:58.480 --> 01:31:59.920
which is what they do to pence or you

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:00.639

my niece was getting bullied i think a

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:52.800
little bit for it oh for real

01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:54.639
yeah that's where that's where it starts

01:39:54.639 --> 01:39:55.840
to get like ah

01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:57.600
and like you know my mom was proud for

01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:59.360
the first time

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:01.280
and then that got and it's the same

01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:03.040
thing as like people that don't like you

01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:03.840
celebrating

01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:05.679
when you [ __ ] up it's the same thing at

01:40:05.679 --> 01:40:06.960
every single

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:09.440
level of how many people you know so

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:11.199
like my mom going around for like

01:40:11.199 --> 01:40:12.719
three days being like my son's gonna be

01:40:12.719 --> 01:40:15.360
on saturday night live and kind of

01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.440
tossing it in some [ __ ] ladies face

01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:19.119
whose son's a loser

01:40:19.119 --> 01:40:20.560
she was probably like yeah [ __ ] that

01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:22.560
[ __ ] i'm glad her racist son

01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:26.400
got destroyed that's so crazy yeah like

01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:27.360
it's

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:29.600
it's funny too because it's interesting

01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:30.400
now that

01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:33.119
you know my my bus driver is a black

01:40:33.119 --> 01:40:33.920
dude and

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:35.520
one of my closer friends oh congrats

01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:37.280
congratulations thanks you know well

01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:37.760
that's

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:39.920
i thought i forgot you had a tour bus i

01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:41.679
was like you're bragging about like your

01:40:41.679 --> 01:40:45.360
local city bus driver people

01:40:46.159 --> 01:40:48.840
it took me i was like damn you take the

01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:50.000
bus

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:54.719
yeah he um but his perspective has

01:40:54.719 --> 01:40:57.119
and i think black people's perspective

01:40:57.119 --> 01:40:58.320
in general has always been

01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:01.440
yeah all white people are racist so

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:04.639
it's interesting to like i i don't think

01:41:04.639 --> 01:41:06.080
i don't think they i don't think they

01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:08.480
mean all white people are walking around

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:10.400
lighting crosses yeah yeah yeah but i

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:12.400
think they're saying yeah there's this

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:14.719
this institutionalized racism that

01:41:14.719 --> 01:41:16.480
you're even unaware of

01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:20.639
so it's like in a weird way like he'll

01:41:20.639 --> 01:41:21.840
say things to me where

01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:24.480
i will it's it's amazing you know i've

01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:25.199
had

01:41:25.199 --> 01:41:26.639
black dudes i've been friends with but

01:41:26.639 --> 01:41:28.320
never one that i

01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:31.920
came at from from like two grown men

01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:34.400
from very different walks of life

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:36.639
who you know and despite the fact that

01:41:36.639 --> 01:41:38.320
he is technically my employee

01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:40.960
he has no problem challenging me on just

01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:41.360
about

01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:43.760
anything the other day he told me to

01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:44.960
pick up arms

01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:47.600
and take a side because the race war's

01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:49.280
coming and if if

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:51.600
he's not if i'm not on his side he knows

01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:52.900
where my family lives

01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:55.280
[Laughter]

01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:57.040
so that's good i hope this guy [ __ ]

01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:58.320
kills you it's

01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:01.040
it's it's been interesting to have a

01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:02.080
[ __ ]

01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:05.119
friend that is willing to be [ __ ]

01:42:05.119 --> 01:42:07.040
really candid with you about his

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:08.320
feelings and about

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:09.840
you know and where you can get you know

01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:11.520
one of the things i love about it is you

01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:13.360
can get into a heated conversation with

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:14.719
them but you're good at the end because

01:42:14.719 --> 01:42:16.000
you're not mad you're just that's how

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.239
you talk

01:42:18.239 --> 01:42:21.520
but it is racism is such a weird thing

01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:22.960
that people throw around because

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:26.080
everyone's guilty of it to some extent

01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:27.520
and then they say but he did it and

01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:29.679
you're like yeah but

01:42:29.679 --> 01:42:32.480
hold on you've never done it like you've

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:32.800
never

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:34.239
you've never done anything yeah yeah

01:42:34.239 --> 01:42:36.320
sideways where you're just like

01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:38.239
clutched your pearls or clustered purse

01:42:38.239 --> 01:42:39.520
or [ __ ]

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:42.320
carrying somebody like and you know it's

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:42.800
so

01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:45.440
[ __ ] interesting because now you see

01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:47.360
the levels of racism that you see

01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:50.159
are real genuine like genuine when i see

01:42:50.159 --> 01:42:51.520
people go go back to your country i'm

01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:53.280
like who the [ __ ] says that

01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:56.000
like i understand sarah silverman making

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.159
a joke on conan about asian people

01:42:58.159 --> 01:42:59.760
i get it her attempt is to make people

01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:01.360
laugh but someone is like go back to

01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:02.480
your [ __ ] country

01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:05.440
i cannot defend that i go i'm sorry i'm

01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:07.280
like

01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:09.199
well here's how you defend it there are

01:43:09.199 --> 01:43:10.560
[ __ ] a a

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:14.560
ton of really really dumb [ __ ]

01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:16.880
in this country and you got to be pretty

01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:18.719
[ __ ] dumb to say go back to your

01:43:18.719 --> 01:43:20.480
country to somebody

01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:22.960
um you know you'll see videos online of

01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:23.679
like

01:43:23.679 --> 01:43:26.159
the lady screams the n-word it's just a

01:43:26.159 --> 01:43:27.199
[ __ ] like a

01:43:27.199 --> 01:43:30.080
a homeless lady on a bus it's like all

01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:30.480
right

01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:32.080
but i'm not downplaying ready but that's

01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:34.320
that's usually how that the answer to

01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:36.239
how you can be that ignorant now don't

01:43:36.239 --> 01:43:38.400
get me wrong smart people can be racist

01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:40.880
but we're gonna yeah i don't know where

01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:41.760
i'm going with this

01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:43.760
no it's it's it's it's a tough by the

01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:44.880
way we're in just

01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:46.560
tough territory for two white guys

01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:48.000
because everything we say

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.600
sounds sounds subject to yeah

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:53.440
and any and it also you know because if

01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:54.639
you're thinking about the scrutiny then

01:43:54.639 --> 01:43:56.000
you're not being honest and then you're

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:56.560
gonna

01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:58.400
you're gonna end up saying you know like

01:43:58.400 --> 01:43:59.840
i just backpedaled towards the end of

01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:01.040
that statement

01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:02.560
you're gonna start backpedaling you

01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:04.880
gotta backpedal on everything you say

01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:09.199
um but yeah the racism thing is like

01:44:09.199 --> 01:44:10.719
here's here's here's something that i

01:44:10.719 --> 01:44:12.480
thought was interesting so like i'll be

01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:14.239
seeing things about like

01:44:14.239 --> 01:44:15.199
you know there'll be a tweet or

01:44:15.199 --> 01:44:16.800
something about new snl or like if

01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:18.080
you're trying if you're a new cast

01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:19.600
member make sure you delete everything

01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:20.000
you've ever

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.840
done if you're looking to have a career

01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:23.280
in this make sure you delete everything

01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:24.560
you've ever done

01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:28.000
so it's almost like everybody knows

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.440
everybody has bad things and if you get

01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:31.920
caught

01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:33.920
then you're a bad person but if you

01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:36.080
delete it you're not a bad person

01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:37.760
yeah so it's almost like a very public

01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:39.840
acknowledgement that public perception

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.679
is the only thing that matters

01:44:41.679 --> 01:44:44.159
where it's like oh sure i think almost

01:44:44.159 --> 01:44:47.280
every white person has said the n-word

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:49.520
but if you say it on you know if

01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:51.280
somebody secretly records you and says

01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:51.920
it

01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:53.360
now you're you're the worst guy i've

01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:55.280
ever met in my life

01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:58.400
and it's i had an instance uh where

01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:02.159
on my first television show i was

01:45:02.159 --> 01:45:05.679
i was very insecure and i mean like

01:45:05.679 --> 01:45:07.440
beyond insecure that i wasn't gonna do

01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:09.520
well and i was trying to make everyone

01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:09.840
laugh

01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:12.480
and cracking jokes like the whole time

01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:14.080
thinking the cameras were on the whole

01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:15.679
time not realizing

01:45:15.679 --> 01:45:17.520
like just trying to get my energy up and

01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:18.880
like sure

01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:21.360
and i was i'm probably saying a lot of

01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:22.880
off color stuff as well but one of the

01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:24.239
things i said

01:45:24.239 --> 01:45:26.000
was i at the end of the day the first

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
day i couldn't get a read through

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.480
and i had had a couple beers at the end

01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.280
of the day

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:33.199
not knowing we had a read left and then

01:45:33.199 --> 01:45:34.880
we went and we went and did the read

01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:37.440
and i had a few beers and i said this is

01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:38.639
why you don't get drunk before you're

01:45:38.639 --> 01:45:39.440
done your day

01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:41.679
work and my sound guy eric beanie pulled

01:45:41.679 --> 01:45:43.679
me aside he goes hey man

01:45:43.679 --> 01:45:45.679
just so you you have to be aware there

01:45:45.679 --> 01:45:46.960
will always be a mic

01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:49.840
on you for the rest of your life so you

01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:51.920
need to be aware of what you're saying

01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:54.320
because you've been really loose today

01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:55.600
and i've been cutting your mic

01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:57.520
out but there are sound guys that won't

01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:59.840
protect you that will let it play

01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:01.600
and let it especially if they don't like

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:03.280
you they'll let it go to the production

01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:04.000
company

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.239
and they you will lose a job and he was

01:46:06.239 --> 01:46:07.600
like i got you

01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:09.520
i'm covering you but you need to be

01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:11.199
aware of that and

01:46:11.199 --> 01:46:13.199
beanie was this guy that kind of taught

01:46:13.199 --> 01:46:15.520
me you're always being recorded so i've

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:16.159
been

01:46:16.159 --> 01:46:18.480
i've been at dinner parties where and by

01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:19.920
the way i have a very diverse group of

01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:21.119
friends but where people are speaking

01:46:21.119 --> 01:46:23.040
open and honestly about race

01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:26.719
dude i have when in those situations

01:46:26.719 --> 01:46:28.880
i don't know if this is good or bad but

01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:31.679
i always think a neighbor's recording us

01:46:31.679 --> 01:46:34.159
i always think that's because is

01:46:34.159 --> 01:46:36.560
recording us because i've gotten this

01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:38.159
mindset of like you're always being

01:46:38.159 --> 01:46:40.159
recorded you're always being listened to

01:46:40.159 --> 01:46:43.040
you're always being like i think i hear

01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:44.080
you i hear you on that

01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:46.080
and i think it comes from number one

01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:47.760
always recording

01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:49.840
i mean you're talking hours of podcasts

01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:51.199
and then you do the thing where after

01:46:51.199 --> 01:46:52.880
the podcast at least i do where's the

01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:54.639
there's this anxiety

01:46:54.639 --> 01:46:56.480
for like at least an hour where i'm like

01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:58.400
[ __ ] i wish i hadn't said that n-word

01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:01.280
box joke you know that i just did that

01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:03.040
was a mistake

01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:04.480
it was a mistake it was funny but i'll

01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:05.920
feel bad about it for like an hour i'll

01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:07.520
be like [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:09.119
uh so there and then i was thinking of

01:47:09.119 --> 01:47:10.239
this the other day where it's like it's

01:47:10.239 --> 01:47:11.440
starting to blend together where i'm

01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:13.920
like did i say that on a [ __ ] podcast

01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:16.320
like i'll be driving and be like damn

01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:17.920
that was [ __ ] up i hope i didn't say

01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:19.280
that publicly

01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:21.440
like i don't know i don't know it it

01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:23.440
bleeds in it's it's been bleeding in

01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:25.440
slowly this whole year it's only been a

01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:26.960
year of me being

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:29.119
somewhat known and it's it's only been

01:47:29.119 --> 01:47:31.600
one year just doing it

01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:34.560
uh actually wow that's pretty funny i

01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:36.159
think today

01:47:36.159 --> 01:47:37.520
one year ago it was either today or

01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:39.520
tomorrow i auditioned for snl

01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:42.560
one year ago wow yeah

01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:46.159
pretty cool i haven't it was cool

01:47:46.159 --> 01:47:49.199
i gotta be honest with you it i mean snl

01:47:49.199 --> 01:47:50.800
has kind of taken this leap of like

01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:52.080
celebrities

01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:53.760
it's a celebrity sketch show yeah yeah

01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:55.440
yeah for sure

01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:56.719
the kids on it aren't getting enough

01:47:56.719 --> 01:47:58.880
play in my opinion i agree

01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:00.320
i think it's i think it's a disservice

01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:02.400
to comedy to just have

01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:04.239
all the celebrities come on and just hit

01:48:04.239 --> 01:48:05.760
him and by the way they're i mean

01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:06.960
some of them are actually some of them

01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:09.040
are pretty good you're like wow that's

01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:10.159
really [ __ ] awesome

01:48:10.159 --> 01:48:12.320
and then you're gonna it's like if and

01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:13.840
and then

01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:15.840
i don't know and i think i think that

01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:17.040
the men are never really

01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:18.320
i've never really been a big fan of the

01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:20.480
men on the show i i was with farley and

01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:22.080
spade and those guys

01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:24.639
yeah and the women on the show are just

01:48:24.639 --> 01:48:25.360
it

01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:28.080
it really oh yeah [ __ ] murderous i

01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:28.480
think

01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:30.679
i think they really shifted to a

01:48:30.679 --> 01:48:32.159
women-centric show

01:48:32.159 --> 01:48:34.239
i think uh i think it was like will

01:48:34.239 --> 01:48:36.320
ferrell like right before will ferrell

01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:37.840
kind of like there was some really good

01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:40.480
ones and then tina fey

01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:42.239
and amy poehler in them so it's yeah

01:48:42.239 --> 01:48:43.920
it's definitely i'm definitely i'm

01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:44.639
personally not

01:48:44.639 --> 01:48:48.320
snl's [ __ ] target audience at all

01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:50.480
so yeah it's not you know the show's not

01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:52.239
really for me

01:48:52.239 --> 01:48:54.639
my wife and my daughters love it like

01:48:54.639 --> 01:48:55.679
they'll watch that make sense

01:48:55.679 --> 01:48:57.199
they'll watch the sketches they love it

01:48:57.199 --> 01:48:58.960
and by the way i love it i love

01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:01.679
i'm i'm like obsessed with uh like three

01:49:01.679 --> 01:49:02.800
of the performers on there i think

01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:04.400
they're [ __ ] amazing

01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:06.880
yeah i mean we can update [ __ ] rules

01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:07.679
yeah

01:49:07.679 --> 01:49:10.960
snl is cool but it's uh

01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:12.719
i i'm not gonna [ __ ] be like i want

01:49:12.719 --> 01:49:15.360
to laugh what should i watch

01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:18.880
yeah i'm not going to watch it be like

01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:22.320
yeah it's interesting that's been tough

01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:23.760
it's been tough for me not to like

01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:25.199
i've been really trying to avoid like

01:49:25.199 --> 01:49:26.960
ever [ __ ] on snl

01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:28.480
because then it it just looks like i'm

01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:30.719
just being a bitter bitter [ __ ]

01:49:30.719 --> 01:49:33.280
cause i would have i would have taken it

01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:34.080
i

01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:35.520
very happily would have been on that

01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:38.400
show oh yeah all of us all of us

01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:40.400
i mean it was like it was i thought that

01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:42.000
would be my path i didn't know that i'd

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:42.639
be in

01:49:42.639 --> 01:49:44.239
getting to stand up the way i did i

01:49:44.239 --> 01:49:46.080
thought i'd get up to new york

01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:49.520
i'd get on snl i get on mtv

01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:53.440
i'd be a vj uh i'd party hard

01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:54.960
i don't i don't think i had like a game

01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:57.920
plan partying i got the party again

01:49:57.920 --> 01:49:59.840
my game plan i just watched like i just

01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:01.840
listened and saw clips of like

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:04.239
o a and the seller and then louie and

01:50:04.239 --> 01:50:05.760
then i was like all right that's what i

01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:06.239
want

01:50:06.239 --> 01:50:09.040
which ended up being exactly what i got

01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:11.840
like that trajectory of like

01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:15.840
i hope like stand-up new york comics

01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:18.800
uh versus yeah i never i never assumed

01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:19.840
snl

01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:21.280
and that's you know probably why i

01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:24.000
[ __ ] got it

01:50:25.599 --> 01:50:27.199
i didn't know that people did the road i

01:50:27.199 --> 01:50:29.280
didn't know that new york i like

01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:31.679
i didn't know what comedy was i really

01:50:31.679 --> 01:50:32.719
honestly thought

01:50:32.719 --> 01:50:34.639
when i got to new york i had been in

01:50:34.639 --> 01:50:36.080
rolling stone people were going to be

01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:36.719
like

01:50:36.719 --> 01:50:38.800
oh yeah yeah yeah how about how about

01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:40.880
like we would give you 600

01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:43.199
and you just a night and you do stand up

01:50:43.199 --> 01:50:45.040
every night and you just figure it out

01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:47.440
and i was like i'll i'll be into that i

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:48.320
remember like

01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:50.159
being such a phony when i got up to new

01:50:50.159 --> 01:50:51.840
york

01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:55.440
that i'm i mean

01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:58.480
such a phony

01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:01.679
it's so crazy like

01:51:01.679 --> 01:51:04.560
what a [ __ ] fake i was and now i look

01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:06.800
back and i go like i was obsessed with

01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:08.000
adam sandler's uh

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.040
comedy album and

01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:14.400
i love like that that the the

01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:17.920
guy in right field the [ __ ]

01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:20.000
set on that one it was yeah that was on

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:20.960
there it was uh

01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:23.440
it was a medium pace was on there like

01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:25.520
all the songs and i played the guitar

01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:28.560
so me and my buddy eddie went

01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:31.920
and i mean we went and scouted

01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:35.119
studio space to do an album

01:51:35.119 --> 01:51:37.520
we had no money like we had no money and

01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:39.119
we thought yeah yeah yeah i thought

01:51:39.119 --> 01:51:40.239
somehow

01:51:40.239 --> 01:51:42.719
someone was gonna go hey man why don't

01:51:42.719 --> 01:51:44.960
we just give you the space

01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:47.440
and then you we'll get we'll produce it

01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:48.560
we just thought

01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:49.840
i don't know what we even thought like

01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:51.679
yeah yeah yeah

01:51:51.679 --> 01:51:53.840
and there was so much fun it was

01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:55.199
probably fun telling people hey we're

01:51:55.199 --> 01:51:56.960
looking for a studio

01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:58.480
it was because you had nothing i felt

01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:00.239
cool being like yeah just checking out

01:52:00.239 --> 01:52:02.960
some studio space not a big deal

01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:04.719
yeah and i mean we we went and met up

01:52:04.719 --> 01:52:06.480
with an improv group

01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:09.599
and auditioned them

01:52:09.599 --> 01:52:12.239
like it was just oh god it was like we

01:52:12.239 --> 01:52:14.880
met with an improv group and then

01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:16.719
my eddie had met them and then he was

01:52:16.719 --> 01:52:18.159
like hey i want to introduce you to them

01:52:18.159 --> 01:52:19.360
they're really cool

01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:21.599
and then i kind of sat with them and

01:52:21.599 --> 01:52:23.840
then kind of auditioned them

01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:26.880
to like to like

01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:29.440
be a part of my group that i didn't have

01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:30.320

01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:34.239
so [ __ ] [ __ ] like of like putting the

01:52:34.239 --> 01:52:36.159
as opposed to doing the work i wanted i

01:52:36.159 --> 01:52:37.280
just thought

01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:39.119
i thought the work was horseshit i

01:52:39.119 --> 01:52:40.560

01:52:43.679 --> 01:52:45.679

people would get upset or it would

02:09:54.239 --> 02:09:55.599
offend people or walk people out of a

02:09:55.599 --> 02:09:56.159
room

02:09:56.159 --> 02:09:58.079

02:10:03.199 --> 02:10:04.800
things that i

02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:06.880
wouldn't take swings at and then shows

02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:08.960
me a different way to do it i used to

02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:10.079
say that with louis

02:10:10.079 --> 02:10:12.400
like louie would do a joke that i'd go

02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:14.239
i'd had that premise but i didn't think

02:10:14.239 --> 02:10:14.719
of

02:10:14.719 --> 02:10:16.719
i didn't sit and think it through you

02:10:16.719 --> 02:10:17.760
know yeah

02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:19.199
doug's bid i think he did it on this

02:10:19.199 --> 02:10:21.520
last special about

02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:23.760
the call center in india did you hear

02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:24.719
that bit

02:10:24.719 --> 02:10:26.960
yeah it's so brilliant it's so brilliant

02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:28.880
and it it at its base

02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:32.079
is a is a is like i called

02:10:32.079 --> 02:10:34.800
tech support joke that's the joke but

02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:36.960
yeah the way his brain reworks that is

02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:38.239
so brilliant you go

02:10:38.239 --> 02:10:41.040
you know what that's what i love about

02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:42.320
that's what i love about

02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:44.000
your your your joke that we were talking

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
about earlier is

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:49.360
it it just was it's the word

02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:51.360
it's it's in that and like the wording

02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:52.480
and i think that's what you and stan

02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:53.679
hope have in common

02:10:53.679 --> 02:10:55.440
the town over is that what you said the

02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:57.840
town over yeah so they're the fastest

02:10:57.840 --> 02:10:59.040
ones

02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:01.679
yeah and it's just like that wording is

02:11:01.679 --> 02:11:02.159
what

02:11:02.159 --> 02:11:04.000
sticks with you and i think like great

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:07.280
wording so many comics don't think

02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:10.880
enough about how they're saying it like

02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:12.639
have the premise but then say it pretty

02:11:12.639 --> 02:11:14.239
also you know are you looking at your

02:11:14.239 --> 02:11:14.960
dad yeah

02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:17.440
i'm so mad i'm so bad about it it's so

02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:18.400
annoying

02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:20.159
it's just so annoying but you just call

02:11:20.159 --> 02:11:21.679
me on the phone

02:11:21.679 --> 02:11:25.360
yes okay that's what he's saying right

02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:26.960
now okay

02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:29.119
yeah i'll go ahead and do he's working

02:11:29.119 --> 02:11:30.880
what should i do

02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:33.360
he's a salesman so what he does now so

02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:35.520
he's on the phone with a guy and he's

02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:37.199
he's already he's old so he's made all

02:11:37.199 --> 02:11:39.040
his connections so all he has to do is

02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:39.920
occasionally just

02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:42.159
check in with people and be their friend

02:11:42.159 --> 02:11:44.719
so he he's an office that he sends like

02:11:44.719 --> 02:11:47.040
two or three emails a day from and

02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:49.679
that's his day

02:11:50.079 --> 02:11:53.119
i i'm sorry i mean we're going to fight

02:11:53.119 --> 02:11:54.480

02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:56.880
can i g

02:11:56.880 --> 02:11:58.480
the uh i would have made i would have

02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:00.560
made a good salesman

02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:02.800
yeah i thought i was okay i sold cars

02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:03.760
right out of college

02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:06.320
and i was a decent salesman yeah but i

02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:08.000
didn't know [ __ ] about cars

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.320
so that hurt everyone saw you

02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:12.320
[ __ ]

02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:16.239
i'm so sorry i don't care

02:12:16.239 --> 02:12:21.840

02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:30.800
is like the thing i love about it you

02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:31.199
know

02:12:31.199 --> 02:12:32.639
my favorite thing about rogan's early

02:12:32.639 --> 02:12:34.400
podcast was he had a landline

02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:35.840
that would ring every now and then it

02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:37.840
would just ring he'd be like yeah

02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:39.520
it used to make me giggle that it would

02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:40.960
ring every now and then you go like oh

02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:42.400
like almost like it was like a

02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:44.880
like like oh there's the old land line

02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:45.840
and i missed that

02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:48.960
about the the high the the

02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:52.480
the the [ __ ] structure that he has

02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:53.920
now where it's like

02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:56.320
[ __ ] like that there's no broken

02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:57.920
parts to it anymore you know

02:12:57.920 --> 02:13:00.159
yeah for like a broken part of the

02:13:00.159 --> 02:13:02.239
podcast it's what i love about like

02:13:02.239 --> 02:13:03.440
legion of skanks the last time i did

02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:05.440
legion of skanks it was i

02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:08.400
i i remember being like i can't believe

02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:09.840
people listen to this

02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:11.760
because lewis was just fighting with

02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:14.159
someone in the audience

02:13:14.159 --> 02:13:15.679
and it was like and i was like i was

02:13:15.679 --> 02:13:17.920
like there's this is what's beautiful

02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:19.440
about a podcast is that

02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:22.320
a die-hard fan is sitting there going oh

02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:22.719
[ __ ]

02:13:22.719 --> 02:13:24.560
lewis is doing his thing you know it's

02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:26.639
like you really find the thumbprint of

02:13:26.639 --> 02:13:27.520
the group

02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:30.719
or the of the of the show by the broken

02:13:30.719 --> 02:13:31.760
parts and i remember

02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:35.520
being so high being like being like

02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:37.440
if this was my podcast i'd be like we

02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:38.639
need to fix this

02:13:38.639 --> 02:13:41.199
and we need a camera on this person but

02:13:41.199 --> 02:13:42.400
i was like there's no camera on this

02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:42.960
person

02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:44.880
it's just lewis fighting with a woman

02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:47.119
who has issue with legion

02:13:47.119 --> 02:13:49.840
and then i thought so that that is in

02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:52.000
essence part of this show is that

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:53.880
there are people that feel

02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:55.199
underrepresented

02:13:55.199 --> 02:13:56.960
and lewis is standing up for them

02:13:56.960 --> 02:13:58.719
because this woman is fighting with them

02:13:58.719 --> 02:13:59.599
in essence

02:13:59.599 --> 02:14:01.520
i'm high as [ __ ] at the time and i'm

02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:03.119
going so that's

02:14:03.119 --> 02:14:05.199
like that's it's the beauty of what

02:14:05.199 --> 02:14:06.880
makes a great podcast is

02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:09.119
your listeners tether onto the thing

02:14:09.119 --> 02:14:10.000
that

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:14.159
that they need in you you know of course

02:14:14.159 --> 02:14:17.119
