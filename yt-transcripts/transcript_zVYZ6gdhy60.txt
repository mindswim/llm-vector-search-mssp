Indians speaking of which oh my god I

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.180
was actually doing a little race of

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.250
racist research dude tell you I was

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.130
trying to find out I was trying to see I

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.900
was in a parking lot

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.759
pretty wanted targeted yet something and

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:39.900
I was just like alright I'll wait in the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.000
car in like I don't know what I guess

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.020
whatever we would have been talking

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.610
about something I was like there's gotta

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.290
be real stats that like prove Asians are

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.780
bad at driving I was like try to figure

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.270
out like by auto accidents by ethnicity

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.049
in terms of fatalities Asians are the

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.240
lowest fatalities which expenses they do

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.740
Drive no one so they drive reckless they

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.570
do drive slow they're very technical

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.570
about their driving yeah it looks like

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.130
if you look inside of an agency cars

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.229
like a plug-in boat you only turn like

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.770
two degrees

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.420
so I'm like it--who so Asians were like

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.970
6% or whatever was very low percentage

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.020
of traffic fatalities black white

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.020
Hispanic all tied Wow Native Americans

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.660
yeah its per capita of race yeah Native

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.810
Americans are by far lion by far the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.130
leaders that makes perfect sense

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.930
he thinks number one they booze hardest

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.450
[ __ ] true the most of them are depressed

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.660
yeah most of them are poor and they also

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.030
live on areas with a speed limits like

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.160
90 miles an hour that's true if they get

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.900
into any type of accident that car is

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.020
[ __ ] exploding every time they're

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.030

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:11.000
the massive scale

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.949
but bus crashes because they all have

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:15.199
cameras inside I think one of the first

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:17.120
videos I saw on the internet was like a

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.919
school bus that flipped on its side

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:21.949
and all the kids just fly against the

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:23.479

before an accident yeah only when he

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:17.170
like wow imagine like dedicating your

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.670

her camera do you believe him buddy

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:40.000
you've been to kick her camera I believe

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.839
all men you know as funny is that's just

00:16:43.839 --> 00:16:45.370
as preposterous as believe all women

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.620
it's like to say believe all men

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.110
everyone's like that's ridiculous yeah

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:55.230
but it's like believe all women yeah yes

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.790
women ever lied to me I don't know about

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:01.000
you yeah a woman ever lied to you we

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.640
know it's funny probably not funny thing

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.949
is that maybe before saying that like

00:17:05.949 --> 00:17:07.689
believe all women they had they actually

00:17:07.689 --> 00:17:08.559
there was a thing going around on

00:17:08.559 --> 00:17:11.829
Facebook that was like it was actually

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:14.890
meant to like protect our boys it was

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:16.600
like gonna like an ironic take with the

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.799
hello like the young black kids that got

00:17:17.799 --> 00:17:19.510
killed and then Cavanaugh and it was

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.160
like I guess these guys weren't our boys

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.169
but the one guy who got killed on that

00:17:23.169 --> 00:17:26.410
was Emmett Till it's like yes probably

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:27.850
shouldn't throw the tool man up yeah

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:29.410
because we believed all women on that

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.290
one yeah dude so that's kind of like you

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:34.330
know yeah but the classy response to

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:35.770
that is like well that's very rare it's

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:39.370
like okay then take out the word all you

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:40.900
could be like I believe women most the

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.550
time first

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:46.150
sure you know if you want yes like there

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.620
was a lot of I mean obviously again

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.240
there's a ton of [ __ ] hypocrisy

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.910
especially with a Cavanaugh thing like

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:54.730
someone Trump somebody brought up that

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.590
Trump remember when he took out that ad

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.750
for those there was like four black

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:00.250
teenagers in Central Park that got

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:04.120
falsely accused with rape okay and Trump

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.810
at the time took out like a full-page

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:09.760
and I think the New York Times yeah just

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.830
blasting these dudes the dudes forget

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.230
that we're innocent until proven guilty

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.080
they weren't proven guilty so he was

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.340
guilty he had no idea yeah there's a

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.740
long time ago they did it but then a

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.280
bunch of the left was like oh you mean

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.200
we shouldn't just accuse people that are

quarter they were those guys anyway yeah

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:00.640
that's I mean that's that is like a

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.320
pretty dead to rights thing like yell

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.910

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:06.640
it right now

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.900
it's a Kavanagh dude the [ __ ] cab dog

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.540
is loose bro he's in Supreme Court I

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.180
mean dude again he was he was like the

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:19.450
bushes dogs so everyone like they're all

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:20.800
making up sides on this and it's like

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.360
dude they're all the same [ __ ] it's

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.970
the same group of people and I think he

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:29.320
was considered moderate I've been told I

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.490
don't know if that's what they said in

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.080
the newspaper I do we I think we also

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.570
need to always have this caveat in here

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:35.920
that me and Matt literally know nothing

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.600
no they were trying people they put him

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.040
off it's like he's pretty moderate but I

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.150
think he's been against like gay

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:43.240
marriage sick all his damn life dude is

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.550
they the guy he was asking I'm like oh I

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:47.350
just I figured the guy's name he's like

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:49.060
like a light-skinned black dude he's

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.040
like I just have to know what is your

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.570
position I know you've done fantastic

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:53.440
thanks to the black community

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.850
what is the precision on gay marriage

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:56.080
and he was like Cavanaugh

00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.580
oh well uh and he just wouldn't answer

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.740
he was like I don't know how it got to

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.080
that but it was uh that was funny that

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.130
was the other thing two people were like

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:08.800
well even if he did into it he can't the

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.510
way he reacted you can't have a Supreme

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.190
Court justice react that way and I was I

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:13.660
was just talking about this today and I

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:17.350
was like dude he was getting accused of

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:21.070
rape in front of the entire country yeah

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:22.600
I was like how the [ __ ] would you react

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.100
to that yeah if I was like if I if

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.750
someone disagrees with me on Facebook my

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.640
heart rate goes up to like 140 I'm like

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.400
oh god I didn't like dude if everyone

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.750
the country was like thinking I raped

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:34.210
somebody I'd probably cry on kitte

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:35.950
trying to explode myself I'd be like I

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:39.550
would cry instantly autre so it's like

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.710
yeah but I mean imagine if he responded

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.420
like stoically it'd be like what a

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.860
[ __ ] weirdo if you're responding

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.960

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.610
so I was you know I start doing it I

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:27.580
didn't ask just went straight for the it

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.460
seemed like the right thing to do you

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:31.870
shouldn't ask in that moment plus I

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:33.220
wasn't like showing my dick it was just

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.260
my fat face I mean if someone's telling

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.270
they're getting naked shower yeah I

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:38.650
think that's kind of saying like hey if

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:39.940
you'd like to jerk off right about now

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:41.410
that's exactly right

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:43.840
so then like midway through she starts

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.260
getting a little freaky in there also

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.030
yeah I was like you know I'm jerking off

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:50.950

weapons and like they'd tell if they

00:35:47.869 --> 00:35:49.190
would like put him on a little screen

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:50.839
and he wouldn't send videos over like yo

00:35:50.839 --> 00:35:52.339
we're gonna you guys are gonna help me

00:35:52.339 --> 00:35:53.720
[ __ ] up America I'm gonna send you

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.099
weapons like we're gonna do this

00:35:55.099 --> 00:35:58.640
oh well then [ __ ] him yeah he's coming

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.859
for the US of A I think he might have

00:36:00.859 --> 00:36:03.349
been I'm just a patriot I you this is

00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:06.289
you I'm a [ __ ] staunch Republican

00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:10.089
Adrienne Patriot you're a [ __ ]

00:36:10.089 --> 00:36:14.210
conservative conspiracy theorists I'm a

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:18.170
very staunch Republican I mean my here's

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:18.829
my thing

00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:21.140
I don't know don't dude yeah that's

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:25.849
nothing wrong here so Gaddafi's whole

00:36:25.849 --> 00:36:27.440
point one of them he lost me on the fact

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.670
that like he was talking about like law

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:30.740
and halel you can't like the only law

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.210
you can have is law based off like

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:35.119
religion that's like time out like you

00:36:35.119 --> 00:36:38.329
lost me but his whole thing is that we

00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:40.099
live in a fake democracy because it's

00:36:40.099 --> 00:36:42.470
like we're split up into factions and

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:44.930
then so like say you're a Republican and

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:46.970
the Democrats win the election you're in

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:48.230
kind of like addicted like a

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:50.150
dictatorship in terms of like there's a

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:51.380
thing in government that you don't want

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:51.829
in there

00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:56.359
that has power over its democracy no he

00:36:56.359 --> 00:36:57.890
says true democracy is like a People's

00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:59.750
Congress because it's not it's not even

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:00.770
the the political parties don't

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:01.880
represent you they represent the

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.829
political party so it's like you lose

00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:05.270
representation because they had don't

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:07.910
have your you you have no real power to

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:10.670
like sway policy so his whole thing was

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:12.650
like the Parliament the party system

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:13.940
he's like it's it's a modern-day

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:16.640
dictatorship that just kind of shuffles

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.000
back and forth so he apparently came up

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.589
with a third way he's like I have a way

00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:23.510
between communism and capitalism no

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:24.500
that's my new thing right now is

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.630
figuring out what is economics he gotten

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:28.069
that far the book to figure it out I

00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:29.930
don't know I haven't got enough his

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:31.190
books only two hours I'm on an hour

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:33.319
thorough and he I have a lively video of

00:37:33.319 --> 00:37:37.369
how his book well you know you know they

00:37:37.369 --> 00:37:39.400
let him read that green book at like

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.289
un conference like I bro you can read

00:37:41.289 --> 00:37:42.760
your book and they came and did it and

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:46.260
they'd [ __ ] stuck a stick up his ass

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:52.020
but no I am I I think I came up with

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.490
what communism doesn't work everyone

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:56.230
knows that to have like everyone get the

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:58.390
same stuff and it's like it just it

00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:59.789
doesn't work

00:37:59.789 --> 00:38:03.069
capitalism is sick it works but my thing

00:38:03.069 --> 00:38:06.069
is the whole goal of it is to have it's

00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:07.420
like well if we all do this everyone

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:09.789
will be rich and wal chill which it has

00:38:09.789 --> 00:38:11.020
been increasing the standard of living

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:14.020
but with the population if 8 billion

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:15.579
people live like North America the world

00:38:15.579 --> 00:38:17.470
would explode there's no way you can

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:19.569
hold it so it's like that's why I'm just

00:38:19.569 --> 00:38:20.890
trying to do the hard work dude figure

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:22.900
out the uh I hope y'all now

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:24.940
dude I'm reading this other book right

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:26.650
kind of banking on you figure that I

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:28.059
think I can you don't I'm gonna kill

00:38:28.059 --> 00:38:31.450
myself okay hurry up good because I was

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:34.240
actually I'm reading another book right

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:37.329
now called Straw Dogs by John Gray and

00:38:37.329 --> 00:38:39.190
he's John Gray and he's this dude who

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:42.460
saying that like science human progress

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.140
is a myth like sight like the fact that

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.150
like people think like they're like

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:47.619
religions [ __ ] I'm a secular

00:38:47.619 --> 00:38:50.140
humanism and I'd like we're gonna use

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.819
science and we're gonna take control of

00:38:51.819 --> 00:38:53.260
our fate with science this guy's like

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.270
that's just a spin off of Christianity

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:56.980
he's a humans aren't special and you're

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:58.750
not going to like human beings aren't

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:00.039
gonna be able control their humans are

00:39:00.039 --> 00:39:01.660
special and they do control their

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.609
environment he's saying it's all [ __ ]

00:39:03.609 --> 00:39:06.039
it's it's a total [ __ ] myth it's a

00:39:06.039 --> 00:39:07.960
fairy tale it's not a fish it's a chime

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:12.069
era dude this is no chime era and you

00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:14.109
know what's funny too this is something

00:39:14.109 --> 00:39:15.190
he brought up that kind of cracked me up

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:17.380
so you know how people like so driving

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:18.369
everyone's like well check out

00:39:18.369 --> 00:39:20.289
technology like I can drive and I can

00:39:20.289 --> 00:39:23.109
get like somewhere and five hours you

00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:24.880
know that would have taken us you know

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.849
twenty five hours to walk or whatever

00:39:26.849 --> 00:39:30.400
like this when you factor in all that if

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.200
you take a person on the median median

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.329
income like the basic amount of money

00:39:34.329 --> 00:39:36.010
when you factor in the time they have to

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:38.020
work for the gas they're caught to

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.000
afford the car to pay it off and

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.039
everything all the all the price and

00:39:42.039 --> 00:39:43.990
time you spend in like putting time into

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:45.670
have a car and gas and insurance and all

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:47.950
that if you take the say you take

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:50.349
fifteen hundred miles and you take the

00:39:50.349 --> 00:39:51.730
time it would take to walk and then you

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:53.140
take the time it takes to drive mine

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.579
all the time you take to work and afford

00:39:54.579 --> 00:39:56.559
that car yeah it comes out to the speed

00:39:56.559 --> 00:39:58.059
of walking right well here let me let me

00:39:58.059 --> 00:40:01.299
come back that because let me come back

00:40:01.299 --> 00:40:03.730
that because I just read a book called

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:05.319
the indifferent stars above

00:40:05.319 --> 00:40:07.569
yeah about the Donner Party yeah and

00:40:07.569 --> 00:40:09.339
cars are pretty good in they ate each

00:40:09.339 --> 00:40:11.019
other and transportation that we have

00:40:11.019 --> 00:40:14.559
now is pretty good go back to the wagons

00:40:14.559 --> 00:40:17.440
and walking I personally yes I told you

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.480
I want to do a red horse dude I didn't

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.680
read that book I listened to one pocket

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:22.359
that's pretty sick though but yeah this

00:40:22.359 --> 00:40:23.769
guy's whole point is that like ya know

00:40:23.769 --> 00:40:25.809
the technology definitely works but it's

00:40:25.809 --> 00:40:27.519
all coming at a price of something and

00:40:27.519 --> 00:40:28.839
that price is we're just completely

00:40:28.839 --> 00:40:31.000
destroying our environment and he says

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.670
the population of the people and I never

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:34.869
really like stuff like this that much

00:40:34.869 --> 00:40:38.950
but the pie he predicts by 2150 if you

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:41.049
follow our population it's similar to

00:40:41.049 --> 00:40:43.539
like that of like a like a viral or

00:40:43.539 --> 00:40:46.390
bacterial infection yuck check this out

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:49.119
but he was like if you know if it is you

00:40:49.119 --> 00:40:50.680
guys I'm not so I'm not sold that it is

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:53.890
but if it if it follows that same bell

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:57.549
curve in terms of like you know in

00:40:57.549 --> 00:40:59.980
decrease yeah he's like by 2150 we'll be

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.470
down like a billion people he's

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:04.690
predicting like in 150 years we're going

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:06.190
to I have like six billion people

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:12.549
despite dust yeah yeah I really before

00:41:12.549 --> 00:41:14.680
bed every night I'm just like yeah I'll

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.710
be dead [ __ ] it true but unless the

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:19.509
patreon keeps growing and then you and

00:41:19.509 --> 00:41:21.099
me are able to [ __ ] take control of

00:41:21.099 --> 00:41:23.859
our destiny if the patreon continues at

00:41:23.859 --> 00:41:26.619
this rate by 2150 you and me are gonna

00:41:26.619 --> 00:41:28.809
be immortal dictators we could buy like

00:41:28.809 --> 00:41:30.789
you know we buy like a water filtration

00:41:30.789 --> 00:41:34.359
system yeah it lives to like 2157 or

00:41:34.359 --> 00:41:36.670
something we could set up a comment yeah

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:39.160
just shat nation yeah we could who would

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:43.140
