WEBVTT

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.909
what's up brother what you doing holy

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.690
[ __ ] hell yeah myself I'm in my basement

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.820
- doing the same exact thing that's

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.559
what's up

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.929
how you been pretty good man right yeah

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.789
not bad I'm on I'm on break for school

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.369
so that's been good I just uh submitted

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.590
a paper earlier it was nearly rejected

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.750
but the professor allowed it to pass

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.699
which was funny for me it's great

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.439
through what's up yes that's all you

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.369
needed

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.380
well I think your your work you're

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.630
working toward you know what sort of a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.300
professional designation to allow you to

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.059
psychotherapy people technically I'd be

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.219
a licensed clinical social worker after

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.489
two years of supervised practice so

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.860
right I just I handed in a paper again I

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.989
I considered it a masterpiece she

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.940
considered it barely passing so it was

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.550
like a great will agree to disagree on

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.010
that one but yeah yeah she didn't like

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.570
the content but either way I'm kind of

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.090
you know I'm that whole process that

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.400
whole part of it so like Social Work is

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.049
like I guess it would be like kind of

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.740
psychodynamic they're typically it's

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.140
like psychodynamic therapy but with a

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.350
strong bent towards like kind of like

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.210
sociological kind of macro concepts if

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.549
that makes sense

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.430
yeah well you have to put in the hours

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.860
like you need a cure of clinical hours

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.079
before you have your ticket yep I would

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.360
need to do two years where I'd be like

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.159
you know I'd have to pay a licensed

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.680
social worker to supervise my cases and

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.320
have two years I could potentially get a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.689
license although it's been brought up to

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.640
me that I might not get approved because

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.939
of my malicious online presence so we'll

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.630
see you yeah I mean obviously well no

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.299
not really because they um well yeah I

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.219
guess it is but they told me that you

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.659
know they told the class that you can

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.340
just call it anyone can call themselves

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.149
a psychotherapist so it's like I just

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.649
wouldn't be able to panel for insurance

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.099
which would suck yeah well yeah that's

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.660
right like in the meantime you can call

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.120
yourself you know a wellness coach right

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.210
exactly

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.450
and our mystic or whatever and but there

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.940
is a liability I guess yeah no that's

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.830
true that is true but yeah that's the

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.150
thing that kind of sucks we'll say like

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.620
I said I'm gonna sit down for the I'm

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.510
gonna sit down for the licenses and all

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.210
that stuff because I just like I mean it

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.370
the the like the Code of Ethics is the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.960
my like right I had to write a report on

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.580
the Code of Ethics like which is

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.020
hilarious is like [ __ ] like I'm in

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.570
sixth grade but I had to do a report on

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:38.950
the Code of Ethics in order to stay in

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.350
school so they're just like it's like

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.300
the most flimsiest like weirdest

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.130
subjective stuff you could think of and

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.360
then they're like it at the end of it it

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.250
comes down to like and these matters

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.050
will be decided by you know the bodies

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.420
who are in charge and it's it's just

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.620
like it's like it's just crazy the the

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.270
ethical considerations are just like

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.640
it's like be good and it's like okay

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.890
like very good am I good or not well

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.230
that's pretty [ __ ] man so you've been

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.340
you've been dogs kind of you know yes I

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.170
don't I don't know that I don't know the

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.380
details you know a short of like some

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.050
CNN articles and you know I'm not

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.930
especially interested in getting into it

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.570
sure and in no way do you know do I sort

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.510
of condone that type of stuff listen I

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.850
listen to Chapo okay I'm very aggressive

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:37.660
ya know I I don't I don't know what what

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.120
went on there but you know the reason

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.190
why I'm interested in sort of what

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.250
you're doing is that you know from my

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.060
perspective we have a huge need for for

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.060
psychotherapy and people sort of

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.750
mainstream medicine I think is sort of

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.330
locally incompetent in terms of

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.350
addressing those needs I mean most I've

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.400
been feeling like a poser

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.040
why so here's my situation I inherited a

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.810
practice where you know without and of

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.530
course I would never discuss patient

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.430
identifiers or patient specifics but

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.690
where you know there's demographics

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.070
let's say you know your

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.030
postmenopausal woman who is struggling

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.830
with her sexual identity and you know

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.770
it's depressed and here you are as a you

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.370
know let's say a 30-something or trying

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.460
to to talk them through their problem

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.250
you don't have the life experience you

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.770
don't have the training and you don't

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.240
have the you don't have the willpower

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.600
you don't you know you like trying to

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.860
you know even bring myself to

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.730
understanding this woman's issue in 15

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.920
minutes which is sort of the constraints

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.970
that we have is it's totally unrealistic

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.620
so that's where the therapists come in

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.940
so I've been shopping around in my in my

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.530
you know small city we'll call it and

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:26.920
there is no government covered options

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.630
for these people and the the the folks

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.390
with any professional designation are

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.900
are running you know $100 an hour so

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.960
it's prohibitive for especially people

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.790
that are personality disordered and

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.290
therefore can't even get along in the

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.090
workplace right there's they're sort of

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.990
by definition non functioning and our

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.190
huge burden on on on the taxpayer in

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.920
terms of all the the social well for it

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.800
welfare that they need to sort of you

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.440
know exist so anyway I don't know what

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.120
the solution has been well someone you

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.710
say just just to clarify when you say

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.360
personality disorder you talking like

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.070
borderline personality or like character

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.230
disorder like what I know I mean I know

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.250
what you're talking about I just want to

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.390
make sure it's clear for people who are

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.810
listening yeah you know I think that by

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.730
far and away the most challenging

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.490
patients are the borderlines and and the

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.380
narcissistic personality disorder and

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.080
then maybe do a lesser degree dependent

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.730
but I think it's fair to say I don't

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.140
know what your experience has been that

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.930
you know the people that we sort of

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.510
highlight are the are the borderlines

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.610
sure because they have you know they

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.520
tend to have tumultuous relationships

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.920
with any of their

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.710
their care providers or the people that

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.710
sort of support them in the Social

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.410
Welfare sort of system right there

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.110
they're all about and again I'm sorry

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.270
for making these as a generalization but

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.640
sort of by definition are about

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.330
externalizing responsibility they have

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.720
no sense of you know personal locus of

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.560
control

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.390
so they're looking for someone to blame

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.660
and those those relationships become

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.520
super hard to navigate because they're

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.380
like hey you know you said that this

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.600
[ __ ] SSRI was going to make me feel

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.170
better

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.090
and I still feel like [ __ ] I'm still

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.920
slitting my wrists and still showing up

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.930
to the emergency department every other

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.600
week what are you doing wrong why aren't

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.090
you as my doctor taking care of me okay

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.430
yeah no that makes did you ever have you

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.600
ever read the look at the road less

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.680
traveled no I'm pretty good it's an old

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.700
book there's like I think it's written

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.590
70s by psychiatrist and he talks about

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:38.700
like the different like people who have

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.230
you know who are character disordered

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.880
quote unquote versus like neurotics and

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.650
neurotics tend to take excessive

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.150
responsibility where people who have

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.470
character disorders or typically

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.450
personality disorders tend to take zero

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.340
responsibility for what they're doing

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.200
like you know it's kind of like he was

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.370
saying the same thing that people with

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.350
character disorders are like the hardest

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:56.640
people to work with because there's

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.340
unless they take like if unless they

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.980
enter in they grant themselves some sort

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.600
of locus or control of responsibility

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.160
over their own lives it's basically

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.620
pointless on some level I mean it's not

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.850
pointless because you should always try

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:13.190
but it can be futile in those cases

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.470
especially a minute yes especially in 15

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.210
minutes it's like well you're just

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.040
you're listening to them sort of kvetch

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.860
and complaining and i don't have the

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.930
training talk or therapy when you guys

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:26.460
are in school for you know two years

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.320
anyway and then doing whatever your

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.930
[ __ ] ten thousand hours of supervised

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.910
training on the these issues

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:35.790
specifically right mm-hmm I don't have a

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:37.200
clue that's that's why I feel like a

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.090
fraud I feel like a poseur

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.100
well here's it so this is like I've been

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.360
working with so I work with children

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.760
like you know like high schoolers pretty

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.250
much and some middle schoolers but the

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.580
thing that this isn't exactly I've been

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.840
thinking exactly what you're saying or

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.070
exactly what you're saying is when

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.329
something I've been thinking about

00:08:54.329 --> 00:08:55.589
like there was a kid I was working with

00:08:55.589 --> 00:08:57.959
who was uh let's say I'll try to mix up

00:08:57.959 --> 00:09:00.629
his say he was afraid of trees right or

00:09:00.629 --> 00:09:01.949
known I wasn't trees say he was afraid

00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:05.160
of like looking at uh it wasn't a school

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.779
trying to I'm trying to get you know I

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:08.069
guess I can say it he's a say he was

00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:10.649
afraid of hospitals right every time due

00:09:10.649 --> 00:09:11.999
to a traumatic experience in his life

00:09:11.999 --> 00:09:13.559
he's afraid of hospitals every time he

00:09:13.559 --> 00:09:16.170
passes one he sees a hospital total like

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.850
he gets what is basically like an

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.889
anxiety response and just can't look at

00:09:19.889 --> 00:09:21.540
it so I'm working with him kind of

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.189
exposing him to the idea of like making

00:09:23.189 --> 00:09:24.839
himself look and like counting down the

00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:26.189
seconds and stopping when it's too

00:09:26.189 --> 00:09:28.049
uncomfortable so I'm doing all this work

00:09:28.049 --> 00:09:29.759
with him using all the exposure therapy

00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:32.009
and all this fancy [ __ ] and then he

00:09:32.009 --> 00:09:32.999
comes in like two days

00:09:32.999 --> 00:09:35.220
next week comes in he goes oh yeah yeah

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.660
I'm fine I can look at hospitals now and

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.399
it's like well like how you know I'm

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:39.629
like hell yeah I'm the best I'm like

00:09:39.629 --> 00:09:42.389
what happened he was like whoa I tried

00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:44.040
the week before I couldn't do it and

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.569
then the next week I was doing it my

00:09:45.569 --> 00:09:47.639
friend asked me he was like hey what are

00:09:47.639 --> 00:09:48.839
you doing and I was like oh and he

00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:50.639
explained like you know I'm scared of

00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:52.019
hospitals this is why I'm scared of

00:09:52.019 --> 00:09:53.970
hospitals and I've been told I like try

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.829
to look at them as long as I can and his

00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:56.999
friend was like oh I'll do it with you

00:09:56.999 --> 00:09:58.919
and this kid he's like I after that my

00:09:58.919 --> 00:09:59.790
friend was doing it with me it was

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.040
totally fine so it's like no therapist

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.449
can you know if they're just gonna do

00:10:03.449 --> 00:10:05.610
set that's something irreversible in

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.470
therapy that people just like don't

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.299
think about how is that so strong to

00:10:09.299 --> 00:10:10.709
have a friend do something with you and

00:10:10.709 --> 00:10:12.149
you have to pay a guy hundred

00:10:12.149 --> 00:10:13.919
seventy-five bucks to listen to you I'm

00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:15.989
just like I said I'm kind of like I'm at

00:10:15.989 --> 00:10:17.160
the point where I just want to work on

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.439
developing peer counseling networks cuz

00:10:19.439 --> 00:10:21.779
it's like I just don't buy that like you

00:10:21.779 --> 00:10:23.459
know I think it's more of a personality

00:10:23.459 --> 00:10:26.040
type than like a trained I mean I guess

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.540
over the hours and hours of experience

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.279
you do get proficient and like how to

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:31.290
help people but like I don't know man I

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.249
think there's a lot of people who could

00:10:32.249 --> 00:10:33.619
probably sit there for 20 years getting

00:10:33.619 --> 00:10:36.269
$175 an hour not really producing any

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:38.850
sort of tangible benefit or very minimal

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.169
right now and I hear that and I mean but

00:10:43.169 --> 00:10:45.749
I mean I guess there's there's probably

00:10:45.749 --> 00:10:48.360
an evidence base around for example like

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.439
peer support so in that case you know

00:10:51.439 --> 00:10:54.179
you saw that you sort of saw that

00:10:54.179 --> 00:10:56.279
practically applied I mean it's

00:10:56.279 --> 00:10:58.949
certainly true that I'm like DBT or

00:10:58.949 --> 00:11:02.929
dialectical based therapy as far as

00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:05.999
borderline personality I think has the

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:07.680
most evidence but

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.600
you know can anyone really well define

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.010
that therapy or those groups of

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:19.110
therapies so you know III sat in on on a

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.120
personality disorder service because I'm

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.860
trying to better understand these people

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.560
and sort of my vain attempts to help

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.180
them mm-hmm and it's amazing how in this

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.209
group setting they sort of developed

00:11:33.209 --> 00:11:38.910
this culture of victimization and

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:42.060
they're all very fluent with sort of the

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.760
the lexicon of the therapies so they

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.250
talk about things like action urges and

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.560
things that that you'll be familiar with

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.390
but yeah that question that's right at

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:52.980
the end of the sessions it's like okay

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.890
well what did we accomplish here today

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:59.060
and and how how is this going to change

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.700
you know this individual is sort of

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.640
patience outcome but certainly that like

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.730
you spoke about making pure or

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:11.760
facilitating peer support networks at

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.810
least that sort of scalable yeah as

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:19.709
opposed to sort of one-on-one you know

00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:22.320
you get some guy laying down on a

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.810
[ __ ] couch and you smoke your pipe

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.630
and and you know analyze his dreams like

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.180
that's you sure for the Select view that

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:34.740
we'll have the insurance or or or you

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.600
know have access to that level of

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.490
therapy that's one thing but certainly

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.320
not the majority of people yeah the

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.120
majority the people who are mandated

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.260
therapy where they don't get to choose

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.870
who they go to they just have to show up

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.279
and like they're just matched with some

00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:49.200
random person who they probably or might

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.720
not like very much so it's like yeah in

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.410
that case it can kind of be a disaster

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:58.079
yeah yes they're being forced into it

00:12:58.079 --> 00:13:01.380
yeah they keep you noted to keep their

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.770
job or or whatever it may be but I don't

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:07.020
know I don't think that's to say that

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.490
you know as a field you know I don't

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.079
think that there's a lot that there's

00:13:13.079 --> 00:13:15.510
value in sort of formal training one of

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.740
the things for example I was surprised

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.990
to learn about was sort of the impact of

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.810
of early childhood experience and even

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:27.330
the value of sort of exploring early

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:32.930
childhood trauma as sort of a

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:37.250
pathological you know Genesis for for

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.690
personality disorders mm-hm

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:41.790
and it wasn't it wasn't something that I

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.610
really you know I thought sort of the

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.860
whole like Freudian like like I still

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.390
don't buy the fact that I want to [ __ ]

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:52.440
my mother and sorry yes but like it it's

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.990
certainly true that you know across the

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:57.660
board these people had less than

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.470
supportive parents if not you know

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.830
frankly abusive parents and you know

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.510
that there's a theme where they describe

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:09.810
really like shallow relationships with

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.490
their parents so you know people didn't

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:15.060
take care of them and and and now that's

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:18.930
sort of what they seek all the time that

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.540
is someone to to take care of them and

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.130
of course I'm talking about borderline

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:26.400
personalities ordered at this point yeah

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.750
I think it's I think it's pretty

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.120
fascinating so have you done like a lot

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.890
of training in like trauma theory and

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.470
like toxic stress and all that stuff no

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.900
in delay he rode really heroes that's

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.270
see that's like that's all I've done

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.470
that and that that's the one thing I'll

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.300
give my school it's like they hammered

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.040
that into your head which is like to me

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.780
I'm that's the thing that makes the most

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.700
sense being that like you can measure it

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.110
on brain scans you can measure the

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.450
changes in the brain you can write the

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.550
whole idea of like when you grow up in

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:54.750
an environment where you know you're

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.460
either being abuse or or like other

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:57.930
people are being abused like you're

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.000
literally your amygdala grows and like

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.130
when your amygdala and all those fierce

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:04.080
stress responses are fired up you can't

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.360
use your prefrontal cortex you typically

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.950
can't use your prefrontal cortex while

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.840
your amygdalas firing so if your Migdal

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.250
is always pretty like on you're gonna

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.520
mutually inhibitory exactly yeah exactly

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.710
so that that's the thing that makes the

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:17.760
most sense to me and that's the thing

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.330
honestly that is the best scientific

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.980
backing for fir ideon concepts of like

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.900
early childhood because he you know back

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.670
then like you just would compare things

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.110
to what you knew about and like myths

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:30.390
were like their TV shows back then so it

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:32.040
was like of course he's gonna be you

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.300
know he's gonna be I guess if you were

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.590
like you know super and wealthy and

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:35.850
super educated myths

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.160
TV show but it's still like that was

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.480
their comparison so there's a lot of

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.160
like weird [ __ ] that comes along with

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.660
that but the trauma theory to me is like

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.509
almost scientific proof of not even just

00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:47.819
proof us and like flat out but like kind

00:15:47.819 --> 00:15:49.529
of lends itself to agree with a lot of

00:15:49.529 --> 00:15:51.329
those Freudian early childhood like

00:15:51.329 --> 00:15:54.990
psychoanalytic concepts right and

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:57.889
they're borrowing from even more ancient

00:15:57.889 --> 00:16:01.470
concepts like Oedipus and and yeah I

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:04.350
mean there's there's obviously a wisdom

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:07.620
there but yeah but introduces that I was

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:11.579
I was I was skeptical about the about

00:16:11.579 --> 00:16:14.040
that sort of aspect and but that's been

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.899
sort of a good learning experience and I

00:16:15.899 --> 00:16:19.589
and I now here you like of course you

00:16:19.589 --> 00:16:22.560
need to be have like an empathetic

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.569
disposition in order to be in the

00:16:24.569 --> 00:16:26.639
business at all and that may be more

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:31.500
valuable than than the formal knowledge

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.730
and training but what the the quandary

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:41.250
that we're in and it probably is the

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.170
case and in the state student certainly

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:44.490
is you because you guys go towards

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:48.740
single there is that you have you have

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:53.699
this artificial hierarchy where you have

00:16:53.699 --> 00:16:57.029
you know your your dog in my beer

00:16:57.029 --> 00:16:59.220
internal medicine attending who is

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.290
writing the sick notes who is writing

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:04.980
the prescriptions but who has very

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:08.760
little formal training unless they seek

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.780
it out and has it doesn't have the

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.360
capacity in terms of time or the

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.870
resources to really do sort of like an

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:22.289
in-depth diagnosis in terms of all these

00:17:22.289 --> 00:17:24.390
mental health issues and psychiatrists

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.209
are no help yeah not my area anyway

00:17:27.209 --> 00:17:30.360
there's they're so burdened that they're

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.909
there to you know discuss fourth lion

00:17:32.909 --> 00:17:35.870
medications and you know resistant

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.460
schizophrenia they're not there to

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:43.799
explore how you know daddy issues are

00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:45.809
causing this woman not to stay in the

00:17:45.809 --> 00:17:47.309
workplace mm-hmm

00:17:47.309 --> 00:17:49.200
no absolutely absolute

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.210
that's in out like I said I didn't want

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.039
to like I kind of can have an extreme

00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:54.539
language and I didn't want to like say

00:17:54.539 --> 00:17:55.950
like oh you know you don't need any try

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.630
think training is good it's just like

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.090
you know when you medicalize life

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:01.230
problems that you just mentioned like

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.059
you have daddy issues but that can only

00:18:03.059 --> 00:18:04.740
be interpreted through like a medical

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.409
like like you know like the medical gaze

00:18:07.409 --> 00:18:09.750
or I forget who said that like I forget

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:10.889
which there are some theorists who talks

00:18:10.889 --> 00:18:13.889
about that so it's like if you can if

00:18:13.889 --> 00:18:15.659
you have daddy issues it's not really a

00:18:15.659 --> 00:18:17.820
medical problem but can it can seems

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.679
like it can only be dealt with if it's

00:18:19.679 --> 00:18:21.440
tagged with the appropriate like

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.909
disorder quote unquote and then

00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:25.559
insurance will kick in when in reality

00:18:25.559 --> 00:18:27.750
this person might just need like someone

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.610
to model positive relationships to them

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.320
and do all this other stuff that just

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.899
takes a long time that is like outside

00:18:33.899 --> 00:18:35.399
of it when I say training I mean like

00:18:35.399 --> 00:18:37.110
this is what bothers me I've seen

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.639
sometimes in my schooling where people

00:18:38.639 --> 00:18:40.649
are just excited to like pin the tail on

00:18:40.649 --> 00:18:43.950
the donkey and be like boom Oh DD boom

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:45.419
this and that and it's like yeah that's

00:18:45.419 --> 00:18:46.860
cool and all you read through the book

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.480
and like match symptoms up even though

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.950
like most the symptoms are the [ __ ]

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.289
same for like half of them but it you

00:18:52.289 --> 00:18:53.490
know it's just like it right

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:55.590
I'm more into what I want to get into is

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:57.389
more like holistic therapy like I said

00:18:57.389 --> 00:19:00.360
like plant medicine exercise sleep diet

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.159
like all those other things so then I

00:19:02.159 --> 00:19:03.179
deal with people and they're go I've

00:19:03.179 --> 00:19:04.889
only slept like three hours and I ate

00:19:04.889 --> 00:19:07.740
for the last week it's like well your

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.539
that might be a problem you're seriously

00:19:09.539 --> 00:19:10.980
upset I can see why you're upset but

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.559
like if you were to sleep eight hours

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:17.039
there's I'm I'm you know I'm inclined to

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:19.049
believe that a good amount of your

00:19:19.049 --> 00:19:20.639
stress would kind of go away or at least

00:19:20.639 --> 00:19:22.320
be mitigated so it's like I don't

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.820
understand what I mean I understand why

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.070
it was like you're just saying it's all

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.149
kind of filtered through this like

00:19:27.149 --> 00:19:29.399
medical hierarchy but yeah that's kind

00:19:29.399 --> 00:19:30.570
of what I want to get into is like

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.029
having more holistic approaches more

00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:34.889
affordable approaches and a more like

00:19:34.889 --> 00:19:37.620
kind of you know like a more centered

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.110
communal experience for mental health

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:41.940
for people one that's actually good and

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.320
measurable you know that doesn't fall

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.960
prey to all like the [ __ ] absolutely

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.840
man and it's funny because you know for

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.649
many what I would call medical illnesses

00:19:52.649 --> 00:19:57.629
I against alternative medicine you know

00:19:57.629 --> 00:20:00.330
putting crystals in your vagina to clear

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.760
your Crohn's disease or whatever

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.640
well I think it's certainly true that

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.090
for psychiatric or mental health issues

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:14.549
that are so complex and that are so that

00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:16.410
are that are modified by environment

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:18.660
that yeah the old istic approach is

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.000
what's needed so in with your in your

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.840
work with kiddos especially in you know

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.950
even mentioned sort of the label of

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.090
oppositional defiant disorder and all

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:32.610
those the OTD and all the stigma that's

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.980
attached to that do you do you ever get

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.110
the impression that that parents are

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:42.870
trying to to medicalize their shitty

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.900
parenting skills yeah I mean like a lot

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.850
of the parents I've dealt with have been

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:50.130
like responsive so like I'll talk to

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:53.490
them a little bit but my my like uh you

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:54.809
know my interaction with the parents is

00:20:54.809 --> 00:20:56.429
like really limited usually oh if I feel

00:20:56.429 --> 00:20:58.230
like it's like there might like to work

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:59.730
I'm doing totally blocked at home I'll

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:01.350
call the parents to come in but yeah

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:02.669
dude there's a ton of literature about

00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:05.610
like over diagnosis of ADHD over

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:08.100
diagnosis of whatever like OD D and

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.230
these other things are typically

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.660
misinterpreted trauma responses so like

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.700
what if a kids constantly hyper vigilant

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:15.929
looking around the room not paying

00:21:15.929 --> 00:21:18.240
attention in school it might not be ADHD

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.440
as much as is the fact that he's

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.090
constantly aroused and looking for

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.010
danger because his parents are beating

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:24.690
the [ __ ] out of him or passing out drunk

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:26.640
or you know his mom's a prostitute and

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.080
there's always weird people inside so

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.179
like sometimes things that are perceived

00:21:30.179 --> 00:21:32.040
as ADHD and gets the kid just gets

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.600
thrown on pills is the fact that he's

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.890
living in a situation that's like

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:41.309
completely [ __ ] up so yeah exactly and

00:21:41.309 --> 00:21:43.020
then like you were saying it's like it's

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.790
it that it's not even like yeah it could

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.080
be from the parents but it's also like

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.400
the doctor looks at him he goes oh yeah

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.770
they look in a book they looking at DSM

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:52.200
ago oh well this is ADHD clearly without

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.850
asking like what the [ __ ] are you doing

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:55.320
what's going on in your house it's they

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.210
just match symptoms and they go medicine

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:58.620
because I work with kids in the inner

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.419
city and like they're the most they're

00:22:00.419 --> 00:22:02.790
some of the most medicated kids like in

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.790
in in America at all or in America like

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:06.870
they just get pills thrown at them

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:10.650
non-stop of course and they're in the

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:12.990
profit motive is their I mean that sort

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:16.470
of old had stuff but you know

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:19.559
there there's money to be made by

00:22:19.559 --> 00:22:22.440
selling stimulants I don't know man it

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.890
it's it's tricky and so and so you're

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:30.110
starting to envision some some solutions

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:33.419
especially you know as relates to sort

00:22:33.419 --> 00:22:37.980
of peer support networks you know some

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:41.270
things that that I think are exciting

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.650
well no I shouldn't say exciting but

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:45.270
some things that I think are practical

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.730
to get involved and and I'm thinking

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:48.090
about it

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.789
even on a voluntary basis are like

00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:53.429
community sports teams yeah I mean these

00:22:53.429 --> 00:22:55.110
are these are simple and they're not

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.669
especially exciting

00:22:56.669 --> 00:22:59.880
these are simple solutions but you know

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.220
from a cost-effectiveness perspective

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.530
that might be more useful than then

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:07.760
sitting down with your newly graduated

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:12.299
you know doctor that has 15 minutes and

00:23:12.299 --> 00:23:16.289
a prescription pad yeah in terms of

00:23:16.289 --> 00:23:19.049
solving these these these problems well

00:23:19.049 --> 00:23:20.880
it's also like you can use an i I use

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.409
like with a little especially like the

00:23:22.409 --> 00:23:23.610
boy actually at that middle school I

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:25.020
only work with boys but it's like I'll

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.159
do a thing where they have like a tiny

00:23:26.159 --> 00:23:27.780
like a little like arcade basketball

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.059
hoop and I'll teach the mindfulness like

00:23:30.059 --> 00:23:31.890
techniques but while shooting basketball

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:33.419
so I'm like all right take a deep breath

00:23:33.419 --> 00:23:34.590
and I'm like detach yourself from

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:35.880
whether or not it goes in or out and

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.110
just let the ball leave your hand and

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:38.909
it's like this is easy to do and you

00:23:38.909 --> 00:23:40.770
could have entire sports teams based

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:42.390
around kind of mindfulness practices

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:44.730
instead of like something like 45 year

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:46.380
old dude who for some reason needs like

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.419
an 8 year old kids team to win to feel

00:23:48.419 --> 00:23:50.370
good about themselves so it's like it

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:52.620
wouldn't be nice to kind of it would be

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.330
nice to kind of like you know and then

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:55.860
hey he's just retry Mathai zhing kids

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:56.850
being like you're gonna win you gotta

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:59.220
win they're just like ah [ __ ] so yeah

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.480
would be I mean what you're talking

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.159
about be cool to have like in it you

00:24:02.159 --> 00:24:03.900
know people would I guarantee be like oh

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.299
my god shut the [ __ ] up but like adding

00:24:06.299 --> 00:24:07.919
therapeutic elements to sports and you

00:24:07.919 --> 00:24:09.990
know making it I don't know like we you

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:11.370
know Rican sexualizing something I I

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:13.140
just think that like especially for

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.370
little kids it's like well what are they

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:15.809
inherently interested in that you could

00:24:15.809 --> 00:24:18.150
kind of like mold in the way that it's

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:19.679
not forcing them to do stuff and

00:24:19.679 --> 00:24:22.049
honestly to a lot of the stuff that when

00:24:22.049 --> 00:24:22.980
I keep talking about like you know

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.289
communal thing it's just church like

00:24:25.289 --> 00:24:27.090
we're missing church is you know it's

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:30.360
gone awry we need to reconsider

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.910
and then be able to like lynchpin just

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:34.410
communities families all the stuff

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:35.970
around a concept and it's like it

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:38.100
doesn't have to be you know like altar

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.020
boys and weird Latin languages it can

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:42.390
like I like the ancient the Greek thing

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:45.590
I I pray I pray at the altar of man

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:48.900
hilarious dude you seen it you seen it

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.520
you've been on the reddit let's be

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.430
honest for a second it's so you've

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:56.880
you've already started to to you know

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.160
institute these community solutions and

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.460
and there's nothing there's nothing

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:05.100
wrong with you know a group of sort of

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.200
like-minded guys getting on the on the

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.810
red head and and sharing ideas and and

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:13.350
it's it's taken sort of more full form

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:20.550
as far as I can see through calm town so

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:23.760
you like men like there they're all now

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.370
the problem is they're they're they're

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:30.150
sort of ethos is a little bit a little

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:32.670
bit different because there's so much

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:37.200
sort of irony poisoning so I don't think

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.200
that there's the same sort of sense of

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.330
community but it's certainly true that

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:43.710
that beyond sorry you're familiar with

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:51.720
discord yes yeah so you have people with

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:56.250
complex relationships okay these are the

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.580
these are the e this is the e culture

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.920
you know sort of boyfriend-girlfriend

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.460
type of people that are that are signing

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:10.110
on on the compound discord or on the on

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:14.280
the mat and chain discord and learning

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.320
how to interact and here's here's the

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.900
reality and you know I'm sorry for for

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.150
the listeners but these might be these

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.370
might be basement dwellers a lot of them

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:24.960
right these might be people there

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.080
they're playing too many video games

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.120
okay and maybe you have maybe are a

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.880
little bit personality disordered but

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:37.020
it's a way for people to you know learn

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.850
how to interact with each other a little

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:42.630
bit better if in the case of it maybe

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.100
I'm speculating in the

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.679
of some of the come town discord folk

00:26:46.679 --> 00:26:48.900
and then and then like you're pointing

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.690
and then maybe with a little more sort

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:54.330
of fully formed communities where

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:58.230
there's a little bit more of an ethic on

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:00.630
reddit for example you know you're

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:03.090
already establishing these peer support

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:06.750
networks and giving people purpose and

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.720
giving people such meaning no I think

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.820
that's huge yeah yeah I appreciate that

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.650
and it is and again it's not even it's

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:15.150
not a slight to be like you know there

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:17.640
are a contingent of any online community

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.590
that pretty much are I would say people

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:21.360
who might be not like it agoraphobic but

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.010
might just kind of be in this little box

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:24.870
and cube and kind of unsure of how to

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.490
proceed in the world you know which a

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:27.929
lot of that goes back to your wake what

00:27:27.929 --> 00:27:29.010
were your parents like what do they

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:30.299
teach you or do they teach you the world

00:27:30.299 --> 00:27:32.159
was like through their behavior because

00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:34.710
as a six-year-old kid if your parents

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:36.900
say they don't like you that's the world

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.970
saying the world does not like you and

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:39.960
then you you know you carry that on

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.940
throughout your life but ya know I think

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.830
I think you're right I think there is a

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.200
huge opportunity for you know for people

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.720
to kind of try to not redefine

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.400
themselves but like filter themselves

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.419
through these different online

00:27:51.419 --> 00:27:52.830
communities and kind of like you know

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:55.049
challenge and poke themselves or even

00:27:55.049 --> 00:27:56.549
just fine so lit like you're you know

00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:57.570
you're reading all this stuff and

00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:59.100
there's seems to be there's a large

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.720
faction of the world who are viewing the

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.799
world in a way that you don't

00:28:01.799 --> 00:28:03.059
particularly like and then you can kind

00:28:03.059 --> 00:28:05.280
of retreat back to like a little

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.419
comforting I know a they'll be like shut

00:28:06.419 --> 00:28:07.830
up it's not a comfort zone [ __ ] you dude

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:09.419
you're [ __ ] gay but it's like it's a

00:28:09.419 --> 00:28:10.830
comfort zone on some respect you you

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:13.919
come back yeah exactly it's like it's

00:28:13.919 --> 00:28:15.600
kind of embryonic in some sense then

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.159
come fall back into a bunch of people

00:28:17.159 --> 00:28:18.780
who most likely agree with you even

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.520
though they fight a lot there's so much

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:25.380
infighting on the sub but there's

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.090
something there's something Sarah punic

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:30.150
about being as you know like it's I

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:32.280
don't know like I think those there's a

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.309
lot of kind of healthy healthy [ __ ] talk

00:28:35.309 --> 00:28:37.470
sure no absolutely man have you me I'm

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:38.700
sure you've met people who can't take

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.380
like a joke and all and it's like it

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.240
does they don't fare well in social

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.720
situations yeah but no it meant we're

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.960
all praying at the altar of banchon so

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.940
here's the thing like I grew up without

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:58.070
without any any real religion outside of

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:00.150
outside of being what you know like a

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:02.130
choir Borah choir boy

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:06.570
mm-hmm here we are kind of holidays

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.990
holiday season now and that's been

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:13.550
difficult like I think I had you know

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:17.940
the Western you know moral ethics just

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.430
drilled into me by you know watching TV

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:23.130
and stuff like that but but certainly I

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:26.430
never had a faith and that's that's

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:29.010
definitely been difficult for me I think

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:32.930
that my family was sort of you know

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:34.760
reactionary

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:38.780
atheists and sort of extreme from that

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.790
perspective and it was weird growing up

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:45.200
like so I heard your little your little

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.180
twill turn trills you you were you in

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.950
the choir as well no I was an altar boy

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.290
but I I know I were an altar boy yeah I

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:53.520
was know I grew up when I was in the

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.320
choir for like I quit because I didn't

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.180
want to do a solo even though I Kylie

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:57.990
you're great it's like the most

00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:59.970
regrettable mistake in my childhood

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:02.040
because I'm not a bad singer so I could

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.260
have wowed my class with my pipes and I

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:06.030
just bitched out yeah in seventh grade

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:08.400
and I heard [ __ ] man if I still sweat

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.930
I'm like what a [ __ ] I was in seventh

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:11.130
grade but yeah I had the opposite

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.170
experience I was like if I masturbate

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:14.070
I'm going to hell

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:15.870
I had like it I had like a taste of like

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:17.610
the Old Testament God for the first like

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:19.530
seven years of my life and then was just

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:23.130
kind of like but yeah and you were the

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:24.900
opposite you grew up with like serious

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.700
atheists which is what is that way cuz

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.790
that's yeah that foreign to me well it

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:32.010
was [ __ ] and it was [ __ ] being part

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:34.200
of the choir for example where were you

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.390
know singing you know fall on your knees

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:39.150
you know praise be to God you know the

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:41.490
King has come type of thing and I'm

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:44.160
trying to reconcile that and and you

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.120
know scenes of Bethlehem with palm trees

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.900
and baby Jesus with Santa but you know

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.500
Santa was Santa was the pantheon of gods

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.990
that I was comfortable with and I

00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:59.820
thought that was I was from like

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.130
coca-cola or something like that I had

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:04.080
no [ __ ] idea what these guys were

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.230
going on about and and I was a flyer

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:07.920
sorry

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.509
why were you

00:31:08.509 --> 00:31:11.059
quiet because I had a beautiful singing

00:31:11.059 --> 00:31:15.440
voice hell yes yeah until until my voice

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.449
cracked I swear they would have

00:31:17.449 --> 00:31:20.269
castrated me if I kept going and it's

00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:26.059
gorgeous yeah yeah but I couldn't and

00:31:26.059 --> 00:31:28.459
the thing is is that we brought like our

00:31:28.459 --> 00:31:33.199
you know I remember sort of a snide sort

00:31:33.199 --> 00:31:36.709
of smug attitude of let all these people

00:31:36.709 --> 00:31:40.070
are sort of delusional but you couldn't

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:43.849
but help get caught up in the spirit of

00:31:43.849 --> 00:31:47.899
it right and and and and singing

00:31:47.899 --> 00:31:50.599
together and and sort of the glory of it

00:31:50.599 --> 00:31:52.699
and the wonder of it and I mean

00:31:52.699 --> 00:31:54.889
obviously I'm not to give my folks

00:31:54.889 --> 00:31:56.690
credit that's that's been part of why

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:58.909
they had me involved but yeah so now we

00:31:58.909 --> 00:32:01.579
don't have that I mean I don't is it

00:32:01.579 --> 00:32:03.829
still is it still politically accessible

00:32:03.829 --> 00:32:06.049
to sing Christmas carols or is that I

00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:07.999
don't think that's PC anymore well

00:32:07.999 --> 00:32:09.799
there's a well no there's a couple like

00:32:09.799 --> 00:32:11.809
it baby it's cold outside it's slightly

00:32:11.809 --> 00:32:13.309
off limits even though I don't think I

00:32:13.309 --> 00:32:15.019
would do yeah I don't know I don't think

00:32:15.019 --> 00:32:16.609
you would go to somebody's house and I

00:32:16.609 --> 00:32:18.169
try to entice them with that one like if

00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:19.459
you started singing baby it's cold

00:32:19.459 --> 00:32:21.469
outside that someone's the neighbor's

00:32:21.469 --> 00:32:25.009
door that'd be kind of funny but no I

00:32:25.009 --> 00:32:26.599
think like I don't know why I think

00:32:26.599 --> 00:32:28.190
people would you know people started

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:29.690
walking around Christmas caroling and

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:30.949
all that stuff I think most people would

00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:32.959
be kind of like oh that's nice

00:32:32.959 --> 00:32:35.359
I mean I did it yeah things out yes we

00:32:35.359 --> 00:32:37.099
did a musical theater so we had a music

00:32:37.099 --> 00:32:39.379
therapist come and like they like came

00:32:39.379 --> 00:32:41.239
into the class and without even speaking

00:32:41.239 --> 00:32:43.279
started singing is like a little like

00:32:43.279 --> 00:32:44.780
you know like boom

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:47.360
like like introducing themselves like my

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.250
name is blah blah but and all that stuff

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:52.520
and it was funny because the class froze

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.470
and then like she got us all to

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:55.910
introduce ourselves we had to sing our

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:57.470
names and then keep patting the rhythm

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:59.060
on the desk while we did it it instantly

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.650
centers an entire group it's um it's

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:02.390
like the most was my attention drift

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:04.970
very like hard and I was like zeroed in

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:06.380
after we did that little like quick

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.510
little singing and like death strumming

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:11.030
exercise and I was like my attention was

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:12.920
seized for 45 minutes like I was like

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.720
rapturously listening to this lady and

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.780
is taking in all her words just like oh

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:19.760
and it's better than adderall dude it's

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.640
crazy it's it's crazy how simple that is

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.410
and how well that like zapped me and

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.300
because I don't think I have ADHD but I

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.310
could I'll be willing to bet that if a

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:30.350
doctor assessed me I have you know forms

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:32.240
of a DD or whatever I definitely would

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.400
have come up positive for that but it's

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.080
like dude I did that with that lady and

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.970
I was zeroed in being like your blood

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:38.990
I'm sorry sir

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:44.240
your blood tests come back but no but

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.950
exactly yeah I think we all come back

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:48.820
positive for yet some aspects of that

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.940
diagnosis but yeah so you found that

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:54.920
that it was a way especially in a group

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.480
setting to get everyone sort of on the

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.700
same wavelength and everyone was vibing

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:00.890
yeah for me at least there's a lot of

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:02.420
everyone bitched out no one would sing

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:03.650
along with the song which kind of

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:05.030
bothered me because it's like seriously

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:07.130
you guys know the whole everyone just be

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.409
moans like Western civilization so rigid

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:11.060
and it's like alright here we go we're

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.409
all gonna sing together you don't want

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:13.880
to do this now it's like goddammit that

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.159
pit that kind of bothered me but the but

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:18.470
yeah there is something like it profound

00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:20.570
the simplicity of sitting in a group of

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:22.250
people and you know as you know as it's

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:24.560
been kind of like made to be kind of

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.750
silly like to have a drum circle but

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:28.100
like dude if you got me six people and

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:29.480
some drums I would sit there for four

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.340
hours and drum and [ __ ] sing I would

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.860
love to do that and it's so easy to do

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:35.840
and I'm sure if you were to hook people

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.850
up to bio markers before and afterwards

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:39.740
our blood pressure would drop and our

00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:41.210
you know whatever else our cortisol

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:42.980
would drop it's like a simple thing

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.540
people can do together that were for

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.730
some reason kind of like super hesitant

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:51.740
about her shirt oh well I mean we're we

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:56.030
those those institutions are are falling

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:58.500
apart right I mean church attendance

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.080
his way down that's not that I mean like

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.430
[ __ ] man don't get me wrong

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:04.680
like I'm not I don't have the first clue

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.360
and for all I know it's probably boring

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.040
it's [ __ ] to sit through a storm and

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.590
there's no but there's a there yeah

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:13.470
there's a there's something there's

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:15.330
something missing I mean there's always

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:17.940
going to be sort of societal pathology

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.300
but as we become more digital and more

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:25.320
isolated it's becoming more difficult to

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.320
get together and to teach each other and

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.300
to support each other as peers and and

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:31.920
maybe that's why we're moving toward

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.750
these online solutions

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:37.140
I mean Facebook's worked well speaking

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.050
of Facebook you know one of the

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:42.660
recommendations so new dad how far along

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:47.850
is your baby uh you'll be here March

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:51.600
first according to the estimates so

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.840
you're right you're a no dad you said

00:35:53.840 --> 00:36:03.030
yeah I found that yeah so it's

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:05.970
definitely the first four months I mean

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:09.050
it's hilarious to complain as a dad but

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:12.120
the first the first four months or I

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:15.300
found especially difficult and so the

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:18.420
and and you know and no one has kids

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:19.100
anymore

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.540
everyone delays their kids until they're

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:23.730
like fifty years old or 45 year old

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:26.100
forty-five years old so you know no one

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:30.150
in my peer group had kids so I I went

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:33.030
online then I had to go online that make

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:36.990
sense I found I found huge community

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:40.710
support for the first time I didn't

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:43.290
anticipate those on Facebook and so

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:47.030
there's there's groups for for new dads

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:51.240
and they there's a you know like a hive

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.780
mind that you can consult with practical

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:59.880
questions with you know with someone to

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.460
sort of support you and that was hugely

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:05.250
useful yeah that's really Edie's cool

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:06.420
then it that's the thing about online

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:09.120
that's like you really can't like speak

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.760
badly of is that hive mind aspect where

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.270
it's like I

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:15.300
put out a question and like maybe 2500

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.340
people within the span of a half an hour

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.170
or formulate a piece of the response

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:20.430
that I need it's like you can't you

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:21.840
can't touch that in terms of like

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:27.600
getting that elsewhere yeah I mean yeah

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.690
I mean they can't hug you but but short

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:33.990
of that it was it's a pretty supportive

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:36.090
environment so how are you gonna raise

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:37.530
your and how are you going to mold them

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:40.320
in terms that they're there are you

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.670
gonna circumcise I don't know it's a

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:43.290
little girly little girl thank God

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:45.330
because that's that's a big bit that's a

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:46.650
big beef between me and my wife right

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:48.180
now I'm saying no circumcision I'm

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.790
saying it's unnecessary you can decide

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:52.950
later it's history I was just reading an

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:55.590
article about like and there's an

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:56.940
article in the Atlantic like what boys

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:59.070
need to learn you know what boys need to

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:00.660
learn about being a man and it was like

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:03.120
little boys for some reason report like

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:05.070
wanting to be like tall and strong and

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:07.080
rich and like we don't know why where

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:10.770
that's come from and it's like yeah yeah

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:12.060
and it's like really like you don't know

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.710
where that's come from it's like okay

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:15.240
it's like like in every dating profiles

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.130
like must not must be this tall and like

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:18.480
if you guys are like oh he's rich it's

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.340
like that's the one that whatever that's

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:21.300
a whole difference so I'm not even

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.730
sidetracked in that but the but with the

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:25.770
whole like you know people finding you

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:27.060
know they're seeking their level and

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.740
everything I'm like obsessed with this

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:33.900
idea of building like a form of some

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.880
form of church community center whatever

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.550
you want to call it that has like some

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:40.110
form program or would be like you know

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:43.650
you'd have like affordable daycare in

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:44.640
there because it would be you know it'd

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.140
all be kind of pure controlled with like

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.760
other people you kind of interact with

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.260
so it'd be like somewhere where people

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.690
could exercise somewhere people could do

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:53.610
like kind of like therapy community

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:56.940
therapy group therapy like physical

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:59.190
exercise like just a gigantic community

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:00.780
center that would be accessible and used

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.910
by a bunch of people in a way that like

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:05.190
I think people could benefit from since

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:06.240
like you were like the churches are just

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.130
like you sit there you're bored for an

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:09.390
hour and a half you throw them five

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:10.500
bucks and you're like sweet I'm not

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.240
going to hell it's like I just don't

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.500
think good you know that's kind of

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:19.170
falling apart right yeah and I think in

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:22.800
smaller communities you sort of you get

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.609
that a little bit more like in terms of

00:39:25.609 --> 00:39:27.289
community centers and stuff like that

00:39:27.289 --> 00:39:30.140
yeah and you and you know all about this

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.900
you've mentioned tribes before on the

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.539
podcast but you know in terms of how

00:39:35.539 --> 00:39:37.910
we're sort of evolved for a social

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:40.190
network of like four hundred people or

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:43.220
something like that but I think in

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.670
bigger city centers it's harder even

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:51.410
from a practical perspective in terms of

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:57.170
creating a community center with that

00:39:57.170 --> 00:40:02.660
with that sort of feel outside of of

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:05.019
going to a country club or buying in

00:40:05.019 --> 00:40:07.489
into something that's that sort of

00:40:07.489 --> 00:40:11.420
restricted to to the public so what do

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.489
you why this is what I'm thinking of the

00:40:13.489 --> 00:40:14.720
thing you know cuz it yeah again if I

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:15.980
opened a big thing in the middle you

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.210
know in Philadelphia was like community

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:19.069
center you're just like it would turn

00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:20.930
into so many different things but I'm

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:23.900
thinking of creating physical extensions

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.390
of online communities so it's like you

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:27.529
know this is a kind of a word-of-mouth

00:40:27.529 --> 00:40:29.059
it's not like word-of-mouth like other

00:40:29.059 --> 00:40:30.980
people be able to go but it's like I'm

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:33.619
gonna build this physical space and tell

00:40:33.619 --> 00:40:36.200
people online this is yeah like this is

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.640
what I want to do I want to have like

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.109
it's almost gonna be like ancient Greece

00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:40.640
where it's like you could go there you

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.349
could wrestle people you could sit there

00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:44.480
and [ __ ] debate and dialogue people

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.829
and you can you know if you want to go

00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:47.809
into like a trance State there would be

00:40:47.809 --> 00:40:49.130
a room where you can you know people

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:50.809
could block off times they like do that

00:40:50.809 --> 00:40:52.400
whether in groups or by themselves or

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.230
guided and I'm like I'm obsessed with

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:56.239
building this space and I'm like that's

00:40:56.239 --> 00:40:57.739
currently like what I want when I get

00:40:57.739 --> 00:40:58.730
out of school I want to rent like

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:00.319
warehouse space and just fill it with

00:41:00.319 --> 00:41:03.289
like wrestling mats you know fitness

00:41:03.289 --> 00:41:05.299
equipment and then like just like areas

00:41:05.299 --> 00:41:06.680
people could get together and talk and

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.660
you know just do other stuff I'm like I

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:10.700
can't check this idea which sounds like

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:17.440
a cold I love it that's what I said I

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:19.940
yeah as long as I don't [ __ ] it all

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:22.009
convince us all to kill ourselves we're

00:41:22.009 --> 00:41:28.160
fine yeah I love that idea

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.970
and I yeah and I guess longest you can

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:33.410
monetize it I don't know if it's gonna

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:35.150
be with like a membership or something

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:38.180
like that so I've been I've been

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:40.279
thinking about getting back into

00:41:40.279 --> 00:41:46.900
nice that's as much as much as from a a

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:53.089
need for belonging in community as as my

00:41:53.089 --> 00:41:55.339
interested interest in training the

00:41:55.339 --> 00:41:58.579
mercial er but a man like throat

00:41:58.579 --> 00:42:02.739
throwing down some mats having people

00:42:02.739 --> 00:42:05.900
you know unplug I think that that would

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:06.829
be fantastic

00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:08.930
and I guess you have a big amount fan

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:11.509
base in Philly where it would be it'd be

00:42:11.509 --> 00:42:13.939
practical to ya be like it would be like

00:42:13.939 --> 00:42:16.099
a reinvented Elks Lodge you know what I

00:42:16.099 --> 00:42:17.119
mean because it's like if you think

00:42:17.119 --> 00:42:19.459
about even like biker bars it's like if

00:42:19.459 --> 00:42:21.140
you think about it it's probably a bunch

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:22.849
of people who were kind of traumatized

00:42:22.849 --> 00:42:25.160
to their childhood or like became bikers

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:26.329
but in reality they're just trying to

00:42:26.329 --> 00:42:27.589
like go to the biker bar and hang out

00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:29.660
with other people so they're like I'm

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:31.519
gonna buy a gang but you know either way

00:42:31.519 --> 00:42:32.869
sorry that's probably a bad analogy but

00:42:32.869 --> 00:42:34.699
even like actually that's per second

00:42:34.699 --> 00:42:36.439
algae dude we're all [ __ ] bikers but

00:42:36.439 --> 00:42:39.140
we're [ __ ] yeah but like even to

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:41.059
think about that to like open up like

00:42:41.059 --> 00:42:43.699
chapters of like to extend podcasts cuz

00:42:43.699 --> 00:42:44.749
there is a weird like people are

00:42:44.749 --> 00:42:46.640
recognizing like yeah podcasting is

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.679
weird and there is like a communal

00:42:48.679 --> 00:42:50.509
aspect no one really wants to confront

00:42:50.509 --> 00:42:52.339
even though like it does seem to be the

00:42:52.339 --> 00:42:54.229
case so like I'm thinking like why not

00:42:54.229 --> 00:42:56.569
just you know [ __ ] rip the rip cord

00:42:56.569 --> 00:42:58.099
and it's like I just want to build a

00:42:58.099 --> 00:42:59.929
warehouse advertise the podcast like

00:42:59.929 --> 00:43:02.239
this is what this Center this is the the

00:43:02.239 --> 00:43:04.719
center I envision to like you know

00:43:04.719 --> 00:43:07.910
externalize and materialize the essence

00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:09.559
of the podcast and this is what I'd love

00:43:09.559 --> 00:43:10.789
to have a center for people to be able

00:43:10.789 --> 00:43:12.439
to do and then if you want to open one

00:43:12.439 --> 00:43:14.299
another city just [ __ ] do it I does

00:43:14.299 --> 00:43:16.039
it's not like a I dig well I need

00:43:16.039 --> 00:43:17.390
excellent it's like just just open these

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:19.039
yeah I just I just want this place

00:43:19.039 --> 00:43:22.160
you're not gonna franchise it oh no I

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.339
just want it because it's it's all

00:43:24.339 --> 00:43:27.170
cross-promotion yeah dude I mean

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:30.829
obviously Luis you know with linen

00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:33.349
excess and stuff like that has created a

00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:35.359
bit of a brand I mean the analogy that

00:43:35.359 --> 00:43:37.429
I'm sort of hasn't been to make it's

00:43:37.429 --> 00:43:41.900
with the proud boys these are you know

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.079
not someone that you want to be

00:43:44.079 --> 00:43:46.910
associated with but I mean like it or

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:49.759
not they that obviously the development

00:43:49.759 --> 00:43:51.229
of that

00:43:51.229 --> 00:43:52.910
yeah that's carries

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:55.940
yeah and what it could be mitigated

00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:57.350
through and that you know that's on

00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:58.880
responsibility that's kind of what

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.290
McGuinness what he was put that was the

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:01.880
vibe he was putting out so that it's

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.680
almost is like you do get back what you

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:06.920
put out so it's like you know any don't

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.090
want to that's what you're putting out

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:09.350
that's what you're attracting so it's

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:10.940
like you know I like I like people

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:12.230
joking around having fun about anything

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:13.820
but as soon as you're like marching and

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:16.010
trying to like fight an tyfa it's like

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:17.450
obviously that's where my buck stops

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:18.500
where i'm like ah right dude I'm gonna

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:20.480
go you know I'm gonna go run on the

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.520
treadmill or [ __ ] you know sure I'm

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:23.690
gonna jerk off my brother jerk off

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:24.590
antifa

00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:27.760
but it's like it yeah I would love to

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.610
yeah exactly exactly but it's also late

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:33.230
it's also like something that I I feel

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:34.490
like especially in the States it was

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:36.290
like the culture wars were kind of a

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:38.720
[ __ ] joke that like kind of unsettled

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.070
almost everybody for you know not

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:41.870
everybody but unsettled a lot of people

00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:43.850
so now it's gonna be like people finding

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:45.140
their way back to Center and being

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:46.730
alright like I can chill I don't have to

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:49.160
read all this weird filter news I can

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:50.930
chill back I can chill out again and

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:53.300
like kind of reintegrate myself not like

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:56.210
I was reading that article on a like

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:58.610
about boys and I was like all this is

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:00.140
written by a girl and I instantly caught

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:01.880
myself being like who is she to tell

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.920
boys how to be men and I'd had to like

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.530
stop and be like dude shut the [ __ ] up

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:08.270
and read it and I read it and it was

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:09.620
like oh there's a bunch of [ __ ] I didn't

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:11.660
know that was actually cool to learn so

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:13.340
it's like yeah that's a whole other

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:14.990
random point but yeah I do agree with

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:19.360
like I feel like building you know

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.410
materializing these communities I think

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:24.740
would be a very viable option for mental

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:26.300
health and one in which people could

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:27.770
really take their own mental health from

00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:29.780
their own hands and like you know build

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:31.970
meaningful communities around things

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:34.610
that will enrich their life experiences

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:36.710
and you know blah blah blah so it's like

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:38.450
I think that is a big missing component

00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:39.770
in terms of people's mental health piece

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:41.810
it's like working out like you can't

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:43.010
expect to have a nice body if you don't

00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:44.960
work out and like mentally if you're not

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.730
doing anything that kind of activates

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:49.370
those circuits of feeling okay like the

00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:51.170
calm peace cycle whatever you want to

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:52.850
call it the antithesis of the fear cycle

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:54.530
it's like then you it's not going to

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:55.190
happen for you

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:56.660
nothing's you're not going to feel good

00:45:56.660 --> 00:46:01.130
that makes sense absolutely and the need

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:03.230
is there I mean that I think that's sort

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:05.619
of half of what gyms are

00:46:05.619 --> 00:46:07.390
yeah that certainly certainly to keep

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:09.519
certainly case with with with you with

00:46:09.519 --> 00:46:11.890
the yoga studios and like it's you know

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:15.640
people are going yeah you know going to

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:18.549
their their sunday mass and then doing

00:46:18.549 --> 00:46:21.599
you know hot yoga and and having a

00:46:21.599 --> 00:46:25.690
spiritual experience yeah I mean what

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:26.890
yeah but like what yeah what the [ __ ]

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:28.299
happened what happened to the Elks Lodge

00:46:28.299 --> 00:46:31.809
what happened to I don't really get that

00:46:31.809 --> 00:46:35.589
I mean I guess all that that sense of

00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:37.900
like Brotherhood or whatever has gone

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:40.059
online and in terms of in online

00:46:40.059 --> 00:46:42.279
communities and obviously it's not

00:46:42.279 --> 00:46:45.010
natural or as healthy as as being in a

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:48.039
physical space no others I love it yeah

00:46:48.039 --> 00:46:50.349
it is awesome and it's also I think that

00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:53.019
I would say people of our generation and

00:46:53.019 --> 00:46:55.359
younger suffer from and this is we were

00:46:55.359 --> 00:46:56.559
talking about the ethos of certain

00:46:56.559 --> 00:46:58.990
podcast like I like I like to do to do

00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:00.579
come town but I feel like for a certain

00:47:00.579 --> 00:47:02.470
they've put and it's not just them

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:03.640
they've I think the reason they're so

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.559
successful so they've tapped into this

00:47:05.559 --> 00:47:08.200
like need for people who are our age and

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:11.589
younger to like interpret all of life

00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:13.660
events through like an ironic kind of

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:15.400
like filter if that makes sense

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.740
so like the idea of going to an elf

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:20.230
Lodge is already so kind of blah and

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:21.849
like oh my god what are you a [ __ ]

00:47:21.849 --> 00:47:23.859
boomer so like it which is you know

00:47:23.859 --> 00:47:25.240
that's cool like distance yourself from

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:27.039
a lot of weird boomer tendencies but

00:47:27.039 --> 00:47:28.900
it's like you can't throw the baby out

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:32.529
but with what what they don't get so if

00:47:32.529 --> 00:47:36.730
I if I can you know presume to say as

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:40.720
much is that those were started with a

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.539
[ __ ] tongue-in-cheek like that it was

00:47:43.539 --> 00:47:46.599
supposed to be stupid I mean that's like

00:47:46.599 --> 00:47:48.880
the the idea of like you know putting

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:50.589
[ __ ] antlers on you're like whatever

00:47:50.589 --> 00:47:53.619
like that's the whole point like it it

00:47:53.619 --> 00:47:57.279
started as a sort of semi joke or a

00:47:57.279 --> 00:47:58.990
little bit of it like with a little bit

00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:01.150
of a satirical feel but that's not to

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:04.000
say that there can be a genuine like

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.400
component right and it's the fear of

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:12.250
having any sort of of Being Earnest like

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:14.079
you you can't you can't you can't mix

00:48:14.079 --> 00:48:16.750
the two right and it's I think and I

00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:18.510
think that I I think

00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:20.400
is totally fair to say that that sort of

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:24.920
part of what what what your podcast has

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:28.950
has gotten that and you know I was also

00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:33.480
listening to to dad meet do it more dad

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:35.760
meet go ahead so yeah they're trying it

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:38.550
well no I know I mean you got it like

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:39.900
that's what they are trying to get like

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:42.060
there's nothing there's there's there's

00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:44.940
nothing incompatible about earnest tea

00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:47.640
and humor you know what I mean like you

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.160
can you can you can go in and out of the

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.730
tube but yeah like calm town it's

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:55.170
[ __ ] hilarious and Nick Mullens

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:58.680
obviously a genius but I don't see them

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:00.660
making any community centers anytime

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:05.910
soon no not at all and I think I said I

00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:08.040
think it's great to be able to listen to

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:09.210
something that's a hundred percent

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:11.460
satirical it's just like you're saying

00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:13.110
when then the community forms around

00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:14.460
that and then dude this is I literally

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:15.600
just was the paper I just submitted

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:18.450
about how like we almost um

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:20.850
unconsciously build hierarchies around

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:22.380
everything we're interested in and that

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:23.820
was my idea with like Social Work school

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:26.550
how it's like yeah like I I get that you

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:28.290
know and they're they're always pointing

00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:29.730
out all the flaws and everything but I'm

00:49:29.730 --> 00:49:31.140
like well what are you guys doing what

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:32.730
are you guys building hierarchies around

00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:34.110
and how are you guys and how are you

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:34.670
guys

00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:38.010
conceptualizing like how you stand apart

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:39.450
from others within this Pro you know

00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:41.430
what was that look like I'm not gonna

00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:43.260
bore you with all that but it's like you

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.390
know it's a no recognize that where it's

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:48.090
like you know where we amore man you

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:50.670
know no Morgan brutal sitting sitting on

00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:53.190
therapy sessions where they're they're

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:56.340
asking their clients to divulge sort of

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:59.580
their deepest darkest thoughts and then

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:04.320
like feigning this this persona where

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:08.580
they're you know like unshakable and and

00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:10.860
and but you know underneath it all

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:13.610
underneath this this thin veil of

00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:17.040
clinician is a an emotionally disturbed

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:19.770
person with as much mental illness as

00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:21.930
the the people that they're that they're

00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:24.900
counseling I mean oh god it's it's

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:27.720
[ __ ] brutal to watch that was one of

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:30.270
the big takeaways that was it that's

00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:31.950
exactly that's exactly my problem where

00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:32.250
it's like

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:34.200
dude you gotta be a little bit above

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:35.520
this stuff man and it's like if you're

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.440
not in like I don't know that that's

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:38.970
just that's just that's irresponsible

00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:41.220
for someone who's again like 62 years

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.920
old 64 years old coming in complaining

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:45.690
about you know like wanting to open up

00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:47.430
who doesn't know how who's never had it

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:49.470
modeled to them and who's gonna start

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:51.090
the chat with like you know like about

00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:53.040
getting [ __ ] and it's like you have to

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.360
be able to give that person the benefit

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:55.500
of the doubt and be like like you know

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.210
the conditional positive regard to be

00:50:57.210 --> 00:50:58.950
like this person's nervous about opening

00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:01.160
up let's work through this and if

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:04.560
clinician I can spin getting [ __ ] into

00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:06.300
like earlier what would about your early

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:08.310
relationships like with girls Oh what

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:09.330
was it like with your parents like you

00:51:09.330 --> 00:51:10.830
can spin all that stuff rather than

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:12.540
being like my feminist I'm a FEMINIST

00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:14.310
it's like it's not time for that right

00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:15.750
now put your [ __ ] on the [ __ ] shelf

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:18.510
about do that all man you just push my

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:21.960
button no I hear that and you're great

00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:25.310
if you're bringing in your own political

00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:27.900
agenda you are compromising the

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:30.630
therapeutic relationship and that's why

00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:33.350
like let's you know not that I'm a big

00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:36.990
accolade of of Jordan Peterson or

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:39.210
anything like that but I mean his his

00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:41.880
success and I think you know the success

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:46.020
of its it's a basic formula is that he

00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:49.200
he entered in you know a vacuum like as

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.720
being as being a right-leaning

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:54.990
you know a little bit chauvinistic

00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:58.470
politically conservative psychologist I

00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:00.210
mean that's unheard of right yeah the

00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:01.950
people were sort of hungry hungry for

00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:03.930
that perspective you know men were

00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:06.330
hungry for that perspective and then

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:10.500
from a therapeutic looking at it from a

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:11.430
therapeutic lens

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:14.670
I mean he's relatable to them he is

00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:17.490
addressing issues whether you agree with

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:20.820
with their issues or not he's relatable

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:23.010
to them and that's why he's done so well

00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:25.350
for himself right yeah I mean if you

00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:27.570
were to measure his conical impact with

00:52:27.570 --> 00:52:29.100
like questionnaires of everyone who's

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:30.840
ever listened to him or listened to his

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:33.030
material yeah it would be enormous

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:34.380
in terms of like you know like a

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:35.820
Wellness scores all that stuff but yeah

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:37.230
dude you want to talk about a online

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:39.600
community who literally personifies the

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.370
leader of the community go to the

00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:43.680
Petersons subreddit they all talk like

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.450
holy they are like well this is

00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:46.109
reprehensible

00:52:46.109 --> 00:52:48.630
it's like we held on like Kermit yeah

00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:51.170
they literally take what are you all

00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:53.730
they've adopted his speech patterns and

00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:55.499
typing which is you know but again like

00:52:55.499 --> 00:52:57.089
what was there before was that a void

00:52:57.089 --> 00:52:58.739
like you're like what do they have any

00:52:58.739 --> 00:52:59.759
thoughts that's the thing that frightens

00:52:59.759 --> 00:53:01.650
me the most of thinking of people who

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:04.019
and again that could be just saying this

00:53:04.019 --> 00:53:05.670
but I feel like there's a lot of people

00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:07.799
who at their core don't have any of

00:53:07.799 --> 00:53:09.809
their true own authentic or have very

00:53:09.809 --> 00:53:11.910
few of their own authentic thoughts

00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:13.200
they've developed through their

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.640
experience rather than just like

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:16.410
parroting like when you start getting

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:17.819
into like how much people just parrot

00:53:17.819 --> 00:53:18.749
what's around them without thinking

00:53:18.749 --> 00:53:22.019
about it it's [ __ ] terrifying yeah I

00:53:22.019 --> 00:53:24.359
mean and that's that's sort of one of

00:53:24.359 --> 00:53:27.390
the DSM criteria of borderline

00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:29.190
personality disorder right they have no

00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:32.190
sort of sense of self they feel and I

00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:35.249
think yeah I think that that's okay I

00:53:35.249 --> 00:53:37.019
mean shark-like

00:53:37.019 --> 00:53:43.230
i identify as the you know the the

00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:45.779
mediator that i consume and i am i

00:53:45.779 --> 00:53:48.599
change on a monthly basis according to

00:53:48.599 --> 00:53:53.190
what podcast i'm listening to no no I I

00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:55.910
don't have I don't have a unifying

00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:57.960
identity per se maybe that's why I

00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:00.450
listen to come down but you know what I

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:03.509
mean like I think is that like you're

00:54:03.509 --> 00:54:05.700
able to say like like again the ability

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:07.289
to because do like my opinion on things

00:54:07.289 --> 00:54:09.359
change literally day to day so it's like

00:54:09.359 --> 00:54:12.539
it's not that you know you're malleable

00:54:12.539 --> 00:54:13.950
that I'm talking about it's more of like

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:16.019
I've met people who I just don't think

00:54:16.019 --> 00:54:17.970
even try to stake their own claim and

00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:20.220
anything at all and just kind of sit and

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:21.390
watch which again like you're saying I

00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:23.190
don't think this is a bad thing it's

00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:25.049
just kind of for me it's just a little

00:54:25.049 --> 00:54:28.200
strange to watch people never truly

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.849
throw their hat in the ring in any sort

00:54:29.849 --> 00:54:31.499
of meaningful way and it's just kind of

00:54:31.499 --> 00:54:32.759
like and I get it there's obviously

00:54:32.759 --> 00:54:34.559
there's huge social rewards not to do

00:54:34.559 --> 00:54:38.009
that yeah I don't mean like malleable

00:54:38.009 --> 00:54:39.480
you know I'm being being malleable and

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.710
you know being like well yeah I thought

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:43.140
that that's wrong but being like I don't

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:45.079
know maybe I'm not explaining it right

00:54:45.079 --> 00:54:48.210
no I hear that like they're so they're

00:54:48.210 --> 00:54:51.960
so positive that they can't actualize

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:53.549
themselves because they're unwilling to

00:54:53.549 --> 00:54:56.249
sort of engage in anything that could be

00:54:56.249 --> 00:54:59.180
even like remotely

00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:01.910
you know Miskin misconstrued is like a

00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:06.390
like an opinion that that that someone

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:08.910
could object against and like yeah I I

00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:10.140
see that and that's what you know you

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:14.940
people people identify most what they're

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:16.920
like with sports teams i feeding that

00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:19.410
that's like god in country for a lot of

00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:21.180
people of their local sports name

00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:23.609
because at least you know that that

00:55:23.609 --> 00:55:25.819
doesn't have any kind of connotation of

00:55:25.819 --> 00:55:28.380
nationalism or like you know an

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:30.809
ethnicity or anything like that

00:55:30.809 --> 00:55:32.670
sure i don't know there is there

00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:34.170
anything wrong with that i don't know

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:37.200
no yeah i don't think so i think i think

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.849
it definitely also scratches those

00:55:38.849 --> 00:55:41.160
tribal itches in a way that's like you

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:42.329
can't like you were saying like you

00:55:42.329 --> 00:55:44.309
can't you can't really come at it you

00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:46.200
can just like [ __ ] love the vikings

00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:47.729
with all your heart and soul and

00:55:47.729 --> 00:55:49.529
everyone's just like hey that's I guess

00:55:49.529 --> 00:55:51.779
a safe place to pour all that you know

00:55:51.779 --> 00:55:54.180
like ancient tribalism into but I also

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.979
think from a Productivity striking

00:55:55.979 --> 00:56:00.349
Viking fans are superior than everyone

00:56:01.759 --> 00:56:04.589
kind of is like a absorption for those

00:56:04.589 --> 00:56:07.529
kind of like you know like like death no

00:56:07.529 --> 00:56:09.059
Chloe whatever you would call it people

00:56:09.059 --> 00:56:10.559
who would want an ethnos state would

00:56:10.559 --> 00:56:12.450
just kind of be like what the [ __ ] of

00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:13.979
like a like an Eagles fan the [ __ ]

00:56:13.979 --> 00:56:15.539
Dallas fan it is like a good place to

00:56:15.539 --> 00:56:17.969
pour those feelings into but I also have

00:56:17.969 --> 00:56:20.309
a problem with spending all day Saturday

00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:22.469
and all day sunday watching a bunch of

00:56:22.469 --> 00:56:24.029
sports teams I just from a Productivity

00:56:24.029 --> 00:56:26.279
standpoint that idea of spending my

00:56:26.279 --> 00:56:28.469
weekends doing that terrifies me but you

00:56:28.469 --> 00:56:29.819
know if it's again that's what people

00:56:29.819 --> 00:56:32.430
like that yeah I don't know but again if

00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:33.809
it's what that some people are into and

00:56:33.809 --> 00:56:35.160
they like I'm with my buddies this is

00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:37.049
fun I'm like I wake up from a day of

00:56:37.049 --> 00:56:38.579
watching football being like that was

00:56:38.579 --> 00:56:40.559
awesome then like yeah you should do

00:56:40.559 --> 00:56:42.299
that I'd be wracked with [ __ ] guilt

00:56:42.299 --> 00:56:43.950
and being like I [ __ ] what the [ __ ]

00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:44.339
do I do

00:56:44.339 --> 00:56:46.559
you know so I've learned to let go of

00:56:46.559 --> 00:56:48.059
that okay man if that [ __ ] do you

00:56:48.059 --> 00:56:49.650
feel good after doing that do you

00:56:49.650 --> 00:56:54.299
I don't yeah what do you think about

00:56:54.299 --> 00:57:00.200
Peterson sort of propelling him himself

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:03.359
you know making a name for himself based

00:57:03.359 --> 00:57:08.309
on I don't know it's like his is

00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:13.309
politically incorrect opinions around

00:57:13.519 --> 00:57:17.009
using preferred pronouns and what he

00:57:17.009 --> 00:57:22.289
would call compelled speech yeah yeah

00:57:22.289 --> 00:57:23.819
what like I think that's sort of

00:57:23.819 --> 00:57:26.579
interesting so like in your guy's case

00:57:26.579 --> 00:57:28.220
and again I don't know that details

00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:31.619
related to this and hopefully yeah I

00:57:31.619 --> 00:57:33.089
don't know the details related to this

00:57:33.089 --> 00:57:36.180
but have you seen a big like spike in in

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:38.039
your metrics and listenership or

00:57:38.039 --> 00:57:40.619
anything like that well that's in the

00:57:40.619 --> 00:57:42.720
Old Testament no well here's what

00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:45.420
happened so it was like so the Petersons

00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:47.579
thing that was like the thing you're

00:57:47.579 --> 00:57:50.009
describing was like the lightning bolt

00:57:50.009 --> 00:57:51.509
that gave it was like the flash of

00:57:51.509 --> 00:57:54.089
lightning that gave him online life so

00:57:54.089 --> 00:57:55.740
it's like without that a lot of people

00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:56.970
probably wouldn't have known who he was

00:57:56.970 --> 00:57:58.410
I mean maybe eventually he would but I

00:57:58.410 --> 00:58:00.960
doubt it if he he like you know

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:03.000
literally there was like a an arc

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.069
between two wires and he grabbed onto it

00:58:05.069 --> 00:58:06.480
like that was literally what like you

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.430
know gave it like Frankenstein him his

00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:10.079
digital presence to life so it's like

00:58:10.079 --> 00:58:12.240
yeah I kind of regret that cuz I think

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:14.160
like his materials are so good and he

00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:15.809
watches video as maps a meaning course

00:58:15.809 --> 00:58:17.759
all that stuff it's so good but then it

00:58:17.759 --> 00:58:20.039
just gets kind of derailed by all of the

00:58:20.039 --> 00:58:21.569
political [ __ ] which you know he went on

00:58:21.569 --> 00:58:23.640
and constantly fed into because he he

00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:24.779
was there's probably a one to one thing

00:58:24.779 --> 00:58:26.579
if you do that like political stuff it

00:58:26.579 --> 00:58:28.650
pays off you will get paid people flock

00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:29.789
right they love that

00:58:29.789 --> 00:58:31.950
but when we when the [ __ ] hit the fan

00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:33.900
with us we didn't really like kind of

00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:35.220
rattle our so you know we didn't like

00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:36.720
rattle our sabers really we kind of

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:38.490
chilled for a while there was like a lot

00:58:38.490 --> 00:58:39.809
of other factors too but it was this

00:58:39.809 --> 00:58:42.089
really like a lot of the main thing was

00:58:42.089 --> 00:58:44.009
was like all right and again a lot of

00:58:44.009 --> 00:58:45.900
the stuff that happened was really

00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:47.400
really taken out of context and

00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:50.220
presented as if like you know like Shane

00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:52.230
was saying things like from his [ __ ]

00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:54.089
soul and heart and reality we were like

00:58:54.089 --> 00:58:55.980
making fun of the invention of Chinatown

00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:57.779
be like damn people like there must have

00:58:57.779 --> 00:58:59.069
been dudes in the 40s being like what

00:58:59.069 --> 00:59:00.210
the [ __ ] when they're building all these

00:59:00.210 --> 00:59:01.980
crazy buildings and then like that's

00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:04.410
when like we were describing like what

00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:05.700
people would have said literally what

00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:06.779
people would have said back then it was

00:59:06.779 --> 00:59:07.589
like we were to sitting there like

00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:09.480
literally just like farting out of our

00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:11.039
minds talking like wasn't even like a

00:59:11.039 --> 00:59:12.269
structured joke we were just

00:59:12.269 --> 00:59:12.990
bullshitting

00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:15.930
so that was presented as if Shane's real

00:59:15.930 --> 00:59:17.430
feel he was like we was character

00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:19.440
cheering a guy in the 40s freaking out

00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:21.089
about Chinatown and they presented as if

00:59:21.089 --> 00:59:22.950
that's how he walks around perceiving

00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:24.029
the world so it was [ __ ] it was

00:59:24.029 --> 00:59:25.829
total [ __ ] but to answer

00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:28.319
it was like we kind of chose not to like

00:59:28.319 --> 00:59:31.319
enter the fray and I I wanted to I

00:59:31.319 --> 00:59:33.089
really there's a part of me being like

00:59:33.089 --> 00:59:35.729
oh I could go full [ __ ] like you know

00:59:35.729 --> 00:59:38.099
like freedom speed Ruth and I could we

00:59:38.099 --> 00:59:39.450
could really we could have boat no we

00:59:39.450 --> 00:59:41.789
shut down the we shut the patreon down

00:59:41.789 --> 00:59:43.079
during that time and then we did get

00:59:43.079 --> 00:59:45.119
like a nice little surge after that but

00:59:45.119 --> 00:59:46.380
it just kind of died off because well

00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:48.180
you know I guess there wasn't that uh I

00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:49.499
mean there was also the possibility of

00:59:49.499 --> 00:59:51.359
podcaster sucks because I could kind of

00:59:51.359 --> 00:59:53.789
fell off a little bit but it did fall

00:59:53.789 --> 00:59:55.319
off and I think part of that is because

00:59:55.319 --> 00:59:57.869
we didn't go like full bore into the

00:59:57.869 --> 01:00:00.599
fray of like let's go guys we're let's

01:00:00.599 --> 01:00:02.729
attack [ __ ] uh like I don't know

01:00:02.729 --> 01:00:04.799
whoever you know whatever reporter we

01:00:04.799 --> 01:00:06.900
want to attack and we just didn't do

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:09.089
that interesting right because there is

01:00:09.089 --> 01:00:12.499
probably an alternate universe where I

01:00:12.499 --> 01:00:15.440
don't know like obviously you'd be

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.209
exploiting something there and I don't

01:00:18.209 --> 01:00:21.930
know like but yeah people capitalized on

01:00:21.930 --> 01:00:24.089
stuff like that yeah interesting cuz I

01:00:24.089 --> 01:00:26.039
sir I certainly hadn't heard a Peterson

01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:29.430
prior did all of that and he played into

01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:32.430
it I mean it's only like what 2016 like

01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:34.229
all of the media coverage wasn't about

01:00:34.229 --> 01:00:40.349
you know his is his work as a

01:00:40.349 --> 01:00:43.650
psychologist but it's just the same old

01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:49.170
[ __ ] story about compelled speech I

01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:50.729
thought it was tiring

01:00:50.729 --> 01:00:52.380
I was brutal you know he would go on

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:55.079
he'd sit down on Fox News and he could

01:00:55.079 --> 01:00:57.150
have talked about so much more stuff but

01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:58.680
it was just in the end he was promoting

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.839
a book and he even came out and said he

01:01:00.839 --> 01:01:02.549
goes every time I get protests said I

01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:04.170
get thrown in the negative light in the

01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:07.619
news I make more money my patreon just

01:01:07.619 --> 01:01:10.049
like flat goes it just exorbitantly

01:01:10.049 --> 01:01:11.910
increases every time this happens and he

01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:13.079
you said consciously he's like I

01:01:13.079 --> 01:01:15.299
consciously you know I'm aware of this

01:01:15.299 --> 01:01:16.739
and you know he's like it's something

01:01:16.739 --> 01:01:17.940
I'm aware of and it's something I

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.039
personally benefit from so he and he

01:01:20.039 --> 01:01:21.089
always said he's gonna bashed

01:01:21.089 --> 01:01:23.009
capitalists at heart I'm a classic

01:01:23.009 --> 01:01:24.329
British liberal whatever you would say

01:01:24.329 --> 01:01:25.829
but it's like it sucks it's his

01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:27.839
materials were so good I think he liked

01:01:27.839 --> 01:01:28.109
me

01:01:28.109 --> 01:01:29.789
they wrote a couple of those hit pieces

01:01:29.789 --> 01:01:31.229
on him apparently he was always pretty

01:01:31.229 --> 01:01:33.269
eccentric you know kind of a while do

01:01:33.269 --> 01:01:34.799
but that's why he was pretty good at you

01:01:34.799 --> 01:01:36.119
know his class at Harvard apparently it

01:01:36.119 --> 01:01:38.009
was like super sought out because it

01:01:38.009 --> 01:01:38.999
really was like you're saying I was

01:01:38.999 --> 01:01:39.750
filling this weird

01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:41.070
void were like if you go to a college

01:01:41.070 --> 01:01:43.290
campus it's like I would have is it like

01:01:43.290 --> 01:01:45.980
three quarters if not like honestly like

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:48.390
7/8 of the professors are you know

01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:51.570
pretty far on the liberal side any of

01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:53.250
this guy who's kind of like right-center

01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:55.980
who's kind of like you know talking

01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:57.480
about all these other concepts that you

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.400
know it like 24-year their hate or you

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.690
know twenty two in your college it's

01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:02.820
like oh yeah this is a kind of a nice

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:04.020
message because you know there is

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.220
something to be said for like the

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:06.660
quote-unquote conservative message

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:08.970
there's good things about it it's not

01:02:08.970 --> 01:02:11.370
like one's evil the other is good like

01:02:11.370 --> 01:02:12.750
there's but there's it's part of the

01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:14.070
same thing but you know when people get

01:02:14.070 --> 01:02:15.090
into light that's like all like the

01:02:15.090 --> 01:02:16.470
dialectic stuff that like they just

01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:17.760
don't teach you how to do that in school

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.770
how to hold two opposing viewpoints and

01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:20.820
cyntha thought since I thought

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:25.260
synthesize them I can't talk yeah I was

01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:27.330
in the psychology department this is

01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:29.670
even worse in terms of political bias

01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:31.860
one of the one of the interesting things

01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:34.140
that so that was the University of

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:36.930
Toronto and I think it was the the

01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:39.030
Teachers College that was especially

01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:42.390
involved but they all do these including

01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:45.030
on email correspondence neat land

01:02:45.030 --> 01:02:48.690
acknowledgments elates to the First

01:02:48.690 --> 01:02:51.630
Nations people here which I think is I

01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:55.680
think it comes from a good place but you

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:59.580
know from a historical perspective I

01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:01.650
wonder if they needed to consult with

01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:04.500
the history department because they the

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.720
people that they're acknowledging like

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:10.470
you know Anishinaabe or Oda nashoni like

01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:13.250
the Mohawk people like these people

01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:16.890
claim to those territories went back and

01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:20.490
forth after you know massacres and

01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:23.280
genocide and prior to that there was

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.870
there was people that were living on the

01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:26.280
shores of Lake Ontario

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.840
you know this year honor the went back

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:30.780
culture which has which no longer exists

01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:34.560
because if we're genocided wow it's just

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:38.280
yeah exactly it's just like you know we

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.960
really gonna unpack everything or just

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.810
gonna do like a very superficial gesture

01:03:42.810 --> 01:03:45.030
that that's not really helping anyone or

01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:49.680
to technology you know like I don't know

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.090
that's my problem with it you know

01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:53.440
exactly exactly they would say

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:54.910
Oh what you have a problem with it's

01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:56.290
like no I don't this just seems like

01:03:56.290 --> 01:03:58.300
[ __ ] because it's like as if like

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.550
again like the the Pacwa or like wait

01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:02.290
what they acknowledge that that's our

01:04:02.290 --> 01:04:04.000
land before they did [ __ ] psychology

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.460
class okay that's cool no they're like

01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:07.870
alright mother if you really feel if

01:04:07.870 --> 01:04:10.180
you're acknowledging genocide enough to

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.440
be like hey guys like just before we

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.760
start class I'd like to analogous land

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.560
once belong to it's like then give it

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:17.050
the [ __ ] back give it back yeah if

01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:18.760
that's if you really feel that again

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:20.590
that's such a that's what I hate about

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:22.870
it's such an empty kind of like and you

01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:24.250
know just to acknowledge that this land

01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:25.960
was formerly it's a cart well then

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.270
[ __ ] let them come here and like I'd

01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:30.580
rather probably learn from a Native

01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:31.840
American tribe right now if someone is

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:33.130
like hey we're giving all the land back

01:04:33.130 --> 01:04:34.720
to the Native Americans I say this and

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.190
people could say [ __ ] I'd be like

01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:38.470
sweet I'd rather live in a Native

01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:39.850
American tribe this will be [ __ ]

01:04:39.850 --> 01:04:42.220
awesome but again you know I people will

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:46.300
be but you know we're also so in bed

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.310
it's an impossibility at this point to

01:04:48.310 --> 01:04:50.770
be like even if like what can you really

01:04:50.770 --> 01:04:53.590
do it was a genocide you can't you can't

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:55.840
undo it it's like what is that what is

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.400
it ask them like what do you guys what

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.390
do you guys want what do you want to

01:04:58.390 --> 01:05:00.040
have I don't know I have no idea but I'm

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:01.330
pretty sure on the top of their list

01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:03.100
isn't like I just want liberal arts

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:04.300
colleges to acknowledge that's where the

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:11.500
land came from then you know anyway at

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:12.760
the end of it at the end of the day you

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.470
guys were just pushing boundaries right

01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:16.090

01:05:16.090 --> 01:05:21.580
