00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.560
professional comedian and i've been

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.440

22 years 22 years this november

professionally this is the best book

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.959
i've ever read about stand-up comedy in

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.280
my life i'm not the one who came up with

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.760
that

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.840

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.360
reading this book and it starts

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.599
in amarillo that was just i had that was

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:48.640
a place i could go

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.200
four times a year and it starts there

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.720
and it starts with this character

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.080
and it's a dude who's been on the road

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.080
way too long

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.000
and it and a guy who had some success

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.519
in his career and now doesn't and

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.120
it is it is an amazing story that tracks

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.439
basically a week in his life

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.799
and it it is so it is written so real

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.639
and so connected to

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.840
the lifestyle and and the

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.759
the mindset and it it's eerie it was

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:24.160
really

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.240
eerie reading this book because i

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.520
thought that

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.639

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.240

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.840
and and maybe and definitely booze

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.520
i mean it's and it wasn't me to a t but

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.440

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:40.880
drinking

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.760
man that [ __ ] that book [ __ ] with my

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.080
head on so many [ __ ] levels

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.399
i'm glad man i'm glad it uh drove you to

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:51.680
drink and made you feel bad

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.440
what i want there's so much i want to

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.279
talk about this book so badly

00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:58.560
the entire interview yeah how tall

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.480
how tall was the character that you

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.680
wrote about

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.200
great that's a good question i think

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.839
he's six three billy ray shaffer

00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:10.000
yeah six three um

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.640
how f like how funny do you think billy

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.320
ray shaffer would have been for us like

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.000
would we have liked him or would

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.519
we have disliked his act

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:23.440
i think you would have uh not wanted to

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.720
be on a show with him

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.240
because that meant that your entire

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.320
career was on fire

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.240
but uh i bet he's a great green room

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.399
hang his act i don't know

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:34.320
i think his act is uh him trying to

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.680
survive and get to the point where he

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.880
can sell t-shirts

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.560
i think he's a guy that still has a good

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.399
act and doesn't close on a 15-minute

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:41.600
t-shirt pitch

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.920
so that's good can i tell you i was

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.120
always i was

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.320
always i wanted him to murder every time

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.279
he got on stage

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:52.399
i wanted him to i want i wanted him to

00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:52.880
drop

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.200
anything that was new don't take any

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.079
chances

00:10:56.079 --> 00:10:58.399
just go up there and crush with a tried

00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:00.560
and true material

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.839
this [ __ ] with my head so much because

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:06.399
it was so much how i feel about myself

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:10.560
at times like it was

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.839
like how like i i can't

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:15.519
imagine that billy ray shaffer is a

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:17.440
comic you would have liked but you spent

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:17.680
an

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.560
entire time writing a book about him

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.000
yeah i mean it's that guy that

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.160
i don't want to turn into man he's a

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.760
cautionary tale

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.120
uh you know you realize i mean doug do

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:29.440

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.800
close to turning into billy gray safer

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.079
i i found myself finding uh places where

00:11:38.079 --> 00:11:38.399
i

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:40.560

like i don't wear cowboy boots

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.279

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.680
bad hand the hand that he fell and his

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.279
hand no longer works

00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:30.720
so he holds a 100 marlboro in it

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.199
i feel like i'm at the bottom of my

00:14:47.199 --> 00:14:48.880
career i feel like

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.839
those flights into amarillo where you're

00:15:10.839 --> 00:15:13.839
stage

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.839
after the podcast search doug stanhope

00:15:19.839 --> 00:15:21.839
amarillo comedy club

00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:26.880
uh yeah we we got into a beef years back

through your [ __ ] jew

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.759
[ __ ] manager who's i think this is

00:15:35.759 --> 00:15:39.040
this is this is the guys doug

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.560
i remember this i remember there because

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.079
i got there and they're like you know

00:15:42.079 --> 00:15:43.839
doug stanhope and i was like yeah i do

00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:47.040
and they're like boy and they went on a

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.519
tear

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.240
i had yet i guess i had news trucks down

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.440
at their comedy club

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.240
getting comments on their blatant racism

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.600
and sexism

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.360
that must have sold some tickets if they

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.800
heard that was going on in there they're

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.680
like oh cool

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.399
i want to be a part of that uh it's even

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:06.000
worse than the book because he like gets

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.440
to amarillo and then he gets

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.040
picked up from the airport that's good

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.800
to come carry he's not even allowed to

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.920
appear in amarillo no

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.320
it i that that was the first thing that

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.360
struck what was your like did you do

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.480
your read yet

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.399
bert i haven't done my read yet i've

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:25.920
been i've been working every single day

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.440
i'm going to do my read i've been by the

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.759
way reading copy on prompter

00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:31.759
so you're very lucky that you're getting

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:33.360
this bert who can actually read

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.199
out loud your tongue's lubed up and

00:16:35.199 --> 00:16:36.720
ready to go

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.440
my tongue's lubed up okay so what was

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.399
your intent

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:43.199
in writing the book like there had to be

00:16:43.199 --> 00:16:45.040
because i feel like you wrote it for me

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.480
like i don't feel like you wrote it for

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.240
everyone i feel like you wrote it for me

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.720
and for doug maybe jeff tate deserves to

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.279
read it

00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:54.079
like i don't feel like like i i wanted

00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:55.839
to send it to sagura

00:16:55.839 --> 00:16:59.120
but i'm afraid segura never like he

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.240
reads that and he goes oh yeah that

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.920
guy's a loser and i'm like oh no he's

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.279
not a loser

00:17:03.279 --> 00:17:06.640
you know what i mean yeah man i mean i

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.439
wrote it because i

00:17:07.439 --> 00:17:09.439
my wife did her first two years in med

00:17:09.439 --> 00:17:11.280
school in las vegas and

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.799
las vegas is a godless hell hole so i

00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:16.319
didn't have any friends there and it was

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:18.319
too hot to go outside so

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:21.039
i just sat down and wrote a book and uh

00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:22.480
the intent was to

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.839
not be laughed out of the room when

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.520
anyone read the book

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.120
but i did write it for you man i wrote

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.640
it for comics and i

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.559
i'm glad that comics have adopted it and

00:17:30.559 --> 00:17:33.120
they're helping the book sale

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.000
i feel like you've done do you feel like

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.160
do you feel like we're lucky because we

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.080
got that book that we understood that

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.080
book and that book resonated with us

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.840
or do you feel like or do you feel like

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.200
there's something broken in us

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.360
that that we connect with billy ray

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.480
shafer in some kind of way

00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:54.320
me or doug doug doug oh [ __ ] i thought

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.840
you're talking to him

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.960
uh i think this book is gonna be

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.840
when when 10 years 20 years from now i

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.520
think when people start doing stand-up

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.880
comedy that's going to be one of the

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.840
first things

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.799
did you read running the light yeah i

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:10.080
think it's going to be

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.799
you know a fear and loathing of the

00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:14.000
comic set if nothing

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.320
else i think it can save people a lot of

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.760
time like open micros

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.039
if they're like oh this is the life you

00:18:19.039 --> 00:18:20.799
want and then you read that and you're

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:22.480
just um i'm gonna stay in school and

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.880
manage a radio shack

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.880
yeah i think the opposite i think people

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.559
are gonna like

00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:30.160
think it's cool i think you're gonna

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.160
actually steer some people down the

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:32.559
wrong

00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:34.480
path oh this is gonna be the siren call

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.000
that drags them on the rocks

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.679
yeah the same way fear and loathing

00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:39.919
makes it seem cool to do ecstasy at the

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:40.799
circus circus

00:18:40.799 --> 00:18:42.400
i mean i'm glad that billy ray shaffer

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.000
is still having three ways

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.799
and like as unwoke as he is he still

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:48.080
lets a guy suck his dick

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.240
and i think that's cool i think that's

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.600
redeeming

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.799
yeah yeah i mean you're from florida man

00:18:54.799 --> 00:18:56.000
all those [ __ ] swingers

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.520
that are always trying to bang comedians

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.520
at every show in florida

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.720
yeah yeah it's uh it's a phenomenon and

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:02.960
if

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.480
if you're trying to have weird sex with

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.080
old people comedy is probably the most

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.559
direct route to that

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:11.120
i remember i remember we had a friend we

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.640
had a friend who we used to go to the

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.000
swingers clubs it was a uh

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.840
it was like a house you go to the house

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.720
and then you could go there and you

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.559
could [ __ ] everyone's wife and

00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:20.880
and i remember he was telling like i had

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.720
two groups of friends growing up i had

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.200
the ones who were

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.480
did coke and partied and were like

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.440
bat like you know the bad kids and then

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.120
i had a group that were like meatheads

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.039
like they still are meatheads that

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:37.760
you know [ __ ] are in trump boat

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.400
parades

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.679
you know so so i remember one of the

00:19:41.679 --> 00:19:42.240
guys

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.679
one of the dirt bags just telling the

00:19:43.679 --> 00:19:45.600
story and he said ends up saying and

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.799
then all of a sudden

00:19:46.799 --> 00:19:48.559
her husband's just sucking my dick and

00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:49.760
i'm [ __ ] eating her and all my

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.039
immediate friends are like

00:19:51.039 --> 00:19:53.200
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa are you

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.400
[ __ ] gay and then

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.400
he was trying to justify it going like

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.320
listen man i got to [ __ ] his wife i'm

00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.600
gonna let him suck my dick and i

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.400
remember

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.039
being on the fence going i feel for both

00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:04.559
of you right now

00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:08.640
i feel like a centrist i think you're uh

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.400
i think you're more straight if you love

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.919
[ __ ] so much that you'll let a guy blow

00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:14.080
you just for a taste of [ __ ]

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.760

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.280
cast in this movie

we're gonna make this who do we cast

00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:30.159

like six foot two

00:20:35.039 --> 00:20:37.520
um he has comedic timing and he also

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.240
looks haggard and can be disgusting

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.720
um i mean it'd be cool to have like a

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.919
comedian do it but

00:20:43.919 --> 00:20:47.360

one of the funniest dudes alive like

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.919

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.240
for it to

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:46.559

comedy for the wrecker you should just

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.960
be a writer that was the

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.080
the prettiest i set

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.000
can i tell you what i did last night i

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.440

vodka

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.159

book and he married it to a half he me

it was a it was a something i think it

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.399
was an orange juice

00:28:06.399 --> 00:28:09.200
and he married a vodka to it and it i

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.480
read that and i went

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.760
you know what that's when you know good

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.919
writing when you're like what the [ __ ]

00:28:13.919 --> 00:28:14.399
did he

00:28:14.399 --> 00:28:15.679
i mean that's and that's by the way

00:28:15.679 --> 00:28:18.240
that's probably the least

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.919
the least beautiful thing you wrote in

00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:21.440
that book but i

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.520
have been one and the second i said read

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.039
that i went i want to start marrying

00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:27.440

drinks you want

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.279
it was it was so your writing is so

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:39.760
[ __ ] good did you go to like

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.399
like uh college school yeah did you go

00:28:42.399 --> 00:28:43.520
to writing school

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.200
no i dropped out of school as soon as i

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.440
could pay my rent from stand-up

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.440
and i paid my rent from stand-up once

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.279
and then was like homeless for the next

00:28:51.279 --> 00:28:53.520
six months and also not in school

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.360
so i don't have an education i just read

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.000
a lot man i like to read and

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.120
i think that's the best way to get good

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.039
at writing is read stuff that uh

00:29:01.039 --> 00:29:02.880
you want to emulate and just try and not

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.880
rip them off directly

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.559
kind of this works the same with stand

00:29:06.559 --> 00:29:08.720
up thank you stand up had someone in

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.200
mind and they tried not to copy them

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.200
yeah you like find their voice and then

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.200
make it worse that's pretty much what i

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.440
did is just rip off dennis johnson but

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.799

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:27.919
took

00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:31.440
time with things like and i i wrote a

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:31.840
book

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.480
and i i've definitely someone told me

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.720
and i was like oh yeah because i'm not

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.720
good at writing

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.919
i was worried people were going to call

00:29:45.919 --> 00:29:47.840
me pretentious and a jerk-off because i

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:48.880

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.240
might use and

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.120
i'm glad people have uh have been happy

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.159
with the fact they had to get us

00:29:56.159 --> 00:29:58.320
thesaurus out every now and then

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.760
yeah it was so it was written so

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.760
beautifully that i was like [ __ ] this is

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.360
like a dance i gotta be honest with you

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:05.919
though

00:30:05.919 --> 00:30:11.200
there's uh a part i forget the part

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.240
where i wish i could remember the part

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.120
where i did this i i grabbed the book

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.000

let's go back and reread

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.200

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.399
to people is like

00:31:10.399 --> 00:31:11.679

00:31:11.679 --> 00:31:13.440
people that i get that would get it the

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:13.760
way

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.159
we get it where i go you gotta read this

00:31:16.159 --> 00:31:18.480
book i sent it to rogan and arie and

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.960
tom but i don't joe joe never did the

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:21.519
road

00:31:21.519 --> 00:31:23.919
that way like he like he never he only

00:31:23.919 --> 00:31:25.440
did the road famous

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.279
um i mean he did road the road like you

00:31:27.279 --> 00:31:29.679
know those boston runs

00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:32.240
yeah but i think it's a very different

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:32.960
animal

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.159
you can still do it tonight yeah and

00:31:36.159 --> 00:31:37.039
then

00:31:37.039 --> 00:31:40.240
ari just opened for joe like he didn't

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.120
like

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.720
he never like did the road he just

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.200
worked for joe i think

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.000
it's it's interesting sometimes when

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.200
you're like

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.240
when you're like like tom

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.960
opened for joe did the road a little bit

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.320
but tom was the kind of guy that was

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:56.880
like

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.600
oh [ __ ] this i'm not doing toledo that's

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.080
stupid

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.799
but joe loves when joey diaz tells

00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:06.559
stories about the road and this is like

00:32:06.559 --> 00:32:08.720
there's a lot of diaz in this guy

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.399
so i think there's even you mentioned vs

00:32:10.399 --> 00:32:12.960
in it i do mention diaz yeah

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.799
yeah it's not like if you don't know the

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:16.640
road you won't if you didn't work the

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.760
world you wouldn't get it

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:20.720
yeah it'd actually make you think wow i

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.080
should have done more road

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.279
yeah before i got married yeah it's

00:32:25.279 --> 00:32:27.120
interesting because i was married when i

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.799
was doing the road like that

00:32:28.799 --> 00:32:32.720
and i mean i there's so many times i

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.840
felt like i've been a character in a

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.840
book when i'm like

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.679
i mean there's so many things that like

00:32:37.679 --> 00:32:39.440
i wanted in this book

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:42.799
that i that i did in that i did

00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:44.960
or or things where i go oh i did it a

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.120
little different than billy ray did like

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.519
one of the things i i hate that i've

00:32:49.519 --> 00:32:51.440
done my entire [ __ ] life is

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.159
those early mornings and airports i

00:32:54.159 --> 00:32:55.200
always have

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.279
i'm i almost guarantee they'll be in my

00:32:57.279 --> 00:32:59.760
bag right now

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.880

little bottles of list of liquor i have

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.480
right i mean

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.240
this is and by the way these are these

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.000
aren't even good but i i

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.039
have these in my bag they always go

00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:13.440
through

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.640

but i get through security

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.039
i go and i oh i mean the first thing i

00:33:23.039 --> 00:33:23.600
mean

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.360
this is what was killing me is that i

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.279
was thinking i'm reading your book and

00:33:27.279 --> 00:33:28.000
i'm

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.399
and i'm writing my book of me doing it

00:33:30.399 --> 00:33:31.120
in my head

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.159
as i read it of thinking of my very very

00:33:34.159 --> 00:33:35.360
sad times

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.320
where i'm like oh that's a low that for

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.000
other people they'd go

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.799
my god your life's in the [ __ ] and

00:33:42.799 --> 00:33:44.559
you're like oh no i'm a comedian

00:33:44.559 --> 00:33:47.679
this is how i get through the day it

00:33:47.679 --> 00:33:48.880
you you don't understand at the end of

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.480
the night if i do all this i can get to

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.519
go on stage

00:33:51.519 --> 00:33:53.200
but like the first thing i do when i

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.120
walk in in an airport is i go to see if

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.240
the bar is open

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:59.120
now i'll take certain flights knowing

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.519
that the bar should be open by then

00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:04.720
and there's nothing worse than going

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.880
is uh you guys serving alcohol and he

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.399
goes oh we don't serve till seven you're

00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:09.040

uh i bought it 705 and the guys like uh

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.280

00:34:21.839 --> 00:34:23.520
walking around with a mcdonald's cup in

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.399
an airport

00:34:24.399 --> 00:34:26.560
at [ __ ] six in the morning sipping

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:51.520
tumbler but no one walked around only

rock climbers did that

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.800

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.960
instance in that story is a write-off

everything you just said is a total

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.079
write-off and that's the best part about

00:35:04.079 --> 00:35:06.079
stand-up is you can be

00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:08.240

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.000
especially with like i want to talk to

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.160
you guys about what you guys think about

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.839
the state of comedy of like literally

00:38:53.839 --> 00:38:55.760
all the clubs closing literally all the

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.520
comics leaving la

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.480
and i thought my initial thought was

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.320
this is bad for comedy and then i

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.000
as i'm reading the book i go oh

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.560

more money than he ever did during cobit

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.040

me one time

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.720

there was a comic named jim brewer

and he was i was like that's got to be

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.319
problematic for the name

00:43:07.119 --> 00:43:08.560
[ __ ] funny comic

30 minutes in 25 minutes in

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:43.440
they'd bring a phone a landline to the

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.400
stage

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.200

call your house

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.040

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.040
what's being cut out of comedy by

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.560
cancel culture we can't have [ __ ]

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.400

she's the one person i'd love to track

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:50.640
down because she's the only person that

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:51.920

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:32.799
i'm like oh okay well i guess i'll make

00:56:32.799 --> 00:56:34.320
dinner i'm sorry

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:37.800
[Laughter]

00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:41.200
the uh so wait when you wrote it did you

00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.799
self-publish it

00:56:42.799 --> 00:56:45.040
yeah cause like that uh that story you

00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:46.160
told about

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:48.559
your agent getting jaymore 20 grand or

00:56:48.559 --> 00:56:50.319
getting you nine dollars or getting him

00:56:50.319 --> 00:56:51.359
nine dollars

00:56:51.359 --> 00:56:53.280
that was what my agent said he was like

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:55.040
they offered seven thousand dollars but

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.400
this isn't really worth my time

00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.760
i was like oh good this is the most

00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.440
important thing i've ever done

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:02.559
um so i still published it when covet

00:57:02.559 --> 00:57:03.200
happened

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:05.119
and uh luckily it was it was the right

00:57:05.119 --> 00:57:06.319
move because i've

00:57:06.319 --> 00:57:09.520
you know made more than ten times the

00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:10.960
money i would have got off that seven

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:12.000
grand

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.079
yeah what no what about what's going on

00:57:14.079 --> 00:57:15.520
with the audiobook because

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:18.960
i'll tell you right now that is i wish i

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:19.760
had gotten

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:22.400
a check for that because my audiobook

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.640
was the number one audiobook for like

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:28.559
seven months because well hold on

00:57:28.559 --> 00:57:31.040
if you if you're if you have a long ride

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:32.400
definitely treat yourself

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:35.200
and buy that audiobook is way overpriced

00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:37.040
i don't get a cent of it

00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:39.760
but i cannot i have a really hard time

00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:40.880
reading out loud

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:42.960
so it took me like 22 hours to read a

00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:44.640
five-hour book

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.760
and whatever editor edit it put it

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:48.480
together with

00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:50.720
me [ __ ] up throughout it he thought

00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:51.680
it was funnier

00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:54.079
with me [ __ ] up so they left in me

00:57:54.079 --> 00:57:54.720
going mother

00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:56.559

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:36.480

01:00:42.559 --> 01:00:43.280
all myself

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.839
and then i'll sell it online somehow but

01:00:45.839 --> 01:00:46.400
uh

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.680
yeah i'm really excited about the

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.160
audiobook the audiobook's gonna be great

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.200
and you can put it

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.680
are you gonna put it on itunes i don't

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:55.440
know i think i'm gonna do it through uh

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.359
audible's online client their

01:00:57.359 --> 01:00:58.960
self-publishing client

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.200
oh really yeah i'd like to do it as a

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:03.920
podcast but i think that using audible

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:07.760
uh using their reach is smarter

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.760
yeah i've got to be honest with you i

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.520
don't understand how audible works

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.319
to be i don't either man i really i've

01:01:14.319 --> 01:01:15.280
tried

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:18.960
a hundred times to get a book on audible

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:19.359
and i

01:01:19.359 --> 01:01:22.400
cannot [ __ ] do it i cannot

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:25.760
get a book on audible i can't get it

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:29.200
to play i can't buy it i

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.640
reached i almost signed a deal with

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.480
audible they gave me three free

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:33.680
downloads

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.680
i have those three free downloads that's

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.760
it i do not know how the [ __ ] audible

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:38.559
works

01:01:38.559 --> 01:01:42.160
i think you get points you buy points

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.319
and then like it's almost like only fans

01:01:44.319 --> 01:01:45.680
you buy points

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.280
and then you can give those points to a

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.559
book and that's how you trade

01:01:50.559 --> 01:01:52.559
yeah you subscribe to audible and then

01:01:52.559 --> 01:01:53.920
they give you a free download at the

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:55.760
beginning of the month

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.680
but uh yeah i don't i thought you meant

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.440

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:53.680
way to go on all

yeah what's uh i mean

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:32.400
is there an option like what if like

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.920
what if it goes really big

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:35.280
and then a publisher comes to you and

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.039
like hey man we'd like to we'd like to

01:03:37.039 --> 01:03:38.400

bookstores

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.119
is that what do you why would you do

01:03:41.119 --> 01:03:43.200
that no because they've already they

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.640
wouldn't do that because they've already

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.400
lost out on these sales i've got i'm

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:49.039
like over 5000 books sold

01:03:49.039 --> 01:03:51.119
so they would there's no interest for

01:03:51.119 --> 01:03:52.960
them because they can't wet their beak

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.039
off the initial wave

01:03:55.039 --> 01:03:57.119
which is heartbreaking for me because i

01:03:57.119 --> 01:03:58.240
want the book

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:01.680
tell us what your agent said about like

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:04.160
podcasting oh yeah dude he was like how

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.359
are we going to sell this book who's

01:04:05.359 --> 01:04:06.880
going to read it because it's so bleak

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.400
and i was like i don't know fans of

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.359
comedy

01:04:09.359 --> 01:04:12.960
uh every podcast is run by a comedian

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.880
uh i think that the power of comedy will

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:17.039
sell this book and he had like no idea

01:04:17.039 --> 01:04:18.319
who joe rogan was

01:04:18.319 --> 01:04:22.400
so uh i do he's he's very successful but

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.559
he wasn't the right fit for me i'll say

01:04:24.559 --> 01:04:27.839
it that way

01:04:27.839 --> 01:04:30.079
wait

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.760
i think i know who this guy is i bet you

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.319
do

01:04:34.319 --> 01:04:37.760

oh is he

01:04:46.079 --> 01:04:49.839

01:04:49.839 --> 01:04:50.799
same guy

01:04:50.799 --> 01:04:53.760
because he paired me up with mieshka to

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:54.400
do

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.520

my radar and the money wasn't

01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:04.880
enough because i was making too much

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:06.319

middle-aged men about hip-hop

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.679
that's why they get into the game last

01:11:37.679 --> 01:11:39.520
night i got to slide one of my jokes by

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:40.159
him

01:11:40.159 --> 01:11:42.640

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.719
trinidad james trinidad james wrote a

01:11:44.719 --> 01:11:46.480
wrote a song called all gold everything

yeah i remember that

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.760
and the n-word is through out throughout

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.199
it all the way

01:11:51.199 --> 01:11:53.040
and i was talking to snoop and i said we

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.800
were talking about the m word about

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:56.159
how i go how do you feel when you see

01:11:56.159 --> 01:11:58.159

01:11:58.159 --> 01:11:59.679
and he goes i hate it he's not black

01:11:59.679 --> 01:12:01.360

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.199
yeah i was talking trinidad james about

01:12:05.199 --> 01:12:06.880
it i said it's got to be weird

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.800
to play that song and then guys like me

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.880
buy that album and he goes and then you

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:12.560
can't sing the n-word in your car and i

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:12.880
went

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:16.159
oh no i do what i said

01:12:16.159 --> 01:12:18.960
uh i definitely do yeah we all do i can

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.480
wait you didn't think i've been singing

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:21.360
the n-word

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:24.080
to your songs in the car and he goes you

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.679
do that and i go yeah i go i've been

01:12:25.679 --> 01:12:26.719
singing the n-word

01:12:26.719 --> 01:12:28.320
forever and then i is an old joke if i

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.920
go not when i do like yard work or

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:30.480
something

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:33.840
but like you know on the bus

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:36.000
you ever see there's a clip of i think

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
it was kendrick lamar he brought up a

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.840
white chest on stage and she sang it

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:45.120
and the whole crowd was like

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.120
it's like what you wanted to do dude

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:51.199
she's hitting the lyrics yeah exactly

01:12:51.199 --> 01:12:52.719
is it weird to not say it in that

01:12:52.719 --> 01:12:54.080
situation i don't know that's a tough

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.040
spot

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.760
we had a girl i can't tell too much of

01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.600
this but we had a girl

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:02.800
on set sing one of snoop dogg songs

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.800
and she replaced the n-word with a

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.000
different word

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.040
but i didn't know i didn't know that's

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.159
where the n-word was

01:13:10.159 --> 01:13:12.000
i thought snoopy used that word in his

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.679
song and i was like that's so

01:13:13.679 --> 01:13:15.840
odd is snoop a big fan of country

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:18.560
westerns like

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.120
what was the word cowboy a bunch of

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.520
cowboys

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:31.520
being on my cowboys a ride from my

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:32.640
cowboys

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:37.520
rhyme for my cowboys i'm a real cowboy

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:40.560
compton cowboy yeah it actually kind of

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:42.000
translates yeah it has the same

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.840
syllables yeah yeah

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:48.640
cowboys uh this is

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:51.280
that's hoping you do the math aloud yeah

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:52.560
i had to do the math of my head i just

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.080
said the n word in my head everybody i

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:56.000
don't know if you saw that

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:01.840
i just took a second there to say it

01:14:07.679 --> 01:14:12.000
oh [ __ ] oh what was i gotta tell you

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.719
[ __ ] god damn it i was just going to

01:14:14.719 --> 01:14:15.199
tell you

01:14:15.199 --> 01:14:18.320
oh oh oh so i did a podcast i did a my

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.760
cooking show something's burning

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.400
and i had andrew schultz on and uh and i

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.159
have this joke i've told the joke i've

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:24.960
told a joke

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.640
before i've told her on stage and i've

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.400
also told her on podcasts

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:32.159
it's a really really really awesome joke

01:14:32.159 --> 01:14:34.239
but the punchline is the n-word okay

01:14:34.239 --> 01:14:36.560
like and so i i i don't mind telling you

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:37.280
that

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:39.040
but the punchline is the n-word it has

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.320
to be the n-word

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:41.920
like every christmas party i've ever

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:43.920
family christmas party i've ever been to

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:46.159
it's not like all of my uncles look i'm

01:14:46.159 --> 01:14:47.440
gonna say it

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:51.199
but it's worth it so i and so

01:14:51.199 --> 01:14:54.239
i i was torn because the joke is so good

01:14:54.239 --> 01:14:56.719
it really is it's a story but you i know

01:14:56.719 --> 01:14:57.520
it's good dude

01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.920
i heard the punchline it's a good joke i

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.719
don't need to hear the setup

01:15:02.719 --> 01:15:04.800
so i'm talking to andrew schultz about

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.560
it and andrew schultz you know it's like

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.560
captain workaround captain think it

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.400
through and he's like

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:13.679
switching out for pancakes he goes

01:15:13.679 --> 01:15:16.800
switch it off for pancakes and i go

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.000
what do you mean he goes tell everyone

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.440
hey listen i got to say the n word in

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.199
this song and this joker if it doesn't

01:15:21.199 --> 01:15:22.159
work

01:15:22.159 --> 01:15:23.679
but i don't want to say the n-word so

01:15:23.679 --> 01:15:25.280
instead like why would i call a black

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.500
astronaut a pancake

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:29.760
[Laughter]

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:33.120
rosa parks hated pancakes

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:36.080
so i i tell my cousin my cousin andrew

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.199
is

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:39.520
one of the smartest dudes i know like

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:40.320
really smart

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:41.600
should have been a comic he's a

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:44.480
filmmaker just a really smart guy

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:47.840
so and so i

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:50.239
i say the first time i tell this joke

01:15:50.239 --> 01:15:51.679
now without saying that when i go on

01:15:51.679 --> 01:15:52.000
stage

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.239
and i go so the i got is this joke i

01:15:54.239 --> 01:15:55.440
want to tell it i think it's a great

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.719
joke but in order to tell it

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:59.679
i got to say the the n word but i'm

01:15:59.679 --> 01:16:00.640
instead of saying that word i'm going to

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:02.080
say pancakes and i go

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.760
okay so everyone's clear we're going to

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:07.140
go are you pancakes ready

01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:08.880
[Music]

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:11.600
almost so i start telling the story and

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.120
then when any time a black guy's there

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.480
i'm like so this little short stack

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:15.190
comes up to me

01:16:15.190 --> 01:16:16.400
[Laughter]

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:19.120
a syrupy [ __ ] butter on top you

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.880
know what i'm talking about right

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:23.280
that moon's over my hammy gold chain

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.120
like

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:27.360
so i get done and my cousin andrew goes

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:30.239
no you're not ever doing that again

01:16:30.239 --> 01:16:33.520
that's worse than saying the n-word

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:35.840
and not only that he goes just listen to

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:36.640
the people at the bar

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.000
and then everyone's like hey there's no

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.330
pancakes in here at all

01:16:39.330 --> 01:16:40.880
[Music]

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:43.120
oh that's the worst that's the hardest

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:45.120
code signaling everyone a new way to say

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:45.920
the n-word

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:47.440
he goes that's the worst thing you've

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:50.880
ever done and i was like

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.760
you could have pancaked t-shirts man oh

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:54.239
it was

01:16:54.239 --> 01:16:57.760
so oh so [ __ ] i didn't and i'm such

01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.360
an idiot i'm just eating it up i'm like

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:00.800
ah these pancakes and

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.080

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:04.000
[ __ ] waffle house or so many pancakes

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.199
i just started using

01:17:05.199 --> 01:17:07.120
i would have used the word once i must

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.960
have used the word a hundred times in

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:10.239
the story

01:17:10.239 --> 01:17:12.080
yeah ironically there are always a lot

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:16.130
of pancakes

01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:21.930
[Laughter]

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.760
by the way the whole the whole the best

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.679
part of this story is a true [ __ ]

01:17:27.679 --> 01:17:29.360
story right it's a it's a true story

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:30.320
that happened to me

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:32.960
where i pulled up to a party in a

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:33.840
convertible

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:36.239
to go drop off keys and as i didn't drop

01:17:36.239 --> 01:17:36.960
off i

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.719
was too many people and so i just left

01:17:38.719 --> 01:17:40.640
and i didn't park and i go to the other

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.080
side of this apartment complex and it's

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:42.960
an equally

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:44.880
big party it's an all black party it's

and i was like i definitely didn't say

01:19:07.679 --> 01:19:08.719
that word i would never

01:19:08.719 --> 01:19:11.440
like only a lunatic would say that word

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:12.400
and they're like

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.920

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:15.600
like you know i'm aware of that

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:20.000
[ __ ] beer

put it in park left it wide open running

01:19:25.199 --> 01:19:26.960
at a party and i walked into a house

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.000
with these guys

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.600
and they started telling the story to

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:31.199
everyone at this party you walked into

01:19:31.199 --> 01:19:32.000
the ihop

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.040
i walked into the ihop and they started

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.560
telling everyone this story of how this

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:37.440
happened i take a

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.679
i took a [ __ ] i smoked off a joint i

01:19:39.679 --> 01:19:41.199
drank two beers with the guys

01:19:41.199 --> 01:19:42.880
and i'm having a great time and then

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.320
like and then

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.000
the story was over and the enter

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.600
everyone went back to their party and

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:49.040
now i'm just a white guy standing at an

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.040
all black party holding a beer going

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:52.400
my car's still out there right like i'm

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:52.740
gonna go

01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:54.400
[Laughter]

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.560
so i went home and then told everyone i

01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:57.760
must have told that story a hundred

01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:58.880
times

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:01.440
in uh in college and then and then i

01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:02.880
tried it out on stage

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:05.840
at the store and it went fine but the

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:07.280
problem is the n-word

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.040
i was saying the m-word with it because

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:10.880
you needed to in order to let people

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:11.440
know

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.920
and you couldn't like punch it down you

01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:14.880
know

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:18.080
and i was telling on stage and that word

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:18.960
was just

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:21.120
breaking shutting the room down like you

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:22.800
couldn't there was no way to

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:24.639
tell the story but you say when you

01:20:24.639 --> 01:20:26.560
shout that word in a room it sounds like

01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:27.280
you're

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:30.320
shouting that word in a room and like

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.000
i remember black comics like red grant

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.600
on everyone was like it's a great

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.040
[ __ ] joke you just gotta

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:36.800
he's like they're like and i don't think

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:39.199
there's a problem with it it's just

01:20:39.199 --> 01:20:41.199
that word is pretty aggressive and i was

01:20:41.199 --> 01:20:43.440
like yeah so i just never

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:45.920
whatever yeah there's no secret meaning

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:46.800
to that word

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.600
it's it's very straightforward now it

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.120
looks like doug has us on

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:55.040

01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:35.840
latino kids on bikes were watching me

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:37.679

01:39:37.679 --> 01:39:39.600
of that was bad as shane

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:42.719

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:52.400
someone getting a hold of my webcam

01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:55.360

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:12.080
like those unfiltered moments that's my

01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:12.719
fear

01:40:12.719 --> 01:40:14.320
yeah no one wants to see that or have

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:16.159

01:40:16.159 --> 01:40:16.800
that fear

01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:18.800
but aaron andrews does it and it's

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:21.440

15 years my favorite

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:54.639
though my favorite thing about the

chappelle compound is to be white and to

01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:57.440
be there

01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:01.199
you have to be like the most famous dude

01:45:03.679 --> 01:45:04.800

can come

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:15.440

replied to your email but i kind of got

01:47:56.960 --> 01:47:58.719
lost in the day-to-day on the road and

01:47:58.719 --> 01:47:59.920
family regardless

01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:01.840
i would now like to answer the question

01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:03.520
you posed to me

01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:07.199
then of how are you doing

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:09.280
i'd like to preface this answer with two

01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:11.440
things one time i heard you on stage at

01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:12.320
the improv

01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:14.400
the smaller room and i think you knew i

01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:15.520
was in the audience

01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:17.360
but you were talking about the exile and

01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:19.280
the road and your experiences

01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:20.800
and somehow i knew you were talking

01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:22.400
about something i was going to have to

01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:23.760
experience on my own

01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:27.440
oh my god you i feel like we are friends

01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:29.679
i know that's weird us never having hung

01:48:29.679 --> 01:48:30.480
out at all

01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:32.560
but that's how i feel i feel like we are

01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:35.119
friends oh

01:48:35.119 --> 01:48:38.639
[ __ ] my point is this i'm beating myself

01:48:38.639 --> 01:48:41.199
up with these shitty road gigs the same

01:48:41.199 --> 01:48:41.920
point

01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:44.239
i think you were making that said night

01:48:44.239 --> 01:48:46.159
i feel like i'm asking too much out of

01:48:46.159 --> 01:48:50.639
people in general no one really listens

01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:52.880
and when they do i think they hear the

01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:55.040
wrong things i think in a way i have

01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:55.600
over

01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:57.520
in a way i have overestimated the

01:48:57.520 --> 01:48:59.920
general public and i'm being too honest

01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:01.840
even more so in a sad way

01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:04.560
i can't stop the fight i can predict

01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:07.679
what they'll throw in the towel

01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:10.400
that they'll find funny and it isn't

01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:11.920
where i want to be

01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:13.840
you've always been a kind of missionary

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:15.360
when it came to comedy

01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:16.960
in the sense that you headed out into

01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:18.560
the unknown by yourself

01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:20.000
and stayed there until they were

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.800
converted in writing this i realize i'm

01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:24.639
not asking you any questions

01:49:24.639 --> 01:49:26.880
i'm just frustrated after a bad night of

01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:30.080
comedy and i want to hear

01:56:47.199 --> 01:56:48.080
few times

01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:50.560
and then i'm sitting at a [ __ ] i'm

01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:51.599
sitting at a

01:56:51.599 --> 01:56:54.320
at a at a restaurant in chicago i'm

01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:55.280
doing the schomburg

01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:58.719

01:56:58.719 --> 01:57:00.159
tompkins and i'm like

01:57:00.159 --> 01:57:02.080
what the this is like this is like four

01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:03.280
years ago right

01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:05.599
i get an email from paul tompkins and it

01:57:05.599 --> 01:57:06.719
is the most

01:57:06.719 --> 01:57:10.239
eloquent like rational

01:57:10.239 --> 01:57:13.599
email of like this is my perspective of

01:57:13.599 --> 01:57:14.560
the night

01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:17.280
that happened this is how i believe it

01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:18.000
went down

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.520
i'm certain that you believe it went

01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:21.360
down a different way i don't i'm not

01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:22.800
saying that one of us is right one of us

01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:24.560
is wrong what i'm saying is

01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:26.960
this is stupid for us to dislike each

01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:27.760
other for

01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:29.360
something we don't you know like this is

01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:31.119
[ __ ] and he was like i

01:57:31.119 --> 01:57:33.040
sincerely apologize i hope we can get

01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:34.719
past this he's like i'm not trying to be

01:57:34.719 --> 01:57:36.000
your best friend i don't really need to

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.280
know you i don't need to hang out with

01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:38.800
you but the fact that

01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:40.080
that we have a problem with each other

01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:42.000
is ridiculous and i was like

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.520
i was like whoa who the [ __ ] i was like

01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:44.639
is he going through sobriety or

01:57:44.639 --> 01:57:46.960
something

01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:48.639
and then i reply back i was like you're

01:57:48.639 --> 01:57:50.000
right and you're a bigger man than me

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:51.920
i should have sent this a long time ago

01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:53.199
and he was like i'll never say a bad

01:57:53.199 --> 01:57:54.719
word about you please i

01:57:54.719 --> 01:57:56.159
all i ask is you do the same and i was

01:57:56.159 --> 01:57:58.400
like of course and i was like hey by the

01:57:58.400 --> 01:57:59.679
way i'm still a fan of your stand up

01:57:59.679 --> 01:58:01.679
like whatever

01:58:01.679 --> 01:58:03.040
and he was like yeah i'm not i don't

01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:06.320
like what you do but i understand

01:58:08.639 --> 01:58:11.119
wait so you sent music to people you met

01:58:11.119 --> 01:58:11.920
from jfl

01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:13.840
i would say well not just jfl like i

01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:15.440
would talk to people and try and connect

01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:16.800
with them on some level that wasn't

01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:18.080
stand up you know

01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:19.920
and i'd be like oh you like the cramps

01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:21.280
well here's a song that i think you'd

01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:23.119
like or like a bootleg you know

01:58:23.119 --> 01:58:25.840
just i've done that a million times yeah

01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:26.880
oh and then they're like i'd love to

01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:28.719
have you host

01:58:28.719 --> 01:58:31.840
i sent a submission

01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:35.360
to comedy central uh for to do a half

01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:36.400
hour

01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:39.920
and my bright idea was i'm gonna put

01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:44.320
a song that i know is a cool song

01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:46.400
at the front of it like i'll play that

01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:48.080
music up front and then they're gonna go

01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:50.320
oh [ __ ] he's got the same taste of music

01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:52.560
we do i gotta get him booked on the show

01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:55.360
so i played this song this heart is on

01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:56.320
fire

01:58:56.320 --> 01:58:58.719
it's like [ __ ] a minute of a song

01:58:58.719 --> 01:59:01.599
before you watch my stand up

01:59:01.599 --> 01:59:04.800

so nina ross is a playing a card game

02:11:14.639 --> 02:11:17.599
to the rank of nine and so it's a card

02:11:17.599 --> 02:11:18.480
game and so

02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:19.840
i was going through snoop's lyrics

02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:21.599
because i was i got to ask him all

02:11:21.599 --> 02:11:23.920
like i've been i've been literally i

02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:25.280
mean i've been a fan of snoops my whole

02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:26.079
[ __ ] life

02:11:26.079 --> 02:11:28.400
but now i've got access to him so i'm

02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:30.000
getting to ask him all the lyrics i

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.719
never understood in all his songs

02:11:32.719 --> 02:11:36.000
so and then i'm i'm going to lyrics that

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:37.360
i misunderstood

02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:38.719
because i thought there was this the

02:11:38.719 --> 02:11:40.719
wrong this song this lyric in the song

02:11:40.719 --> 02:11:41.920
where it goes

02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:45.040
i drop rhymes like potatoes and he was

02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:46.000
like what

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:47.360
i was like you said you drop rhymes like

02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:48.800
potatoes he goes no i don't even know

02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:49.760
what you're talking about

02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:51.119
and then we listen to the song he goes i

02:11:51.119 --> 02:11:53.199
said platoon and i said oh i've always

02:11:53.199 --> 02:11:54.719
thought it was potatoes and he was like

02:11:54.719 --> 02:11:56.400
why would i say [ __ ] potatoes i said

02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:58.000
that's why i'm asking you about it

02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.520
but there's a part where he says nina

02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:00.800
ross i didn't know what nina ross was

02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:02.159
and it's a card game

02:12:02.159 --> 02:12:04.800
i've never heard of this card game it's

02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:06.560
i think it's a card game

02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:08.400
carrie von erick i've been googling one

02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:09.920
of the judges

02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:13.440
is uh dusty rose or uh cody rhodes

02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:17.199

02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:21.440
i'm not even a big wrestling fan

02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:24.480
but i am obsessed with carrie von erich

02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:27.440
yeah he's had a real bad time he's dead

02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:29.440
this is the earliest one i could find

02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:32.400
with rogan i wrote to rogan this is uh

02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:34.960
november of 2004.

02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:37.679
dear mr rogan i write you this evening

02:12:37.679 --> 02:12:39.679
pie-eyed drunk in chicago

02:12:39.679 --> 02:12:42.159
to suggest what should be obvious we

02:12:42.159 --> 02:12:44.079
should run for the office of president

02:12:44.079 --> 02:12:45.920
and vice president of the united states

02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:48.239
of america in 2008.

02:12:48.239 --> 02:12:50.000
i have no delusion that we could win

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:51.920
such an election nor am i under

02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:53.440
any false belief that we could do

02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:55.360
anything that would resemble an adequate

02:12:55.360 --> 02:12:55.760
job

02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:58.639
should we be elected yet i honestly do

02:12:58.639 --> 02:13:00.880
think we could bring a level of logic

02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:02.639
that could not be ignored to the super

02:13:02.639 --> 02:13:03.920
bowl of humanity

02:13:03.920 --> 02:13:05.599
we never expected to be where we are

02:13:05.599 --> 02:13:08.000
today why not take one ugly stab at the

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.079
top just to say we did it

02:13:10.079 --> 02:13:12.000
and he wrote back i was just talking

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:13.119
about running

02:13:13.119 --> 02:13:14.800
[ __ ] it let's roll the dice and see what

02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:16.239
happens this could be really [ __ ]

02:13:16.239 --> 02:13:17.040
interesting

02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:18.639
at the very least it'll start some

02:13:18.639 --> 02:13:20.079
people talking about some [ __ ]

02:13:20.079 --> 02:13:22.960
they would have just let lay it's not

02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:25.599
that great but

02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:32.400
i'm trying to think of people like

02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:36.159

02:13:36.159 --> 02:13:37.679

02:13:37.679 --> 02:13:39.520

02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:48.560
phone

02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:50.719

02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:10.320

02:14:17.199 --> 02:14:18.960
man

02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:22.400

02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:23.360
a show

02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:27.840

02:17:17.840 --> 02:17:19.280
read i think i think

02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:22.160
i i here's i was actually thinking about

02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:24.000
rogue and reading it and i was like

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:27.040
you know joe's so disciplined i think

02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:28.000
there's a part of him

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.040
that would really embrace

02:17:31.040 --> 02:17:33.519
and celebrate the [ __ ] upness of the

02:17:33.519 --> 02:17:35.200
billy ray schaefer character

02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:36.880
and i think there's a part of that loves

02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:39.280
guys like that a lot

02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:41.280
but then the other part of me is like i

02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:42.800
don't know if he

02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:44.399
i don't know if he knows i think it

02:17:44.399 --> 02:17:45.760
would make him very sad i don't know if

02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:46.960
he knows

02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:49.840
how bad that those people are very real

02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:51.040
does that make sense

02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:52.080
yeah definitely doesn't know what

02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:54.240
they're out there like that like

02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:56.960
like i just i think i got lucky to know

02:17:56.960 --> 02:17:57.439
those

02:17:57.439 --> 02:17:59.439
people and be one of those people for a

02:17:59.439 --> 02:18:01.519
long time and i'd like what did ari say

02:18:01.519 --> 02:18:02.880
did aries have

02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:04.000
say anything about i'm gonna call let's

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.960
call ari and find out if he

02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:08.719
like his extent of the road because i

02:18:08.719 --> 02:18:10.240
really feel like ari's extent of the

02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:10.719
road

02:18:10.719 --> 02:18:13.359
this sounds horrible is getting paid

02:18:13.359 --> 02:18:14.080
like

02:18:14.080 --> 02:18:15.760
i'm guessing five thousand dollars a

02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:18.240
weekend to open for joe

02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:21.519
you know i've never been paid five

02:18:21.519 --> 02:18:22.880
thousand dollars for anything

02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:24.639
i don't know i don't know what joe paid

02:18:24.639 --> 02:18:26.639
them but i know it wasn't like

02:18:26.639 --> 02:18:30.080
it wasn't uh 800 bucks he paid them well

02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:31.200
and he took care of them

02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:33.040
and they went to mma fights and they ate

02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:34.559
steak and i mean

02:18:34.559 --> 02:18:37.599
arya said one of the hardest parts is

02:18:37.599 --> 02:18:39.120
not opening for joe because the money

02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:41.040
was so great and everything was so great

02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:42.559
about it the lifestyle was so great

02:18:42.559 --> 02:18:44.000
that you're like why would i go off on

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:45.920
my own like why would i

02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:48.080
go do a club for nine hundred dollars

02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:49.840
when i can just wait till joe does

02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:51.679
if he does one date in the next three

02:18:51.679 --> 02:18:53.040
months i'm gonna make good money i'm

02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:54.000
gonna fly

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.800
first class joe i mean joe's always

02:18:56.800 --> 02:18:58.479
taking care of people that work with him

02:18:58.479 --> 02:19:01.599

never have me as like

02:20:42.319 --> 02:20:44.240

by the time i got there it's like i

02:20:48.800 --> 02:20:50.880
could drop 40 50 people

02:20:50.880 --> 02:20:52.399
yeah i was saying like because i was

02:20:52.399 --> 02:20:54.319
like your experience

02:20:54.319 --> 02:20:57.520

once

02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:13.120
yeah and joe i was i was i was guessing

02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:15.520
the book i read it's like it makes you

02:21:15.520 --> 02:21:16.880
like this those times even though they

02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:18.640
would have been shitty

02:21:18.640 --> 02:21:20.880
yeah oh it's got like a romance to it

02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:22.160
that would have been pretty cool to have

02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:23.120
experienced

02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:25.600
oh yeah i've read the whole book i read

02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:27.520
it really quickly

02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:29.120
to read it to you how did you get

02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:30.960
through it yeah i know i read it with my

02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:32.160
readers on

02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:34.080
and i was like and i was i was like you

02:21:34.080 --> 02:21:35.520
know i definitely

02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:37.280
like i said i was saying to them i was

02:21:37.280 --> 02:21:38.560
like i don't think

02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:41.600
segura experienced that lifestyle i

02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:43.200
don't think joe experienced it

02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:44.640
and i was like i don't think ari

02:21:44.640 --> 02:21:46.319
experienced it really either i

02:21:46.319 --> 02:21:47.280
definitely got it

02:21:47.280 --> 02:21:49.600
the like drinking but i also think it's

02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:50.560
part of that

02:21:50.560 --> 02:21:53.359
personality of being yeah canain i think

02:21:53.359 --> 02:21:55.040
canaan and tripoli do more of that like

02:21:55.040 --> 02:21:55.840
show's over

02:21:55.840 --> 02:21:57.680
and maybe a tale like shows over now

02:21:57.680 --> 02:21:59.520
where do we go i'm like

02:21:59.520 --> 02:22:01.200
maybe i can hook with a chick maybe i'll

02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:03.280
go see a movie if it's like a one show

02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:05.280
only night with like local comics

02:22:05.280 --> 02:22:08.960
maybe go eat but like i don't know my

02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:11.359
drugs were like daytime drugs

02:22:11.359 --> 02:22:12.560
yeah and i was saying that when you

02:22:12.560 --> 02:22:14.240
toured with rogan i was like he he

02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:15.439
always paid well

02:22:15.439 --> 02:22:18.319
and always took care of you guys yeah

02:22:18.319 --> 02:22:19.760
yeah we never had to figure out a way to

02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:20.840
get

02:22:20.840 --> 02:22:23.600
like a meal

02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:25.040
the only problem was when he wanted to

02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:26.319
like party too long and i had to figure

02:22:26.319 --> 02:22:27.120
out how to

with the staff and i went

02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:16.080
yeah and he goes he goes you like every

02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:17.280
night you party with the staff i go

02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:18.800
every night and he goes

02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:20.800
like every [ __ ] night i said yeah i

02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:22.080
go what do you do and he goes

02:26:22.080 --> 02:26:24.160
i go to my hotel room and i go to bed

02:26:24.160 --> 02:26:25.600
and i went you know why

02:26:25.600 --> 02:26:28.800
why okay he's got some argentinian in

02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:29.280
him

02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:30.800
uh his descendants and they think that

02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:32.720
the best of the latinos they look down

02:26:32.720 --> 02:26:34.240
their nose on other latinos

02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:36.640
and so he's internalized that he thinks

02:26:36.640 --> 02:26:38.319
staff they're working people

02:26:38.319 --> 02:26:41.120
i can't be seen with them uh and i don't

02:26:41.120 --> 02:26:42.399
respect them as like full

02:26:42.399 --> 02:26:44.880
humans that makes sense that makes a lot

02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:46.000
of sense

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:49.520
personal theory yeah he goes he's

02:26:49.520 --> 02:26:51.840
someone that just goes back to his hotel

02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:53.280
room that's crazy

02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:56.399
and goes well the reason i ever did the

02:26:56.399 --> 02:26:58.240
[ __ ] road at one point

02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:00.479
oh if they do a lock in that's my

02:27:00.479 --> 02:27:01.920
favorite you do a lock in where it's

02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:02.640

all this oh it's so fun

02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:14.160
it's so funny because you read this book

02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:16.080
and there's parts of it where you go

02:27:16.080 --> 02:27:19.040
that is so sad and then you remember you

02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:19.520

02:27:44.880 --> 02:27:47.200
bringing out how good josh snead was

02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:49.200
how he's the best comic they've ever had

02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:50.479

02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:06.880
laughing hysterically

02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:44.960
i was like

02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:48.000
do you realize how often i would do that

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:49.200
you know what i liked about the chapter

02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:51.520
i read that it's that there was a moment

02:29:51.520 --> 02:29:53.200
where he talks about and this is like

02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:55.760
lost in the [ __ ] as as comedy loses

02:29:55.760 --> 02:29:56.880
its outsider

02:29:56.880 --> 02:29:59.920
outlaw kind of mentality but like

02:29:59.920 --> 02:30:00.960
there's a moment of like i don't know if

02:30:00.960 --> 02:30:03.200
i can get these people

02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:04.800
and then you really he caught a rift he

02:30:04.800 --> 02:30:08.319
caught a [ __ ] uh you know a good

02:30:08.319 --> 02:30:09.840
you know riff and then he just like

02:30:09.840 --> 02:30:11.200
milked it into like the rest of his

02:30:11.200 --> 02:30:12.640
material and he got the crowd he got a

02:30:12.640 --> 02:30:14.319
[ __ ] dead crowd going

02:30:14.319 --> 02:30:16.640
and it's like when you're there with no

02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:18.479
fans nobody knows you

02:30:18.479 --> 02:30:20.080
and you're like how do i turn these

02:30:20.080 --> 02:30:22.479
people i can't rely on they see my bits

02:30:22.479 --> 02:30:23.920
or they follow my best

02:30:23.920 --> 02:30:26.000
it's just like they don't know me at all

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:27.359
how do i turn them

02:30:27.359 --> 02:30:29.040
and then the ability to turn an

02:30:29.040 --> 02:30:30.960
unturnable crowd is like that's the

02:30:30.960 --> 02:30:31.760
magic of

02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:33.280
me and that's completely lost in those

02:30:33.280 --> 02:30:35.439
[ __ ] theaters and

02:30:35.439 --> 02:30:38.399
clean glossy uh [ __ ] way it is now

02:30:38.399 --> 02:30:39.040

02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:29.439
by far the best book about stand-up

02:35:29.439 --> 02:35:31.120
comedy that's ever been written and one

02:35:31.120 --> 02:35:32.880
of my favorite books i've ever read

02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:35.040
all around yeah it is the best book

02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:36.800

what you're trading your time for is

02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:47.680
that lump of money in your sock

02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:51.280
yeah yeah i i

02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:54.160
i also i mean i i do not want to give

02:36:54.160 --> 02:36:56.160
too much of this book away but

02:36:56.160 --> 02:36:58.000
there is one part when you talk about

02:36:58.000 --> 02:36:59.760
rental cars and that is the only place

02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:01.040
that he matters

02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:02.960
yeah it's so funny where you how you

02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:04.960
hang your hat on those

02:37:04.960 --> 02:37:08.240
privileged things you earn as a comic

02:37:08.240 --> 02:37:10.160
and you know you met like you may not

02:37:10.160 --> 02:37:12.160
matter in the amarillo [ __ ]

02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:13.520
whatchamacallit but because you're

02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:15.600
executive platinum on american

02:37:15.600 --> 02:37:17.520
when you show up at that airport you're

02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:19.680
a millionaire you're a successful comic

02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:22.880
and that for me was something

02:37:22.880 --> 02:37:26.319
i didn't realize my ego needed like i've

02:37:26.319 --> 02:37:26.800
lost

02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:29.040
all my status on american because i

02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:31.200
haven't flown all year i won't have it

02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:32.160
right

02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:35.439
and i was like oh [ __ ]

02:37:35.439 --> 02:37:37.520
that is something that meant so much to

02:37:37.520 --> 02:37:39.359
me when i was a young comic

02:37:39.359 --> 02:37:41.680
i could tell you times where i i'm

02:37:41.680 --> 02:37:42.880
getting to the airport i was like hey

02:37:42.880 --> 02:37:43.520
will you check

02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:45.600
did i make platinum did i make platinum

02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:47.439
like those upgrades

02:37:47.439 --> 02:37:51.040
[ __ ] [ __ ] i loved i loved that he did

02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:52.640
not give a [ __ ] about cars

02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:54.720
i loved it because i don't give a [ __ ]

02:37:54.720 --> 02:37:56.560
about cars so i never was like

02:37:56.560 --> 02:37:57.920
i was never like yeah yeah give me the

02:37:57.920 --> 02:38:00.560
escalade you know i was always like

02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:04.160
i love that and and i i

02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:06.880
loved the end and i saw it i saw it i

02:38:06.880 --> 02:38:07.680
knew it

02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:09.760
before i knew it i got to tell you man

02:38:09.760 --> 02:38:11.359
i've never wanted

02:38:11.359 --> 02:38:14.800
cold beers more in my life in my life

02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:16.080
than when i was reading that

02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:19.040
the way he drinks a beer and and pulls a

02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:20.000
beer down i

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:24.399
am i was i was like the whole time

02:38:24.399 --> 02:38:26.080
you can't give this book away when you

02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:27.200
keep saying i don't want to give too

02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:28.479
much away

02:38:28.479 --> 02:38:30.880
it's so well written earlier you talked

02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:31.600
about

02:38:31.600 --> 02:38:34.399
fly boys bill bird told you to you gave

02:38:34.399 --> 02:38:35.520
the book away

02:38:35.520 --> 02:38:37.840
but i still want to read it yeah they

02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:38.960
eat the people

02:38:38.960 --> 02:38:41.600
yeah okay i'm going to read that it's so

02:38:41.600 --> 02:38:43.200
well written even if you knew where it

02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:43.920
was going

02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:45.920
it doesn't matter oh it doesn't matter

02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:48.000
at all it doesn't

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.479
matter at all and it's crazy like the

02:38:50.479 --> 02:38:53.920
the way he finds people who do drugs

02:38:53.920 --> 02:38:57.040
it's so interesting that once you are

02:38:57.040 --> 02:39:00.080
broken you find the broken people with

02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:00.800
you

02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:03.760
so [ __ ] quickly that my wife would

02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:04.880
never be able to see it

02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:07.439
but once you see it you know how to spot

02:39:07.439 --> 02:39:09.520
out broken people

02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:11.120
and that there's so many insights on

02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:12.560
this book that they just

02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:15.600
it was such an amazing

02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:18.800
book that i actually want to give it to

02:39:18.800 --> 02:39:20.319
my daughters

02:39:20.319 --> 02:39:21.920
when when like you know when they're

02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:23.840
older and go hey do you remember when

02:39:23.840 --> 02:39:24.319
like

02:39:24.319 --> 02:39:27.200
i wasn't there like this isn't what i

02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:27.840
did

02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:30.479
but just so you know it's really [ __ ]

02:39:30.479 --> 02:39:30.960
close

02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:34.800
like i wasn't this bad but man i was

02:39:34.800 --> 02:39:38.080
like and it's yeah because my daughters

02:39:38.080 --> 02:39:39.200
have no frame of reference for what a

02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:41.040
comic does

02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:42.880
i think it's a good ya novel i think i'm

02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:44.319
gonna try and get it into schools

02:39:44.319 --> 02:39:46.399
that'd be a good move it's in prisons

02:39:46.399 --> 02:39:48.160
it's in seven different prisons

02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:49.680
i mean it's a staggering work of

02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:51.280
towering genius just buy the book you're

02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:52.160
