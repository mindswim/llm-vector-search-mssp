band when you have a name for it that

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.690
could be a good hook though it could be

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.700
a really cool hook to just never name it

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:31.470
a band with no name right right no one's

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.290

no now olive oil you shouldn't be

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.630
cooking in a pan like that

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.810
why not it's more of like a drizzle and

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.310
like a heat type of thing it's you were

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.680

olive what I mean I know it was not the

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:54.690
extra virgin olive oil I used a regular

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.240
olive oil the extra virgin olive oil is

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.990
a lower heat threshold and smokes but no

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.050
I used the normal olive oil

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.180
all right well I feel bad now because it

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.220

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:56.690

Shane Gillis if you don't know Shane

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.480

incredible stand-up comedian and I saw

his number calling and so I picked it up

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:15.649
and it was Shane Gillis and Doug

00:34:15.649 --> 00:34:19.040
Stanhope both on the phone unfortunately

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.260

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:29.840

generals to our listeners who don't know

what it is

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:37.499
okay well as far as I remember what we

00:39:37.499 --> 00:39:38.880
have to do is we have to throw our

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.690
pieces of celery onto the road yeah and

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:47.730
if if my piece gets hit you you have to

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:50.160
bite it or do I have to bite it I don't

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:50.989
know you tell me

00:39:50.989 --> 00:39:53.759
well I've been playing by myself so I

00:39:53.759 --> 00:39:55.619
gotta fight it no matter what

00:39:55.619 --> 00:39:57.690
yeah the way it works is you get it all

00:39:57.690 --> 00:39:59.779
though make little celery stick figures

00:39:59.779 --> 00:40:01.259
