00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.840
um look

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.800
it was

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.519
a trying morning i wake up

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.120
i'm in a bad mood

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.200
and what was i in a bad way why'd you

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.680
wake up in a bad mood i sometimes just

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.920
sh i have a lot going on so if if things

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.080
just don't go exactly the right way

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.920
i just get myself in a mood and what

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.280
happened was we were supposed to do this

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.599
podcast at two this all happened let me

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.120
explain to you how much happened if you

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.040
made terrible decisions over and over

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.680
again you would wake up in a bad mood

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.440
so to say if a man is right his world is

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.760
right dude for no apparent reason

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.760
sabotage yourself every day

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.840
this was this happened so quickly you

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.920
have to understand like uh we i texted

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.120

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.200
podcast right now is crazy okay yeah

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.720

00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:40.800
all of this is just happening and

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.000
unfolding

in between like we gotta go and i'm

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.680

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.920
the phone rings

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.519
like that and he picks up the phone and

00:13:53.519 --> 00:13:55.920
i'm like i was first

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.160

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.320
he should have answered that call

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.360
can we all admit that he should have

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.920
answered that call this is so crazy i i

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.000

started trying to tell your side of it

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:12.079
you just thought the hotel at least was

00:14:12.079 --> 00:14:13.839
a little bit responsible

00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:15.680
you just created this whole situation

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.240
dude at every step of the way like next

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.199
step i'm like this is where they

00:14:19.199 --> 00:14:21.360
probably lost patience no

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.519

understand they don't know what they're

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.240
dealing with at this point because a guy

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.639

00:16:16.639 --> 00:16:17.680
like

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.839
and every step to calm you down you've

00:16:19.839 --> 00:16:22.560
escalated you look people don't know

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.839

00:16:23.839 --> 00:16:25.519
[ __ ] world working at this hotel dude

00:16:25.519 --> 00:16:26.320
okay

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.079
so all they're seeing is some guy who's

00:16:28.079 --> 00:16:29.440
much bigger than them

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.600
just flipping out calming down flipping

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.839
out calming down over nothing that's

00:16:33.839 --> 00:16:35.680
true so they have no idea what you're

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.040
gonna do this is philly where people are

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.560
like that and yeah well you're lucky

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.320

00:16:46.079 --> 00:16:47.839
time so this was this was pretty mild

00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:49.839
overall yeah it wasn't that was honestly

00:16:49.839 --> 00:16:51.199

00:16:51.199 --> 00:16:52.399
dumber things

00:16:52.399 --> 00:16:54.000

you did but can i say what's going on

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.440
and already i have this in my head

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.279
everyone has an attitude at this hotel

00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:00.639

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.039
astonishing also i have to say it's

00:17:13.039 --> 00:17:15.039
what i love the most

00:17:15.039 --> 00:17:16.559
like

00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:18.240
this is what's so crazy about this lewis

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.679
is right now telling his side of the

00:17:19.679 --> 00:17:21.360
story i know

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.079
and

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.919
not one part of this can i give any of

00:17:23.919 --> 00:17:25.520
it to him no my brain would have totally

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.959
morphed this where i actually could have

00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:28.880
sounded like no no i was actually wrong

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.919
why

00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:32.080

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.240
a fair are you so smart some [ __ ] and

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.039
this

00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:37.440
this is insane it's my anger issues

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.360
here's my here's my problem if i feel

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.760
justified in my anger it doesn't matter

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.320
how small the transgression was

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.640
i will go really big and it's called joe

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.160
derosa's syndrome we're all familiar

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.960
with it i get crazy but i can't believe

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.160
it's bad about meds that's what i said

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.039
that was like they were wrong for us

00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:54.160
when me and myself had argument i was

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.679
like message yeah i probably okay let me

00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:56.880
tell you something but he was wrong

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.440
first here's okay here's something right

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.880
let me tell you something i've learned

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.799
from years of dealing with women that i

00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:04.400
can't believe that you haven't learned

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.240
what the just the amount of ass you

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.080
crush

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.120
okay if somebody's 25 wrong or whatever

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.160
and then you're 75 wrong you're 100

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.000
wrong that's called how the [ __ ]

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.640
civilization works women invented it

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.000
that's why you're always wrong in that

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.840
situation yeah uh

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.200
i don't know how you don't know this at

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.960
this point i can only assume a lot of

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.200
neglect so i say to the guy after he

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.880
gets security he has to call security i

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.080
have to wait for security now once again

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.679
now i'm just like [ __ ] like i gotta

00:18:31.679 --> 00:18:34.559
go now my soup's gonna be cold okay yeah

00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:36.799
uh so i'm waiting for security to come

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:38.799
and i say i can't the guy's face just

00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:40.080
this attitude in this guy's face just

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.760
like sort of looking down at his nose

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:42.880
and i said i was like hey by the way i

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.559
was like i was looking up in terror he

00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:46.559
was a very small man was he no no the

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:48.160
black guy behind the counter well you

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.720
probably set him off with those like

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.480
i did i did you know what i mean that

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.160
probably activated all his wheels

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.440
doesn't matter i'm still the you're

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.640
giving him like tongue sucks he was

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.480
probably like

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.240
probably flash back to his mom [ __ ]

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.240
with him this was like a whole

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.760
weird trauma collective going on in the

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.200
morning it was a dance between me and

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.360
the hilton pens landing

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.039
i was leading that dance but they were

00:19:09.039 --> 00:19:11.200
all dancing all right yeah sure for sure

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.880
you picked worthy opponents dude

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.400
couldn't we just get you to start like a

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.720
breakdance battle when you're mad

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.400
like get yeah what about timeouts dude

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.400
just go outside and like

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.840
so they

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.200
yeah so you're there so how does this

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.480
whole thing escalate to you

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.720
good trick so pretty cool

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.799
so security comes and and i t before

00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:29.840
security even gets here i tell the guy

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.200
behind the count i'm like dude at least

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.120
so you know i was like

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.640
it's terrible service oh the whole thing

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.919
i was like everybody every person

00:19:35.919 --> 00:19:37.600
nobody's smiling in this place i haven't

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.200
seen a single person happy to be here

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.240
when i checked it was the same thing it

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.440
was a weird little attitude when i

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.960
checked in and i was going like what is

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.000
going on i was like it's supposed to be

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.039
good customer service i was like i was

00:19:45.039 --> 00:19:46.559
like i've never had a ever i've never

00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:48.880
had anybody ever escort me to my room

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.400
and have a security escort meeting room

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.760
now you're right as i'm thinking back

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.280
now they probably were like this guy's a

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.039
problem security should escort him

00:19:55.039 --> 00:19:56.559
anywhere he goes in this hotel having

00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:58.160
nothing to do with even my interaction

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.760
or me for getting my room key yeah but

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.679
in my mind all i'm seeing is that he's

00:20:01.679 --> 00:20:03.360
having security escort me to my room for

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.440
my room key so which is weird i'm

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.799
telling you right now it's bad service

00:20:06.799 --> 00:20:07.840
every bit of service that i've dealt

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.600
with so far the hotel is bad and that's

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.840
putting me over the edge okay

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.919
so security guard this is where i know

00:20:13.919 --> 00:20:16.320
i'm right he follows me up and we get up

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.159
to the room and right before i get my id

00:20:18.159 --> 00:20:19.440
to show him that it was my room he goes

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.039
hey man let me talk to you and i was

00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:22.480
like what's up he goes he was like

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.440
you're right

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.640
like these people are terrible the

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.320
scooter said this to me it was like this

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.200
hill he was like you see him in a real

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.480
hold on this is managed by another

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.320
company that's not hilton okay it was

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.760
like it was like this it was like it

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.120
comes from the top down it's like

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.480
they're miserable nobody wants to work

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.600
here like i just came from the hyatt

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.880
this guy told me this guy broke this

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.880
[ __ ] [ __ ] down dude i swear to god

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.720
okay and then i started going yeah dude

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.480
i am right now i'm even more justified

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.480
i'm like he [ __ ] was he shouldn't

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.000
have done that he was bad there

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.440
he should have just had a united front

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.360
that's also bad management your [ __ ]

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.799
securities breaking [ __ ] squad

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:56.159
wow this is fascinating okay this guy

00:20:56.159 --> 00:20:58.080
is trying to calm me the [ __ ] down sure

00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.760
so he's just hitting a little bit good

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.080
cop and this maniac takes it as i should

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.320
get even more mad

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.360
i mean they literally tried everything

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.600
oh my god dude i've been in some bad

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.520
customer service jobs yeah and that

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.240
would break my limits of of what my what

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.919
i could do to get the customer yeah

00:21:15.919 --> 00:21:17.840
would he want the service he wants

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.679
you you have tested the limits of it i

00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:21.120
just want to smile and i want some soup

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.799
and some shrimp tacos yeah that's the

00:21:22.799 --> 00:21:24.880
other thing these people the employees

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.080
are living in a world where they're like

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.840
dealing with customers so like you're

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.360
activating all their [ __ ] but that's

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.200
what they do don't be in this world then

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.600
it's i i i don't be in this world then

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.440
they don't they don't aspire for it bro

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.679
they're like victims of circumstance

00:21:37.679 --> 00:21:39.520
were you raised by wolves

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.120
i was raised by ill-mannered wolves

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.799
actually they were the worst of the

00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:44.240
wolves in the forest people are paying

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.320
attention man you gotta really help your

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.080
kids out because

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.840
he just doesn't know i think you just

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.240
that's a fat how are you so savvy

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.679

00:21:57.679 --> 00:22:00.320

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.640
yeah so just then in this moment it's

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.559
just timing is such the [ __ ]

00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:08.559
everything here right

00:22:08.559 --> 00:22:11.120
knock on my door cleaning lady

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.720
so um

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.039
and she comes in the room

00:22:15.039 --> 00:22:16.320
and i just come back here and i'd roll

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.159
the really nice blunt and i can smell

00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:19.840
the weaving room so when she comes in i

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.039
say to her

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:22.799
um i was like hey just so you know miss

00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:24.240
i was like i know it probably smells a

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.520
little bit like weed in here i was like

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.720
but i didn't smoke weed in the room i

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.159
just rolled in here and she was like oh

00:22:28.159 --> 00:22:29.840
no no no

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.679
so then

00:22:31.679 --> 00:22:33.840
a guy in a suit happens to be walking by

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.600
right then yeah and i said let me tell

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.600
him this because that's how they found

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.600
out jesus christ

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.799

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.480
were like i should tell these guys i

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.840

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.480

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.840
yes bro

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:52.960
this is probably the craziest thing

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.400
that's ever happened since that hotel's

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.240
been built

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.679
i thought that they followed you into

00:22:57.679 --> 00:22:59.440
your room and just were like no i think

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.600
the i think that other security guard

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.120
was following me up there and keeping an

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.039
eye right so listen to what happens

00:23:05.039 --> 00:23:06.480
he kind of peeks in as i'm telling her

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.840
this i didn't just go get him like the

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.360
guy who came from the hyatt was a triple

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.600
agent now no hyatt's guy's gone another

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.720
guy's there okay yeah hispanic guy and

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.559
he as i'm saying the star he walks by

00:23:16.559 --> 00:23:17.760
and i see him kind of pick his head in

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.440
the room so in that moment i'm just

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.640
going like i was like let me tell him

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.840
what i'm telling her because i don't

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.240

dude it really should be a television so

00:23:30.159 --> 00:23:31.440
i said this is like a series of

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.640
unfortunate events where you're just

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.720
creating them yeah

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.799

guess he saw me say weed or whatever he

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.679
looked up and then i was like i was just

00:23:43.679 --> 00:23:44.720
telling her i was like i rolled the

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.919

dude not since when i toured barry

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.200

okay you understand that's like the

00:27:45.679 --> 00:27:47.840
level of trauma yeah and he doesn't even

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.440

you shouldn't do that i think that you

00:30:48.399 --> 00:30:50.559

00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:52.240
pray to him daily there's a there's a

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.679
legion of gangster which that design

00:30:53.679 --> 00:30:55.520
where it's it's satan stabbing michael

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.960
the archangel and like through the heart

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.200

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:03.760
scene but it didn't look like uh

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.159
it almost sounds more epic in his story

00:32:06.159 --> 00:32:08.159
it's definitely a scene sure

00:32:08.159 --> 00:32:10.000
it wasn't a scene of like where i'm like

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.440

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.919
cops had been called when we were up in

00:32:15.919 --> 00:32:17.600
the room already the cops have been

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:18.559
called

00:32:18.559 --> 00:32:20.080

they're not going for that there has to

00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:34.000
they have to say a man is screaming and

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.679
then maybe they'll come

00:32:35.679 --> 00:32:38.559

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.519
given time doing that yeah they got to

00:32:45.519 --> 00:32:46.799
pick the right way worse like people

00:32:46.799 --> 00:32:48.480
like 302 i can't remember what the

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.159
amount of police there are for per

00:32:50.159 --> 00:32:51.840
population but it's like ridiculously

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.240
small here yeah yeah and they're lazy

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.200
too

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.559
so

00:32:56.559 --> 00:32:57.519
um

00:32:57.519 --> 00:32:58.559
the guy's like yeah so you're gonna have

00:32:58.559 --> 00:32:59.919
to get yourself and leave and i'm like

00:32:59.919 --> 00:33:01.440
yeah well get the cops i'm not [ __ ]

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.279
doing it all right how about that

00:33:03.279 --> 00:33:05.360
so um

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.039
then yeah metzger sees me kind of

00:33:07.039 --> 00:33:09.600
entering this thing and that's when

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.960
i call an uber because at this point i

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.159
gotta go and i'm like well i'm not even

00:33:12.159 --> 00:33:14.240
gonna [ __ ] wait okay i'm not waiting

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.440
around anymore and i have another friend

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.200
who's hanging out staying in the hotel

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.640
and um i was like well let's have my

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.080
friend pick up my stuff

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:20.960
okay

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.279
take it uh to his room and then that'll

00:33:23.279 --> 00:33:25.760
be that right she like broke up with him

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.120
you're like he'll come get my stuff yeah

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:30.880
come here yeah that's it so um

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.039
i i go give my key card to him and i

00:33:33.039 --> 00:33:34.720
leave i was like myself because he's

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.080
[ __ ] and i'm still waiting for the

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.159
cops because in my mind by the way one

00:33:38.159 --> 00:33:39.039
of the cops they're going to come

00:33:39.039 --> 00:33:40.399
they're going to side with me like in my

00:33:40.399 --> 00:33:41.360
mind i was like yeah the cops would

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.519
probably shoot the hilton manager so i

00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:44.640
was like you're lucky the cops aren't

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.559
here like in my mind i'm so justified

00:33:46.559 --> 00:33:47.440
you thought the cops are going to stay

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.559
on the ground they were going to come

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:50.080
and [ __ ] start lighting up the entire

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.159
staff dude

00:33:52.159 --> 00:33:53.600
battering ram in the door just start

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.279
[ __ ] plus are shooting all the

00:33:55.279 --> 00:33:56.240
employees they would have definitely

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.480
arrested you on site i would not be

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.080
doing a show tonight i know they would

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.279
the cops came they would have arrested

00:34:01.279 --> 00:34:02.799
you do you think they would have well

00:34:02.799 --> 00:34:04.080
they would have tried to get you out of

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:07.640
there but if you started

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.679
so you respect those who walk the thin

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:11.440
blue line i'm a [ __ ] right-wing

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.119
conservative christian so so you would

00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:14.560
have been like once the cops came you'd

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.000
be like thank god

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.639
please get me out of here exactly

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:20.800

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.160
cousin got banned from yellowstone for

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.680

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.320
saying that you're going to kill them

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.520
literally

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.200
and you're upset that someone isn't

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.960
smiling enough when you like you should

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.320
wear a sign

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.480
you're like

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.839
the amount of tolerance that you're

00:37:11.839 --> 00:37:14.000
requiring like the joker has that little

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.480
note that says i have a condition

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.079
you should because

00:37:18.079 --> 00:37:19.760
you don't have it like you should have

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.280
the most patience in the world for the

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.720
way you could flip out on something

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.960
that's crazy dude yeah it's tough people

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.240
aren't supposed to be extra cheerful in

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.400
case you get set off

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.839

that's like a daily occurrence dude

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.240
that's like

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.560
stupid [ __ ] where's my soup they

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:43.760
probably talk [ __ ] amongst themselves

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.760
like man [ __ ] that guy 15 minutes later

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.079
and by the way that kind of [ __ ] like

00:38:48.079 --> 00:38:50.240
you you dude that

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.359

yourself dude okay i know i have to fix

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.200
my telling these stories like we're all

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.800
like oh dude that's hilarious you

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.640
verbally abuse all these people and they

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.640
don't call cops that's not hilarious

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:03.040
that's a problem and you you a guy who's

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.640
good at business people don't want to

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.760
get in business

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.760
dude you could be all kinds of [ __ ] you

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.040
can't be that

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.800
you just you can't for what you're

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.000
trying to do

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.280
which by the way i'm on your channel

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.800
because i believe in it you can't do

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.880
that i believe in you but you just can't

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.040
do that okay it's going to

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.320
like

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:23.200
it's so far beyond the enormous leeway

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.359
that you have yeah

00:39:25.359 --> 00:39:26.839
you've so

00:39:26.839 --> 00:39:29.920
much dude you have so much leeway doing

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.280
in entertainment and all i know it's a

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.359
lot less than it used to be with like uh

00:39:33.359 --> 00:39:35.599
uh you know now that weinstein's down

00:39:35.599 --> 00:39:36.800
well by the way that's why i don't know

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.400
harvey weinstein never treated somebody

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.079
this way they

00:39:40.079 --> 00:39:41.599
they the reason they particularly don't

00:39:41.599 --> 00:39:44.079
like me uh in in the industry especially

00:39:44.079 --> 00:39:45.119
with like you know liberal leading

00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:46.960
comedians is because they look at me as

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.119
like an uncle tom they hate the fact

00:39:49.119 --> 00:39:50.160
that it's like with like my that's why

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.760
they really hate it afraid you're gonna

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.920
kill them they really hated milo because

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.839
he [ __ ] like he was a gay like they

00:39:55.839 --> 00:39:57.440
couldn't they didn't really call him a

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.560
nazi

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.000
like and they were they realize how

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.280
stupid they sound when they do that so

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.920
like they it angers them even more so

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.760
metzger you're probably right no no

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.319
listen what you just said i'm even more

00:40:08.319 --> 00:40:10.319
right because people that want to get

00:40:10.319 --> 00:40:11.040
you

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.640
okay who have any inkling and the reason

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.240
they want to get you is if you have any

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.520
success coming

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.280
okay if you have any success there's a

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.280
whole group of people there wait now

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.319
look

00:40:20.319 --> 00:40:22.000
you have enough puerto rican that it

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.319
hasn't [ __ ] you but you don't talk

00:40:24.319 --> 00:40:26.319
puerto rican this is not even you can't

00:40:26.319 --> 00:40:28.000
put this behavior on being puerto rican

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.240
this is something like florida level

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.359
upbringing

00:40:31.359 --> 00:40:32.240
okay

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.280
so so if you give enough rope you know

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.880
like

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.319

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.440
guy's oh yeah there's a limit to your

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.440
puerto rican that they're gonna give you

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.800
of course i know well here's the that

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.319
would be the case if hold on if i

00:40:48.319 --> 00:40:50.960

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:55.599
[ __ ]

00:40:55.599 --> 00:40:57.440

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.119
everyone's like yeah that sucks no you

00:40:59.119 --> 00:41:00.640

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.079

an honest way and i will admit that i'm

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:31.599
wrong in a lot of it sure but they all

00:41:31.599 --> 00:41:33.599

00:41:33.599 --> 00:41:35.599

00:41:41.119 --> 00:41:43.440
for hotel room i left it's my [ __ ] hold

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.839

the main bottom forget the hotel any of

00:41:47.599 --> 00:41:49.680
that okay it's getting into a rage and

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.280
then feeding it and feeding it and

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.560
feeding it yeah

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.480
and then looking and so that dude that's

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.240
an addiction that's an addiction it's

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.920
like any kind of drug you're getting

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.599
some kind of high off of this that

00:41:59.599 --> 00:42:01.440
little laugh you're doing you're getting

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.520
high from it it's very yeah you you're

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.720
getting something out of it and it's

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.960
it's dangerous well i'll tell you you're

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.000
almost like a joker you're going to

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.560
always remember as much of it it's not

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.319
you're there's something about you're

00:42:12.319 --> 00:42:14.079
right about something right where there

00:42:14.079 --> 00:42:16.079
is something weirdly i keep on coming

00:42:16.079 --> 00:42:17.440
back in this cycle right and there's an

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.640
addiction

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.119
to that feeling that's not the feeling

00:42:21.119 --> 00:42:22.000
because i don't like the feeling the

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
feeling gives me like mass anxiety the

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.240
problem was and i have this bitterness

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.319
in me where i feel like nobody's ever

00:42:28.319 --> 00:42:30.079
given me anything i've done everything

00:42:30.079 --> 00:42:32.000
for myself and then when i don't get

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.599
something the way that i want it i feel

00:42:33.599 --> 00:42:35.200
like it's a real like it's a personal

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.119
affront and it's it's because i've

00:42:37.119 --> 00:42:39.200
worked very hard to get where i'm at and

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.040
this means being very honest right

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.800
i'm not arguing you're you're right no

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.000
one's telling you a bad person what

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.079
happens with the anger why i get so

00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:47.440
justified in the moment where it's bad

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:49.119
customer service or whatever it is it's

00:42:49.119 --> 00:42:51.760
because i'm going like

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.079
people when i i downplay how bad my

00:42:54.079 --> 00:42:55.760
childhood was people have no clue you're

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.960
telling barry crimson's was raped as

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.160
four is like dude i would have taken a

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.520
raping at four over the [ __ ] that i

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.240
dealt with from zero to [ __ ] 14 right

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.440
one raping

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.520

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:06.720
you kidding me

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.640
i'm telling you so i think maybe i

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.480
downplay that and the [ __ ] that i have

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.480
to fight so what happens is i now i have

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.680
a little bit of success i have things

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.359
that i've worked very hard for and still

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:18.079
to this day nobody has given me [ __ ]

00:43:18.079 --> 00:43:19.680
nobody hands me anything i've never gone

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.280
on the road and opened up for people

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.880
nobody did nobody nobody gave me stage

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.960
time nothing nobody [ __ ] wanted to be

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:28.160
[ __ ] ever so when somebody

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.000
when i'm spending money

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.839
at a place and i'm [ __ ] and i work so

00:43:31.839 --> 00:43:33.040
hard every dollar i mean i'm so

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.960
emotionally connected to every dollar

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.880
because like i i was so poor i mean dude

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.319
i mean i remember being like a kid being

00:43:38.319 --> 00:43:39.040
like

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.480
[ __ ] dude i mean just fantasizing about

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.920
having money or just something just

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.520
being so [ __ ] poor

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.319
um it triggers this thing where i snap

00:43:46.319 --> 00:43:47.440
and i go

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.960
are you [ __ ] crazy like it's almost

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.400
like i don't say it like do you know who

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.599
i am but i have this attitude like are

00:43:51.599 --> 00:43:52.880
you [ __ ] do you know where i've come

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.800
from to get here this person behind a

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.560
[ __ ] hotel room desk is gonna you

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:58.160
look down their [ __ ] nose at me i'm

00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.920
getting angry now as i'm saying it right

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.319
yes so but i'm it's not justified but

00:44:02.319 --> 00:44:03.520
i'm trying to let you into my head a

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:04.880
little bit it's not as simple as me

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.240
going like i really like just being

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.079
shitty to people i hate it i don't like

00:44:08.079 --> 00:44:09.920
that feeling at all listen

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.280
there's no endorphins that are released

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:13.359
that i that i go like no it's funny you

00:44:13.359 --> 00:44:14.400
guys are making me laugh as i'm telling

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.760
the story and i know how ridiculous it

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.079
is i'm also willing and you said it's

00:44:18.079 --> 00:44:19.760
top of the show dude i'm more willing to

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.000
put myself out there and be honest about

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.359
it yes versus other people because most

00:44:23.359 --> 00:44:24.480
other people tell the story and they

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.319
would try to you know make themselves

00:44:26.319 --> 00:44:28.319
look like the [ __ ] truth look that's

00:44:28.319 --> 00:44:30.079
true that's very good about you okay i'm

00:44:30.079 --> 00:44:32.560
saying learn from it i i've been i have

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:34.480
i've been fighting look i've come very

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.079
far compared to where i tell you here's

00:44:36.079 --> 00:44:37.760
here's the feeling okay because i

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.440
definitely have blown up a bunch of

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.040
times okay

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.839
um one you you'll have the

00:44:43.839 --> 00:44:45.599
there's a thing of

00:44:45.599 --> 00:44:46.960
if you're gonna lose one little thing

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.720
like let's blow the whole thing up then

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.640
there's like this [ __ ]

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.480
uh fear of having something taken away

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.520
from you so that's part of it okay

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:56.560
and then

00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:00.240
uh there's a feeling of uh uh you're

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.560
this small thing that's been done to me

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.839
now you're to pay for every other

00:45:03.839 --> 00:45:05.520
[ __ ] thing that's been done to me

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.319
right yeah which which so on both counts

00:45:08.319 --> 00:45:11.119
you can't do that you're right so so

00:45:11.119 --> 00:45:12.960
listen i'm gonna tell you not to love

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.319
you should feel that's why you're good

00:45:14.319 --> 00:45:16.800
at the the other part because you're

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.359
you're putting yourself into it okay

00:45:19.359 --> 00:45:21.119
but same thing with comedy

00:45:21.119 --> 00:45:23.119
dude it'll help you in comedy too

00:45:23.119 --> 00:45:24.160
because you have a lot of good jokes

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.880
dude like and i this thing is going to

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:28.800
hold you back doing your jokes it's

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.160
going to hold you back on every [ __ ]

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.680
level because you're not willing to

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.040
fully put yourself out there and just

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.560
take the hit well i think where you're

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:38.160
right is i'm not willing to um

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:40.000
it's always a negotiation and everything

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.200
in life right it's always like a back

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.560
and forth negotiation just whatever if

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.480
you're walking down the street you know

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.319
everything in life is sort of like one

00:45:46.319 --> 00:45:47.359
person

00:45:47.359 --> 00:45:50.720
selling great at that so the problem is

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:53.599
i'm i'm not training myself to negotiate

00:45:53.599 --> 00:45:55.920
really well thank you so you don't have

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.359
to you're good at that i know i know but

00:45:57.359 --> 00:45:59.040
i'm saying like i'm not like it can't

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.720
always necessarily be my way this is

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.920
just like in terms of if you're if i was

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.520
building a robot right so i use this

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:04.960
analogy a lot right if i was building

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.200
the lewis j gomez robot right to be as

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.560
successful as possible right you're

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:09.440
building your building you're [ __ ]

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.200
mad at me customer robot master robot

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.160
and you're saying you're the [ __ ]

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.359
scientist you got a team of engineers

00:46:13.359 --> 00:46:14.960
behind you you build this thing to be

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.800
reactive and these algorithms where it

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.880
learns and it becomes better and it it's

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.280
to become the absolute most successful

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.640
being right

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.240
it would never do what i just did in the

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.599
hotel never in a million years it would

00:46:25.599 --> 00:46:27.440
never that robot would never in a m they

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.880
would never be programmed to go and do

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.040
that so i know i can step outside of

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.560
myself and give myself the correct

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.640
advice the problem is when you're so in

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:36.319
it i mean metzger you're you know you're

00:46:36.319 --> 00:46:38.160
a lunatic

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.400
once you see red and you're in it and it

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.839
was once again it was all these little

00:46:41.839 --> 00:46:43.200
ping ping ping everything just kept on

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.319
happening it's even funny as we were

00:46:44.319 --> 00:46:45.839
about to leave right after we came back

00:46:45.839 --> 00:46:47.839

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.720

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.720
and i go in and they're all in a huddle

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.400
i could tell they were just like

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.000
pts they huddled up against you jesus

so and i say the guy i'm like look i'm

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.960
very calm i'm not trying to close the

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.400
scene right now you asked me to leave

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.240
you told me to get my stuff i left i i

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.640
had my friend go get my stuff because um

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:19.920
i was in a hurry for an appointment i

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.359
was like i'm not trying to make anything

00:47:21.359 --> 00:47:22.319
right now i was like i'll be out of your

00:47:22.319 --> 00:47:23.599
hair i was like i need to get my stuff

00:47:23.599 --> 00:47:24.960
right now i need my friend to take it

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.200
yeah and then he was like

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:28.880
all right come on let's go

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:31.200
and then we went up three of us

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.839
my buddy met me in my room i left and

00:47:33.839 --> 00:47:36.640
then uh right before we were leaving

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:39.040
there was a car being valet parked right

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.280
in front of us

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.480
we were just about to be on it was all

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:43.920
done it was all settled by hitchhiking

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:45.440
15 minutes be right back

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.960
right

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.079
this car is just taking their [ __ ]

00:47:48.079 --> 00:47:50.160
time they won't leave and it's like once

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:51.599
again it feels like 10 minutes to me but

00:47:51.599 --> 00:47:52.960
it's probably two minutes three minutes

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:53.839
you know

00:47:53.839 --> 00:47:56.400
and we're just waiting waiting waiting

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.160
i could just open the door and put my

00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.920
foot out it's like what are you doing

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.680
let me go say something like due to the

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.920
call

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.520
yeah i mean if you go so if you go back

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:06.960
to like all that early childhood stuff

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:08.880
so it seems like perceived disrespect's

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.640
a huge trigger for you

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.880
yeah probably you want to be a comic if

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.960
you want to be a comic because you you

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:17.280
dude the [ __ ] you're funny as [ __ ] is

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.880
you can do it

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.200
though your main block never mind all

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.200
this [ __ ] it's gonna [ __ ] you up what

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.319
you want to do if you want to be a comic

00:48:24.319 --> 00:48:26.160
you want to be a comic you better drop

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.160
that [ __ ] pride uh you know who never

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:28.880
like

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.000
you know

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.680
whoever you think you're better at as a

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:34.000
stand-up okay who's never say [ __ ] like

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.240
that i could tell i tell

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.640
like the prime to me example of of the

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:39.760
thing like

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:41.680
chappelle said on uh

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.440
in the dvds of the show like there's a

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:44.880
commentary like you don't get to have

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:47.839
your [ __ ] dignity and be a comic so

00:48:47.839 --> 00:48:49.040
in business

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.559
it's weird because it's a different

00:48:50.559 --> 00:48:52.319
because i don't i don't necessarily it's

00:48:52.319 --> 00:48:53.760
not funny for you to kick ass that's

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.200
well you're right i agree with that but

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.319
here's the thing i wouldn't this would

00:48:56.319 --> 00:48:59.280
never be first of all two things

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.640
this isn't me kicking ass this is me

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.160
being a lunatic and being wrong in the

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.079
wrong so that's why it's funny so people

00:49:04.079 --> 00:49:05.680
listen to these stories and i do put

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.280
myself out there a lot on these podcasts

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.440
and i'm the only one out of all my

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:11.119
friends the only one willing to [ __ ]

00:49:11.119 --> 00:49:12.640
bring that level of honesty and make

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.480
myself look like the [ __ ] it is

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.400
self-deprecation to a certain degree i

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.160
know that i'm not right i know i'm not

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.240
going like look at me guys i'm the

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.520
[ __ ] person who threatened to kick

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.119
everyone's ass at the hilton aren't i

00:49:23.119 --> 00:49:25.920
awesome you didn't say you're right

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:27.440
no i didn't think i said it

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.319
wrong i said i'm 75 wrong okay but i

00:49:30.319 --> 00:49:31.599
know that i'm wrong in the way that i

00:49:31.599 --> 00:49:34.079
reacted i'm right in having a reaction

00:49:34.079 --> 00:49:35.599
it's not the right reaction okay fair

00:49:35.599 --> 00:49:37.760
enough now what about they were wrong in

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.520
every scenario they were actually wrong

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:40.720
none of them were right the woman wasn't

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:42.800
actually helping me she was just being a

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.559
weird [ __ ] she seemed like she was

00:49:44.559 --> 00:49:46.000
trying to help you be honest but hey

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.280
like i know they told you one thing i'm

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.319
going to give you the truth it's

00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:50.000
actually going to be a little longer but

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.119
at the point that i say it's fine miss

00:49:51.119 --> 00:49:52.960
just put it in that's enough

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:54.559
it's enough and you're right i should

00:49:54.559 --> 00:49:57.520
have given her an attitude but i just

00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.880
you know let's say you're right okay

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:01.040
just let's go with that like so [ __ ]

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.119
what who who the [ __ ] are you that's how

00:50:03.119 --> 00:50:05.200
you should think who the like in that

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.119
situation here's why you can always

00:50:07.119 --> 00:50:09.680
simmer with rage later okay

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.079
uh uh but if you're smart you get what

00:50:12.079 --> 00:50:14.480
you want you understand like

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.240
you got like kevin hart hustle dude and

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:17.760
you're never gonna see him do that

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:20.400
except to his own entourage

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.920
yeah he films it and puts it out i don't

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.200
know why

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.640
you know but he saves it for the plastic

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:26.559
cup boys yeah but that's dude i don't do

00:50:26.559 --> 00:50:28.800
that to my entourage like my boys

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:29.839
it's funny as me mexico are sitting here

00:50:29.839 --> 00:50:30.800
if you're gonna do a big [ __ ] thing

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.160
but that typically isn't what happens

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.200
with me and my friends you know what i'm

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.240
saying like that's what you want by

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.599
being smart and all this stuff of course

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:37.280
you did get you got by being smart i got

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.880
you you're hungry no none of it was

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.559
screaming at people it's a weird in

00:50:40.559 --> 00:50:43.200
spite of in spite of my anger i i'm able

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.640
to create some things and people like

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:46.240
working with me sure because but i think

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:47.520
that's the thing once people are inside

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:49.440
of my circle it's very easy when you're

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.200
looking from the outside to go oh louis

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.280
is just a [ __ ] animal who screams and

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:56.079
gets an organs of cab drivers i'm also i

00:50:56.079 --> 00:50:57.599
everyone's embarrassed so they hide

00:50:57.599 --> 00:50:59.599
these moments from the public view right

00:50:59.599 --> 00:51:02.319
so the problem it's it's

00:51:02.319 --> 00:51:05.200
i do a lot of other [ __ ] 99 of my day is

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.200
working with people and making i mean i

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.400
don't think people think you just i

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.680
think you know i know like people that

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:11.280
know people i think you feel you're that

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.280
what you you the way you're talking

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.960
about this [ __ ] is like you feel that's

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:16.000
what you are

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.520
this animal that yells no that's not

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.760
true the way he's talked about it now

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:22.480
is like what i am what i am that's not

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:23.760
true i don't think so i think i'm being

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:26.079
somewhat um i don't think you are just i

00:51:26.079 --> 00:51:27.839
think that you have i think i'm being so

00:51:27.839 --> 00:51:28.720
i don't know i'm being somewhat

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.000
reflective right now i mean i don't i

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:30.960
don't think i'm saying i am there's

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.800
always a deeper level i've said i need

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.559
to i need to be better i know that it's

00:51:34.559 --> 00:51:36.079
not the right way to act and i said if i

00:51:36.079 --> 00:51:37.440
was to build a robot i would never have

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:38.960
it to act that way i'm not there's no

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.640
part of me that's going i am what i am

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.920
[ __ ] you world

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.760
i'm telling i'm just being honest about

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:46.720
it and the problem is i think people can

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.079
sort of look at these moments these are

00:51:48.079 --> 00:51:49.280
the big funny moments like i don't sit

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.319
here and go like well let me explain to

00:51:50.319 --> 00:51:52.160
you what i did today for the ad sales

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.440
side let me show you the five [ __ ]

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.680
meetings i had with you know various you

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.119
know companies or partners or whatever

00:51:57.119 --> 00:51:58.559
it is that shit's not funny or

00:51:58.559 --> 00:51:59.440
interesting and to be honest with you

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.359
that's not really what i've built myself

00:52:01.359 --> 00:52:03.200
to be known as so if i really break it

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.800
down in an honest way it's like no i can

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.480
be like every other [ __ ] and all the

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.400
[ __ ] that i'm that most people be

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.920
embarrassed about i wouldn't put out

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:11.440
there and i would hide it and i would

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.040
present this perfect version of myself

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.559
but i think the reason my fans like me

00:52:14.559 --> 00:52:16.880
and appreciate me is because i'm willing

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:18.400
to do that and i'm willing to admit that

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.440
i [ __ ] up and i think they see

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.800
themselves in me a little bit even if

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.000
it's not as extreme i think they go

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.359
alright you know what dude [ __ ] we all

00:52:23.359 --> 00:52:25.280
[ __ ] up we all have these issues so i

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.359
just disagree with you on that and

00:52:27.359 --> 00:52:29.200
what yeah i'm confused i disagree i

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.800
disagree with you that it it's sort of

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.599
this like

00:52:33.599 --> 00:52:36.160
huge detriment to my career and to who i

00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:38.800
am i i do the being like that yeah that

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:39.680

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:41.440

00:52:53.839 --> 00:52:55.680

00:53:04.319 --> 00:53:05.760
story again or whatever maybe this is

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:07.200
the last one that you have ever like

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.640
that okay

like

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.119
you're not you don't understand like

00:53:11.119 --> 00:53:14.000
like putting information out there

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.359
it's not just companies trying to take

00:53:15.359 --> 00:53:17.599
your information it's everyone and if

00:53:17.599 --> 00:53:19.040
some little [ __ ]

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.880
who there's plenty of sees you're

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:23.200
getting something big they're gonna go

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:25.200
now's my chance to keep them down okay

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.800
and if you're worried about that

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.880
things that you put your heart into

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.800
being ripped away from you that's how

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:33.119
it's gonna go okay and that feeling is

00:53:33.119 --> 00:53:34.559
gonna be way more intense than not

00:53:34.559 --> 00:53:36.400
getting a smile with your shrimp taco

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:38.720
it's gonna be a [ __ ] devastating dude

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.880
yeah and it and then if god forbid that

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:42.880
kind of stress is on you and your

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.839
instinct is to go complete cold fusion

00:53:45.839 --> 00:53:48.000
self-fueling [ __ ] rage like you'll

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.319
die you'll it will kill you

00:53:50.319 --> 00:53:51.440
so

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:53.200
what i'm saying is just be have the

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.880
humility and be like oh [ __ ] me i

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:57.280
deserve it because just so you know you

00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:59.200
deserve like four more frowns that you

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.559
didn't do anything about for this

00:54:00.559 --> 00:54:02.319
incident just remember that just keep

00:54:02.319 --> 00:54:04.160
that's where the jesus can help you just

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:05.200

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:09.200

you're not worse than everybody look

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:14.400
that's a good way to look at it i i

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.240
agree with that's a better way that's a

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:17.920
great

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.200
um

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:21.040
so much but that no that's a great tool

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.720
to like you know sort of control like

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:24.079
you know what think about each time i

00:54:24.079 --> 00:54:26.079
was an [ __ ] or you know i didn't get

00:54:26.079 --> 00:54:27.839

00:54:27.839 --> 00:54:29.280
whatever it is right you know cheating

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.960
on a chick or whatever yeah i probably

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:32.720
did that's a good but

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.960
also

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.559
you know

00:54:36.559 --> 00:54:37.839
sometimes people got to be told babe but

00:54:37.839 --> 00:54:39.440
boy

00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:40.720

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:42.880
they're gonna be told and you've done

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.440
more than your batman amount of work

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:47.119
fighting injustice fighting poor

00:54:47.119 --> 00:54:49.359
customers now you can hang up the cow i

00:54:49.359 --> 00:54:50.880
i have you're right but i mean there

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:52.720
also is something to like

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:55.440
you know i i'm doing okay for myself and

00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:56.480
it's

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:57.920
not i want you to keep it but it's not

00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:59.920
just it's not i said before in spite of

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:03.440
my anger in spite of my instincts

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:05.280
you know some of that

00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:08.000
drives why i do very well some of that

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.599
you know sure you're gonna get the wrong

00:55:09.599 --> 00:55:11.040
look i don't want you

00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.280
i hope it won't be this bad ever but

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.640
you're gonna get the owen benjamin

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.079
validation

00:55:16.079 --> 00:55:17.599
like like

00:55:17.599 --> 00:55:19.440
the fact that you attract people with

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:20.799
your horseshit is actually good that

00:55:20.799 --> 00:55:22.000
there's a lot of people sharing pain

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.760
with you so

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:24.960
now you're just in a position you've got

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:27.040
to be responsible like you you your kids

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:28.240
should never see you acting like you're

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.839
very good with your son like well my son

00:55:29.839 --> 00:55:31.440
it's a different thing because like i

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:32.720
mean even times where i've gotten like

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:34.480
angry in front of him like i feel so

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:35.760
guilty and i apologize to him

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.520
immediately and it's not it's never

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:39.359
anything like crazy sure i mean luckily

00:55:39.359 --> 00:55:40.960
my kid my kid probably [ __ ] saved my

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:43.520
life because i don't i constantly think

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.640
about that like i don't want to get

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:47.040
[ __ ] stabbed like my dad was you know

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.319
it was a fight outside of a strip club

00:55:48.319 --> 00:55:49.440
like my dad was stabbed to death because

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:50.960
he just couldn't control his anger and

00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:53.200
got into a thing you know so

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.559
it's uh it's something i think about

00:55:54.559 --> 00:55:56.000
constantly you know and it's a constant

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.200
battle and i've been to anger management

00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.559
for years now at this point i go to

00:55:58.559 --> 00:56:00.880
therapy i'm on my mind

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:02.079
what

00:56:02.079 --> 00:56:05.119
um they uh

00:56:05.119 --> 00:56:06.319
i mean it's just a lot of like just

00:56:06.319 --> 00:56:08.240
talking about the issues the the problem

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:10.160
the problem is i'm

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.000
now not seeing my same anger management

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:12.880
counselor i think i should probably go

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.240
back to the same check because yeah i'm

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.520
seeing her weekly i'm seeing therapists

00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:17.119
every two weeks now and my anger

00:56:17.119 --> 00:56:19.280
specifically it was all keeping a log

00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:20.480
every time i got angry what i got angry

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.599
about and it would keep me so

00:56:21.599 --> 00:56:23.119
accountable yeah that i'd be like ah

00:56:23.119 --> 00:56:24.480
[ __ ] like as i started getting angry i

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:25.839
was like do i need to log this [ __ ] am i

00:56:25.839 --> 00:56:27.119
gonna have to go and have a discussion

00:56:27.119 --> 00:56:28.880
about the so it would almost like

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:32.400
keep me at bay and i can do it with my

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:33.520
kid you know what i'm saying so i know i

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:35.040
have the ability to not flip out because

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:36.160
if i'm walking on the street my kid i

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.760
don't [ __ ] just go and do that on

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:38.640
people

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:39.440
um

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:42.160
so yeah dude you're 100 right about the

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:44.000
advice that you're giving me i do feel

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.440
like

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:47.599
you know

00:56:47.599 --> 00:56:49.520
i i feel like you're being maybe a

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:51.520
little over paranoid for me because i

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:54.160
don't feel like this thing specifically

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:55.680
is something that like this thing

00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:57.119
specifically isn't that's why it's

00:56:57.119 --> 00:56:59.280
important now for you but

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:00.880
i'm not i think he's talking about like

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:02.640
the pattern what about raping women i'm

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.880
not hitting [ __ ] i'm not i'm not going

00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:06.000
out and hurting

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.680
you know kids i'm not it doesn't you

00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:08.880
know

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:10.000
but here's what i'm saying like you

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.400
could get in trouble for [ __ ]

00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:13.920
i just worst case scenario if somebody

00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:14.960
videotaped me yelling at a [ __ ]

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:16.880
security guard at hotel who [ __ ]

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:18.960
cares i just don't know that i i can't

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.799
connect with like that as this big

00:57:20.799 --> 00:57:22.799
detriment that's just not the thing well

00:57:22.799 --> 00:57:24.079
i know it's not right having nothing to

00:57:24.079 --> 00:57:25.680
do with my career it's not right having

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:27.040
you with humanity like i know i

00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:28.640
shouldn't be that way i'm not looking i

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:30.319
was like i'm gonna lose my [ __ ] you

00:57:30.319 --> 00:57:32.079
know racist podcast network because

00:57:32.079 --> 00:57:33.839
[ __ ] i yelled at someone

00:57:33.839 --> 00:57:35.440
doesn't matter oh that's i built all my

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.280
own [ __ ] [ __ ] for a reason because

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.200
once again nobody's giving me anything

00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:40.720
oh and the reason i flipped out was

00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:42.640
because owen had [ __ ] owen was [ __ ]

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:44.400
with winona ryder owen was a [ __ ]

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:46.559
a-lister he was in hollywood and you

00:57:46.559 --> 00:57:48.000
know he started talking about some real

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.359
[ __ ] and i agree with that the joke that

00:57:49.359 --> 00:57:50.480
he told i completely agree with the

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:52.480
whole trans kid joke what was the joke i

00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:53.520
didn't remember but it was like just

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:54.799
talking about yeah you shouldn't allow

00:57:54.799 --> 00:57:56.319
kids to take hormones i think it's an

00:57:56.319 --> 00:57:58.160
honest conversation and they fired him

00:57:58.160 --> 00:57:59.680
from a college and then he sort of went

00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:02.400
down this path and i think that

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:05.119
that became almost like he saw success

00:58:05.119 --> 00:58:07.119
in saying [ __ ] you to the system and

00:58:07.119 --> 00:58:08.799
then he just went kept on going and kept

00:58:08.799 --> 00:58:10.079
on going

00:58:10.079 --> 00:58:12.240
i i'm just not that guy like i i it's

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:13.839
just a different thing i have too much

00:58:13.839 --> 00:58:16.000
going on right now i'm not a guy who is

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.359
has an agent that could fire i have an

00:58:17.359 --> 00:58:18.319
agent but he's not going to [ __ ]

00:58:18.319 --> 00:58:20.799
fight i'm good ooh i'm gonna i i do more

00:58:20.799 --> 00:58:22.400
for my career than anybody does nobody

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.640
like well yeah i don't i don't have a uh

00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:25.440
you know

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.680
a tv deal i don't have uh it's not and

00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:29.440
it's not happening ever no it's not in

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:30.480
the works it's not like i'm writing a

00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:32.319
script and waiting to sell it i've given

00:58:32.319 --> 00:58:34.799
up on all that [ __ ] i will be a [ __ ]

00:58:34.799 --> 00:58:36.319
multi-millionaire i will be very

00:58:36.319 --> 00:58:38.000
successful i will be

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.440
in charge of all of my own [ __ ] and i

00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:40.880
honestly i won't have any bosses i do

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.400
not work well with anybody working above

00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.400
me so

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.079
you're right none of this stuff is right

00:58:46.079 --> 00:58:47.680
but i just don't think that

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:48.799
i feel like it's not the same thing

00:58:48.799 --> 00:58:50.400
maybe you're you also said it before

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.640
you're like you're like you know there's

00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:54.079
not every comic is the same i don't know

00:58:54.079 --> 00:58:55.920
i think you don't you argue you you

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:57.599
don't need that like what is what is the

00:58:57.599 --> 00:58:59.280
argument that's not are you saying like

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:00.559
what do you what's the i don't even know

00:59:00.559 --> 00:59:01.440
what you're disagreeing with he's saying

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:03.280
it's potentially you could lead

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:05.359
spazzing just at will could potentially

00:59:05.359 --> 00:59:06.880
lead to an outburst that could be traced

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.400
back and used negatively against you

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.079
that seems to be yeah maybe but we all

00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:11.680
are in agreement you can't do this you

00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:13.280
gotta do i just don't think it's as big

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:14.640
of a detriment to my career because it

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:16.160
hasn't it has yet to have been the

00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:18.319
detriment it could be but now things are

00:59:18.319 --> 00:59:19.839
ratcheting it up and i'm telling you

00:59:19.839 --> 00:59:21.920
dude you're not going to see it until

00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:23.440
people you have something

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:25.119
imagine okay so your friends are winona

00:59:25.119 --> 00:59:26.880
ryder whoever right and imagine if owen

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:28.960
had built a business that would rival

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:31.359
the people that she would get hired by

00:59:31.359 --> 00:59:32.960
well well now it's time to find a way to

00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:35.520
ruin you okay so

00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:37.440
especially with your your top dog

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.520
[ __ ] feelings you got that's what you

00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:41.359
super have to be conscious of because

00:59:41.359 --> 00:59:42.880
there's other predators

00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:45.040
way above you and they're

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.480
what were we talking about yesterday at

00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:48.240
that show where you you

00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:50.079
realize you couldn't beat up some guy

00:59:50.079 --> 00:59:51.839
who's mma and you're like i think i beat

00:59:51.839 --> 00:59:54.400
up everybody yeah oh uh well bisping i

00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:56.640
trained with him yeah yeah like

00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:58.240
that there's a part of that that's like

00:59:58.240 --> 00:59:59.440
good that i don't think you should let

00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.680
go of that kind of i'm game to whatever

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:03.680
you know what i mean it's just the

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.599
arrogant part of it like

01:00:05.599 --> 01:00:07.200
like uh

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.200
it's like a thing of like uh i'll have

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.119
to be shown that i can't

01:00:11.119 --> 01:00:12.880
uh beat up this guy who professionally

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.040
does this the it's

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.440
that that spirit's a good spirit the the

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.680
thing that's not is is uh

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:21.599
thinking that you're at a level already

01:00:21.599 --> 01:00:22.720
of something

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.400
like people tell you and and they will

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.359
do like

01:00:25.359 --> 01:00:27.119
the [ __ ] that i see you build up and

01:00:27.119 --> 01:00:29.839
like i'm so impressed by

01:00:29.839 --> 01:00:31.359
literally don't you don't ever have to

01:00:31.359 --> 01:00:33.599
be looking for anyone's validation just

01:00:33.599 --> 01:00:35.200
do your thing it'll just come to you

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.839
dude naturally without any of you like

01:00:37.839 --> 01:00:39.440
all your hustle and [ __ ] your business

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.119
side

01:00:41.119 --> 01:00:42.799
that's why that shit's so sharp and

01:00:42.799 --> 01:00:44.000
you're doing you are trying to be

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.599
genuine all the time so your performing

01:00:45.599 --> 01:00:46.880
side

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.720
it's like it's affecting that dude it's

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.880
affecting that and it's holding you back

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.799
comedically because you got you like

01:00:52.799 --> 01:00:54.400
your [ __ ] that's so good is so good and

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.240
then you have [ __ ] where i can tell it's

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.680
like trying to be the bouncer a little

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:58.640
bit

01:00:58.640 --> 01:00:59.839
like like

01:00:59.839 --> 01:01:01.760
just be like if i get

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.040
you already honest like i don't give a

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.240
[ __ ] if i'm wrong you're telling a story

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.680
so get your ass kicked or have somebody

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.160
be rude to you no just allow it but i

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.240
agree with you that i think that maybe

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.319
we're just

01:01:12.319 --> 01:01:14.400
once again maybe we're just sort of like

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.119
i don't know if we're gonna start

01:01:15.119 --> 01:01:16.400
talking about the same thing because

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.400
comedically yeah no i i completely agree

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.319
i come from the same thing to me but i

01:01:20.319 --> 01:01:22.319
came yeah but it's not one thing it's

01:01:22.319 --> 01:01:24.000
also being being a comedian it's

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.920
sometimes not the funniest thing to go

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:28.160
into uh ad sales meeting and to talk

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.760
about it i mean it's just not it's not

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.960
the same thing and the reality is if i

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.880
was just a comedian i would be a [ __ ]

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.480
broke [ __ ] with roommates right now i

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.599
had to go and create other opportunities

01:01:35.599 --> 01:01:37.040
for myself in order to have any sort of

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.359
real success so i can go and play at

01:01:39.359 --> 01:01:40.720
night and do jokes and tell jokes and

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.240
now i've crossed the threshold where now

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.599
i'm actually making money doing stand up

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:45.200
on the road and but i had to go and sort

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.440
of create a whole other path for myself

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.880
that didn't exist well think about it

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:51.280
dude take yourself great take yourself

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.720
out of it and think about a dude who's

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.559
filling bowls of soup for [ __ ] like

01:01:54.559 --> 01:01:56.079
nine bucks an hour

01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:57.200
you know what i mean or a lady who's

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.480
just sitting at a counter it's like the

01:01:58.480 --> 01:01:59.760
last thing she needs is someone like

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.520
[ __ ] bugging on her and she probably

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.640
doesn't give a [ __ ] about her job

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.559
because like al bell

01:02:04.559 --> 01:02:08.240
i don't know like it barely pays any

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.079
money the person is working for like

01:02:10.079 --> 01:02:12.160
barely able to afford an apartment

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.520
where the [ __ ] is my ship that i

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.480
shouldn't act this way ladies and

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.599
gentlemen

01:02:15.599 --> 01:02:16.799
you guys are hungry

01:02:16.799 --> 01:02:19.200
is different it's a it's a thing about

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.599
you've got a resentment of of certain

01:02:21.599 --> 01:02:23.039
it would i do it i know it's a

01:02:23.039 --> 01:02:24.640
psychological problem

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.079
i'm not even arguing that i should act

01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:27.440
that way i'm just letting you know

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:28.640
what's going on in my head and why i

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.240
start to justify it what's happening

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.599
everything's pinging off the exact

01:02:31.599 --> 01:02:33.359
moment and then i sit back and i reflect

01:02:33.359 --> 01:02:34.880
and i go oh [ __ ] no i shouldn't be that

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.799
way yeah so what's the plan to not do

01:02:36.799 --> 01:02:38.000
that again

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.599
um i gotta go back to anger management

01:02:39.599 --> 01:02:41.520
yeah that's like today made me go like i

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.480
need to go back to anger management

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.400
because everything was so avoidable

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.240
where it was like even like and i could

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.160
just be right i could have gotten a free

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.079
night at the hilton pretty easily had i

01:02:50.079 --> 01:02:51.839
just written an email and been like hey

01:02:51.839 --> 01:02:52.960
you know it was a little weird because

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:54.559
everyone had an attitude this day and i

01:02:54.559 --> 01:02:55.680
had this person come up to me and this

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.039
person you know and if i would have

01:02:57.039 --> 01:02:58.640
handled it like a [ __ ] respectable

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.319
white person i could have gotten you

01:03:00.319 --> 01:03:01.920
know i would have just been on the right

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.400
the whole time it's almost like um i say

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.200
this to you

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:08.640
like an albanian it would be fine

01:03:11.039 --> 01:03:12.480
i say this to girlfriends all the time

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.240
like really

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.400
like because i just say i'm sorry like

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.520
it's such a great way to diffuse

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.480
something like i'm sorry but it was

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.440
totally my fault even if you don't

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:22.000
believe it yeah apologies

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.680
and you're like well now you're just

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:24.960
wrong because you just keep it going i

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.400
already apologize i'm out of it you know

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:27.440
what i'm saying so it's like sort of

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.200
like how much they how further they take

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:30.480
it it's like

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.599
um

01:03:31.599 --> 01:03:32.799
yeah i look i gotta go to anger

01:03:32.799 --> 01:03:34.079
management i'm not arguing that i should

01:03:34.079 --> 01:03:36.000
act that way um

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.920
i'm just saying that the thing that you

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.520
sort of connected this thing

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.920
you touched on it before metzger with

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:42.720
um

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.880
just sort of like the con i came from

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:47.520
the same like um you know lineage as you

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.559
in terms of all the comics that i

01:03:48.559 --> 01:03:50.000
respected and looked up to you you know

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.200
you were part of it so you know it was

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.119
like you and big j and nate and vicky

01:03:53.119 --> 01:03:53.839
and

01:03:53.839 --> 01:03:54.880
i was sort of looking up to you guys and

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.400
then you know from there you guys were

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.440
like looking at the guys like italian

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.559
patrice it was like the direct

01:03:58.559 --> 01:04:00.599
correlation so i know the whole

01:04:00.599 --> 01:04:02.400
self-deprecating like that that's what's

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.920
funny there's nothing funny about the

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.160
hero story i know that okay i i would

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:08.400
never go on stage and be like dude

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.520
i don't have a story about the fight

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.119
that i won well there's nothing funny

01:04:11.119 --> 01:04:13.119
about that i mean the thing the feeling

01:04:13.119 --> 01:04:14.240
of like

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.839
i'm not gonna take this [ __ ] like that

01:04:15.839 --> 01:04:16.799
feeling

01:04:16.799 --> 01:04:18.799
just take this [ __ ] and it's just

01:04:18.799 --> 01:04:20.480
principle for everything like a joke

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:21.920
somebody i think you can somebody's

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:24.400
extremely diverse right so i think that

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.680
you could have different personality

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.680
types and no i i i'm just not you don't

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:28.799
have to change personality type at all

01:04:28.799 --> 01:04:31.119
it's literally i just this dude it's

01:04:31.119 --> 01:04:33.200
almost like you if you into [ __ ]

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.280
martial arts or something it's just a

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:38.000
ben like to read principle

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.839
even on stage like like if somebody if

01:04:39.839 --> 01:04:41.280
somebody huckles you

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.880
you got to always just completely have

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.079
love for the crowd like it's your

01:04:44.079 --> 01:04:46.559
[ __ ] kid almost okay even when they

01:04:46.559 --> 01:04:47.599
suck

01:04:47.599 --> 01:04:50.160
so that's why you can't just

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.920
you can't respond with abuse you gotta

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:52.720
like

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.480
bend with it i've dude i've had a

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.160
million [ __ ] blow all kinds of

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.000
[ __ ] [ __ ] on stage of like so i

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.680
already know how this [ __ ] works

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:01.280
as long as you are in the moment and

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:03.280
you're not [ __ ]

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.039
that that thing of like you know taking

01:05:05.039 --> 01:05:06.799
the mask off and you're

01:05:06.799 --> 01:05:08.799
you're showing your pulsating [ __ ]

01:05:08.799 --> 01:05:10.000
rage

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.680
you don't want to do that like let's

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:15.039
also forget comedy guy who wins in mma

01:05:15.039 --> 01:05:16.559
yeah we talked to you and we interviewed

01:05:16.559 --> 01:05:19.680
him yeah yeah and he's yeah never angry

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:22.240
fighting ever never angry in a fight

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.440
because i was very curious about that

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:24.799
because like the fight only kind of like

01:05:24.799 --> 01:05:27.039
fights i bet it were pure adrenaline

01:05:27.039 --> 01:05:28.240
something

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.640
yeah i have no skill you know because

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:33.280
physically i would never be able to

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:34.319
so

01:05:34.319 --> 01:05:37.359
so that's that's put that into that that

01:05:37.359 --> 01:05:39.039
like think about it like that dude

01:05:39.039 --> 01:05:41.200
because that guy is a [ __ ]

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.799
i mean whatever it is you're threatening

01:05:42.799 --> 01:05:44.720
to do he can do and that guy

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.000
well by the way i didn't write a single

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.240
person today i didn't threaten kisses i

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.720
mean except for out loud no i did not i

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.400
did not threaten to kick anybody's ass i

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.839
called a [ __ ] [ __ ] all i was doing

01:05:53.839 --> 01:05:55.359
was that's progress screaming at their

01:05:55.359 --> 01:05:56.480
[ __ ] [ __ ] i wasn't threatening a

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:57.680
kick into his ass if i was oh if i

01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:58.559
threatened to kick somebody's ass i

01:05:58.559 --> 01:06:00.640
would get arrested well i'm glad by the

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.160
way the reason i was so confident that

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.400
the cops was like have the cops come

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:05.760
all right that's progress i'm glad to

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.920
hear it is progress they didn't there

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.599
was no physical thing where i felt like

01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:11.760
i needed to threaten to fight this guy

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.599
it was it was me saying you're a [ __ ]

01:06:13.599 --> 01:06:15.440
[ __ ] and as simple as that at the

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:16.319
point that they kicked me out of the

01:06:16.319 --> 01:06:18.000
hotel i was like well [ __ ] all of you

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.359

[ __ ] dick

see with that all that like

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.079
all that like anger kind of thing it's

01:06:24.079 --> 01:06:26.319
just like dirty burning fuel basically

01:06:26.319 --> 01:06:29.200
and and if you were using your journal

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.319
all the things you're gonna say that are

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:31.760
funny and it doesn't have to be related

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:32.960
to the situation do you know what i mean

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.720
that you have a joke that i like about

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:38.160
babies having a great body

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.640
yeah i'm just saying i'm not i'm some

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:42.480
right but

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.799
that's the joke that takes me down

01:06:44.799 --> 01:06:46.480
the thing of like holding on to your

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.079
anger until it can turn clever that's

01:06:48.079 --> 01:06:50.079
really what you got to do and so yeah

01:06:50.079 --> 01:06:51.359
you'll get jokes like that that don't

01:06:51.359 --> 01:06:52.559
even relate to the situation that

01:06:52.559 --> 01:06:54.400
happened because you just like just

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.319
[ __ ] process it and then

01:06:56.319 --> 01:06:57.920
make it make it into your art can i just

01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:00.720
play devil's advocate you look at things

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:04.400
very much try to kill the angel dude

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.720
look at things from what you look at

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.440
things for purely from a comedian

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.039
standpoint so you're i mean because you

01:07:11.039 --> 01:07:13.359
are very much i've had a million

01:07:13.359 --> 01:07:14.559
all kinds of places but i'm saying but

01:07:14.559 --> 01:07:15.520
everything you're saying right now is

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:17.119
like like i

01:07:17.119 --> 01:07:18.640
i'm not and you may be right in the

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:20.079
sense that like internalizing that would

01:07:20.079 --> 01:07:21.440
probably i'd probably come up with more

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:24.000
funny because of it however what am i

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.079
not i don't look at everything from the

01:07:26.079 --> 01:07:27.440
eyes of how am i going to become a

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:28.960
better stand-up comedian sometimes i

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.119
just [ __ ] you know i we all want to

01:07:31.119 --> 01:07:33.039
become a better comedian but i mean i'm

01:07:33.039 --> 01:07:34.240
becoming a better center community and

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.839
i'm you you have your modes right

01:07:35.839 --> 01:07:37.359
there's comedian mode there's business

01:07:37.359 --> 01:07:39.039
mode your business mode you're dead on

01:07:39.039 --> 01:07:40.559
for some reason when you get in comedian

01:07:40.559 --> 01:07:42.480
mode a whole bunch of horseshit comes

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:44.319
out okay

01:07:44.319 --> 01:07:46.880
that's and they clash somebody names

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:48.079
because you're we're here on you're

01:07:48.079 --> 01:07:49.839
doing a show so you're here in comedian

01:07:49.839 --> 01:07:52.079
business in your comedian personality

01:07:52.079 --> 01:07:54.000
that's when this horse [ __ ] comes out

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.920
your business [ __ ] is dead-on explain it

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:56.720
i don't know what you mean by that

01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:58.160
though the thing of losing your temper

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:00.079
somewhere doing it whatever like for

01:08:00.079 --> 01:08:02.000
some reason this is fused to your like

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.760
artist part of your life

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.520
okay so you're saying like i lean into

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.520
it with like who i am on stage and as a

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.200
podcaster like i'm not i don't think you

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.880
do an act i'm saying when you're okay

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.720
louis the business like you're talking

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.079
i'm just i'm not i'm genuinely not

01:08:14.079 --> 01:08:15.440
understanding what you mean by it in

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.359
business you would never be doing that

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:19.120
you get into your [ __ ] mode of

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.880
business and you yeah i wouldn't i would

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:23.359
if if i i could be triggered in a moment

01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:25.679
of like rage like yeah i mean i you know

01:08:25.679 --> 01:08:28.239
it's not crazy when i'm triggering and i

01:08:28.239 --> 01:08:29.359
have rage

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:31.040
there's no controlling it sometimes i

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.480
mean it's not like a conscious thing

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:34.400
where i'm going like oh yeah it's

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:39.199
something that like sure it's like

01:08:41.199 --> 01:08:42.960
you know i know that i shouldn't go up

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:44.080
and start getting in a guy's [ __ ]

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.359
face and trying to get him to fight me i

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:46.480
know that i shouldn't do that i wouldn't

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:48.560
give myself or give my kid that advice

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.400
but in the moment i feel justified and

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.080
i'm angry and the rage sets in and i'm

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:55.199
[ __ ] like you know i see red and i

01:08:55.199 --> 01:08:56.480
can't control it and it's something that

01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:00.560
i need to fix so i'm not really like

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.679
yeah i'm not really like i don't even

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:03.440
know if i'm not really arguing with you

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.960
i just feel like i'm not i do have a lot

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:08.719
of other layers beyond being just a

01:09:08.719 --> 01:09:11.759
comedian so and and a lot of that

01:09:11.759 --> 01:09:13.520
passion and rage and feeling like i'm

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.960
the [ __ ] and feeling like i'm on top i

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.480
know that's not the comedian thing to

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:18.400
say but if i'm trying to [ __ ] be

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:19.839
really successful and be a

01:09:19.839 --> 01:09:22.560
multi-millionaire and really [ __ ] you

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.159
have to do two different things the two

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:25.920
different look well for me i measure

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.759
success monetarily that's a very big

01:09:27.759 --> 01:09:29.199
part of success for me in my head like

01:09:29.199 --> 01:09:31.359
money is available yeah yeah so it is so

01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:35.839
no you you're not wrong that's a fact

01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:38.480
but you also want the comedy respect

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:40.000
okay well i'm never going to get the the

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.679
comedy respect i don't think you should

01:09:41.679 --> 01:09:43.920
give up on no i haven't i do let me say

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.239
something i i'm at such a comfortable

01:09:46.239 --> 01:09:47.839
place where i am with my my comedy right

01:09:47.839 --> 01:09:49.120
now i feel really good about it i i've

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.560
never i feel great about my special i

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.759
feel great about all the new stuff that

01:09:51.759 --> 01:09:54.159
i'm writing um but yeah i think i saw

01:09:54.159 --> 01:09:56.159
some horse [ __ ] in my act this residual

01:09:56.159 --> 01:09:58.880
left over um i think we all do if we're

01:09:58.880 --> 01:09:59.840
being completely honest she should

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.520
always feel like it's all horseshoe i

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.199
know that's the thing i tell like i tell

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:04.400
will tell you he's the worst comic in

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.719
the world it's psychotic however

01:10:06.719 --> 01:10:08.719
i don't know dude i need i'm a different

01:10:08.719 --> 01:10:11.600
person so i need to feel like i'm good i

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:12.800
need to like if i don't have that

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.560
validation right

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:15.600
um

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:18.159
i will not create i will just stop right

01:10:18.159 --> 01:10:18.960
so

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.719
it was yeah it was almost like i had to

01:10:20.719 --> 01:10:22.480
step back from stand up and create some

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.159
successes and my life makes sense in

01:10:24.159 --> 01:10:25.920
order to come back and i never stopped

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.760
doing stand up i just wasn't as hyper

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.040
focused when we were really starting gas

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.880
digital on the podcast network and now

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:32.320
that we've sort of crossed a certain

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.560
threshold now i'm uber focused on

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.080
stand-up but i sort of needed that

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.480
validity first so and you got that

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:39.760
validity very young so everyone's been

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:40.960
saying you're a [ __ ] genius no i

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.520
didn't yes

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:44.880
i was saying karma mask is a genius

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:46.400
since i've known him in comedy since he

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.560
was like a three year comic everyone

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.320
metzger knew everyone knew you were

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.480
brilliant don't you forget this i'm

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:53.199
telling you you don't have the

01:10:53.199 --> 01:10:54.800
perspective that i have on it everyone

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:55.920
knew when you were very young that you

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.040
were brilliant you may not have killed

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.800
the way that jay killed back then um

01:10:58.800 --> 01:10:59.840
because james was killed but nobody

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.679
considered jay a better comic than you

01:11:01.679 --> 01:11:02.719
everyone just knew that jay was a

01:11:02.719 --> 01:11:04.480
[ __ ] killer okay so but that

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.480
validation you got really young so it's

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:07.760
very easy for you to go like i do you

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:08.800
gotta always think you suck you gotta

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.560
always think it's like no dude for me if

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:11.440
i would have always thought i sucked and

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:12.800
i did that for [ __ ] years i would

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.000
come in i'm like yeah dude i'm just you

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.360
know big jay's lacking i'm not very good

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.800
i'm really trying to learn and then

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:18.000
eventually i was like oh [ __ ] people

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.520
started treating me that way and then i

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:21.280
said [ __ ] all that noise and i stopped

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:22.800
connecting myself go back go back wait

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.640
wait wait wait hold on sorry uh say that

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:25.679
again about

01:11:25.679 --> 01:11:27.679
just having the idea of like i suck me

01:11:27.679 --> 01:11:28.960
and david i was like yeah we're not very

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:30.080
good like these guys are great we're

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.920
just students of the game we're [ __ ]

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.840
and then eventually it was just we were

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.600
literally just big j's lackeys we were

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:37.120
guys that would hang out big j and it

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:39.280
wasn't until i literally consciously

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:40.800
remove myself and detach myself from

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.719
that scenario you do have to do that

01:11:42.719 --> 01:11:44.640
yeah and and went and created some

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:45.920
things for myself

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.120
i was able to create the confidence the

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.719
reason i'm a good guy

01:11:48.719 --> 01:11:50.239
is because i'm confident whereas back

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:51.199
then like

01:11:51.199 --> 01:11:53.440
i mean i i remember dude one day what

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:54.719
happened with me in comedy really [ __ ]

01:11:54.719 --> 01:11:56.000
up for years like i wanted to wrote a

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.120
big jag when i was really young in

01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:59.360
comedy like maybe a year in right they

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:00.560
just had an honest moment he shouldn't

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:01.520
have done this it was [ __ ] up for him

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:04.080
to do actually but uh i was like oh do

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:08.040
you go yes you lower your voice

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.800
he told me there was no tacos left

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.719
no he i asked him to go over my jokes

01:12:14.719 --> 01:12:16.480
with me and i'm a shitty young comic

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:17.600
right you know i'm just not good at

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.040
comedy so

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:19.840
uh

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:21.040
he's like all right tell me your jokes

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.239
you tell him the first joke he was like

01:12:22.239 --> 01:12:23.360
yeah it's terrible remember from your

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.520
act and i was like it's my opener like

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.040
tell me another one tell me another one

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:28.320
that's awful take it out of your act

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.480
right now that's my closer jay

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.239
and he just went over here i was like

01:12:32.239 --> 01:12:33.280
yeah dude yeah you're funny you'll

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.199
figure it out eventually now he in his

01:12:35.199 --> 01:12:36.560
mind this wasn't even interesting he

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.920
shouldn't have done that no i'll tell

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.280
you why

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.960
because we all suck at a year end he

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:42.239
shouldn't have broken down he should

01:12:42.239 --> 01:12:43.199
what he should have done was he should

01:12:43.199 --> 01:12:44.480
have said i'm not going to go over your

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.080
jokes i'm not going to go over your act

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.280
right now i was like

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.480
they probably all suck they're probably

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.239
all horseshit but you're funny and

01:12:50.239 --> 01:12:51.600
you'll figure it out eventually because

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.360
that's part of the process

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.679
he destroyed my confidence wait how long

01:12:55.679 --> 01:12:57.440
have you been doing it maybe a year like

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.120
i've destroyed my confidence to the

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.400
point where like i was devastated this

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:01.920
is the guy that i looked up to most you

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.520
don't think that happened to both me and

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:06.480
jay many times maybe you haven't a lot i

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.080
don't know i don't know dude

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:09.120
like

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.560
that's crazy dude keith robinson i

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:13.360
remember [ __ ] cut my ass down he was

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.800
dead right this is what i'm talking

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:16.719
about and you you wish to stroke upon

01:13:16.719 --> 01:13:19.679
him right in that moment

01:13:19.679 --> 01:13:21.280
no i go oh i gotta get better it's like

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:22.880
getting beat up by that guy you [ __ ]

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.080
thought you could beat up and you

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:25.360
trained and you're like oh i can't beat

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:27.760
a professional i just don't know that

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.679
it's not you being bad or good jay

01:13:29.679 --> 01:13:31.440
wasn't telling you you're not funny this

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:32.800
is hilarious because when i was with

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:33.920
delfino

01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:36.640
my ex is a ukulele comic now

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.000
we would be like we'd be in bed she'd

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.679
like do time to listen my joke i love

01:13:39.679 --> 01:13:41.360
going with people's jokes yeah the only

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.640
reason not to do it is because they're

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:44.320
going to get upset if you dude i

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.320
professionally write in a professional

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:47.520
place you're like [ __ ] well you

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:48.719
don't have time for people's [ __ ]

01:13:48.719 --> 01:13:50.560
emotions of course so this is not the

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.800
difference

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.280
it's louis i know what i'm i know what

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:56.480
i'm talking it's just you can give back

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:57.840
it's not of course

01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.199
and that's where you're wrong to relate

01:13:59.199 --> 01:14:01.360
this to i'm louis is bad or louis you're

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:04.159
acting you are not the same your act

01:14:04.159 --> 01:14:06.400
could stink in large chunks okay and

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.560
often it does that doesn't mean you're

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.320
bad you're funny if you made even one

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.080
funny thing you're funny yeah of course

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.239
your ex sting wait what are you crazy i

01:14:14.239 --> 01:14:15.360
know but that's what i'm saying for a

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:16.960
year comic though i don't agree that you

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:19.600
should go to a year comic and

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.360
tell them to take jokes out of their act

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:22.800
that you shouldn't do that you should

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:23.920
they should figure out that that joke

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.520
stinks eventually and drop it i just

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.880
feel like in my opinion that's a

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.640
shortcut and it's not a shortcut it's

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:30.480
not a shortcut which can be if you allow

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.920
see this one tomb if you'll just allow

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:33.760
it lewis i have all kinds of emotional

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.120
problems like you do

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:37.199
just one thing with comedy

01:14:37.199 --> 01:14:39.360
you need to allow you need to be [ __ ]

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:42.480
humiliated okay and and you're terrified

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:43.280
of it

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:44.800
you're terrified of being humiliated for

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.640
14 years it's pretty humiliating i've

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.080
already whatever you're talking about

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.760
it's sort of crazy let's go up to the

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.760
balls buddy i've done it i've done i've

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.199
gone through the balls everything you're

01:14:53.199 --> 01:14:54.480
talking about i've done i've been

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.600
humiliated i've been kicked into the

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.280
[ __ ] dirt i've had no opportunities

01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:58.719
afforded to me ever everything you're

01:14:58.719 --> 01:14:59.920
talking there's no i'm not like a guy

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.679
who has [ __ ] i don't know what you're in

01:15:01.679 --> 01:15:03.760
your mind you're not listening what okay

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:04.960
what i'm saying is it's very

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.120
specifically i forget forgive me forget

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.480
jay forget anything else i don't think

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:09.920
an older comic should go to a comic

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.520
that's doing comedy for a year whether

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:13.360
they look up to him or not and break

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.640
down their jokes and say you should get

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:15.920
rid of those jokes that iraq's right am

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.199
i wrong i'm sorry let me finish this

01:15:17.199 --> 01:15:19.040
point let me finish the point i did i

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.480
did and i don't think you should have if

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.000
i i've had comics do this to me at this

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.600
point young comics come up to you they

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.440
write they say hey dude you just and i

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:28.080
say no number one i say i'm not go ask a

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:29.920
better comic okay i'm not the guy to ask

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:31.600
but number two

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.520
they're going to figure out the jokes

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:34.719
they're going to go through the process

01:15:34.719 --> 01:15:36.080
of making those jokes better they're

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.520
going to stink at a year and there's no

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:39.280
[ __ ] comic that's good at a year end

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:40.960
it's impossible to write good jokes at a

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.880
year in sure well i would perform them i

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:45.520
say right it's nearly impossible

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:47.520
i mean i i think it's good for someone

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:49.760
to say like anybody honestly less than

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:51.440
five years it's very rare you're looking

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.320
at somebody who's been coming for less

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.159
than five years and

01:15:54.159 --> 01:15:55.440
not just go like if you're a good

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.560
comment you're gonna go oh yeah they're

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.239
so green that i can't even get past the

01:15:58.239 --> 01:16:01.040
fact that that was the challenge

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.560
horrible so

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.520
just easily looking back now you can see

01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:08.719
look if you drop the channel i'm just

01:16:08.719 --> 01:16:10.800
saying that i went for years it broke me

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.400
to the point where i was embarrassed to

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.480
get on stage it was the guy that maybe

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:15.760
you know i'm a connected idea enough it

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.440
was a guy that i looked up to the most

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.120
it devas i almost cried that night dude

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.400
it devastated you knew what it tell said

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:21.760
to me let me finish it's not about you

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.440
let me finish [ __ ] [ __ ] i don't

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.120
give a [ __ ] what to tell said to you all

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:26.480
right i'm saying the guy that i looked

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:27.600
up to most

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.199
broke my heart that night and it really

01:16:29.199 --> 01:16:31.360
did affect me in a very negative way and

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.120
i stopped like i stopped being able to

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.719
do good on stage i was killing it a year

01:16:34.719 --> 01:16:36.000
and by the way i was doing very well on

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
stage i would always do well and then

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.239
for like four or five years

01:16:40.239 --> 01:16:42.719
it like shut me down to where i was not

01:16:42.719 --> 01:16:44.320
doing very well on stage and it was

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.600
because i was so self-conscious jay

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:46.640
would literally stand in the back of the

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.719
room and i know it was funny to him but

01:16:48.719 --> 01:16:50.000
he didn't remember that he even had this

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.280
high conversation with me but he'd be

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.400
doing joking

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.679
he's being funny to [ __ ] with me and i

01:16:53.679 --> 01:16:56.000
know that it's very funny i get it but

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.600
in my head

01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.840
like he's disgusted but in my head i'm

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.840
being brought back to the hotel room but

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:03.520
he really thinks this he's not [ __ ]

01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:05.520
with me like in my and it it just [ __ ]

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:07.040
me up so what i'm saying is that we

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.400
could it's a stupid point to argue i

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.000
guess there's no really wrong or right

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.239
answer here good to him

01:17:12.239 --> 01:17:13.679
what do you think patricia lim did to

01:17:13.679 --> 01:17:15.040
jay by the way jay i don't know if

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.239
that's right either patrice is an

01:17:16.239 --> 01:17:17.920
[ __ ] but here's the genius but i

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:18.960
don't know if he's necessarily the

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:20.480
nicest person in the world to be

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:22.719
figuring out how to make you dude

01:17:22.719 --> 01:17:24.080
your chances of being funny are

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:25.840
specifically because of [ __ ] like that

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:28.480
yeah i mean like i've eaten enough [ __ ]

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.239
i'm saying jay what are you mccusker

01:17:30.239 --> 01:17:31.840
we're going back

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.679
there's a young buck comes up to you and

01:17:33.679 --> 01:17:35.600
he's like hey dude you know

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.960
would you would you would you tell him

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.560
all of his jokes sucked especially with

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:40.080
somebody that you really liked

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.520
here's the thing i could be super nice

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.719
to him and if he keeps doing them for

01:17:42.719 --> 01:17:43.840
two years it's not going to help him

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:45.360
it'll help me because i can be like well

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.800
i was doing it like if somebody but i

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.480
wouldn't say i wouldn't i wouldn't lie i

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.840
would say this is what i would say i

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:50.880
would say don't go over your jokes

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:51.760
because they're all going to suck this

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:53.040
is what i say i share this now i

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:54.560
remember this and this is what i do

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.760
because i have people ask me all the

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:56.640
time

01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:57.679
i say

01:17:57.679 --> 01:17:59.760
don't show me at a year more than likely

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:01.199
your jokes aren't going to be very good

01:18:01.199 --> 01:18:02.400
and in five years you won't even be

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.760
doing these jokes yeah

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:05.120
he'll go to open mics and have those

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:06.239
conversations with other kids about how

01:18:06.239 --> 01:18:07.760
to make them better it's not going to be

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:10.000
from some older comic breaking down why

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.199
his jokes suck it wasn't a writing

01:18:11.199 --> 01:18:12.480
workshop it wasn't like me and you were

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:13.920
working on a [ __ ] bit and going back

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.520
and forth he was literally just being

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:16.880
sort of a [ __ ] bully to a guy who

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:18.560
looked up to him a lot i'm telling you

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.800
right now it wasn't the right one

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:22.800
it sounds brother i got better no no at

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:24.320
the end of the day i look back at it in

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.640
sort of a positive way because i stopped

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:27.840
doing horseshit and i probably would

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.120
have kept going down the path of doing

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:30.480
horseshit for way longer than i needed

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:32.719
to do um so it was a good thing but i'm

01:18:32.719 --> 01:18:34.000
saying he could have also just said that

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.520
without actually [ __ ]

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:37.760
breaking down every joke and [ __ ]

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.360
just making me super self-conscious

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.480
about everything that i was doing it

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:41.760
just wasn't he didn't handle it the

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:42.800
right way especially if it's somebody

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.080
who's a friend i i that's just the way

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.199
that i feel

01:18:45.199 --> 01:18:46.000
um

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.400
all of we all i mean

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.239
uh uh dude

01:18:50.239 --> 01:18:51.600
look

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.360
the you're as you're telling the story

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:54.960
you're saying it's a good you understand

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:58.480
it was like a good thing dude that that

01:18:58.480 --> 01:18:59.679
you know what like the pain i was just

01:18:59.679 --> 01:19:01.040
watching it like i got always got to

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:02.480
record myself and i always don't want to

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:03.760
look at it

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.679
because it's [ __ ] painful dude

01:19:05.679 --> 01:19:07.360
there's nothing like jake would say to

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:08.800
me or anyone could say to me that would

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:10.080
be as painful as what i would think

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.679
looking at my own [ __ ] right the reason

01:19:11.679 --> 01:19:13.199
i'm saying think you suck all the time

01:19:13.199 --> 01:19:15.520
is to keep your [ __ ] eye critical you

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:16.880
know when these people get in comedy

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:18.239
debates about

01:19:18.239 --> 01:19:20.320
like jim norton what's her name uh

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.239
[ __ ] lindy west yeah she's like you

01:19:22.239 --> 01:19:23.679
can't have it both ways you can't say

01:19:23.679 --> 01:19:25.679
comedy is this important transformative

01:19:25.679 --> 01:19:27.760
thing and say hey i'm just a comic well

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:29.520
she's missing the point okay

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:31.920
she can then the non-comic can say it's

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:33.840
this big important thing me the guy

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:36.640
making it i never can say that or it's

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:38.640
broken it's broken

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.800
all i'm doing i'm a [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.719
making i'm a birthday clown shut the

01:19:42.719 --> 01:19:43.920
[ __ ] up that's

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:46.239
if you want to be able to do it

01:19:46.239 --> 01:19:48.640
to the way that you aspire that's how

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:50.719
you got to feel about that okay now the

01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:52.400
the funny thing is in the business end

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.159
of it it's exactly opposite that's how

01:19:54.159 --> 01:19:56.239
kev took off so fast like he had this

01:19:56.239 --> 01:19:58.080
[ __ ] charisma and like it's not

01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:59.840
humility but he just was like you

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:01.600
couldn't get him you couldn't hurt his

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.840
feelings i agree with you it's so fun

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.600
because i fight i'm fighting an internal

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.840
thing in my head because i agree

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:08.960
i was also that was like sort of my

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:10.239
foundation the way that i looked at it

01:20:10.239 --> 01:20:11.600
like yes

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.520
however i just feel like i don't know i

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:14.560
think andrew schultz is a really good

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.480
comic i think he's a [ __ ] hustler

01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:17.600
he's a killer he kills on stage i think

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:19.199
he's got good jokes

01:20:19.199 --> 01:20:20.480
he just doesn't have the attitude like

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.960
he sucks and i think that there are

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:24.800
thankfully look up to andrew no but i

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:25.679
think a lot of people do and i think

01:20:25.679 --> 01:20:26.480
he's really successful he's a

01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:27.600
multi-millionaire i think that we can

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:28.560
all take a little bit of what andrew

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.080
schultz does and say hey you know what

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.159
hold on there's something there metzger

01:20:32.159 --> 01:20:34.000
you're genius break his heart tomorrow

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.159
you're a genius metzger i'm i'm still

01:20:36.159 --> 01:20:37.360
thinking i love andrew schultz by the

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.880
way he's a great dude

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:41.120
you're genius but i'm saying like maybe

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:42.880
just for a second step back and realize

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:43.760
maybe you don't have all the answers

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:44.960
either because you've had some issues in

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:47.280
the past too you're you know i mean you

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:49.520
you are the answers to these issues i

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:51.199
you in my opinion i've said all the

01:20:51.199 --> 01:20:52.639
issues the ones we're talking about i

01:20:52.639 --> 01:20:55.040
got [ __ ] for saying this i put metzger

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:56.400
my top five favorite comedians of all

01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.480
time right people were like dude

01:20:58.480 --> 01:20:59.760
i didn't put your palm unless i [ __ ]

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:01.120
up i [ __ ] up because i had to put you

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:02.880
poundless and i you got bumped to six

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.159
after i threw she fell in there i forgot

01:21:04.159 --> 01:21:05.840
about it it's for nothing i was just

01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:07.040
talking about it or whatever right and i

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.159
was just very complimentary of your

01:21:08.159 --> 01:21:10.159
comedy i think of you as a genius okay i

01:21:10.159 --> 01:21:11.840
really do and i've said it for a long

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:13.360
time even we were arguing was like in

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.960
that big argument you know oh you guys

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:16.719
beefed on youtube i don't know we had a

01:21:16.719 --> 01:21:18.800
[ __ ] huge almost [ __ ] fight on

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:19.280
youtube

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:20.880
[Laughter]

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:21.840
so

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:24.159
but i'm saying like you should be a

01:21:24.159 --> 01:21:25.920
multi-millionaire you should be one of

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:28.239
the most successful people i know so and

01:21:28.239 --> 01:21:30.800
you're not and you are more talented

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.000
than every comic that i know for the

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.360
most part you know for most of them at

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:36.239
least debatably in the top top tier so

01:21:36.239 --> 01:21:37.760
maybe you should say and then you should

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:38.800
look at me and go like all right well

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.239
lewis is not as talented as a comic and

01:21:40.239 --> 01:21:42.000
louis is doing pretty well and his

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.600
career is going pretty funny just said

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:45.040
that for an hour

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:46.080
so i'm saying maybe you shouldn't just

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:47.360
completely dismiss everything i'm saying

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:48.480
and saying the truth probably lies

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:49.760
somewhere in the middle of all of this

01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:50.639
louis

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:52.480
you're confusing dismissing the things

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:53.360
that are wrong you're saying with

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:54.880
dismissing you in any way which i'm not

01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:56.239
this is because i believe in you that i

01:21:56.239 --> 01:21:58.320
want you to exercise this cancer that

01:21:58.320 --> 01:21:59.280
you have

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:01.920
you you got a lot i mean dude

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.440
you have so much to lose now because you

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:04.880
made such a great thing i was so

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:06.320
impressed with it

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:07.440
um

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:08.800
especially progress in the comic from

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.040
when i saw you to now

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:12.320
you probably should thank big j because

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:14.000
it definitely helped

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
that that that feeling you should take

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:16.960
and you should take it for somebody who

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:18.880
you look up to yeah that's the best

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.719
thing that's your [ __ ] medicine and

01:22:20.719 --> 01:22:22.719
honestly just take it you can't be a

01:22:22.719 --> 01:22:24.400

things that you're getting mad about

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:29.600
have helped you

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:30.960
just let them it's like just getting out

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.880
of your own way it's such a simple

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:34.960
you good sales dude get out of the way

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:37.280

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.080
amazing because you got just like

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:44.320

i i'm uh

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:47.600
it's a fire sign oh yeah you're fire

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.360
baby but i don't even know what we're

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:51.440
disagreeing about like i don't all it is

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:52.960
is that like

01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:54.480
i hope it's not that i'm still gonna

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:56.000
flip out i feel like we're no i feel

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.520
like we're sort of setting it up like an

01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:58.800
argument when we're all just sort of

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.560
having a discussion about you know what

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:04.480
topic we you are argumentative

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.960
you guys are trying

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.600
hallucination this is the

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.600
this whole situation the hotel you could

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:15.520
have just had a fantastic day you were

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:18.639
the genesis of a total tailspin sega

01:23:18.639 --> 01:23:20.080
literally it was you could have been

01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:22.159
like all right like what's what was at

01:23:22.159 --> 01:23:23.920
stake in terms of waiting sonic part

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.120
three right now because what's happening

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:26.400
right now

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:28.239
what was what was at stake of that whole

01:23:28.239 --> 01:23:29.920
situation early in this morning you woke

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:32.159
up you were grumpy you were like i don't

01:23:32.159 --> 01:23:33.920
want to wait that long for soup

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:35.760
therefore i was running late but it's

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.199
actually i've said this a million times

01:23:37.199 --> 01:23:38.560
one of my triggers like is if i'm

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.639
running late i get this anxiety

01:23:40.639 --> 01:23:41.920
and then

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:42.880
that's why i get into so many arguments

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.239
with cab drivers because if i'm taking a

01:23:44.239 --> 01:23:45.280
cab it's usually because i'm running

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:47.040
late and it's just they're there they're

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.480
the person [ __ ]

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:50.000
dude i made a million things because of

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.159
time timeline that's that's it timeline

01:23:52.159 --> 01:23:53.840

the the whole [ __ ] uh but everyone so

01:25:07.199 --> 01:25:08.880
to take that thought right

everybody is a little bit different

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.040
though right so the the one guy

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.000
matt might be the type of guy that if

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.080
he's running late like that

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.520
he might just completely get in his head

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:19.280
and bomb because he's like not he'd have

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.639

there's there's truth to that's your

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:29.360
truth you know what i'm saying but for

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:30.560
me like it's all about like kind of what

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.239

01:25:32.239 --> 01:25:34.159

somebody who like who's the guy who's

01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:38.800
like really really notoriously rich

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.400

hollywood fixer like

01:25:55.679 --> 01:25:58.880
i i that's the story so i can't imagine

01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:01.040
even going down the path of doing comedy

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.880
and finding the inspiration to like talk

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:04.639
about things and to because you're just

01:26:04.639 --> 01:26:05.760
like you don't really have that same

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.280
type like i couldn't even

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:08.880
wait what i couldn't imagine why you

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:10.320
would go down the path of being a comic

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:11.520
and where you would find the funny from

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:12.480
if you were born with that much

01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:13.440
privilege you know what i'm saying like

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:14.960
i just couldn't because it's not about

01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:16.400
because but i'm saying the wrong things

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:19.199
with it but listen i'm i'm agree but i

01:26:19.199 --> 01:26:20.800

mind around i also can't write jokes

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:23.840

01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:25.600
narcissist some people can write you

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:28.080
these observational things that are

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:29.760
hilarious like i can't i can't find

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.280
myself caring about something that's not

01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:32.800
very personally you know i don't think

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:34.400
you are a narcissist because narcissist

01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:35.679

little oh yeah maybe you're right maybe

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.239
i'm just using the word yeah i've

01:26:42.239 --> 01:26:44.000
noticed this isn't true you have like i

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.440
don't know what the psychological but

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:47.840
you have a chip on your shoulder and

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:49.199
look you talking about whoever's a

01:26:49.199 --> 01:26:50.960
genius to you and all like that's all

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:52.880
fine too but we should understand is

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:55.120
being called a genius and being called

01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:57.199
louis j gomez is the same thing it means

01:26:57.199 --> 01:27:00.080
nothing the [ __ ] means nothing you

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:01.360

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:02.800
gonna set even if you're like dude

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:04.639
you're the best if i don't feel it it

01:27:04.639 --> 01:27:06.239
affects nothing it's always a thing with

01:27:06.239 --> 01:27:08.480
yourself so you can't even with a

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.080
business that that's good to have that

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:11.520
mentality kind of that's how capitalism

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:13.360
works i guess but i mean this is your

01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:14.800

comedy much like your other things that

01:28:11.199 --> 01:28:13.600
you do in life comedy is a dirty urge

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:16.159
that you have to do so it's not love or

01:28:16.159 --> 01:28:18.560

like you got it it's this is just for

01:28:38.239 --> 01:28:39.760
you it's an internal thing it's almost

01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:41.280
like when people go how come muslims got

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:44.480

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:49.760
for you because you're a piece of [ __ ]

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:51.120
and it's the thing to keep yourself in

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:52.080
line

01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:53.840

after talking to nate about it and i

01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:04.560
think i'm right about this i was going

01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:06.239
to figure out how to make those jokes

01:30:06.239 --> 01:30:08.239
better or whatever it was all it did was

01:30:08.239 --> 01:30:10.960
it made me start bombing and not being

01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:12.880
very good and not having any confidence

01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:14.719
versus why you're better now do you have

01:30:14.719 --> 01:30:16.960
to bomb of course but i was going to

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:18.080
bomb i was going to eat all the [ __ ] in

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:18.880
the world that was i was going to

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:20.880
execute when i started i had i remember

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:22.000
i was gonna have somebody else tell me

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.679
my joke sucked eventually it just didn't

01:30:23.679 --> 01:30:24.880
need to be from the guy that i looked up

01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:26.400
to most on a the first night of a

01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:27.520
weekend that i'm excited to go do with

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:29.199
him it was [ __ ] crazy it's not the

01:30:29.199 --> 01:30:30.880
way you should treat your friends

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:32.480
i mean you're like this is no way to

01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:34.960
treat your son i mean your friends

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:36.719
this is this is becoming a parent what's

01:30:36.719 --> 01:30:37.440
happening i think you're gonna get a

01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:39.120
smoking charge

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:40.159
no

01:30:40.159 --> 01:30:42.320
can they oh from the hotel no he assured

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:44.159
me because i was gonna make them um sign

01:30:44.159 --> 01:30:45.600
a thing after they brought me the room i

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:46.560
was like i need something signed right

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:47.360
now saying that i'm not going to get a

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:49.040
smoking charge and then it was like he

01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:50.239
was like sir

01:30:50.239 --> 01:30:51.600
we just want you to go

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:53.440
i want to convert city mac to country

01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:55.600
mac

01:30:55.679 --> 01:30:58.560
country bank was like smoother

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.719
you'd be in city mac right now

01:31:00.719 --> 01:31:03.440
but um dude i [ __ ] i remember when i

01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:05.760
started i remember so vividly too i'm

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.040
miserable because

01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:08.800
i went in pretty confident just because

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:09.840
you know it would be the first time they

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.280
go on i guess it goes well a lot of

01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:12.239
times

01:31:12.239 --> 01:31:14.320
and then i bombed and i was like do i

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:15.760
even understand i was like i don't even

01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:17.440
understand it's like i always thought i

01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:18.560
was funny

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:20.880
and now i'm like did i why would i ever

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:22.960
think i was funny like the amount of so

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:25.040
i'd just be sad and i'd be overthinking

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:26.560
every little thing that i would do or

01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:27.520
say

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:28.480
and

01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:29.920
and all the thing that gets out of it is

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:31.520
just [ __ ] like oh that's right i'm

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:33.679
not [ __ ] so it's fine who cares

01:31:33.679 --> 01:31:35.040
like you don't worry about knocking me

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:36.960
down a peg i came in lower you you

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:38.800
understand it's just a

01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:40.080
a guy who's just in mma should

01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:42.480
understand this principle that's good i

01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:44.639
i just there's it's weird because i

01:31:44.639 --> 01:31:46.800
think that

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:47.600
that

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:49.600
thing is yes it makes you as funny as

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:50.719
you are

01:31:50.719 --> 01:31:51.600
however

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:53.679
being funny is

01:31:53.679 --> 01:31:54.880
honestly

01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:56.880
a smaller part of this business than it

01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:58.400
should be everything right

01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:01.120
but it's really not right being funny it

01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:02.239
means

01:32:02.239 --> 01:32:03.760
something if you're funny and you have a

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:05.600
little bit of if you decent work ethic

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:06.880
you can make a career doing comedy i

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:08.080
think it's a pretty fair business it's

01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:09.280
really really good at it though dude

01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.960
you're like you you your [ __ ] that's

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:13.040
good no i i know what i'm saying like

01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:14.480
being pulled down by this little

01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:15.760
nonsense that's not what i'm saying i'm

01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:18.080
saying for you specifically though

01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:20.320
you are you know forget you don't need

01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:21.840
to be called genius or whatever but you

01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:23.440
know i think that yeah you should step

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:24.960
outside of yourself though and not have

01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:26.480
that attitude about yourself

01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:28.239
because i think that well no you

01:32:28.239 --> 01:32:31.120
wouldn't but it is a business

01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:32.239
i know it's a bit it's more of a

01:32:32.239 --> 01:32:33.520
business than it is an art what are we

01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:34.800
talking about

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:36.880
i'm completely lost the uh comedy it

01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:37.760
sounds like you're trying to turn this

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:40.880
whole thing over with

01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:48.159
[Laughter]

01:32:48.159 --> 01:32:49.679
if you weren't worth it nobody would

01:32:49.679 --> 01:32:51.520
tell you like if you weren't see like if

01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:52.719
you weren't worth it jay wouldn't tell

01:32:52.719 --> 01:32:54.719
your jokes no i know the the reason you

01:32:54.719 --> 01:32:56.400
don't tell a new comic the thing if they

01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:57.440
ask you

01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:00.000
is because they're not worth it

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.280
in fact that's the thing i would do now

01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:02.400
because i'm like i don't know this guy

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:04.320
if he's [ __ ] worth it if if i have

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:05.600
any genuine feeling for somebody and

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:07.520
they ask me i'll [ __ ] tell him all

01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:09.360
the comics i've ever respected if i was

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.920
like you remember vic henley he's i said

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.679
get [ __ ] up with him at uh the uh

01:33:13.679 --> 01:33:15.280
comic strip but i remember we did some

01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:16.719
cruise and i was asking him like it was

01:33:16.719 --> 01:33:18.080
that good he's like you don't want me to

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:19.600
judge a set

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:20.400
and then

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:22.880
i was like oh and then like two years

01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:24.480
later he came up to me to tell me hey

01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:26.320
that was really funny people come up to

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:28.159
you don't don't worry about it and if

01:33:28.159 --> 01:33:30.400
they never do then [ __ ] don't worry

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:32.480
about either but they will if you just

01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:33.679
are never

01:33:33.679 --> 01:33:34.560
dude

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:35.679
i mean like i don't know how you do it

01:33:35.679 --> 01:33:37.440
with chicks so well but it's the same

01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:39.840
energy of like the [ __ ] comes to you the

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:41.280
[ __ ] will come to you

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:42.480
oh i mean

01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:43.600
my philosophy

01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:45.360
if you listen if you could just like

01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:47.199
drop that nonsense thing

01:33:47.199 --> 01:33:48.880
your advantage over me is you are a

01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:50.960
[ __ ] businessman so you could be both

01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:52.400
things you could be a artist it's very

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:54.880
hard to be both it's very hard yeah i

01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:56.400
mean it's very hard to be as funny as

01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:59.120
you are yeah and and do that like i it's

01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:02.080
that's very rare i know i'm doing it i'm

01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:04.800
doing extremely well what are we talking

01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:06.239
about here

01:34:06.239 --> 01:34:07.760
we're co-headlining this weekend what

01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:09.280
are we talking about right now i'm

01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:11.199
[ __ ] listening we're talking about

01:34:13.199 --> 01:34:14.480
shouldn't spaz but i don't you were

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:15.760
saying that could be bad for you long

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:18.960
time i think my personality traits

01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:20.800
i'm totally [ __ ] again

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:23.120
i'm totally fine

01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:24.400
like something like that that's like a

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:26.159
good example because i we just did the

01:34:26.159 --> 01:34:27.840

featuring rules there's no like don't

01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:41.360

01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:48.480
that don't no i'm not but i you know

01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:50.080
we're having a conversation specifically

01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:51.760
about all the problems with my career

01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:52.880
and what i'm doing wrong and about how

01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:54.320
it's going to destroy myself

01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:56.159
and i need to just stop for a second ago

01:34:56.159 --> 01:34:58.080
i'm [ __ ] doing really well guy i'm

01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:00.080
doing better than any other comic at my

01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:01.840
talent level any other comic at my

01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:03.040
talent level i'm doing way better than

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:05.040
that i kind of think i can't really

01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:07.760
speak very well i'm not very smart and

01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:09.280
i'm doing really well so you agree with

01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:10.480
that by the way i'm also doing better

01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:11.760
than i think people even have any

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:13.360
[ __ ] clue so but my bro i don't want

01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:14.880
to get into a two-hour podcast about how

01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:15.920
i need to change everything where i'm

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:17.280
like no no no

01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:18.400
no

01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:19.760
i need to stop yelling at people in

01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:21.760
public i agree with that as but i don't

01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:23.440
think it has much to do with my career

01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:24.719
much to do with my comedy much to do

01:35:24.719 --> 01:35:26.000
with how funny i am much to do with my

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.600
business i think that that is a

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:28.880
personality trait that sucks and i

01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:30.400
shouldn't want i shouldn't want other

01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:31.840
kids to see me yelling at people in

01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:33.440
public sure but i think that all of the

01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:35.679
entire everything that makes me me

01:35:35.679 --> 01:35:37.520
is sort of why i'm where i'm at the good

01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:38.719
and the bad there's good ingredients and

01:35:38.719 --> 01:35:42.239
bad ingredients and it's my job to fix

01:35:42.239 --> 01:35:44.080
the bad things in everyone's life right

01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:45.760
it's not comedy if you're a [ __ ]

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.480
banker fix the bad things expand on the

01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:49.679
good things you know what i'm saying and

01:35:49.679 --> 01:35:51.119
you're supposed to just continuously and

01:35:51.119 --> 01:35:52.639
i've done that regularly throughout my

01:35:52.639 --> 01:35:54.960
life so i need to sometimes as you know

01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:56.080
getting my ass kicked in this podcast

01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.119
the whole time for being a [ __ ]

01:36:05.199 --> 01:36:06.480

01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:08.960
trying to say to you what angrily as if

01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:10.960
i'm a toys r us kid

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:12.400
stop and think about how well you're

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:13.280
doing

01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:15.440
please yes thank you please do that

01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:16.639
that's all that's literally what's

01:36:16.639 --> 01:36:18.480
trying to get across to you

01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:20.159
every time a thing comes up stop and

01:36:20.159 --> 01:36:21.360
think about how well you're doing and

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.920
how much you did and yeah i'm not

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:26.080
like that's great please think that but

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:27.119
can i

01:36:27.119 --> 01:36:28.239
i don't

01:36:28.239 --> 01:36:29.600
even go there because there's no

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:32.639
conscious part of me that's going like

01:36:32.639 --> 01:36:34.880
you know the anger in that moment has

01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:36.800
anything to do with sort of this career

01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:38.719
or comedy or the art side of it or the

01:36:38.719 --> 01:36:40.480
business out of it it is truly a

01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:43.440
psychological defect that i have that

01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:45.360
i mean it's it's dude i have the defect

01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:46.880
i mean if i worked at a bank i would

01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:49.040
jump over the [ __ ] thing and attack

01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:50.080
somebody eventually because it would

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:51.360
just get there there'd be a day where

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:53.840
it's like yeah so that's not right but

01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:54.880
i'm just saying like there's this

01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:57.679
correlation to like comedy and and and

01:36:57.679 --> 01:36:59.040
you know both the artist and the

01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.719
business side that i just feel like i

01:37:00.719 --> 01:37:01.840
don't necessarily see the correlation

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:03.119
maybe that's what the point that i'm

01:37:03.119 --> 01:37:04.480
making is like i

01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:06.159
maybe since that's what i'm arguing i

01:37:06.159 --> 01:37:08.960
just feel like you know

01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:10.480
i agree that i shouldn't do those things

01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:11.199
but

01:37:11.199 --> 01:37:12.000
dude

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.199
you don't have to change everything this

01:37:13.199 --> 01:37:14.560
is not this complicated dude it's

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:15.520
actually just simple you don't have to

01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:17.440
change everything like the

01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:19.199
you're mostly good

01:37:19.199 --> 01:37:20.800
you like

01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:22.800
there's one small thing and and i don't

01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:24.639
know what the proper term is but it's

01:37:24.639 --> 01:37:26.560
like a chip on your shoulder and it

01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:28.080
comes from something not

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:30.000
some childhood thing yeah i know where

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.840
my childhood [ __ ] comes from

01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:34.080
and and it's it's driving you and it's

01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:35.920
negating like everything that you were

01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:37.840
building you're like

01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:38.960
it's like

01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:41.040
look think about all that [ __ ] don't

01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:44.159
throw it away on a thing for what stakes

01:37:44.159 --> 01:37:45.840
you know what i mean like here's here's

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:47.280
what we learned is at stake all the [ __ ]

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:48.719
you've built mm-hmm

01:37:48.719 --> 01:37:49.920
right now

01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:52.080
yeah so act like a guy with something to

01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:53.040
lose

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:55.360
before any you know you're right there's

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:56.639
a lot of nothing to lose talking you

01:37:56.639 --> 01:37:58.159
could like hey nobody's ever given me a

01:37:58.159 --> 01:37:59.199
[ __ ] in this business no i haven't i

01:37:59.199 --> 01:38:00.719
have a live lot to lose but i will get

01:38:00.719 --> 01:38:01.679
you a

01:38:01.679 --> 01:38:03.199
but but now

01:38:03.199 --> 01:38:04.639
as a result of that getting you an

01:38:04.639 --> 01:38:06.960
audience now you have something to lose

01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:08.639
i'm just saying she's not the same it's

01:38:08.639 --> 01:38:10.159
just not the same thing as owen because

01:38:10.159 --> 01:38:11.360
i you know

01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:13.040
no no no it's not the same i just don't

01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:14.560
it's just not the same thing it's gonna

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:16.000
be it's not that i'm talking i think

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.440
what you're talking about though it's

01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:18.400
literally

01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:20.480
the reason my fans love me is because

01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:22.480
i'm willing to come to a podcast and

01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:23.920
just have that honest conversation put

01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:25.679
it out there good fans by the way

01:38:25.679 --> 01:38:27.040
they're the best friends in the [ __ ]

01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:29.760
world here's the thing on the road

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:30.880
because we've hung out with fans the

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:33.119
fans were [ __ ] cool they're not like

01:38:33.119 --> 01:38:35.520
they're not animals at all sure

01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:36.480
so

01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:38.080
that's even more where that's like that

01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:39.600
should be calming your spirit is

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:41.280
understanding that you're bonding with

01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:42.960
people on a thing that's a good thing

01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:44.480
essentially that's like what you're

01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:45.920
saying the thing is saving grace to this

01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:47.119
[ __ ] that could have got in all kinds of

01:38:47.119 --> 01:38:48.880
trouble is that

01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:50.639
right exactly i mean i look i turn those

01:38:50.639 --> 01:38:52.159
negatives into something that like you

01:38:52.159 --> 01:38:54.639
know i think here's the thing i think

01:38:54.639 --> 01:38:56.000
if i did have the attitude like yeah

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.280
well [ __ ] you it is what it is that you

01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:58.639
know that's what a sorry [ __ ] hilton

01:38:58.639 --> 01:38:59.920
suck my dick

01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:02.000
i think even when i'm sort of leaning

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.080
into like i've got where i'm like

01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:05.600
you know i i've had other stories where

01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:07.040
i have customer service issues that have

01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:08.159
a build-a-bear story that's out there

01:39:08.159 --> 01:39:09.440
for legion of skanks and there's

01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:13.159
7-eleven there's

01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:21.679
[Laughter]

01:39:21.679 --> 01:39:24.080
you have like bedrock psychological

01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:25.280
processes that are happening almost

01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:26.800
subconsciously where like some lady's

01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:28.080
like hey that's going to be 15 minutes

01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:29.520
and you're like you're interpreting that

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:31.840
as like i'm being disrespected and that

01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:33.679
you know unleashes a torrent of anger

01:39:33.679 --> 01:39:36.320
that spreads across every single like if

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:37.920
you think of all your relationships

01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:39.280
that's there's like a limiter on your

01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:40.800
relationships due to like you perceiving

01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:42.400
things and it's not like due to the way

01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:45.360
you grew up i'm a stress huff [ __ ]

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:47.199
pill every girl that's ever dated me

01:39:47.199 --> 01:39:50.239
everybody's ever been friends with me

01:39:50.239 --> 01:39:51.679
i'm saying no don't say that you're just

01:39:51.679 --> 01:39:53.119
like i'm like scraping up the cement a

01:39:53.119 --> 01:39:54.480
little bit you're resuming it like i'm a

01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:55.600
tough pill

01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:58.880
no stop that no

01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:02.400
this is not you yeah god damn it no

01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:03.760
it's not your thing of you being a bad

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:05.280
person and that's what's making it hard

01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:06.560
for you is to think of it like that it's

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:07.679
not like no it's because i think i have

01:40:07.679 --> 01:40:09.520
a good moral compass and i think i think

01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:10.880
you know i think i'm a good friend and a

01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:13.280
good father

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:15.360
dude think of it this way morality it's

01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.040
always dude it's never it never comes

01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:18.800
from a bank unless the guy really didn't

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:20.560
get my taco think of it this way think

01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:22.320
of it this way when you're when you're a

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:24.080
little kid when you're a little kid and

01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:26.400
things are super stressful all the time

01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:27.280
so you have like you know your

01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:28.719
prefrontal cortex this is the front of

01:40:28.719 --> 01:40:30.080
your brain this is where you can like

01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:32.159
when you want to get mad you go no don't

01:40:32.159 --> 01:40:33.520
get mad this is the part of your brain

01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:35.199
so your executive conscious

01:40:35.199 --> 01:40:37.520
yes the amygdala is back here that's the

01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:39.360
danger and fear center so when you're

01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:40.800
little and you're always seeing stuff

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:42.080
that's like making you scared as a

01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:44.400
little kid your amygdala grows so when

01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:45.600
you're and you have all these memories

01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:46.800
trapped that haven't been processed so i

01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:49.119
have a huge amygdala yes your big deal i

01:40:49.119 --> 01:40:50.400
would guarantee if you did like a

01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:52.080
neurological scan it would be large it

01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:53.199
would be enlarged

01:40:53.199 --> 01:40:54.400
shane's

01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:57.840
amygdala is putting on weight right now

01:40:58.719 --> 01:41:00.080
so it's like when that happens you're

01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:01.760
perceiving things in this like flight or

01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:03.520
fight like danger danger thing all the

01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:05.280
time and then it turns to situations

01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:06.239
like i'll sit back and like what the

01:41:06.239 --> 01:41:07.760
[ __ ] is your brother

01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:10.719

01:41:10.719 --> 01:41:12.320
mean you've been to therapy set but as i

01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:13.920
understand most men don't do anything

01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:15.840
about that [ __ ] until they're late 30s

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:18.239
early yeah yeah i'm trying i'm trying i

01:41:18.239 --> 01:41:19.920
i'm definitely trying ask your therapist

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:21.600
about trauma theory they'll explain that

01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:22.719
whole thing to you and you can work with

01:41:22.719 --> 01:41:24.320

just talking so if you're working with

01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:42.400
someone who doesn't understand like the

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:43.920
neuroscience of like early childhood

01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:45.119
development they're not doing you any

01:41:45.119 --> 01:41:47.119

i'm just being brought back to that

01:41:54.719 --> 01:41:56.000
hotel room with big j right now i'm just

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.360
feeling very like attacked by my friends

01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:58.400
is that how you woke up i think that's

01:41:58.400 --> 01:41:59.520
how you woke up this morning i was

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:01.040
thinking about big j would you have a

01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:02.080
dream what did you dream about you

01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:03.040
dressed about just that conversation

01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:05.199
with jay damn dude anybody that would

01:42:05.199 --> 01:42:06.719
talk to you about it it cares about you

01:42:06.719 --> 01:42:08.239
like you should never feel that the

01:42:08.239 --> 01:42:09.920
attack is like

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:11.360
somehow you got something registered as

01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:13.119
attack that's not attack

01:42:13.119 --> 01:42:15.360
with uh the hotel like the thing if jay

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:16.639
going like this or whatever like that

01:42:16.639 --> 01:42:19.040
should be comforting and not an attack

01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:20.560
so that for some reason

01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:22.000
it just brought me back to that moment i

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.679
became very self-conscious and i did

01:42:23.679 --> 01:42:25.520
stink there was truth to it it wasn't

01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:26.960
like i was like i was this great comedy

01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:28.239
because he was like oh you stink yeah

01:42:28.239 --> 01:42:30.480
okay keith great yeah sure well that was

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:32.159
it it was it was thing but why do you

01:42:32.159 --> 01:42:33.760
think that keith why do you make a

01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:35.520
difference between because i think that

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:37.280
i wouldn't tell somebody who stunk the

01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:38.960
that genuinely stunk i wouldn't do that

01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:40.080
because to be honest with you it's

01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:42.480
[ __ ] i wouldn't do it somebody that i

01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:44.639
liked dude this is how you i mean no i

01:42:44.639 --> 01:42:46.560
but i wouldn't dude it's not my

01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:47.920
everyone sticks let me say this are you

01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:49.600
not doing it hold on let me if somebody

01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:52.239
does it i think everybody [ __ ] sucks

01:42:52.239 --> 01:42:54.320
at comedy there's very few people's acts

01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:55.920
that i look at and i go wow dude they're

01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:58.880
[ __ ] really good so who am i so no i

01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:01.040
don't think that like a young buck if i

01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:03.280
if some you know if i like them and oh

01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:04.320
my god that guy kind of thinks we all

01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:05.760
know them that's great it's not like you

01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:07.520
you know you know right now people in la

01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:09.840
and new york i'm saying that different

01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:11.280
yeah that stink that you're like i'm not

01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:12.800
going to [ __ ] tell this thing you

01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:14.080
know even though you're with your friend

01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:15.119
and that's the right thing to do and

01:43:15.119 --> 01:43:16.639
they should know they stink dude the

01:43:16.639 --> 01:43:19.199
right thing like it's jace

01:43:19.199 --> 01:43:21.280
feeling you're worth it to tell you

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:22.239
that's

01:43:22.239 --> 01:43:22.880
we

01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:23.760
we don't have to go back to this

01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:25.840
argument i'm saying i agree that jay he

01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:27.760
could have said something i think what

01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:29.920
he should have said was what i said sure

01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:31.520
wait and i don't keep going in a circle

01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:32.800
but he should have just said if he did

01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:34.560
that would mean he didn't think you had

01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:35.760
any chance

01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:37.760
that's not true if you would if you

01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:39.040
would have just said the [ __ ] truth

01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:40.239
which is like yeah dude all your jokes

01:43:40.239 --> 01:43:41.280
stink don't worry about it i'm not going

01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:42.159
to break them down because you have to

01:43:42.159 --> 01:43:43.679
figure out how to make them good me

01:43:43.679 --> 01:43:44.880
telling you that they stink aren't going

01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:46.400
to make them good tomorrow it's just

01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:47.760
going to make you stink more with those

01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:49.600
same jokes that's what happened i bet

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:51.920
you clearly at some point clearly

01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:54.239
competitive with him in some way

01:43:54.239 --> 01:43:55.280
before

01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:56.560
that whole thing happened like there was

01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:58.159
some kind of like no jay if you beat jay

01:43:58.159 --> 01:43:59.360
at anything he will not be your friend

01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:01.280
the only reason me and aj are friends to

01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:03.199
this day the only reason we are friends

01:44:03.199 --> 01:44:04.719
is because the first time we hung out he

01:44:04.719 --> 01:44:05.760
brought me to his apartment we played

01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:07.440
guitar hero and he was just a little bit

01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:09.280
better he kept on beating me and i was

01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:10.719
good yeah he was a little bit better if

01:44:10.719 --> 01:44:12.560
i had beat jane guitar here that day he

01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:13.920
would have taken it back no legion of

01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:16.480
skanks no gas digital no [ __ ] that is

01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:17.760
extremely true

01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:19.920
nothing was happening dude we were not

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.199
coming down this path

01:44:21.199 --> 01:44:22.800
you earlier was like [ __ ] this guy i

01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:24.960
used to play ufc with jay or you get the

01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:26.560
new one and then like he wouldn't tell

01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:28.159
me he wouldn't let me see the directions

01:44:28.159 --> 01:44:29.920
or tell me the the buttons and she just

01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:30.719
kicked

01:44:30.719 --> 01:44:31.600
that game

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:33.360
complicated [ __ ] up the game's hard we

01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:34.800
knock out kings he took back to the

01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:36.400
store he got that because he's gonna

01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:37.920
have played that one

01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:39.600
but if he loses he'll take it if he's

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:40.880
not good at it he won't try to get

01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:43.520
better i play nba uh like 2k whatever

01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:45.360
the year was and i'm bad but i would

01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:46.480
just use the all-star team and he'd

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:48.639
always use the sixers and it was like

01:44:48.639 --> 01:44:49.600
they were like the worst team in the

01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:51.040
game and i was like the all-star team it

01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:53.760
was just one game literally one game

01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:55.520
where i started beating him just one

01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:57.600
time ever he would [ __ ] dominate

01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:59.440
every time sure one game and like

01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:01.040
literally half half time he just stopped

01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:03.440
shooting he's like he gave up oh he gave

01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:05.760
up on you i got to like i

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:07.760
left the house in a rage that's a good

01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.280
example of that video games anyway jay

01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:10.159
because

01:45:10.159 --> 01:45:11.840
that's a good place to keep that kind of

01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:13.760
feel that it's like a funny place for

01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:15.920
him to be like that in comedy he can't

01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:17.280
be like that

01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:19.760
like those kind of competitive feelings

01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:21.520
yeah those are sports competitive

01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:23.760
feelings they're not art competitive art

01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:25.440
competitive is a different

01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:27.600
it's a different thing like it's not

01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:30.159
about humiliating defeats and like roast

01:45:30.159 --> 01:45:32.480
battle i ca i honestly i mean i judge

01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:33.679
them or whatever they are what they are

01:45:33.679 --> 01:45:35.600
now but the whole idea of a roast battle

01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:36.960
is [ __ ] ridiculous that's not what a

01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:38.000
roast is

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.719
it's not and then stew i'm the better

01:45:40.719 --> 01:45:42.560
like you've proven anything by winning

01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:44.080
or losing a rose battle that's not

01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:45.600
what's possible not to feel that way

01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:47.760
doing it let me let me just sidestep

01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:49.600
that because i agree with you that like

01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:51.679
no i think competition for the sake of

01:45:51.679 --> 01:45:54.080
art sucks yes however it's not a real

01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:55.760
competition nobody looks at a rust belt

01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:57.119
nobody looks at the winners and losers

01:45:57.119 --> 01:45:58.960
it's even more like the video game but

01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:00.320
can i tell you why

01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:01.920
it's good and i think it's very good

01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:04.000
actually very very good yeah really good

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.520
for comedy because a lot of handicapped

01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:08.639
people a chance to shine so

01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:11.199
one of them has to win right

01:46:11.199 --> 01:46:13.040
there's always a winner

01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:15.280
no it number one it opens the window for

01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:16.800
us to say [ __ ] up [ __ ] it reminds us

01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:18.400
that people like hearing [ __ ] up jokes

01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:20.960
mean nasty dark dirty [ __ ] now it's um

01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:22.320
it's okay because it's one of the last

01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:24.480
spots where yeah we can say [ __ ] up

01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:26.239
[ __ ] you could say anything anything

01:46:26.239 --> 01:46:27.600
goes into this battle and i that in my

01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:29.119
opinion is really important for comedy

01:46:29.119 --> 01:46:30.080
it's important for stand up it's

01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:31.760
important for everyone to remind to be

01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:32.960
reminded that people laugh at that type

01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:34.719
of [ __ ] um because it's not happening if

01:46:34.719 --> 01:46:36.320
you're just going to tv people are being

01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:37.840
trained to not laugh at [ __ ] up [ __ ]

01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:40.960
now see this is what you're having a man

01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:42.880
yeah this should not be a man cave but

01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:43.920
and then the other side of it the other

01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:45.840
side of it though it's a great exercise

01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:47.360
that just every time i've written for a

01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:50.320
rose battle every time i it gets those

01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:51.679
juices flowing

01:46:51.679 --> 01:46:52.880
you know i'm talking about the thing i

01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:54.159
think it's more of a net positive than a

01:46:54.159 --> 01:46:56.000
negative that's what i'm saying

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:56.960
i'm just talking about that the

01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:59.040
competitor angle of like well the last

01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:01.040
comic standard that sucks there's no

01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:02.159
there's no upside blasting because

01:47:02.159 --> 01:47:04.159
there's a competition in general just

01:47:04.159 --> 01:47:05.679
being doing stand-up you're in

01:47:05.679 --> 01:47:07.199
competition you gotta just get people

01:47:07.199 --> 01:47:08.960
show up so

01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:10.159
just putting it in those sports well

01:47:10.159 --> 01:47:11.760
that competition [ __ ] is all from and

01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:12.800
you're right big j does have a little

01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:14.080
bit of that in him he does look at the

01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:15.679
successes of other people and sort of

01:47:15.679 --> 01:47:17.600
get something i'm shocked as once jay

01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:18.639
will say

01:47:18.639 --> 01:47:20.960
big j speaks the language of funnier

01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:22.159
better than anybody that i've ever met

01:47:22.159 --> 01:47:23.520
in my entire life what's that big jack

01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:24.880
should be another [ __ ] bazillionaire

01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:26.000
right but he's not and there's a but

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.280
he's getting the success that he's

01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:28.800
wanted for a long time but it was a slow

01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:30.639
[ __ ] burn considering how talented he

01:47:30.639 --> 01:47:31.920
is and how funny he is and how likable

01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:33.920
he is everyone likes jay right really

01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:35.360
really likeable dude but you're right i

01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:36.719
think that he was

01:47:36.719 --> 01:47:38.960
gauging his successes off of even a guy

01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:40.560
like i think with kevin hart i think jay

01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:41.920
watching kevin become a [ __ ]

01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:43.600
superstar

01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:45.040
[ __ ] with him a little bit and set him

01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:47.119
off on uh he's got that stupid rock and

01:47:47.119 --> 01:47:48.639
roll [ __ ] in his heart

01:47:48.639 --> 01:47:50.239
it was get over the rock star [ __ ] it's

01:47:50.239 --> 01:47:52.239
so stupid i mean it's like that shit's

01:47:52.239 --> 01:47:53.199
done

01:47:53.199 --> 01:47:54.960
but what that's like with kevin

01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:56.159
fireworks

01:47:56.159 --> 01:47:57.920
i just i'm like do you want to have

01:47:57.920 --> 01:47:59.360
fireworks in your

01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:01.600
show yeah i think the rocks

01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:03.040
you know jay's like he always thinks i

01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:04.239
don't think he's funny if somebody's

01:48:04.239 --> 01:48:05.360
telling you

01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:06.719
like she's one of the funniest people

01:48:06.719 --> 01:48:08.000
i've ever seen there's nobody that's

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.679
funnier and you put him in any medium

01:48:09.679 --> 01:48:10.880
and he's the funniest in every medium so

01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:12.800
if you were to put him in a car ride

01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:14.159
just talking he's gonna make you laugh

01:48:14.159 --> 01:48:15.440
script writing is just gonna make you

01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:17.119
[ __ ] laugh he's gonna he understands

01:48:17.119 --> 01:48:19.119
how to be funny very so chappelle

01:48:19.119 --> 01:48:20.560
talking about the language of funny jay

01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:23.040
is fluent with [ __ ] he's an off the

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:24.239
cuff by the way i don't know everybody

01:48:24.239 --> 01:48:26.320
is good nobody's as good off the cover

01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:27.679
but like

01:48:27.679 --> 01:48:29.360
as long as i know him like whatever his

01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:30.639
limiters were

01:48:30.639 --> 01:48:32.000
because everybody has a limiter they put

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:33.360
on themselves so his is always like well

01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:34.880
i'm not really right whatever dumb [ __ ]

01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:36.320
he would say which is stupid because if

01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:37.520
jay wants to write an hour of clean

01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:39.040
material he'd write the best album

01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:40.639
material he could do it he could just

01:48:40.639 --> 01:48:42.400
write it when i met shafir he used to be

01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:44.560
like i will never not do he would only

01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:47.280
do dirty sets that was sorry point of

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:50.159
pride yeah like what yeah it was barry's

01:48:50.159 --> 01:48:51.520
great comic by already became a great

01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:53.520
comic yeah and he dropped that stupid

01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:54.719
[ __ ] yeah

01:48:54.719 --> 01:48:56.800
[ __ ] look i don't know i don't even

01:48:56.800 --> 01:48:58.239
understand where we're at right now the

01:48:58.239 --> 01:48:59.679
thing you gotta drop is the stupid [ __ ]

01:48:59.679 --> 01:49:01.040
where you think it's from what

01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:02.000
what were you saying about what we're

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.760
saying about jay though no

01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:06.080
no we were on a point about jay look

01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:07.600
that's that everybody has that

01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:09.440
competitive thing and jay loves sports

01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:11.520
and all the [ __ ] that i don't care about

01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:12.880
um

01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:15.520
oh but no so jay the reason jay started

01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:18.560
getting real success was because i think

01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:20.719
he let go of that comparing himself to

01:49:20.719 --> 01:49:22.320
other people thing and that's what all

01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:24.800
that comes from is massive insecurity

01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:26.320
right so you start to compare yourself

01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:27.440
like what does this guy got what is that

01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:29.440
guy that that's all insecurity and we

01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:30.719
all have it you know usually we keep it

01:49:30.719 --> 01:49:31.840
on our head when it comes out of your

01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:33.119
mouth that means you have too much of it

01:49:33.119 --> 01:49:34.159
yeah because no matter what you want to

01:49:34.159 --> 01:49:35.679
[ __ ] say we all sit there and go like

01:49:35.679 --> 01:49:37.360
the [ __ ] guy's got this thing

01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:39.199
the second it escapes your mouth you've

01:49:39.199 --> 01:49:40.719
let control of it and it has control of

01:49:40.719 --> 01:49:42.000
you i think that's sort of the gauge

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.400
right there and you're 100 right about

01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:47.040
that that was for me once i stopped i

01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:48.480
just stopped playing the game where i

01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:50.400
mean i don't you know i don't try to do

01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:51.679
any of the things that the other people

01:49:51.679 --> 01:49:53.599
do i'm in my own world there's nobody

01:49:53.599 --> 01:49:55.440
really competing with me with what i do

01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:57.840
i don't i have no competition i mean

01:49:57.840 --> 01:49:59.360
it's completely all with myself and as

01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:00.320
soon as i started doing that i started

01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:02.719
seeing real success in both the artistic

01:50:02.719 --> 01:50:04.320
side and the business side

01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:07.360
um so so just drop the last [ __ ]

01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:08.880
vestige of your

01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:11.360
vestigial tail that you have

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:13.440
i will try i will try it i'm looking at

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:14.880
this as a therapy session today i also

01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:16.239
feel like dude as long as you can like

01:50:16.239 --> 01:50:18.239
not have a [ __ ] like a nine to five

01:50:18.239 --> 01:50:20.480
job you're like slam dunking dude yeah

01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:21.760
that's the best if i can just go like

01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:23.119
wake up every morning and not have like

01:50:23.119 --> 01:50:24.800
some dude and apron staring at me and

01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:26.239
telling me what to do it's like that was

01:50:26.239 --> 01:50:28.480
literally my i want ambition

01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:30.639
that was money after so but can i

01:50:30.639 --> 01:50:31.920
that's all i care about literally that's

01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:33.440
all i care about move that right there

01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:35.119
is an imaginary line that you've created

01:50:35.119 --> 01:50:36.560
right and you can put that imaginary

01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:39.280
line wherever so so i mean that you can

01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:40.800
literally say all i care about is having

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:42.239
a million dollars in the bank in a year

01:50:42.239 --> 01:50:43.840
doing comedy and if you really cared the

01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:44.880
same way you cared about not having a

01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:46.639
day job you would achieve that goal

01:50:46.639 --> 01:50:47.840
versus achieve because i did the same

01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:48.800
thing i was like dude all i want to do

01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:50.800
is but when my son's four i make sure

01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:52.560
that i have a nice place you know i've

01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:54.400
been on tv a few times i you know when

01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:56.400
he has a memory of his dad not slumming

01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:57.199
it you know what i'm saying it was a

01:50:57.199 --> 01:50:58.480
weird thing i set the center like when

01:50:58.480 --> 01:50:59.679
he's four i just want to make sure i

01:50:59.679 --> 01:51:01.040
have everything together and then sure

01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:02.320
enough we were four was exactly when

01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:03.679
things started coming together and it's

01:51:03.679 --> 01:51:05.440
exactly the time period where and i was

01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:07.760
like oh i set that goal i set that line

01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:09.440
sure yeah i could have just moved that

01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:10.880
line anywhere i wanted to we have

01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:13.280
complete control of that so i think

01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:15.360
that that humility where it's great for

01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:17.119
comedic a comedian to have humility from

01:51:17.119 --> 01:51:18.639
an artistic standpoint you need to think

01:51:18.639 --> 01:51:20.080
dude i have so much self-hatred you have

01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:21.840
no idea all that [ __ ] believe me i need

01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:23.040
some of it out of me okay so you

01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:24.800
shouldn't hate yourself at all

01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:26.239
someone is trying to say that you should

01:51:26.239 --> 01:51:27.760
hate yourself at any level that's very

01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:29.679
common well i think that's where my

01:51:29.679 --> 01:51:31.280
what's funny about me comes from is this

01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:33.119
is you know this you know i've been i've

01:51:33.119 --> 01:51:35.520
been in very very dark places before and

01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:37.280
i think that wait what's funny about you

01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:38.960
that you hate yourself

01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:40.159
i think that that's where a lot of my

01:51:40.159 --> 01:51:41.840
funny comes from is just like the [ __ ]

01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:43.920
that's like you know

01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:46.840
something i hate myself

01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:49.840
i hate myself as in the right word

01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:51.599
it's just a lot of darkness whatever it

01:51:51.599 --> 01:51:53.119
is like the [ __ ] that's going on in my

01:51:53.119 --> 01:51:55.520
head it's not [ __ ] sunshine and happy

01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:57.599
thoughts sure almost ever you know i'm

01:51:57.599 --> 01:51:58.960
saying when i'm working that's why i'm

01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:00.239
so career obsessed and i'm so work

01:52:00.239 --> 01:52:03.360
obsessed i sort of push it out of my

01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:05.199
head like the evil you know what i'm

01:52:05.199 --> 01:52:07.040
saying all like the [ __ ] like i have

01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:08.719
every day i have i think about [ __ ] up

01:52:08.719 --> 01:52:10.159
memories and [ __ ] up things every

01:52:10.159 --> 01:52:12.880
single day okay and i i become obsessed

01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:14.639
with work and i push them out of my head

01:52:14.639 --> 01:52:16.400
and work has sort of become like a level

01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:18.159
of therapy for me you know whether it's

01:52:18.159 --> 01:52:19.599
you know comedy or any of the other

01:52:19.599 --> 01:52:20.960
stuff that i'm doing

01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:21.760
um

01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:23.920
so i don't even know how we got here

01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:25.040
yeah well you were saying it was like i

01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:27.280
said but that's that's cool to avoid the

01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:30.880
original point yeah

01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:32.560
you can't be mean to everybody

01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:34.719
especially that's a weird to be like and

01:52:34.719 --> 01:52:35.920
i i do have to wrap up yeah we gotta

01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:36.800
wrap up

01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:38.560
just to look at like a customer service

01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:40.480
rep like this person has got to take my

01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:43.520
negative feelings can't do that

01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:44.800
can't you gotta go what's this person

01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:46.800
dealing with right now

01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:48.239
you end up having more and more positive

01:52:48.239 --> 01:52:49.360
interactions

01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:50.719
yeah you know what i mean otherwise you

01:52:50.719 --> 01:52:51.920
know what it is though it's like i have

01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:53.679
a you're right that uh what happened to

01:52:53.679 --> 01:52:55.360
that interaction and what's going on in

01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:57.599
my head is that

01:52:57.599 --> 01:52:59.679
i'm going like all right well if i own

01:52:59.679 --> 01:53:01.040
this hotel

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:02.159
what would i do what would be the

01:53:02.159 --> 01:53:04.080
correct answer here it would be you make

01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:05.360
this guy who's obviously already upset

01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:07.280
about something you make him [ __ ]

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:08.719
feel like a million bucks it's a you

01:53:08.719 --> 01:53:09.360
know

01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:10.480
you're spending a lot of money to be

01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:11.280
here

01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:12.800
good customer service good hospitality

01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:14.400
it's like in that moment it's not time

01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:15.520
to give an attitude it's not time to

01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:17.599
double down and then that i start to

01:53:17.599 --> 01:53:19.440
like whatever however

01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:21.119
those ideas connect in my head however

01:53:21.119 --> 01:53:23.040
like i do that math and i get there sure

01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:25.119
that starts to get me even more angry

01:53:25.119 --> 01:53:27.280
what you said about i think that i own

01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:29.520
the hotel or like i think if i own that

01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:31.119
hotel

01:53:31.119 --> 01:53:33.599
that's could be the seed of this whole

01:53:33.599 --> 01:53:35.599
thing it's a that's a control thing not

01:53:35.599 --> 01:53:36.960
saying you're an overly controlling

01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:39.199
person but it's like

01:53:39.199 --> 01:53:41.280
i if i ran this hotel things would be

01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:43.040
different and then you start trying to

01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:45.119
you set this

01:53:45.119 --> 01:53:47.280
expectation of them as if you actually

01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:48.880
do the hotel but everyone's sort of

01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:50.480
pushed you're going in here so everyone

01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:52.719
in life throws their expectations onto

01:53:52.719 --> 01:53:54.080
everyone else so everyone has their own

01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:56.239
set of sort of they do i walk around

01:53:56.239 --> 01:53:57.360
every day i'm told i'm not allowed to

01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:59.040
say stupid words by some [ __ ] idiot

01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:00.800
on the internet sure so everyone hates

01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:04.239
it yes yes but i think that mine is more

01:54:04.239 --> 01:54:05.280
more

01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:06.639
true

01:54:06.639 --> 01:54:08.000
i mean at least mine is coming from a

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.199
place where like yeah dude this how the

01:54:09.199 --> 01:54:10.639

01:54:10.639 --> 01:54:12.400
saying let me see let me say is that not

01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:13.679
true though

01:54:13.679 --> 01:54:15.280
step back start from the situation step

01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:17.119
back you don't think that the person

01:54:17.119 --> 01:54:18.719
behind the desk

01:54:18.719 --> 01:54:20.400
should

01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:21.679
should in the moment where they're

01:54:21.679 --> 01:54:22.639
dealing with a customer even the

01:54:22.639 --> 01:54:23.760

it's not the same thing you you're

01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:55.040
displaying woman anger it's that's not

01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:56.880
no it's not man anger it's the [ __ ]

01:56:56.880 --> 01:56:58.800
disproportionate

01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:00.159
time travel in your head you're gonna

01:57:00.159 --> 01:57:01.520
pay for everything that ever happened

01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:02.719
[ __ ]

01:57:02.719 --> 01:57:05.280
that's that comes from like woman abuse

01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:06.880
like you know for you i didn't get beat

01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:10.000
by my dad so

01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:14.880
my mom's bipolar we found out later

01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:16.480

01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:19.280
everyone was like i love my mom but that

01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:21.119
that who's joking is is that a russian

01:57:21.119 --> 01:57:22.800
ave jokes just a stupid old joke or he's

01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:24.560
like he's like she's bipolar that means

01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:27.199
she [ __ ] male polar bears and female

01:57:27.199 --> 01:57:29.679
pullers sounds like a bad [ __ ] joke

01:57:29.679 --> 01:57:31.199
but he used to make me laugh so hard

01:57:31.199 --> 01:57:32.719
rush medivh is the king of telling bad

01:57:32.719 --> 01:57:34.560
jokes that are hilarious whereas like if

01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:36.320
you look at your ball skin and realize

01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:39.360
it looks just like an elephant skin

01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:41.040
he just goes into this [ __ ] weird

01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:41.840
thing

01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:43.040
talking about [ __ ] pulling on his

01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:44.800
ball scanner whatever hey god no there's

01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:46.000
something to that saying like you have

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.840
like women anger mailing or different

01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:48.880
yeah

01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:51.119
so like all my that's what's what and

01:57:51.119 --> 01:57:53.520
it's it's very dangerous for a woman

01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:55.119
anger to come out of a man

01:57:55.119 --> 01:57:56.800
a woman anger could have a woman who's

01:57:56.800 --> 01:57:58.480
one of you sent him on my period

01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:01.040
it you you you did like a period thing

01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:03.119
and and so

01:58:03.119 --> 01:58:04.560
i shouldn't have moods at first i mean

01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:06.000
you should avoid the black guy's looking

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:07.280
at his nose at you because you remind me

01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:08.800
some chick from his blog

01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:10.639
like yeah like um you don't want to

01:58:10.639 --> 01:58:12.080
display woman anger and it's a thing

01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:14.400
that gets beat into men by like women

01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:16.639
when they're young yeah and it happened

01:58:16.639 --> 01:58:17.840
but

01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:21.520
the there's like a [ __ ] dog

01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:23.440
he's [ __ ] the best he always says the

01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:25.119
best [ __ ] about it he told patrice a lot

01:58:25.119 --> 01:58:26.639
of [ __ ] that pictures yeah

01:58:26.639 --> 01:58:28.480
but it's like but dante's benevolent

01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:31.280
king system is the way to go it's like

01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:32.719
you don't crush somebody when they're

01:58:32.719 --> 01:58:34.960
wrong or whatever you you like it's it's

01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:36.239
proportionate because all this [ __ ] that

01:58:36.239 --> 01:58:37.440
you would hate from some [ __ ]

01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:38.880
feminist by the way who's out of her

01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:40.880
[ __ ] mind that's this exact same

01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:42.320
thing well i don't know i'm right and i

01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:44.320
should be able to jog at midnight while

01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:45.599
i'm drunk and nothing like you think

01:58:45.599 --> 01:58:46.960
that's a reasonable thing to request of

01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:49.119
the world yeah yeah of course we agree

01:58:49.119 --> 01:58:50.880
that's how life should be but you're

01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:52.159
going to have to on your end let's all

01:58:52.159 --> 01:58:53.599
teach men not to rape things you're like

01:58:53.599 --> 01:58:54.320
sure

01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:56.400
yeah i think we have been there's no

01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:57.440
good luck teaching them not to yell

01:58:57.440 --> 01:58:58.310
about tacos

01:58:58.310 --> 01:59:00.880
[Laughter]

01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:02.719
but so you know but just remember that

01:59:02.719 --> 01:59:04.080
like that's not what you want out of

01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:05.760
that because you you know you got you're

01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:07.599
a dad you built a business you got a lot

01:59:07.599 --> 01:59:09.440
of man [ __ ] this is like whatever

01:59:09.440 --> 01:59:11.760
neglected foster kid [ __ ] yeah well no

01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:13.040
it comes from my mom beating the [ __ ]

01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:14.080
out of me and not being able to do

01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:15.360
anything you can't hit her back just to

01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:17.760
just take it over and over again so yeah

01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:19.040
you're right every time somebody walks

01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:20.880
down the street and disrespects me

01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:22.320
it's there's this feeling of like oh

01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:25.199
[ __ ] now i can yeah now i can swing

01:59:25.199 --> 01:59:26.480
because i'm serial killers from that

01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:28.239
kind of thing of course

01:59:28.239 --> 01:59:29.760
you should have you you've got a leg up

01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:31.679
it's not that you don't have to change

01:59:31.679 --> 01:59:33.679
all this stuff and it's like

01:59:33.679 --> 01:59:35.760
uh uh i get no credit for how often i

01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:37.440
don't freak out on people by the way and

01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:38.800
you won't get that correct yeah nobody

01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:40.800
is no one will be able to

01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:42.159
think of all the people i didn't

01:59:42.159 --> 01:59:44.880
viciously assault they're pretty happy

01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:45.840
