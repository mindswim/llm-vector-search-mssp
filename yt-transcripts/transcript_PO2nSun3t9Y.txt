count who knows but there's a lot less

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.300
it's a lot of current events

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.010
yeah I think this will be the first time

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.739

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.390
turret yes spud man V turd it's Chris I

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.850
know why yeah you always trying to

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.980
create that versus I mean it must be the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.440
New York is nothing but I'm a big fan

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.199
began to contact me [ __ ] weasels team

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.359
up on their bond is too strong wait the

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:15.600
hyena isn't [ __ ] lying no I thought

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.939
there was it kind of a bit of a riff

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.450
excited that's whatever that was a

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.990
lifetime ago

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.180
yeah true well I was before you know

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.270
that was before what like the KS blow up

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.520
true yeah that was back in the day well

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.689
I probably listeners don't know about

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.790
that but uh spud man we got a lot going

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.280
on what's what's on your mind oh can I

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.560
talk about oh one second before we got

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.110
you here this is a whole dilemma just

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.210
getting him here yeah okay cause he got

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.729
hungry I don't know why you have to do

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.869
this like I thought we were gonna have a

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:55.290
good time

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.930
it was fans abuse it work what happened

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.420
to work we're not gonna go into that

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.240
docks that dude chill yeah what happened

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.380
was someone mean to you at work

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.149
yeah it's just frustrating let's not

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.069
give us the broad strokes yeah

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.470
the rift is bad what really pissed me

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.430
off is that Billy wants to record our

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.150
phone calls and he wants to know I want

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.000
the money these guys make $200 a month

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.870
boys and Billy's like how do you just

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.060
saw delete your settings I tried to set

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.430
up something and his [ __ ] was dropping

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.290
you tell max was I'm just telling you

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.180
the version Matt's [ __ ] was wasn't

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.739
dropping my dad's wasn't dropping I

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:42.610
tests on him

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.319
spade was shopping every time so what

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.209
would you do who's that fault yeah

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.739
what's the common denominator well he

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.920
called on me Verizon reset all settings

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.379
so I'm not techie like Bill I don't like

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:54.730
playing with my phone and doing all this

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.620
stuff I don't even know if I can get all

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.450

a computer I'm not a computer person

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.280
yeah but this will make your computer

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.099
programs better I guess yeah but I

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.840

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.470

I want to talk about the Redemption tour

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:47.449
came up with an idea I had a vision

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.560
I imagined like a stage where Shane was

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.389
coming off the lights were shine and

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.150
first of all let me preface this by

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.159
Matt's been making me take mushrooms so

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:00.469
I'm driving around all day I'm having

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:02.449
hallucinations little guys just little

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.740
dangerous good to drive and I was like

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.029
oh Connor was standing there he was

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:09.409
about to get on stage and I was like

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:10.849

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:12.979
went on a Redemption tour I called Matt

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.569
and I was like dude Matt I have a killer

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:17.990

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.120
of like a combination between spinal tap

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.659

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.900
scenes they get to know you a little bit

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.070

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:32.460
when I heard about

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.250

both believe that Sandy Hook was a hoax

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.470
oh it's called operation capstone that

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:58.340
definitely didn't happen so why why did

apartment ridiculous Mark Wahlberg said

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:10.090
he would just stop that plane to [ __ ]

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:14.440
yeah you guys believe that we covered

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.700
that 9/11 what I mean 911s that's like

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.760
if you if you get into the Israeli the

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.580
dancing Israeli stuff that's nuts like

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.830
the art students they had to they got in

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:29.440
there before it was actually on an

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.390
Israeli TV I mean I can't even get into

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.150
all this but what was it these guys were

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:37.570
there like in the building then they

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:39.220
were there afterwards dancing up and

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:44.010
down jumping like cheering the 911

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:46.990
people were calling the cops like yo

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:48.640
check these guys out who was head of

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.470
security got detainment hours they were

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:51.250
don't know

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:54.430
the security company now versus brother

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.110
maybe oh that's right that's weird

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.030
there's just a lot of that kind of stuff

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:04.870
going on yeah okay missing money in the

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:06.610
Pentagon mmm there's a lot of weird

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:09.670
stuff in 9/11 but there might be a lot

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:11.230
of weird stuff going on all the time

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.630
yeah and then you can connect the dots

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:16.300
yeah you know you do that I think so the

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.940
Corvette Courbet or Corvette report that

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.890
think you guys would be I think you're

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:28.230

going through a divorce - no it's really

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.520
things are happening to me in my life

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.160
that I retreat from yeah attack that

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:03.809
head-on

00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:14.609
sure maybe do a deep dive you go first

00:24:14.609 --> 00:24:16.229
of all you get high and then there's the

00:24:16.229 --> 00:24:16.830
dweller

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:18.960
you gotta greet the dweller throw on

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.809
throw also known as Thoth

00:24:20.809 --> 00:24:24.749
soft guarding the halls of Amenti that's

00:24:24.749 --> 00:24:32.159
where we're trying to go China got the

00:24:32.159 --> 00:24:35.669
rock contact and I was like well you

00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:37.589
have to go like just I mean you gotta

00:24:37.589 --> 00:24:38.849
talk to Matt cuz he's way more of a

00:24:38.849 --> 00:24:40.830
shaman but I mean you just have to go

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:44.249
with your kind of dude ideas children I

00:24:44.249 --> 00:24:45.599
was like [ __ ] to you what is going on I

00:24:45.599 --> 00:24:47.429
fight instead of freaking out I made it

00:24:47.429 --> 00:24:50.219
through I usually freak out if I get

00:24:50.219 --> 00:24:51.479

the thought is there cause no that's

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:08.999
just the dweller you gotta get into

00:25:08.999 --> 00:25:10.440

worried about Sandy Hook he's scared of

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:46.979
what I'm just wondering like where

00:25:46.979 --> 00:25:48.570
survivors are and the kids are saying

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:57.509
the Superbowl yeah

00:25:57.509 --> 00:25:59.909
and this is all connected so you're all

00:25:59.909 --> 00:26:01.889
Superbowl halftime shows are trust the

00:26:01.889 --> 00:26:04.649
FBI Chris what is that you trust the FBI

00:26:04.649 --> 00:26:08.190
yeah you think they're credible yeah so

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:09.330
what about their stats you think their

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.580
stats are like pretty spot-on right I'm

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.259
not gonna defend all their stats it's

00:26:13.259 --> 00:26:14.999
just weird no anything about their stats

00:26:14.999 --> 00:26:17.340
here linear Sandy Hook happened

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.559
their only account for like five deaths

00:26:19.559 --> 00:26:22.019
in Newtown and 27 people died in the

00:26:22.019 --> 00:26:23.730
school so why is there only like five

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:29.360
deaths in Newtown FBI yeah I don't know

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.580
I have so funny Matt did one episode

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.519
without me there was stoner dads just

00:26:35.519 --> 00:26:36.929
went off the rails of my first episode

00:26:36.929 --> 00:26:45.570
alone is just poking bears yeah I know

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:47.190
well it's funny no homo

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:52.320
it's hard for me not to know it's hard

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.549
for me well it's tough cuz yeah I'm

00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:57.899
genuinely curious yeah that's all I'm

00:26:57.899 --> 00:27:00.149
saying so am i but now I'm a freak show

00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:02.210
you're not a freak show

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:06.779
it's just if I want to be dark and

00:27:06.779 --> 00:27:10.070
twisted as you want but it does

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:13.649
yeah it's ruffle some feathers yeah and

00:27:13.649 --> 00:27:16.230
then it's you know you know like you

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:20.309
aluminized cymbals yeah that was the

00:27:20.309 --> 00:27:22.499
race they had for the Cure why would

00:27:22.499 --> 00:27:25.200
they commit a crime like that and then

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.970
hide their symbols everywhere they do it

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.940
in your age it empowers them how does it

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.610
empower them yes they get off to that

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:35.549
[ __ ] we got a positive polarity dude

00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:37.490
we're not on that negative polarity [ __ ]

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:39.899
okay we don't practice that dark magic

00:27:39.899 --> 00:27:43.320
stuff it's hard to it's hard to argue

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:55.230
when it's all just symbolism will be

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:59.460
their downfall you'll see statement and

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.110

00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:04.569
it's ruining everything

00:52:04.569 --> 00:52:06.579
I'm at about this before in the same way

00:52:06.579 --> 00:52:08.019
that there was like a panic about what

00:52:08.019 --> 00:52:10.630
pornhub was gonna do to boys it did ruin

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:11.920
a lot of dudes

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:13.690
you know what I mean this kid's been on

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:15.069
what was your debut

00:52:15.069 --> 00:52:17.710
what was your edgy porn stuff busting up

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:22.380
my butt volume 2 and portable DVD player

00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:28.210
but underground CD that's all people

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:30.520
used to freak out about these young men

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:32.349
get their hands on porn but I would say

00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:35.109
a real danger is the girls getting on

00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:37.869
the dating apps because you think it

00:52:37.869 --> 00:52:40.630
gasses them up it's like you know girls

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:42.309
like to shop so they're shopping for

00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.790
dudes

00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:45.250
yeah and it's an endless stream of Simon

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:47.589
doobies open yeah they're constantly

00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:51.430
like you're so high your size literally

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:53.680
do you and you get any grief it's me

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:54.790
like [ __ ] this I'll just go out with

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:58.059
another dude right that's it's such a

00:52:58.059 --> 00:52:59.740
bad thing but they want to destroy the

00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:00.640
nuclear family

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:10.540
that's all they want to do so you think

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:13.599
they have a hand in the dating website

00:53:13.599 --> 00:53:17.500
game I thought we were turning a leaf

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:22.420
here yes the dam is definitely control

00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:26.950
to it they control caviar that's the

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:29.260
food delivery yeah who controls a girl

00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:33.010
that's keeping me fat obese Papa John's

00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:35.440
is Taco Bell that's pure blood America

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.339
that's Americana

00:53:36.339 --> 00:53:38.230
but like caviar is like starters and

00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:44.650
nash's so what say appetizers what the

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:47.349
[ __ ] is that I don't know what do you

00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:50.440
think why throw that in there is what I

00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.180
want to know trying to be close and

00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:54.849
nauseous nauseous yeah well I just

00:53:54.849 --> 00:53:56.349
figured out what a [ __ ] nosh was like

00:53:56.349 --> 00:54:02.559
two years ago it's been appetizers four

00:54:02.559 --> 00:54:15.849
years four years was to not do this year

00:54:15.849 --> 00:54:17.950
we could do this all the time but don't

00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:20.670
bring them down

00:54:21.050 --> 00:54:26.510
word is questions why it's [ __ ]

00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:28.640
appetizers remember he's doing this you

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:34.600
I'm sitting here I just got questions so

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:38.930
nosh is Yiddish yes and you think why

00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:42.500
throw that on caviar but it's not even

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:44.060
like they completely replace it it's

00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:47.450
starters and nauseous maybe one guy who

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:50.660
runs its Jewish caviar yeah yeah but why

00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:52.430
though dude it was appetizers forever

00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:54.080
I've had caviar forever it's always been

00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:56.300
appetizers Starwood only recently

00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:59.000
changed yes how long you literally just

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.860
happen I'm all old I think it's a hip to

00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:04.550
be ethnic of any type so I don't know

00:55:04.550 --> 00:55:05.300
I'm sure it helps

00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:06.950
maybe advertisers weren't selling well

00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:09.410
and they changed the jargon who the [ __ ]

00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:11.420
I just figured out what a nosh was dude

00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:13.250
yeah me too way more people don't know

00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:17.720
what obviously nosh is like a cheeky fun

00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:19.160
word for an appetizer

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:22.040

what's finest start saying it yeah so

00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:34.610

00:55:34.610 --> 00:55:36.470
to normalize the Yiddish I don't know

00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:40.030

not actually good the for real like this

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.230
dress from the SNL thing really made me

01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:37.760
not give a [ __ ] about chicks for a while

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:38.990
that's the best way to opera which you

01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:41.660
actually made like it's it's very hard

01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:43.940
to not get chicks if you don't care you

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:45.920
need yeah I think I got a touch that

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:47.840
just from the stress of my life and

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.340
everything if you totally don't care

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:51.230
then it actually kind of gets easy and

01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:52.210
so it's like

01:02:52.210 --> 01:02:54.069
you know it's also hard to deal with

01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:55.599
them because they're talking and you're

01:02:55.599 --> 01:02:58.390

01:02:58.390 --> 01:03:00.220

into the they're going back into the

01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:58.240
time when I remember when Obama did the

01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.380
bailout yeah

01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:02.770

01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:04.120
they're gonna forget about that you know

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:07.210
the RICO laws yeah Julianna you know how

01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:08.800
we use them to take down the mob he says

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:10.870

01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:14.070
did on the mob yeah yeah all right Chris

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:20.140
maybe you have some thoughts on that we

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:21.370
don't even have to get into the Heinz

01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:26.050
the Heinz kid ketchup hunter Biden and

01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:30.010
the carries mustard air yeah it's all

01:06:30.010 --> 01:06:31.780
Skull and Bones [ __ ] they took out Kobe

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:32.500
it's whatever

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:37.770
yeah that shit's wild wait to catch up

01:06:37.770 --> 01:06:43.000
there's a higher side right wait what

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.430
happened with Kobe some like weird magic

01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:46.600
indeed it's kind of wild

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:51.430
what's higher side we'll explain that

01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:53.130
because I would what happened with Kobe

01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:55.540
supposedly like way into magic so it's

01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:59.080
like his dad jelly bean Kirby's dad

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.630
jelly bean came back from Italy and he

01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:05.080
came to some like weird Kabbalah school

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:08.680
and Lower Merion and got into like magic

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.140
or something like that and then Kobe's

01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:16.390
into magic and skullenbones is involved

01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:18.370
and the Heinz family's involved it's

01:07:18.370 --> 01:07:19.330
wild

01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:21.460
generally you know doing my best here

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:21.339
than unilaterally doing it but there was

01:09:21.339 --> 01:09:23.020
a prosecutor going after there was never

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:25.240
a dwith held yeah good job the whole

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:27.130

you say look I don't I don't know this

01:09:34.539 --> 01:09:35.529
well enough but I was under the

01:09:35.529 --> 01:09:37.299
impression that he was actually they

01:09:37.299 --> 01:09:39.339
were removing the prosecutor to get

01:09:39.339 --> 01:09:40.839
someone in there who would prosecute

01:09:40.839 --> 01:09:47.829

fun now we should have stuck to the

01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:02.870
script of funny stories and instead we

01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:04.640
got down the the wrong path

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.560
yes question I know I brought it along

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.840

01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:26.410
said way worse [ __ ] did you require

01:12:26.410 --> 01:12:28.190

01:12:28.190 --> 01:12:29.900
cuz I was quiet she just stepped up no

01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:31.430
you're cool dude look we still have time

01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:32.930
we can salvage it in the last couple

01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:35.120
minutes here does not be called minutes

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.560
last time we did this you kept trying to

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.060
shut us down and wanna be like three

01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:39.710
hours true it is I mean this is what

01:12:39.710 --> 01:12:42.200
happens on a war room yeah I mean it's

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:43.510
tough man

01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:47.690
then that's dramatic it is so dramatic

01:12:47.690 --> 01:12:49.430
not sad I'm just like you know it's

01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:51.470
tough you know I don't want to piss

01:12:51.470 --> 01:13:00.320
O'Connor off well you know it's the same

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:01.910
thing as like his whole family's

01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:03.800
Democrat he comes from a Democrat town

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:05.990
yeah do my cousins from New York or like

01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:08.960
though they want like a Bloomberg Budaj

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.240
presidency or something I was like yeah

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:13.550
there's a judge every single Democrats

01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:16.760
just scrambling to not get Bernie is all

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:19.340
they're there what's the fuss with

01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:20.930
Bernie I mean that seems to be what

01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:22.730
there are people Democrats are rich too

01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:24.620
so they're like you definitely don't

01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:26.840
want a guy who's gonna try to take money

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:29.990
and racks the billionaires which you

01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:33.020
know I actually do agree with yeah we

01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:34.100
should probably populist you should

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:35.480
probably tax some of them yeah your

01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:39.710
populist in taksim a little I mean

01:13:39.710 --> 01:13:41.930
you're not gonna [ __ ] me up taxing the

01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:43.760
rich I know that's what's funny that's

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.980
how I felt when uh Obama when Trump won

01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:48.080
I was just sleeping across the street

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:52.730
here in a mattress just like he's gonna

01:13:52.730 --> 01:13:54.710

01:13:54.710 --> 01:13:55.250
whatever

01:13:55.250 --> 01:13:56.480
counties don't be bad

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:59.000
I think it just took a plummet because

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.150
that's all [ __ ] dude every two years

01:14:02.150 --> 01:14:03.320
they come out with one of these things

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:06.440
weird I think they are real oh they're

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:07.640
real but I'm just saying like they hype

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:10.430
them yeah I mean I do think there is

01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:12.140
like just the possibility if one of

01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:14.870
these hits it's like it's gonna hit and

01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:18.680
it's gonna be [ __ ] go right twice a

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:20.600
day you know that pandemic show where

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:22.100
they're trying to push like a universal

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:25.160
like a week that was weird as [ __ ] that

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.900
whole like Bill Gates stuff funding that

01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:28.310
stuff that gets weird where I'm like

01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:30.620
dude why are you pushing this you know I

01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:33.890

01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:38.950
1918 flu started in a cans in Kansas

01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:41.660
it's like Italy starting in World War

01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:44.210
one they brought it home with one and

01:14:44.210 --> 01:14:46.720
it's like dude that was a really weird

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:50.090
set up of people that didn't live like

01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:52.960
us that might not happen to us again

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:56.989
Spanish flu yeah but it's still like I

01:14:56.989 --> 01:14:58.160

a kid yeah he was a kid and he was

01:31:10.690 --> 01:31:13.720
talking and I didn't like the way they

01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:15.400
were that they were talking about that

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:18.190
situation because the situation is so

01:31:18.190 --> 01:31:20.950
real to a young guy what not getting

01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:23.650

01:31:23.650 --> 01:31:26.620
what I mean and it's like I wouldn't

01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:28.840
want the way I have to deal with it

01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:30.790
imagine and a young dude having to deal

01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:32.860
with it holy [ __ ] man you know what I

01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:36.510
mean it's not cool to talk about not

01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:47.800
kiddies in a mob how old is it 19 he's

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:51.310
like [ __ ] 9 he's 19 didn't I I sent

01:31:51.310 --> 01:31:52.630
something weird about Clayton

01:31:52.630 --> 01:31:55.180
spades gonna obviously go to bat for him

01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:58.000
they're in the same mob I just thought

01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.830
I'd the [ __ ] like the way his mom's

01:31:59.830 --> 01:32:01.720
filming I'm doing that [ __ ] just weird

01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:14.260
just a lot like Keaton Jones yeah yeah

01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:16.240
well something weird there is always

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:17.410
something weird about like a parent

01:32:17.410 --> 01:32:18.820
filming their kid while they're having

01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:20.620
it's the last thing that be on my again

01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:22.030
nine year olds having an existential

01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:23.770
crisis where it's like I want to kill

01:32:23.770 --> 01:32:25.990
myself like I believe now why do you

01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:27.640
want to kill yourself quad yeah exactly

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.830
it doesn't make sense to me obviously

01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:32.170
you're not believe in quality this is I

01:32:32.170 --> 01:32:34.120
believe that he said I believe that I've

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.980
the thing that's [ __ ] up about is just

01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:38.350
a mom coming it and being like the moms

01:32:38.350 --> 01:32:39.880
messed up you couldn't be coaching this

01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:42.040
I think there is a possibility she could

01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:43.570
be coaching my some of it she might be

01:32:43.570 --> 01:32:45.010
coaching but that kids definitely

01:32:45.010 --> 01:32:47.470
feeling like that dad he's a [ __ ] but

01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:48.550
do you think it would make it feel

01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:50.530
better there's no why do you feel I

01:32:50.530 --> 01:32:51.880
should say why you want to kill yourself

01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:54.130
is the mom stuff though yeah yeah I mean

01:32:54.130 --> 01:32:56.170
it's not quite making it worse she is

01:32:56.170 --> 01:32:58.060
making it worse but it is but at least

01:32:58.060 --> 01:33:00.480
she's gonna get a cool GoFundMe you know

01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:02.890
yeah man I get what you're saying but

01:33:02.890 --> 01:33:05.230
coming at him coming at him being 19

01:33:05.230 --> 01:33:14.050
that's all baby no

01:33:14.050 --> 01:33:16.870
but yeah the same thing with the lady

01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:19.090
who filmed that other kid crying the

01:33:19.090 --> 01:33:21.610
same thing yeah it wasn't like his dad

Millennials ago yeah but I mean there's

01:34:01.770 --> 01:34:03.540

some gangster rapper but you've been

01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:12.090

started to get real I mean one of them

01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:30.120

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:31.410
that [ __ ] was real for a long time but I

01:34:31.410 --> 01:34:33.390

hook melon

01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:33.540
