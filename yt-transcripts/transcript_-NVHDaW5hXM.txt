and just laid it in between the beds and

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.290

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.820
trip doobies are gays here these would

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.500
be like butt off yeah I just kept

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.730
telling O'Connor that he can never

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.130
accept responsibility something would

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.490
happen

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.430
this person's an idiot defected you are

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.990
it's a fun trip that sounds like fun

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.450
it's the mutual decision of like it was

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.760
a first-person being like you want to

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.100
stop driving yeah all three of us were

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.410
like let's well the plan originally was

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.780
to get to drive like two or three hours

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.460
and then watch the Eagles game somewhere

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.380
okay like go stop at like a bar or

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.169
something but then it just became we

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.169
could just get a hotel room and watch it

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:35.350
perfect

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.870
yes in complete agreement there's a

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.480
total like no one disagrees he's like I

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.270
have nothing to do today let's sleep

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.040

like the Egyptian Sun God so there's a

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.220
there's a whole genre of literature that

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.080
strictly comes from people who are

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.120
channeling extra-dimensional extra

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.430
dimensional entities yes so the rock

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.380
contact was there's these three people I

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.580
think it was two at first either way

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.800
there's three people and it was like a

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.390
husband and wife and they're like dog

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.340
and they they're just meditating in the

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.170
desert for like seven years they're just

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:52.730
doing the thing they started getting

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.860
into like channeling and stuff so the

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.750
lady decided to try to start channeling

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.900
and she just like started just spewing

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.940

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.670
channeled rah the sun-god rut or

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.070
obviously not even the Sun god there's

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:32.570

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:34.100
her she's a my you're just a

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.840
mind/body/spirit complex with certain

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.220
distortions towards right now it sounds

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.570
like you have a cognitive distortion

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:45.380
leaning towards envy right now yeah so

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.750
they needed sexual like they're like

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.120
it'll help channeling it like sexual

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.510
kind of contact helps like keep like

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:54.710
they called the instrument the person

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.570
who's channeling so this dude was been

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:58.910

girl's [ __ ] and she's like the pyramids

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.270
known as the in the extra-dimensional

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:14.540
year of 2000 dude they filled with five

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.580

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.800
five books dude you I mean dude that's

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.630
deserts news coming from a fourth

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.790
dimensional fourth dimensional entity

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.500
like yourself I would believe that dude

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.570
I'm six dimensional yuck so I'm hearing

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:27.830
that I'm six dimensional I'm a wanderer

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:30.140
dude so it's like I'm digging it but if

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.250
you know obviously from the fourth

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.080
dimensional with you know certain

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.700
cognitive distortions drove eight hours

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.680
through the rock contact is [ __ ] lit

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.470
so what happens did they I don't know

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.630
I'm only I'm only like five hours in

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:49.490
they know that they were just they don't

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:50.960
like go through that explicitly it's

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.060
just the whole whole book is just a guy

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.940
asking a question and then it goes this

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.560
I am raw and that cuz they're just

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.750
saying like this was all on audio sad

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:03.200
you find this this is gibberish this is

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.360
junk less yeah no that's a giant we

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.580
handled literature is an enormous waste

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.990
well even think of it this way obviously

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:10.850
if she's not talking to all I have a

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.530
whole stance right now I my all my

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.530
reading has led me to extra dimensional

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:17.840
entities all the reading I've done that

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.680
culminated new books no to all your

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.630
books are leading you to a lady getting

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:26.600
a [ __ ] and channeling raw dude you're

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.470
at the wrong books no not at all not at

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.270
all because I'm good I'm reading all

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:33.260
these putting like I'm just you know

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:34.670
like oh that's cool I'll read this next

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.080
oh what's this and I'll google it I'll

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.450
read that next dude all the books for

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.760
science it's real weird for the most

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.130
part have all have a common thing of

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:45.140
like like do you know what mysticism is

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.760
like the actual definition of it and now

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.590
what's the definition so that they then

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:49.730
this is according to you know to one

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.560
source but they're saying that mysticism

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.290
is technically the belief that human

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:57.650
beings are the physical manifestation of

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.110
like gods consciousness so like you know

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:01.160
that every the whole thing like we're

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.840
all godlike exploring and looking around

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.930
blah blah so also I've read the noni

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.240
that's about as a Rosicrucian tale do

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.110
you know what they believed a

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.120
Rosicrucian tale yeah

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.560
what does those crucians they're like

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.850
out there like a branch of like

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.860
alchemists or whatever okay it's okay

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.330
like it grew out of alchemy and

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:18.650
apparently liked it a lot of like these

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:19.980
like I've never

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.260
this is like some sort of weird dungeons

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.350
dragons history that I never looked into

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:26.580
yeah obviously it's a secret history

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.930
dude you can't just dig through this I

do what they say to do on every single

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:21.990
decision and they will literally just

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:23.280
completely control your whole life and

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.720
cut it all off and you'll just be you'll

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.090
be [ __ ] you'll be living a bad life if

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:28.500
women are in control you'll live a bad

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.510
life if you live if you're to go like

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:32.100
yeah if you were to do like they grad

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.480
achill yes experiment where you're just

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.110
like okay

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.730
yeah let's do that oh yeah let's do that

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.280
- oh yeah if you do that I still hold I

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.070
and again maybe my views warped I don't

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:43.110
know but this guy is telling me the same

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:45.330
exact thing and I'm like across the pond

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:46.890
he's done he's delivering the same

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:49.410
message a message bro yeah so the

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:51.210
message is clear well well this

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:52.440
continent or the other

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.440
check your [ __ ] yeah basically okay

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.150
like and not even in a way like that's

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:58.590
what you in this manner said not like

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.120
rattle I think women should have

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:06.030
complete control well yeah no no no I'm

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:07.440
trying to think the conversation we were

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.450
having was a nice way it wasn't like

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.790
[ __ ] [ __ ] yeah the sexism wasn't

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.470
out of hate it wasn't it was just he was

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:16.020
just this guy dude we're exactly we're

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.700
driving and he was just like he's a

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.020
command I mean sometimes don't even want

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:23.160
to go back there but at home he's like

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.960
sometimes I just I want to stay out here

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.220
and I was telling him oh my god dude

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.290
like when I got married I remember

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:29.730
thinking about my dad sitting in his

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:31.980
truck for like 45 minutes afterward and

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.150
being like what's dad doing out there

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:35.610
and being like what do you pull up and

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:39.240
you're like you sit outside your house

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.710
you're like I'm not [ __ ] going not

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.050
yet I'm not going it yet mmm weird you

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:43.920
know we're just talking about something

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.320
that makes sense yeah it was funny it

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.940
was funny hearing him and again maybe

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.620
this could be the fact that like you

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.600
know he's you know if you're not really

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.360
it takes a lot to be equipped you have

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.710
to be raised a certain way to be

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.390
equipped to like deal with women in like

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:58.250
a

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:01.010
100% feminist approved way so if you

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:03.230
miss out on those like crucial early

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.810
role models it's just a lady yelling at

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:07.370
you and you're like shut up shut the

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:09.380
[ __ ] up shut the [ __ ] up and then

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.340
someone's like you shouldn't do that

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.250
yeah it's like I don't know whatever I'm

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.050
[ __ ] I'm going off on a tangent I

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:15.740
like it

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.240
what are those goddamn Germans doing in

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.920
that cave Oh

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:22.820
so the so they're hermit cavers these

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.440
people came over and they they were like

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.180
a religious sect who just lived off the

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.130
land and use plants and stuff obviously

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:30.590
we're [ __ ] tripping off what uh like

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:33.920
when interim 1800s or it came - yeah

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.510
came in there feeling like the 1800s I

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.310
believe yeah and just chilled in the

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:39.320
woods and [ __ ] lived off the land did

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.640
their thing I think one of the prominent

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.210
families in that area still comes from

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:46.010
that hole and they're named after not

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:48.650
hermit there's another street up there I

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:50.330
think they like named after that family

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:51.890
see I kind of embedded it in

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:53.390
Philadelphia and they became like you

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:55.520
know part of the that's where a lot of

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.710
that Rosicrucian kind of like Benjamin

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.150
Franklin's secret society [ __ ] comes

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:00.860
from I think he was earlier that he

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.370
would have been yeah but yeah but the

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.900
but yeah the Rosicrucian story I read

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.910
was based so there again from his book

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:10.610
their worldview is that so you know like

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:12.290
was there any magic in the cave of

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:14.270
course there were eating plants and

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:15.590
having like you know they were living

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.060
off the land and doing all kinds of wild

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:19.340
[ __ ] there what was the magic it's a

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:21.320
secret society dude I don't know I'd

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.180
have to get inducted into it but the

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.100
rows of crew here I can tell you though

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.720
because again I read the Rosicrucian

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.640
tale I've read between the lines because

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.900
when you read kind of texts when you

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.780
read texts like that she can utilize you

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.700
can't take him face value true they tell

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.410
you that so like this is allegory don't

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:37.700
read if you try to read between lines

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.530
that's just a filter out fourth

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:40.730
dimensional entities if you're six

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:42.470
traditional you can start being like

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:44.630
okay put this forth in six dimensional

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:47.630
India of world the [ __ ] one the one

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:51.520
creator of the universe a donae anyway

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:58.390
[Laughter]

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:01.130
macro Dosan no dude I miss reading

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:02.780
channeled material dude what surprise

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:06.740
nothing get into it it's [ __ ] good so

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:09.320
the so in the Rosicrucian this is a noni

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.520
book I've been reading for like three

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.630
months I should bring

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:13.010
to school and people who look at it like

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:14.890
what the [ __ ] is that

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:20.180
but the so this is I think this is the

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.100
belief of like you know I guess would

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.900
would be like you know certain mystics

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.380
of I guess like the 17th century was

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.360
that it was like a Christian sect who

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.700
didn't believe in like the Old Testament

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.770
God per se well they did but it was like

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:35.270
totally different to where so like say

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.520
like you know like a leaf has like a

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.810
drop of water and in that drop of water

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.220
there's just like a tons of either as a

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.590
whole you know billions of cells and all

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.330
that stuff and then you know the belief

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.830
is that it just scales out so then like

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:47.600
we're people we're on a bigger we're

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.770
just part of a bigger system and the

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:50.840
idea that that kind of like

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.810
magnification stops it out or stops dead

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:56.000
at outer space is there back then

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.500
they're like that's so dumb things this

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.820
is like during the French Revolution

00:24:58.820 --> 00:24:59.840
kind of when people started pushing

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.610
atheism real hard and they're like no

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:03.530
you guys are idiots religious zealots

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:05.360
don't have the full picture this is

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.130
what's going on and so they're they

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:09.590
theorized that within outer space there

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:11.780
was just different life forms that we

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:12.830
couldn't see that but they're still

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:15.560
there but if you were to like they like

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.760
you know did it a lot to ate a lot of

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.990
plants they would get themselves into a

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.090
trance and then the idea was you could

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:21.830
channel these extra dimensional entities

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.230
but you there's a lot of bad ones out

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:25.910
there this is a [ __ ] Alex Jones talks

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:26.990
about how people channel

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:28.940
extra-dimensional like all this other

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.860
kind of [ __ ] so saying you could channel

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:32.300
these things if you're in the right mind

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.740
state if you were like if you're able to

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.690
do it but if you face them with less

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:38.990
than perfect courage they'll ruin you so

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:40.010
if you're if you're there you're gonna

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:41.930
transfer channel on these things and

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:44.090
you're not totally like begone because

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:45.260
they'll [ __ ] haunt you so if you're

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.750
not if you don't if you don't meet them

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:49.700
with perfect that's the whole thing with

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.170
the dweller on the threshold is you hit

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:52.880
the threshold if you hit the threshold

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.310
with anything left and perfect blind

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:57.980
faith in Adonai the [ __ ] one creator

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.050
dude these things just chew you up and

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:01.370
[ __ ] you up and the only way you can get

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:02.860
away from it is by running around

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.420
merriment [ __ ] around then there's

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.250
you know the things like the the

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.720
guardians are the threshold that come to

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.250
haunt you after you enter a trance State

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:12.140
they'll keep bothering you but if you

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.490
just hit them you're like go back to

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:15.380
your place I don't I'll be but then you

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:17.120
know a donate floats down it's like yo

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.160
sup bro well then what happens when you

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.110
get in there oh you just you know the

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:22.970
secrets of the universe you're able to

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:24.440
move in a way that like most people

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.100
can't

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.600
in this story these guys were two

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.980
immortals who did this so you know again

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:31.070
it's allegory but does anybody know the

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:34.340
secrets of the universe who knows I mean

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.130
rah basically but it wasn't it wasn't

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:38.330
even like that I don't think it that

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:40.640
seriously but to me there's something to

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.200
be said for being able to hit a trance

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.880
state and not bugging out and wimpin out

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.770
and the insights you can get from a

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.179
trance state again like channel material

00:26:47.179 --> 00:26:49.460
even obviously if it wasn't like the the

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:52.010
Egyptian Sun God talking to this lady if

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.570
someone can get into a state where they

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:57.110
produce five volumes of books I'm

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:58.840
impressed

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.190
tons of literature and some of it a lot

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:03.620
of insights gibberish I don't know some

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.059
of it's pretty cool some of it is jib

00:27:05.059 --> 00:27:06.860
some of it is like cuz technically we've

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.740
produced five volumes of gibberish it's

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.390
[ __ ] good though and have I not been

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:14.720
in a trance the entire time I've been in

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.820
a trance for a few episodes and they've

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.700
come back to haunt me you should claim

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.289
that was channel material I was

00:27:21.289 --> 00:27:23.980

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:26.480

and then eventually you memorize the

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:15.560
different cards and you're able to pull

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.000
them up in your mind at any time and

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.410
you're just like one of the cards in the

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:21.250
tarot deck is the black race by the way

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:23.030
really you suppose every now and again

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:27.710
channel the black race like wwww black

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:29.390
race still and really cuz they're like

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.250
the guy was explaining like they're very

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.200
strong group you channel them every now

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.820
and again like what the [ __ ] am i [ __ ] I

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.550
got to tap into it you got tap into your

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.770
blackness dude I'm going to Terran don't

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:41.960
happen in it according to Tarot exactly

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.090
dude I did it today I was consulted my

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:46.040
[ __ ] butt lift guy I'm like bro I'm

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.400
I'm talking about well no he was just

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.680
like nah dude his message was cute I

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.880
thought it was pure dude it was like

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.580
just be yourself don't you again dude

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.590
that's the drawer on the threshold you

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:59.930
cannot you cannot confront the [ __ ]

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:01.910
feminine psyche with anything less than

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:03.580
perfect [ __ ] courage and faith

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.900
because if you if you falter at all

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.270
though if they will [ __ ] pop in there

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.750
and be like what will they do to you

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:13.730
manipulate you my theory is and again

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:16.310
I'm sorry if this hurts they're like

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:18.080
sheep and you got to be a sheepdog not

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.310
even dude I would leave the Sheep

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:21.860
alright I think it's more like they're

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:24.260
just for the most part and dudes are too

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.960
but it's like I don't know man it's like

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.550
I was telling someone the other day like

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:30.740
in terms of like we're talking about

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:31.970
like insecurity someone was saying

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:34.340
something about like oh it's so annoying

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.260
like with like waiting for them to get

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:37.700
ready there it was like some like stock

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.310
kind of thing and [ __ ] what are they

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:41.540
complaining about exactly it was like

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.910
make up and it's like yeah dude I hear

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:45.140
you're saying you have to understand

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:48.230
it's like like looks to them it's like

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:49.610
you know they don't have like the penis

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:50.570
hang-up

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:52.169
but like their looks

00:30:52.169 --> 00:30:54.450
the chicks hot that's a dude that would

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:56.190
be like to equate the feeling they get

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:58.109
in my opinion would be like if a dude

00:30:58.109 --> 00:30:59.309
was like a waiter came up and just

00:30:59.309 --> 00:31:00.869
flopped like a soft date on the table

00:31:00.869 --> 00:31:01.980
was like what's up guys and you'd have

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.340
to be like so I'm like you have to

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:06.450
understand like they're dealing with

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:08.249
competition on a scale that like you

00:31:08.249 --> 00:31:10.200
can't [ __ ] imagine so I'm like

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.389
there's this constant like push to kind

00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:15.869
of you know be part of the winning group

00:31:15.869 --> 00:31:18.480
that if you you know you can fall into

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.190
the chess game of that unless you're

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:22.739
totally like no bobble you know does

00:31:22.739 --> 00:31:24.539
that make sense yeah you can be reworked

00:31:24.539 --> 00:31:26.249
if you're if you approach them that's

00:31:26.249 --> 00:31:28.200
just kind of like I'm just here for the

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:28.769
ride

00:31:28.769 --> 00:31:30.960
you'll wake up a different dude in six

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.159
months if you're not constantly like

00:31:32.159 --> 00:31:33.509
whoa chill will chill of course there's

00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:35.389
exceptions to that but that can't happen

00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:38.489
yeah you must check your [ __ ] you must

00:31:38.489 --> 00:31:40.350
dude you must [ __ ] total faith you

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:41.909
must come to that guardian and be like

00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:44.820
be going yeah now you're gone evil sniz

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.100
I think reveal yourself as a nice woman

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:52.559
I know you are be a sweet baby stop

00:31:52.559 --> 00:32:04.980
telling me what to do smoking much we

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:07.169
either really not a lot dude I'm telling

00:32:07.169 --> 00:32:09.869
you I save it for when I can have three

00:32:09.869 --> 00:32:11.639
hours blocked off and I hit the couch

00:32:11.639 --> 00:32:15.299
and you black it total trash if I'm kind

00:32:15.299 --> 00:32:16.499
of scared dude I'm scared for I was

00:32:16.499 --> 00:32:19.080
gonna call me dude if I close you I'll

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.460
have to listen dude if I get channeled

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.049
it that's the other thing too like takes

00:32:22.049 --> 00:32:23.399
a toll on you physically if you can get

00:32:23.399 --> 00:32:25.230
down as the proof they had the lady got

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:27.029
expand up getting like wicked arthritis

00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:29.249
apparently because it takes a toll you

00:32:29.249 --> 00:32:30.450
get his channel where he's been getting

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:36.179
channels got the arthritis if the whole

00:32:36.179 --> 00:32:37.619
time he was just being channeled the

00:32:37.619 --> 00:32:38.940
whole thing if his voice actually was

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:42.139
like hey guys what's going on he's like

00:32:42.499 --> 00:32:46.080
yeah the threshold thing is yeah taller

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.609
the threshold is my [ __ ] that's

00:32:47.609 --> 00:32:49.350
something like if it doesn't I hear what

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:50.789
you're saying but the allegorical thing

00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:53.039
part like nature of it it doesn't

00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:54.809
necessarily need to be a trance it could

00:32:54.809 --> 00:32:57.119
just be life true know you need to face

00:32:57.119 --> 00:32:58.799
on your [ __ ] problems just with the

00:32:58.799 --> 00:33:00.629
utmost confidence the author would agree

00:33:00.629 --> 00:33:02.519
dude yeah there's no strict again this

00:33:02.519 --> 00:33:04.320
stuff is I think it needs to be post

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.469
volcano bag

00:33:05.469 --> 00:33:08.779
true you know 100% but again if you

00:33:08.779 --> 00:33:10.849
don't if that's not an ingrained that's

00:33:10.849 --> 00:33:13.279
just me I'm like five dimensions you

00:33:13.279 --> 00:33:14.899
might be semi dimensional bro

00:33:14.899 --> 00:33:17.179
you true you might be seven trip every

00:33:17.179 --> 00:33:18.739
seven I might be past all that it goes

00:33:18.739 --> 00:33:20.509
up to eight and repeats on another scale

00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:22.159
just like a home one just like a musical

00:33:22.159 --> 00:33:24.079
scale I'm gonna one do not wanna pass

00:33:24.079 --> 00:33:27.619
eight unrepeated oh you're live

00:33:27.619 --> 00:33:29.119
I mean I've already passed it well one

00:33:29.119 --> 00:33:33.019
dimensional is just the is like well

00:33:33.019 --> 00:33:34.609
yeah one dimensional is just like a

00:33:34.609 --> 00:33:36.739
literal like a rock and then in a plant

00:33:36.739 --> 00:33:38.089
is a two-dimensional where if you're

00:33:38.089 --> 00:33:39.679
just striving towards light that's a

00:33:39.679 --> 00:33:41.570
plant three-dimensional someone who can

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:43.489
self reflect and we're right now as a

00:33:43.489 --> 00:33:44.809
planet we're like in the fourth

00:33:44.809 --> 00:33:46.309
dimension but you know we're having some

00:33:46.309 --> 00:33:47.539
tough times getting all the way there

00:33:47.539 --> 00:33:48.769
but yeah hopefully you can move up

00:33:48.769 --> 00:33:49.940
there's what would be the fourth

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:53.989
dimension uh it would be so being

00:33:53.989 --> 00:33:55.789
self-aware and then having a bent

00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:57.889
towards service using your self-aware

00:33:57.889 --> 00:34:00.259
nature and then forcing that all towards

00:34:00.259 --> 00:34:02.059
the realm of service so that you know we

00:34:02.059 --> 00:34:07.190
can use like nurses yeah also yeah

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:12.279
basically be [ __ ] little nurses which

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:20.690
damn yeah was a different week for us

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:24.619
you and I oh yeah dude oh [ __ ] yeah I

00:34:24.619 --> 00:34:27.169
mean right now I'm on again I'm on a

00:34:27.169 --> 00:34:29.779
Productivity kick that's like oh dude

00:34:29.779 --> 00:34:31.609
it's it doesn't stop I wake up in the

00:34:31.609 --> 00:34:34.399
morning and have a little whiteboard so

00:34:34.399 --> 00:34:36.409
I have my four core tasks of the day the

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:38.059
things I have to do every single day to

00:34:38.059 --> 00:34:39.529
like you know this is the stuff I like

00:34:39.529 --> 00:34:41.480
to do every single day and like I make

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.889

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:44.779
other other stuff so it's like I wake up

00:34:44.779 --> 00:34:46.970

00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:48.349
to do these things and here's the

00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:49.579
obligations I have to get done that

00:34:49.579 --> 00:34:51.349
exists outside of that so it helps me

00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:53.089
insulate my day to not get caught up in

00:34:53.089 --> 00:34:54.859
doing like spending too much time on

00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:56.299
stuff that to me doesn't really matter

00:34:56.299 --> 00:34:58.339
yeah so I've been [ __ ] there's been

00:34:58.339 --> 00:34:59.390
fun that's nice

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:01.609
i dude I use every minute like of my day

00:35:01.609 --> 00:35:04.700

what is what do you do like what for

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:09.529
example my fork or tests or I have to

00:35:09.529 --> 00:35:11.000
work out I have to meditate have to

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.980
write after read outside of that I don't

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:16.250
give a [ __ ] what I do so it's like you

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:17.750
know then the other than that it's like

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:19.310
my responsibility

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:20.540
then I try to balance it all with like

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:22.760
stuff on yeah I like to do as well so

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.990

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.110
doing that's been I've been getting

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.600
super pumped on is visualizing my energy

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.630

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:50.480
it up in the air and spinning real fast

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.920
and like giving off light and I do not

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.290

you don't talk about visualizing my

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:07.460
visualize you visualize your internal

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:08.840
energy center and you just go like what

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:09.860
am I feeling right now and you're like

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:12.830

height and you just imagine it floating

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:18.710
off the ground getting real fast get

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:19.190
crunk

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:20.690

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.869
this is [ __ ] up there was a part in

00:44:01.869 --> 00:44:04.850
the rocco Magnotta thing where because

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:06.170
they have the surveillance footage from

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:08.660
I mean they had the murders online you

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.310

00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:12.980
surveillance footage of him walking

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.080
in with the guy he murdered but then the

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.550
footage of him walking back out he's

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:17.960
wearing the shirt that the dude was

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:20.060
wearing was pretty creepy to watch and

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:21.380
then he goes to the store to buy like

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:22.880
cleaning supplies and then while he's

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.350

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:26.720
a mirror and like adjusts his hair it's

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.490
really [ __ ] creepy to watch oh yeah

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:31.190
having just done like cut a guy's arms

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:34.190
and legs apart off and like the rest of

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:35.990
the torso against the bathtub and was

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:38.750
playing with the head in the bathtub on

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:41.690

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:48.800
true

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.750
could someone her mom believes there's

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:52.760
someone else and in her defense in the

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.500
snake video there is another set of

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.720
hands which they never really addressed

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.810
in the documentary really just brought

00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:01.930
it up I was like there's another guy

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:03.859
fair point I don't think at the end of

00:45:03.859 --> 00:45:06.619
the thing it ever there was ever any

00:45:06.619 --> 00:45:10.480
closure on that I kind of fell asleep

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.090
that's funny watch so it was really good

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:15.619
but then I mean we watched the whole

00:45:15.619 --> 00:45:18.859
thing in one night so bees are no comic

00:45:18.859 --> 00:45:20.570
making a murderer it was like five

00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:22.790
episodes I kind of stopped that what

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:24.859
making things like nine [ __ ] hours

00:45:24.859 --> 00:45:26.510
yeah there was a lot they could have

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:28.730
done without firstly dude for sure

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:30.680
they just [ __ ] come yeah boil it down

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.350
guys cuz it's just like a I know what do

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:34.760
a five episode deal with Netflix like

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.470
this could be to [ __ ] out yes

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:39.050
cut the [ __ ] cut it out you ever hear of

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:41.840
a thing called [ __ ] editing you tell

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.810
me chop it up dude dude so you got you

00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:46.940
got raw you got robbed bumping around in

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:48.619
that old knock knock contact is pretty

00:45:48.619 --> 00:45:50.270
tight when they talk when they started I

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:52.520
was kind of listening I was dream I'm

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:53.869
listening to do it on my guy this is

00:45:53.869 --> 00:45:55.130
kind of [ __ ] and then they're like

00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:57.460
there's six dimensional entities who

00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:00.200
typically suffer from because they're

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:02.330
incompatible with like this particular

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:04.580
earth time-space Distortion do the

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:06.530
[ __ ] language from it's so funny the

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:08.930
what are they the mind/body/spirit

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:12.470
complex known as john mckean manera it's

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:14.330
so the way the guy talked dude that

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:16.700
thing there's like a whole lexicon they

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:18.500
came out with that I'm like that'd be

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:18.890
weird

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:21.410
just to be like spit ball on that yeah

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:23.060
being able to stay in - it was

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:25.490
apparently they have tapes of it so it's

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:26.610
like I

00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:28.500
but then the guy was also saying like oh

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:29.760
this was a physicist I looked these

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.360
people up is like UFO researchers uh

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.200
yeah I think you're getting into that

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:37.740
realm it really seems like it's complete

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:40.110
[ __ ] well I know that but I like I

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:42.000
approach these more as psychic

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.920
phenomenon you don't I mean so I'm not

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.570
being like oh my god of course I don't

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:47.220
think you do was there

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:48.750
channeled material I didn't know there's

00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:50.820
a thing there's there's the equator

00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:52.800
there is another channeled material yeah

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.290
technically that's the Bible exactly

00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:56.430
that's what I was saying the Bible's

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:58.290
technically channel material yeah which

00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:00.480
is that's funny to think about that's

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.550
that's what it's the Holy Spirit God in

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:04.140
your hands virgos bow

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.510
it's a logos bro goes the Holy Spirit

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:08.460
God's this podcast [ __ ] rules dude

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.770
yeah of course we're tapped into logo

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:13.740
stood the so what wait your were you

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:16.200
asking me oh so when I was reading it or

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.790
whatever listen to him that's a good

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:19.800
audible book to you by the way that's a

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.050
good one I wasn't doing the plane to but

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:25.470
the so they're talking about I was kind

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:26.910
of like yeah I'm not really sold on this

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:29.100
and they will six-dimensional there's

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:30.240
like there ask me how many six

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.370
dimensional Wanderers are there blah

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:34.260
blah blah and they're lay there I forgot

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:35.340
the number they said it's pretty low

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.050
which you know is unfortunate but do you

00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:39.450
think you would be one obviously dude

00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:40.620
because they were like hat like how do

00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:42.420
you tell they're like typically they

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:43.620
have problems fitting into this

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:45.780
particular earth time vibration and

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:47.790
there's feelings of alienation I was

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:49.770
like check will you talk about everyone

00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:52.110

you feel lonely and somewhat wonder

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:08.160
six-dimensional do you try vibrating on

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.420
the six dimensional frequency

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:11.670
I don't feel necessary well do you feel

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:14.670

dude dumping places I'm literally afraid

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.600
to take a dump this is a rough one

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:20.950
especially it was a one

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:23.950
there's tons of traffic colors mint

00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:26.350
walls and [ __ ] and it was a single

00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:28.990
bathroom at like a truck exactly yeah so

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:31.720
what when I got in there was no one in

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:33.490
line of course took a dove when I

00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:35.260
over-the-door O'Connor was in the front

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:36.700
but there was like three or four truck

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:39.910
drivers behind Connors that they were

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:42.010
furious the whole the whole time I was

00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:51.400
in there [ __ ] [ __ ] and piss as bad

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.860
as a human being possibly [ __ ] piss yeah

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:56.920
I was in there just cuz no no kindly

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.110
offer no one tried to open the door it

00:52:59.110 --> 00:53:00.940
was long it's kind of plain yeah but

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:02.620
that's how I would know someone was in

00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:04.720
line O'Connor was your [ __ ] O'Connor

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.190
said I knew I was in there so he didn't

00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:07.290
try to open the door

00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:08.490
so I didn't think anyone was out there

00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:10.440
and I was just see you were taking your

00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.750
time I was just checking my vfo just

00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:13.950
checking reddit how long do you think

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:17.910
you were done before 10:00 that's a long

00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:22.410
that's it's a longer yeah yeah it was it

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:23.490
was long enough that there were three or

00:53:23.490 --> 00:53:24.900
four dudes that were upset

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:26.070
I'm surprised O'Connor didn't let the

00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:27.150
truckers go in front of him ultimately

00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:29.220

00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:36.060
hide the fact that I jerked off in there

00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:38.340
for like I'd probably lasted 10 minutes

00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:39.810

00:58:44.550 --> 00:58:45.720
right when I know that I made the bees

00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:47.790
or noise started laughing I was like

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:49.230

00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:55.650
[ __ ] reddit dude yeah dude that's the

00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:56.940

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:36.860
Olympics he doesn't he does basically uh

01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:39.150
he calls him oral presentations but he

01:08:39.150 --> 01:08:41.400
does like a history cast okay on the

01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:43.860
1904 Olympics strictly not he's big in a

01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:46.200
world war two isn't he he is big in the

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.460
world he's big in the history but the

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:49.410
way he gets his history is he watches

01:08:49.410 --> 01:08:51.450
first off all he does is watch YouTube

01:08:51.450 --> 01:08:53.340
he doesn't watch anything else he

01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:56.370
watches YouTube from like 9:00 p.m. to

01:08:56.370 --> 01:08:59.670
like 4:00 a.m. yeah like top 10 scariest

01:08:59.670 --> 01:09:03.120
houses he's the guy watching those you

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:05.160
know those [ __ ] [ __ ] countdown

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:09.630
videos like 23 minutes long would on a

01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:11.940
mattress in a shitty room in Philly is

01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:14.250
the guy watching that oh my god but yeah

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:15.510
the first one was actually really really

01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:18.450
funny that's awesome man I am alone is

01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:21.390
him alone reading this dude so funny

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:24.270
thing he calls the fire festival the FYE

01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:26.010
festival throughout the whole thing you

01:09:26.010 --> 01:09:27.180
remember the fire festival the guy who

01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:28.589
had that yeah

01:09:28.589 --> 01:09:30.000
oh the FYE if you think I think he

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.080
thought that's what it was called it

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:34.650
slightly it's really great to hear war

01:09:34.650 --> 01:09:37.739
FYE he calls it the FYE festival why and

01:09:37.739 --> 01:09:39.239
that's what I thought it was at first I

01:09:39.239 --> 01:09:40.710
didn't realize he was [ __ ] up

01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:43.020
I thought he meant the FYE like the

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:44.759
store that sells like electronics right

01:09:44.759 --> 01:09:46.319
yeah that's what I thought yeah fire

01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:49.109
festival was not the FYE is for your

01:09:49.109 --> 01:09:51.750
entertainment I believe yeah well maybe

01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:53.969
he got a write the hit I don't think

01:09:53.969 --> 01:09:57.780
they were that wasn't FYI he's no know

01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:01.949
what he's talking about is the guy there

01:10:01.949 --> 01:10:04.469
was a Booker who who was trying to set

01:10:04.469 --> 01:10:07.230
up like a fare type thing in st. Louis

01:10:07.230 --> 01:10:09.599
which is where the Olympics were that

01:10:09.599 --> 01:10:11.489
was like a look at all these new

01:10:11.489 --> 01:10:13.290
inventions type thing like a World Fair

01:10:13.290 --> 01:10:14.610
that's why it kind of made sense to me

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:17.040
that he was saying FYE yeah but then it

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:18.780
turns out he was just trying to say fire

01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:21.599
festival because he was making fun of a

01:10:21.599 --> 01:10:24.599
bad book or putting together like I was

01:10:24.599 --> 01:10:25.980
giving him the benefit of down being

01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:29.699
like yeah yeah FIU festival I listened

01:10:29.699 --> 01:10:33.409
to it with BZ and he's like walking 80

01:10:33.409 --> 01:10:36.570
yeah I might buy some stock in FYE it's

01:10:36.570 --> 01:10:38.310
a cutting-edge company dude DVDs

01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:42.449
magazines CDs they're all coming back

01:10:42.449 --> 01:10:45.210

01:10:45.210 --> 01:10:47.429
DVDs they're still in the mall right I

01:10:47.429 --> 01:10:49.730
don't know I haven't seen one in a while

01:10:49.730 --> 01:10:51.690
dude you have you been to like none of

01:10:51.690 --> 01:10:53.070
the [ __ ] mall oh no I went to the

01:10:53.070 --> 01:10:53.670
mall

01:10:53.670 --> 01:10:55.199

discuss it exactly I mean it just goes

01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:11.820
without saying so stoked oh no it's

01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:14.489
weird to with the malls so if you have a

01:11:14.489 --> 01:11:16.380
mall the stores are all inside those

01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:18.420
buildings are failing but if you just

01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:20.909
take them all and put them outside in a

01:11:20.909 --> 01:11:23.040
strip of stores now like that you know

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.630
like the nice shopping plasmas or

01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:26.699
whatever they're crushing it but like

01:11:26.699 --> 01:11:28.800
indoor malls know if you put them

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.050
outside and put a fountain outside

01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:32.159
crushes dude and like a Moe's Southwest

01:11:32.159 --> 01:11:36.469
Grill it's you kill it I went to in

01:11:36.469 --> 01:11:37.650
Worcester

01:11:37.650 --> 01:11:39.960
when I was there I went to a mall that

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.580
was abandoned

01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:44.070
like every single store had been gone

01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:46.860

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:56.640
Oh Ross that was like TJ Maxx was still

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:59.610

01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:09.660
like every it was crazy

01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:11.040
it's awkward dude weird to see like a

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.290
failing economy the granite run mall was

01:12:13.290 --> 01:12:15.570

hand the ball to the ref Christmas is

01:31:17.130 --> 01:31:19.110
big-time hot dog that's like being down

01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:20.880
by 10:00 still dancing after you get a

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:23.460
sack I don't understand celebrating I

01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:24.230
mean come on

01:31:24.230 --> 01:31:27.090
yeah that's big-time hot dog I'm still I

01:31:27.090 --> 01:31:29.910
mean again I don't know that's gotta be

01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:31.260
tough I mean you got to have the guilt

01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:32.550
on you as a Jewish parent too like

01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:34.890
Christmas day to be like I know I'm

01:31:34.890 --> 01:31:36.710
saying they do they do that so

01:31:36.710 --> 01:31:39.080
they're hyping it up I think now it's

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:41.150
definitely more like give you a bunch of

01:31:41.150 --> 01:31:43.730
gifts look if you have like a Christmas

01:31:43.730 --> 01:31:47.390
Christmas month type thing gosh you

01:31:47.390 --> 01:31:51.080
think that yeah I don't know how I feel

01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:52.280
about that mmm

01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:54.020
appropriate I think they have

01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:55.940
appropriate you think we kind of jammed

01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:58.340
it down the throat but also straight

01:31:58.340 --> 01:32:01.430
appropriation what slight appropriation

01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:03.230
you thought you thing on there and it's

01:32:03.230 --> 01:32:04.670
a slight brokerage but also everyone

01:32:04.670 --> 01:32:07.400
really don't have a choice dude it's so

01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:10.010
irresistible dude I mean ask they must

01:32:10.010 --> 01:32:11.780
have kind of real at our pagan roots of

01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:14.960

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:16.430
the shoe out and all that stuff it must

01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:20.000
honestly probably a turn-off like this

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.560
is a [ __ ] this is all about the oil

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:25.280

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:26.420

01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:41.650
like Sultan now give me the shove I

01:40:41.650 --> 01:40:43.030
would take a shot with a good team

dude we put mg DS in the snow we'd be

01:40:45.190 --> 01:40:46.840
smoking hash getting [ __ ] up I would

01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:48.340
stay up all night and then we would just

01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:50.590

01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.340
like our soggy little snow clothes then

01:40:57.340 --> 01:40:58.630
we'd have to go back out that next

01:40:58.630 --> 01:40:59.830
morning I was like dude it felt like I

01:40:59.830 --> 01:41:00.880

01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:01.390

01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:10.360
we're getting paid decently but like -

01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:12.460
this guy was probably kidding I mean

01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:16.030
looking back like shovel and 14 miles of

01:41:16.030 --> 01:41:17.890
neighborhood especially when snow hits a

01:41:17.890 --> 01:41:19.480
certain part like a certain height it

01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:21.160
becomes like I think it's like emergency

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:23.410
levels and through the money you the

01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:25.840
cost of plow it is so [ __ ] much yeah

01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:27.790
dude there's like these are like we're

01:41:27.790 --> 01:41:29.980
like 18 19 year-old bulls - just out

01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:32.410

fun times the best while it's snowing

01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:41.590
that's nice out there drinking I told

01:41:41.590 --> 01:41:43.030
you the one time when Ajax was the boss

01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:45.550
right no I never told you about this no

01:41:45.550 --> 01:41:47.680
dude so we were like you know I hadn't

01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:48.820
shovel and I was out of the shoveling

01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:49.960
game for well every now and again may

01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:51.910
remember Ajax from the old testament yes

01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:56.590
a guy who shot a goose threw a baseball

01:41:56.590 --> 01:42:00.190
bat at my head the poured water on him

01:42:00.190 --> 01:42:03.580
yeah he was going to the Javan this is

01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:05.350
old testament so he was going to my

01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:07.030
cousin Ajax is going to a job interview

01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:09.310
at Wawa you [ __ ] eaters we're like his

01:42:09.310 --> 01:42:11.230

01:42:13.390 --> 01:42:16.660
here he's like what a bucket of water

01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:23.650
and threw it on the interview I think he

01:42:23.650 --> 01:42:25.180
might change his time gonna change to

01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:26.890
like a [ __ ] Megadeth but he probably

01:42:26.890 --> 01:42:29.650
had an alternate but he picked up a

01:42:29.650 --> 01:42:31.600
metal bat and just walking at us I

01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:32.680
remember hitting the deck and this thing

01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:34.690
whizzed over us being like I am reaction

01:42:34.690 --> 01:42:38.470
time I was like that's what's up dude

01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:39.720

01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:42.400
Ajax was leading the plow to so that yes

01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:43.659
