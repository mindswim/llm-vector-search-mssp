00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.120

00:10:04.079 --> 00:10:06.320
bran got in that [ __ ] dragon's dome i

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.600
was thinking about that was that you

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.279
said that to me no i was thinking about

00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:09.760
that though

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.800
they should have showed you might you

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.839
might have actually just picked up on

00:10:11.839 --> 00:10:13.360
some of my thoughts because i was like

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.600
maybe [ __ ] brand but again

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.959
that sort of at least showed that if

00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:18.880
that was the case a brand

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.480
channeling instead of us having to like

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.160
make it better

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.720
for the writers you know i think this is

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.320
writers using ai you just throw out like

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.839
a shitty version of a story and then

00:10:27.839 --> 00:10:28.800
people just come up with a better

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.600
version you're like

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.360
go with that yeah yeah that's what we

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.600
did that's what the books were yeah the

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.800
reason the dragon all of a sudden

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.040
understood politics

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.519
was that was bran i mean that would have

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:41.200
been [ __ ] tight

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.560
i mean everyone should they should have

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.079
had like everybody die at the end

00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:48.720
but yeah whatever again i wish the

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.600
mountain would have won

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.360
and taking control dude beat everyone

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.399

00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:53.120
be fantastic

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.120

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.760
bayonet on a rifle i'd have a little

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.279

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.720
friction wait how are we lining up

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.639
uh i'm just are we like scissoring legs

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:23.600
like that i mean we could be like

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.480
forming a t

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.839
you could be laying down sitting like

00:14:25.839 --> 00:14:27.040
you're sitting in the grass and i could

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.880
be squatting power throw so my ass is in

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.839
your face

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.199
my ass is or we could lay side to side

00:14:35.199 --> 00:14:36.959
and power thrust from the side together

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:38.639
we could put like our like three-legged

00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:39.839
race like we're doing a three-legged

00:14:39.839 --> 00:14:40.880
race and power

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.440
oh i see yeah i don't have enough i mean

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.079
i haven't really ever

00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:47.040
gotten into a double what's it called

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:47.600
dynamics

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.360
double vaginal present there's like that

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.720
double penetrate what

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.240
it's called double vaginal penetration

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.600
i've never really studied it that much

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.160
i'd have to

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.320
study up i never got into it every time

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.000
there was a porno that i think that

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.680
you could just like play spider on the

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.360
swings what do you mean

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.560
do you ever play spider when like you

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.040
sit like like i would sit on the swing

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.720
and then you would like cross your legs

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.800
over me and we'd swing together

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.199
no it's called playing spider okay the

00:15:11.199 --> 00:15:12.560
girls used to do it i never did it in

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.440
grade school

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.800
okay the girls would play spiders so it

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.000
was like one would swing the other would

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.360
sit on them the opposite way and they'd

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.800
swing back and forth but if we sat

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.160
spider style our donks would perfectly

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.839
align and we'd both be bottom to bottom

00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:25.040
so it would be a lot

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.720
um we'd both be getting that feeling

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.720
that underneath friction

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.079
wow that's all that's that's a show dude

00:15:32.079 --> 00:15:33.519

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.919
like epic battle scenes or like here's

00:17:35.919 --> 00:17:37.120

they basically did they shot a first

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.840
draft they're like well

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.760

this box [ __ ] show up

00:17:55.919 --> 00:17:57.840
people doing it the amount of like that

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.440
how much they all hated it the directors

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.480
are probably sick of it

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.080
imagine having to do that for years be

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.080
like we all from the north

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.600
eventually probably oh my god dude that

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.200
sounds like a [ __ ] idiot

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.480
i still never got over the midget's

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.000
accent who

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.280
it wasn't even like british what was

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.799
like a weird [ __ ] shakespeare

00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:20.480
don't know like i don't know what the

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.120
[ __ ] his accent was the whole time

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.559
it was like that's not an accent

00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:26.480
everybody else had like like people from

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.760
the north were like scottish

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.679
everybody had like a british accent and

00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:31.120
then this guy just he might have been

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:31.919
speaking midge

00:18:31.919 --> 00:18:33.840
he it could have been midge that's why

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.520

marvel thing where after the credits

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.760

went to a show

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.680
and this is the exact skill i'm talking

00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:37.359
about of like you hit a negative

00:58:37.359 --> 00:58:39.200
thought hole and you can completely

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.400
shark it off

00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:43.280
well this was negative this was caffeine

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:43.920
induced

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.160
true but it was like it was a panic

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:47.520
attack oh for sure

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:50.880

all the movies 75 bucks

01:09:12.159 --> 01:09:13.759
uh i was just watching a nice little

01:09:13.759 --> 01:09:15.920
flick before uh where'd you watch it

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.839
i was watching no it's on netflix it's

01:09:17.839 --> 01:09:19.920
about this clearly gay autistic guy that

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:20.960
uh

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:24.239
figured out all the prices right prices

01:09:24.239 --> 01:09:25.920
what like he was that obsessed with

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:28.400
prices clearly gay or clearly autistic

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.880
both clearly gay you can be both really

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:32.000
i thought you said you were no

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.400
no [ __ ] guys are always straight

01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.560
there's gay autistic guys

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:37.920
he's definitely good autistic guys

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.880
imagine catching a hum off of that dude

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:44.640
perfection dude i mean this guy was like

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.120
it's great he's he's been like 30 prices

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.239
right tapings

01:09:48.239 --> 01:09:50.799
yeah and he he watches every price is

01:09:50.799 --> 01:09:52.799
right and then memorizes the prices of

01:09:52.799 --> 01:09:54.239
each product

01:09:54.239 --> 01:09:56.640
and had a spreadsheet in his house of

01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:57.440
every product

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.120
yes so then he would go to the show and

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.320
the first couple times he didn't get

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:00.960
picked

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:03.280
so he'd be in the back and he'd you can

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.560
see the footage from the shows where

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.000
he's just nailing the price

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.600
every single time like you know that

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:09.040
opening day yeah he was like a card

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.400
counter for [ __ ] prices

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.000
right and bob barker's like have you

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.280
watched the show how many times have you

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.560
watched the [ __ ] show

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.080
he's like a lot bark started getting a

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.520
little oh bartender's like what the [ __ ]

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.880
are you doing dude cause he kept yelling

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.320
out the correct answer in the back

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.560
every single time did he let him play

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.320
eventually he got to play but he got

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.440
[ __ ] on the wheel

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:26.800
he spun the wheel and didn't get to the

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.960
final showcase now i stopped watching i

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.320
think he gets another shot here

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.920
i think when barker retires because you

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.600
could only be picked once

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.440
parker is probably a heavy gatekeeper

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.960
against all tests

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.320
oh that's you have to be that's his

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.679
whole job it's like listen we're gonna

01:10:39.679 --> 01:10:41.440
put together a cool show that requires

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:42.800
like guessing numbers

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.800
the autists are going to be flying in

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.000
here that must be funny when they're

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.280
trying to like bust them like card

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.760
counters

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:50.960
they start counting they start like

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:52.480
naming the plants on the way in like

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:54.080
that's an arrangement

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:55.280
yeah you're not allowed in we got a

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.800
[ __ ] autistic we got an autistic kind

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.480
of come in here he's gonna ruin the show

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.320
for wheel of fortune jeopardy a couple

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.760
autists have snuck in at jeopardy and

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:02.719
you gotta [ __ ]

01:11:02.719 --> 01:11:03.840
you gotta take them down most of the

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:06.000
winners of jeff are autists

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.920
a lot of lady artists yeah they can say

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:09.199
that that's what you speak

01:11:09.199 --> 01:11:11.760
lady autistics are weird you'll see like

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.040

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.560
wearing like a vest

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.080

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.600
vest yeah actually

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:18.960

like doing the like

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:43.199
final peace talks of like the christian

01:19:43.199 --> 01:19:44.480
american nation

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.719
and then like down and uh talking to

01:19:46.719 --> 01:19:48.239
like saudi arabia and then like having

01:19:48.239 --> 01:19:48.560

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.400
explain like what doc like wait what is

this ducking and you're like well okay

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:52.560
so when a guy

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:54.800
folds his for that would just be a short

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.159
circuit

01:19:56.159 --> 01:19:57.600
like an honorable teacher dude learned

01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:59.600
about a [ __ ] what docking is and the

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:00.880
fact that it exists it would

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.640
[ __ ] on so many levels that'll piss away

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:03.920
i mean it would justify everything they

01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:04.880
were doing

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:06.320
they'd instantly be like oh yeah well

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:08.159
we're right yeah terrorism is correct we

01:20:08.159 --> 01:20:09.600
need to terrorize more these guys are

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:10.400
docking

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:11.920
yes we need to do whatever we can what

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:13.440
is that oh yeah dude

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:14.560
you think there are there's definitely

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.960
guys that don't know what it is

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:18.639
yeah there's a lot of people listening

01:20:18.639 --> 01:20:20.159
to this don't know what docking is true

01:20:20.159 --> 01:20:20.719
that

01:20:20.719 --> 01:20:21.760
but if you went over there and you're

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:23.120
like guys look here's what they're up to

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.719
over there that in itself would just be

01:20:24.719 --> 01:20:26.560
like what the [ __ ] yeah we need to stop

01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:27.440
this empire

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:30.560
this evil empire of docking of dudes

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.080
[ __ ] shoving [ __ ]

01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:35.360

get out of that do you think i mean i'm

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.280
sure it feels

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:39.360
pretty good to dock anything on the tip

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:40.880

fun to do with your boys just kind of

01:20:46.159 --> 01:20:48.080
if you run into a thick enough hog like

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:49.280
a dude that's

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:51.199
uncert big you can probably stick your

01:20:51.199 --> 01:20:53.040
dick in it and just leave your [ __ ]

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:54.480

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.480
just you're just being a brat

01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:08.080

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.120
into a large dog

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.800
having some dude absorb your dong with

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:14.880
his dong i think that's just a game

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:16.239
something sexual about that i think

01:21:16.239 --> 01:21:18.159
