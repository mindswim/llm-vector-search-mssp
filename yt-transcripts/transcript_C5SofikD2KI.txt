00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.190
dice probably why I'm so electrified

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.620
right now my body still has extra

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.180
calories yeah I tried taking it I had

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.489
like a 4-minute now I was about 6 minute

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.019
your 6 minute window and you tried to

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:00.400
squeeze out dumped dumped in four

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.350
minutes pinch it off it was like I think

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.180
that was what was troubling me from the

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.500
night before so I had a bad case of

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.960
today I've had a bad ass honestly I've

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.030
had a salt yeah just like yeah just a

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.380
[ __ ] up I didn't make any casts all

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.149
day it's the worst and then I was like I

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:14.530
I took it dump before this something I

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.940
think this is a dump that's gonna solve

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.460
bring me back to baseline another

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.250
somehow bad ass and another half dump so

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.600
I think I've been taking like my dumps

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.460
have been like the that one flag from

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.350
like the 1700s or the snake section in

like so I've taken joiner down I don't

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.500

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.350
and then he cheated on his wife and then

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.480
he came forward and he goes I gotta do

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.740

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:22.300
saying okay so you know didn't everyone

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.690

personal life well he was man enough he

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.650

women actually don't man up to YouTube

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.240
his whole life is public theory so

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.350
people would have found out so I guess

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:36.340
you wanted to get ahead of it hear what

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.480
you're saying it's not really people's

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.420
like no sound only their biz then again

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.010
Bezos I mean it's kind of what comes

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.630
with the territory though Bezos got

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:46.240

says is you this has his fingerprints

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:55.180
all over although we probably did order

00:18:55.180 --> 00:19:00.010
most of this off yes I did actually yeah

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:04.450

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:09.550
call it what the [ __ ] was that uh there

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:11.320
oh so that we're talking about your

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.080
private life I read an article in the I

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.330
think it was it was even though it was

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:19.570
the Economist about women models who go

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:22.450
around the club scene yeah and then so

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:23.830
basically like you know so you own a

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.870
club right you have people who like you

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:26.920

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:29.860
people who have like just old money so

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:31.480
you would hire me as a club promoter and

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.060

all the models exactly I'm coming I mean

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.070

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:41.020
like my job would be to I'd go to start

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.370

they need to be super skinny because

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.249
they've analyzed like the bar tabs and

00:22:10.249 --> 00:22:11.989

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.110
nuts disgusting fats they're more

physique it's pretty nasty dude but you

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.770
know that and again it ties into all the

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:12.850
[ __ ] that you know like people getting

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:15.010

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:16.680

bro he was going for young I might and

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:22.870

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:26.680
slam the dude it's like you know did

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.970
none of his friends all of his friends

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:29.830

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:33.070
alright do I buy it no but it's like you

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:35.350
know I don't know I've watched

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:36.910
everyone's reaction to that like I just

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:37.990
want to say for the record I did not

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:39.430
know he was [ __ ] young chicks I know

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.020
he liked chicks I didn't know they were

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.390
young yeah it's like like I knew he was

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:47.590
[ __ ] young chicks what are you

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:49.690
talking about he's 40 with ripped jeans

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:51.100
get him outta here

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:55.150
true but you know yeah man I don't know

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:57.190
if I don't you know I'm not [ __ ] on

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:58.960
the dude it's just again it's like his

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.710
MO was look he was making comedy to get

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:05.770
sniz yeah so his comedy was kind of it

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:09.490
was pop mm-hmm it was gay true and he

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:12.250
got the Bieber bump yeah so his fans

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.500
Bieber was his favorite comedian and

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:18.810
then Bieber bequeathed him a nation of

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:28.060
very borderline look well this was the

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.530
whole this was a discussion I had with

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:31.720
spud and it's like you know and this is

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.160
what they're saying people are kind of

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.410
against it like you know as a dude with

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:36.780
a bunch of money in prestige

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.610
you're not supposed to go after young

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:39.810
chicks you're not supposed to be trying

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:41.460
to [ __ ] them and it's like I could agree

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.350
it's it's not the best for your personal

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.270
such situation you go for like you know

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:47.610
I'm talking like mega success mega

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.440
impudence but then again it's like

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.780
what's the [ __ ] age you know okay

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.130
we're gonna say like yeah maybe it's

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:54.660
weird before D and try to [ __ ] 20 year

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.540
olds although is it I don't that's the

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.820
thing is it I don't that and this is

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.410
this was just gonna say that now wait

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:05.490
till you're 40 I mean I know I'm dead

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:07.530
when I'm 80 then you hit 80 yeah I don't

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.470
want to [ __ ] die if I'm 40 and

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:11.880
someone's like is it weird to [ __ ] 20

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.950
rolls and be like well the end thing is

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:15.930
pretty cool if you can pull it off yeah

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:17.970
but there's there's the theory of it and

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:21.540
there's the action no I hit no but this

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:22.440
is important

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.640
there's no what you're talkin where

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.020
you're speaking to is what I was saying

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.940
it's like it's not really like I get the

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.190
cultural implications of like yeah man

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:30.450
is probably not the best thing if you're

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:31.860
40 years old you're like bopping around

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.390
with a 20 year old think there's a huge

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:35.220
time gap and like if you can sit there

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:37.290
and pass time with a 20 year old girl

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:38.760
something's probably kind of wrong with

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.530
you if you can lay afterwards and be

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:42.210
like that's so [ __ ] up your friends

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:43.980
being mean to you man that's well yeah

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:46.560
anyway it's my second house there was

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.300
like what the [ __ ] you talking about

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.220
but when people try to be like oh that's

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.860
just [ __ ] up and weird it's like well

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:56.250
yeah but like again by like biologically

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:57.840
speaking this sounds really bad but it's

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.020
like you know 23 dudes are looking dudes

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.330
are looking for signs of fertility that

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:05.310
is like a deleted was just trying to

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:09.000
reproduce no he's being a pig but it's

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.280
like big down he picked but when people

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.450
are like oh man it's [ __ ] up be

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:14.070
shootin like like what's the agent if

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:15.690
you're what is like 5 years saying like

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:17.040
Muslims figured it out half your age

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.620
plus 7 which is actually really [ __ ]

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:25.080
young but that was that was the Muslim

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.850
rule half your age plus 7 you sure I

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:28.350
thought that was like the uncle's rule

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:30.450
I read roots bro roots you would know

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:32.930
you read roots you know his imagination

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:36.060
and the very big exhale he took some you

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.920
know fiction he took some you know leaps

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.840
but that was the thing I tried to give

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.270
the Muslims credit for wanting to [ __ ]

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:44.190
young chicks they said Muslim rule is

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:45.930
half your age plus seven so I think then

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:47.550
the book the guy was like 34 and had

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:48.010
like a

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:49.360
I don't know that exact math it would

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.790
have been 34 so what like 17 plus 7

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:53.919
20-something 24 I might take a stab

00:26:53.919 --> 00:26:55.780
so it was like it's actually pretty good

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.730
but then back then in the village you

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:58.809
know according to the book Alex Haley

00:26:58.809 --> 00:27:00.730
and roots whoo yeah did get people but

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:02.230
it's funny to people the book came out

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:03.760
people were like [ __ ] and

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.900
they're like I'm gonna I'm gonna sink

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:08.470
this [ __ ] baby yeah but they were in

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:09.760
the in the beginning of it in this

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.140
village there's people there and it's

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.690
like if you were so if you're a lady and

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:15.190
you say you're like 35 and your husband

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:17.020
dies you're allowed to take in like a

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.299
second 18 let's just call it 18 back

00:27:19.299 --> 00:27:20.919
then might have been like 16 or 17 in

00:27:20.919 --> 00:27:22.630
the you know ancient village yeah but

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:24.220
you would take in a young boy and train

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:25.840
him in the ways of sex then release him

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.520
to his wife if you're if you were a

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:31.540
widow if you were a widow though I'm

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.340
sorry so in the African roots but yes

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:34.660
right and it was played it right I was

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.250
just not yeah in the Brooks roots that's

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:38.230
what if you were a widow or you know I

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:39.400
mean you know I don't think back then

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.799
chicks just like didn't get it's fiction

00:27:41.799 --> 00:27:42.880
so this guy just came up with like a

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:48.340
very hot he came up with like pure

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:50.890
stepmom porn or someone some bro like

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:53.049
something how many stepmoms do you think

00:27:53.049 --> 00:27:57.669
have actually been stuck since this

00:27:57.669 --> 00:28:00.220
genre how many kids have walked in to

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.990
see a stepmom stuck in the sink and just

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:06.059
be like you're a pervert I'm out of here

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:09.460
happen once where a dude walked into his

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.690
mom was stuck in the dryer

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:18.580
Eddie [ __ ] her and it's such a strange

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:20.440
genre dude if someone to come up with of

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:23.290
a girl who's just physically stuck cuz

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:24.669
it's like a weird loophole like that's

00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:26.590
technically it has to be rape it's rape

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:32.860
well no if she's stuck true but in a

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:37.200
genre they would enjoy a stalk mom's

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.679
just coming to the kitchen I got you oh

00:28:40.679 --> 00:28:43.690
sorry about that I mean it'd be so much

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.130
for sadder in reality if your mom was

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:46.809
actually stuck yeah she was like

00:28:46.809 --> 00:28:53.169
helpless and you're the real story of

00:28:53.169 --> 00:28:55.570
what because everyone the moms always

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:57.309
like oh yeah yeah sure of course it

00:28:57.309 --> 00:28:59.120
should be they should make one where

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:07.610
never be a horrific movie well-disposed

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:11.480

you can't be all washed jerk it on and

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:58.940
at nighttime it's okay to do my shower a

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.770
shower once I'm like I just I can't get

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:03.110
caught jerking off now like before I'd

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:04.640
be like I'd roll the dice hard now I'm

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.960
like I just don't want to get caught it

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.790
yeah so just what it happens is once

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:09.800
every like we can take it off with the

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.350
kid is that's tough it's weird and weird

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:13.580
I can't drink off of my basement because

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.320
I don't know what [ __ ] is live and

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.700
what's not I have like webcams and [ __ ]

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.590
I'm like just on a chance that these are

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:20.179
recording dude I can't black mirror

00:31:20.179 --> 00:31:22.179
myself like the presidents [ __ ] a pig

00:31:22.179 --> 00:31:26.210
given anything for you to lie to just go

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:28.130
cam girl on [ __ ] YouTube for some

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:29.630
reason there's a chance man between all

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:31.280
the zooms and should I do I know I'm

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:39.049
like it would just be my remember the

00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:41.870
video of me plunging the toilet be my

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:44.179
naked like upright weird body just kinda

00:31:44.179 --> 00:31:47.600
like oh yeah no everyday I use my phone

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.000
so every time I use my phone yeah cover

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.559
that for like a part of me so I cover

00:31:51.559 --> 00:31:53.390
that [ __ ] camera just in case they

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:54.799
have to something we have to be true

00:31:54.799 --> 00:31:56.900
there's gonna be like 20 videos of me

00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:00.980
like your phone does track your facial

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.780
expressions because they want to see

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.190
like how you're reacting to things in

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:05.330
real time and they send that information

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:07.280
out because they want to do yeah

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.990
Facebook especially I think social media

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:10.700
sites started a thing we're like when

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:11.750
you're looking at your phone and you

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:14.059
like you scroll down they do things too

00:32:14.059 --> 00:32:15.530
like they'll measure your facial

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:17.120
expressions to see how you react and

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.470
they typically try to give you stuff

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:19.820
that's what if they're gonna like it

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.740
pre-crime me on being racist on [ __ ]

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.390
like that like every time I look at like

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:30.020
a new article and just said why black

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:32.650
trans is the most important part of this

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:35.210
yeah you watch out that face cry I'm

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:38.809
gonna be like interesting I'm not gonna

00:32:38.809 --> 00:32:42.470
read that now but eventually literally

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:44.150
right before the dispo cast that's the

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:45.799
article I accidentally opened they said

00:32:45.799 --> 00:32:47.690
that was like an Apple news alert on my

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:49.700
phone dude and like while I was going to

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.500
bathroom I accidentally pressed accept

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:56.600
and it was like black how black lives

00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:00.159
matter and LGBT or trans rights are

00:33:00.159 --> 00:33:03.169
inseparable is it was the article and

00:33:03.169 --> 00:33:05.000
it's like boy yeah I'm sure there's some

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.340
great logical relations legend in there

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.520
I mean separately whenever you're like

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.200
they're these arguments are so strange

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.429
cuz you're like a little inseparable how

00:33:13.429 --> 00:33:15.110
they're like [ __ ] you dude you're like I

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:18.289
just want to know how that's like oh the

00:33:18.289 --> 00:33:21.830
chop the Chazz dude dude I looked into

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:23.450
it so what do you tell me what you know

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:25.630
about it

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:28.090
I know attitude my entire thing is just

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:33.460
mulling about the chest my news is just

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.410
look I just let him rant for 45 minutes

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:37.480
I'm like yeah yeah

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.370
tear it perfect and now I can repeat it

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:41.919
you ever hear spud true you gets I did

00:33:41.919 --> 00:33:42.940
you have cited this one and Billy

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.880
started a podcast I didn't want to see

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:49.000
you guys I was like I can't steal spuds

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.110
stuff anymore it was like oh I just

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:51.400
would come in here and spud would talk

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.720
to me all day and I'd be like we'll take

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.120
this for a lot of stuff man it's funny

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.130
cuz now I hear spud on

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:58.990
mm-hm I listen to their podcast and I'm

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:05.679
like I'll listen espada be like no man

00:34:05.679 --> 00:34:07.720
[ __ ] do you they're so funny

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.429
Tony means putting on legitimate

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:11.260
argument about [ __ ] the [ __ ] yes but

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:13.060
the Chazz about what about this whole

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:15.010
thing of like I'm like dude he was like

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:16.929
basically it was I was like dude I get

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:18.250
it like and I look you shouldn't

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:20.020
holistically I get I get the idea that

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:22.300
like yeah it doesn't serve you to have

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.740
relationships where you just physically

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:26.889
use a younger person's body but he you

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:29.290
know I was like but 23 year old chicks

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:31.810
are just hotter they're hot and I'm not

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:33.100
just like saying this objectively it's

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.780
like yeah when you do that billion wiki

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.520
lies book and again like don't do this

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:37.540
obviously you're suppose to be a man and

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:38.919
fight against this but the billion

00:34:38.919 --> 00:34:40.659
wicked lies book when they search for

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:42.340
like porn categories a lot of it's like

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.619
eyes hips this and that a lot of it

00:34:44.619 --> 00:34:47.139
correlates to things that typically show

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:48.990
how fertile a woman is like the hip

00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:51.040
diameter is typically like girls with

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.869
smaller feet or more fertile women that

00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:55.060
have wider hips and more fertile look up

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.770
the porn star those little small feet or

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:58.180
more fertile tend to be more fertile

00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:59.770
yeah and it's like the different shapes

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:01.690
a woman and all of these physicals what

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:03.369
people are into foot porn yes

00:35:03.369 --> 00:35:04.900
smaller that's why guys love smaller

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.220
feet and women have smaller feet they

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.359
tend to be more fertile at least

00:35:07.359 --> 00:35:09.340
according to the new wiki la I never got

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.470
the foot thing never into it myself but

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:13.060
again that's what guys like like tiny

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:17.290
feet like oh man you're so small yeah to

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:20.890
him yeah man but yeah yes yeah so we

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:22.420
were arguing I was like dude I'm not

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.830
saying young chicks are hot I'm just

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:26.290
saying they're hot you're not saying

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:28.240
like it's not up to me that they're

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:33.760
right now I'm even like I have every one

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.440
of these clips I'm [ __ ]

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.240

he looks on this old cliff yeah he was

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:46.410
joking oh now it's a hindsight you know

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:48.420
what what also is funny is yet the one

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.289
they were talking about deleting

00:35:49.289 --> 00:35:51.089
snapchat and it did first of all there's

00:35:51.089 --> 00:35:52.500

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.960
their whole channels just them showing

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.609

00:35:56.609 --> 00:35:58.740

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.690
thanks I'll dude also on the snapchat

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:02.579
one I get it it is funny especially with

00:36:02.579 --> 00:36:05.069
the context now yeah but I've been bored

00:36:05.069 --> 00:36:06.420
on a podcast where people are talking

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.700
I'm just like the segment did suck too

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.440
it was just them being like he's like oh

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.950
you can delete that but but again

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:16.200
knowing now people are like he was

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.049
freaking the [ __ ] out maybe he was but

00:36:19.049 --> 00:36:21.599
you know maybe he was Charles owning out

00:36:21.599 --> 00:36:23.279
during a [ __ ] podcast conversation

00:36:23.279 --> 00:36:24.599
blue they're like look out look at this

00:36:24.599 --> 00:36:26.730
lady and she's like she's hot and the

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:28.109
other guy was like I would love [ __ ]

00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:30.180
oh man if I was a kid someone sent me

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:32.010
tits I would jerk off so hard it's like

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:34.890
hilarious but the yes hilarious not

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:35.579
happy at all

00:36:35.579 --> 00:36:36.660
I don't know why you call us a hacky

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:40.680
podcast but yeah I'm Tony there's a

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.059
thing now though with like the delious

00:36:42.059 --> 00:36:44.279
situation it's like you it's like a soul

00:36:44.279 --> 00:36:45.750
reaping if you're like a youtuber you're

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:48.119
like you see the [ __ ] you see mount

00:36:48.119 --> 00:36:50.160
you know the Castle black falling you're

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:54.210
just like I have thoughts on that he's

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:57.390
breathing their followers are group so

00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:59.400
you know I I'm aware of that I see that

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.369
I'm like you know but yeah there's

00:37:02.369 --> 00:37:03.900
definitely a restructuring thing where

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.059
it's like if it then again it's like you

00:37:06.059 --> 00:37:08.069
go the whole thing with the the models

00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:09.869
and [ __ ] was like they would interview

00:37:09.869 --> 00:37:11.309
these girls and they're like yeah this

00:37:11.309 --> 00:37:12.539
is awesome these young chicks like I get

00:37:12.539 --> 00:37:13.589
to hang out with billionaires get to

00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:16.640
network this is just great it's like

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.990
this and it has to be like older

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:20.640
feminists have to tell younger chicks

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.559
like no you're wrong so like you know

00:37:22.559 --> 00:37:24.240
order for that that whole thing to kind

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.519
of come full circle or whatever it would

00:37:26.519 --> 00:37:28.049
be like look like I know you think

00:37:28.049 --> 00:37:29.279
you're killing it right now but you're

00:37:29.279 --> 00:37:31.710
getting used by 40 year old men but then

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:33.390
it the same thing tells women like yeah

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:36.119
you rock do what you want girl yeah but

00:37:36.119 --> 00:37:48.630
it's it's like being used talk about the

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.759
chairs it's also funny like because I've

00:37:50.759 --> 00:37:52.200
done it in my DMS

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.940
and like text and [ __ ] with girls since

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.309

00:37:56.309 --> 00:37:58.799
to say it be like it I'm not you know

00:37:58.799 --> 00:37:59.970
you want to address and be like I'm not

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:02.400
abusing my power here am i yeah it's

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.280
like what kind of [ __ ] do I think I am

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:07.049
where I'm like oh I have power I've so

00:38:07.049 --> 00:38:09.119
much power over it's like yeah but also

00:38:09.119 --> 00:38:10.619

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:48.890
very very cautious about propaganda so

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:50.360
I'm looking around but then like I look

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.770

said was like [ __ ] man he like mentioned

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:46.290
some technology he was like oh so maybe

00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:47.760
they should not use this technology that

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.560
it's like no this isn't he was basically

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:50.850
claiming like white people invented this

00:53:50.850 --> 00:53:55.860
therefore the chances all white its

00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:57.920
whiter than the city that it's in yeah

00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:00.690
yeah but now he tried you know but then

00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:02.700
so basically the my point is the videos

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:04.860
themselves are like it's hard to find

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:06.120
one that's giving you the straight dope

00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.380
you know what it means they're like this

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:10.410
everyone's just chill yes very peaceful

00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:11.940
and it's like they murdered a kid last

00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:13.800
night yeah well then do you see the guy

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.660
who got shot and then tried saying that

00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:18.990
he was actually shot by like oh it's

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:20.790
right-wing provocateurs right waiting

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:22.860
for rocket oars if both sides are doing

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:24.900
the exact same thing yes and no side

00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:27.180
suck yeah well they're saying like da

00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:28.350
one sides like all this is Anti Fog

00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:29.400
doing this the other ones like these are

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:31.230
right-wing prog-rock adores the thing

00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:32.580
that I was watching that I was like this

00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:33.810
it's kind of funny and maybe I'm just

00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:34.200
wrong

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.420
it's like all these people organized and

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:38.160
they're like we figured it out we need

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.350
we're gonna get rid of cops and it's

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:43.230
like okay you can generally in a month

00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:46.140
they've already they did exactly they

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:48.270
did and then they're not reporting who

00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:50.730
shot the kid and they're literally doing

00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:52.560
exactly what the [ __ ] cops did yeah

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:54.240
they're like I don't know it could have

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.650
been on a cake a cake I honestly don't

00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:57.810
know yeah but the point I'm saying it's

00:54:57.810 --> 00:54:59.970
like they're doing this in depth social

00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:03.420
analysis and it's like who pays cops

00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:04.620
it's like you know these are like they

00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:06.750
have all of this like I read it I read

00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:08.310
an article you know obviously the

00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:10.200
taxpayer but like who's setting that up

00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:11.640
and they're like we're occupying this

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.260
it's like dude somebody's allowing you

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:15.060
to do that there could be someone for

00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:16.740
all you know who's like again like if

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:18.090
the news is owned by billionaires they

00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:20.100
see this chat [ __ ] they're like this is

00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:22.320
a little too far they could very well

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:23.970
send guys in and start sniping people

00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:26.070
just beg pop-pop hittin people but again

00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:27.360
if there are people there this was like

00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:29.940
on it could very well very well could it

00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:31.050
because there was a rapper that got

00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:32.190
killed the Chazz as well

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:33.750
and a lot of people were saying that

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:35.430
like it was like his enemies but then

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:36.780
other people like no I think it was

00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:38.040
proud boys I think it was probably

00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:40.290
probably shot a rapper right there you

00:55:40.290 --> 00:55:42.540
know who knows but you know oh I know

00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:44.190
what was really funny is trying to look

00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:46.200
up the story about the kid who died yeah

00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:49.069
what was real interesting is when it's a

00:55:49.069 --> 00:55:51.359
no one most of the articles I found

00:55:51.359 --> 00:55:54.089
didn't mention that he was black mm-hmm

00:55:54.089 --> 00:55:57.329
which is literally the headline if a cop

00:55:57.329 --> 00:56:01.470
does it yeah and then the pictures like

00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:03.240
the BBC News one that I did the first

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.800
thing you Google when you look at it the

00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:07.170
BBC picture is a cop and then underneath

00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:08.579
it it says fourteen-year-old murdered

00:56:08.579 --> 00:56:10.200
yeah it was the it was the Chief of

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.490
Police served nothing cheap I don't know

00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:13.470
what the lady it was a lady cop yeah

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:15.480
who's like talking about it at a press T

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:18.060
so the headline is a picture of a cop

00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:19.770
and it's like fourteen-year-old murdered

00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:23.460
in Seattle yeah it's like also a notice

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:25.710
of shout-out to like every city now for

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:27.450
having that you all their police chiefs

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:29.250
and like captains are all black ladies

00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:31.530
Billy Philly the guy stepped down they

00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:34.109
have a black lady whatever the Chazz

00:56:34.109 --> 00:56:35.880
police lady I mean it's a smart move

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:36.480
dude

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:40.490
soon as someone gets shot they're like

00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:45.810
oh yeah well what I'm saying I've

00:56:45.810 --> 00:56:47.369
started Orion Trump needs to hire one of

00:56:47.369 --> 00:56:49.550
those why is it like a translator

00:56:49.550 --> 00:56:52.050
because all the I looked at I watched it

00:56:52.050 --> 00:56:52.410
dude

00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:54.089

00:56:54.089 --> 00:56:56.670
conference and so fun it was literally

00:56:56.670 --> 00:56:59.760

Second Amendment like he it was very

00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:16.109
funny because he was up there saying you

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:18.869

00:57:22.619 --> 00:57:23.940
the Constitution says we're allowed to

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:26.880
do that he like says something and then

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:29.040
immediately like counters it's great but

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:30.869
if they had a black lady translator up

funny in like 30 years and you know

00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:23.309
they're like you know or like whatever

00:58:23.309 --> 00:58:24.660
however long it was ago when they had

00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:26.130
like separate bathrooms like you guys

00:58:26.130 --> 00:58:27.780

smelled like used to call black guys who

00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:31.470
are in the GOP black conservatives it's

00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:33.559
like yeah we just had a separate title

00:58:33.559 --> 00:58:38.400
we knew serving them black damn it's

00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.559
crazy so many black Democrats out there

00:58:40.559 --> 00:58:43.230

exactly it's capital they got all caps

00:58:58.559 --> 00:58:59.790
which is safe they should give it all

00:58:59.790 --> 00:59:01.589
caps black should be like capital B

00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:04.380
capital L capital a capital C okay that

00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:05.700
would be you that's the real deal and

00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:08.309
there did I think even white lowercase

00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:10.319
they should it's so funny if they

00:59:10.319 --> 00:59:12.420
actually do that shrinking shrinking a

00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:13.950
font they should shrink it a font I

00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:16.770
don't know yeah I glad to I don't want

00:59:16.770 --> 00:59:18.059

00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:31.170
most like literally that's like well we

00:59:31.170 --> 00:59:32.549
just capitalized that everybody will be

00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:36.900
like I respect them this is this is the

00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:39.210
problem I only respect capital letters

00:59:39.210 --> 00:59:41.599
dude exactly I only expect proper nouns

00:59:41.599 --> 00:59:44.970
big proper down guy dude the so this is

00:59:44.970 --> 00:59:46.230
my problem with the Chaz stuff it's like

00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:47.849
so you have these guys in there who in

00:59:47.849 --> 00:59:48.569
they're like you know they're all

00:59:48.569 --> 00:59:50.910
they're like we occupied this space it's

00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:52.619
like you know people are allowing you to

00:59:52.619 --> 00:59:54.390
the powers that be are allowing you to

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:55.710
occupy this space yeah oh they're like

00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:57.420
what the [ __ ] we gonna do with this if

00:59:57.420 --> 00:59:59.549
they're if that was an actual threat the

00:59:59.549 --> 01:00:02.520
answer is literally wait a week exactly

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:05.130
it'll be gone yeah but the problem I

01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:07.049
read this thing it's a there's someone

01:00:07.049 --> 01:00:08.460
gave you an article from this thing

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:09.720
called the bellows and they were talking

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:11.970
about social media posting how social

01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:13.619
media posting is literally it's not like

01:00:13.619 --> 01:00:15.420
a conversation it's like is if you were

01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:16.950
to go to the top of the mountain just be

01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:18.750
like just scream you know if you're like

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:22.220
a white liberal lady you're like I just

01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:24.359
go back down and the next person comes

01:00:24.359 --> 01:00:26.190
up and then like so when like you know

01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:27.329
if you're not saying you know it's like

01:00:27.329 --> 01:00:29.250
we start there's trends pop up called

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:31.710
hashtags where it's like hey everyone's

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:33.030
blacking out the thing are you going to

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:34.410
do it too so then it becomes again the

01:00:34.410 --> 01:00:36.059
crime the social crime becomes not

01:00:36.059 --> 01:00:38.339
feeding the Machine of social media so

01:00:38.339 --> 01:00:40.109
like you know if you're like I don't

01:00:40.109 --> 01:00:41.430
feel like doing that like you have to

01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:43.349
you have to do becomes this thing where

01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:44.760
like who benefits from this oh [ __ ]

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.710
Twitter you know in a weird way yeah and

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:49.230
they're saying how like you know so you

01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:50.700
had like before like the you know the

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.200
racism of the south with like you know

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.640
they were saying was very like parochial

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:54.869
we're like you know at least like the

01:00:54.869 --> 01:00:56.010
guy would be you know they'd be like

01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:57.240
you'd have someone like you can't have

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:58.290
black people here blah blah and they're

01:00:58.290 --> 01:01:00.089
fighting but now it's got replaced with

01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:01.319
a system that like just doesn't give a

01:01:01.319 --> 01:01:02.609
[ __ ] about anybody and they were saying

01:01:02.609 --> 01:01:04.380
how like the jobs gobble got sold out

01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:06.180
overseas so like when it was time for

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:07.770
like black dudes finally getting in the

01:01:07.770 --> 01:01:10.140
factories those jobs were gone and like

01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:11.400
they're you know in which you know is a

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.170
shitty trade off but it was like being

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:14.369
in the south where people hate you

01:01:14.369 --> 01:01:16.140
versus being like an absolute just like

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:17.460
number and a system that like literally

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:19.109
doesn't give a [ __ ] about anybody yeah

01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:20.640
and this and that system is what's kind

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.140
of perpetuating all this stuff like yeah

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:23.549
we're capitalizing guys more we're

01:01:23.549 --> 01:01:25.020
capitalizing the thing but still it's

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:27.030
like they can totally [ __ ] you over like

01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:30.809
any second that makes sense yes so you

01:01:30.809 --> 01:01:32.730
know the article was [ __ ] good man it

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:34.200
was really good yeah I saw it but

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.040
they're like they're saying like they

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.720
just gave all the jobs away they're like

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:37.920
[ __ ] it we're not paying these guys will

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.599
just have like literal slaves and

01:01:39.599 --> 01:01:41.190
sweatshops and then it was like there

01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:42.900
was a period there's time talking about

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:45.990
like the 70s and 80s we're like they're

01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:47.700
just weren't they were like like imagine

01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:50.220
if there was just not enough jobs and

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:51.720
you were one of the persons one of the

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:53.849
people that were like there's like a

01:01:53.849 --> 01:01:55.980
million jobs I'm like a million to 20

01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:58.109
and there's just not a job there's just

01:01:58.109 --> 01:01:59.579
no matter what I do there's just not a

01:01:59.579 --> 01:02:00.900
[ __ ] job so you're trying to explain

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:04.069
that to people they're like shut up

01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:05.970
yeah the article the article is

01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:07.170
basically saying like dude the fact that

01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:08.520
all these corporations are in support of

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.930
this [ __ ] is like the

01:02:09.930 --> 01:02:11.280
one thing you should just be like what

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.990
the [ __ ] what is sure because they're

01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:14.430

plaguing just going around extracting as

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.300
much money out of things as they can

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:41.089
