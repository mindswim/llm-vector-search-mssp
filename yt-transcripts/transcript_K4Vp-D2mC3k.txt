00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.820
Nazis were after I mean they literally

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.300

I looked at his money on lampshades

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.760
historical lands make it was kind of

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.420
jewy real like your own like ancient

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.860
alien it's like well yeah I was kind of

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.180
thinking about the Babylonians they're a

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.400
little jewy that is sick like ancient

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.900
aliens is pretty much just like it's

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.370
either Jews or aliens

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.370
we don't know who did it [ __ ] all

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.319
these technological advances I've never

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.819
seen that show it's about it's just the

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.709
pyramids every episode well it started

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.840
it's pretty heavy in Egypt I would love

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.220
it if they were doing stuff from like

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.500
the 1800s where they're like the Eiffel

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.530
Tower was built by and they they went up

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.760
to World War II have no I do oh yeah I

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.650
believe that show they were the Nazis

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.390
were like into the occult and [ __ ] which

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.010
is the funniest thing about them that

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.599
they're like we got to kill every Jew

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.650
ever so we can find Santa Santa's real

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.950
he's real

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.780
these symbols prove it yeah the aliens

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.810
gave him like UFOs and [ __ ] but then

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.150
they didn't use them so I think that's

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.340
kind of debunked right yeah they ended

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.440
up using like children we and we Lynn

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.629
yeah but ancient aliens is like now they

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.370
had [ __ ] lasers we took their

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.290
technology right yeah we is that

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.730
paperclip is that what that's called

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.349

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.840
bunch of Nazi scientists initially they

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.120

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.150
they realized it like all the best

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.739

to live in a metropolis a global city

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.440
that should be a real [ __ ] punishment

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:56.980
exile

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.470
exile should be like a [ __ ] thrown in

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.110
Yakuza control yeah well then he gets

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.610

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:44.590
[ __ ] sick yeah they also don't get

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.170
Tokyo Drift but it's because it's too

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.720
smart for them that's why the plot

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.670
doesn't make sense as they couldn't

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.460
grasp that he would go to Japan which is

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.300
a different country than China

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:01.220
I don't get it also age old movie

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.020
archetype of a white guy hitting Asian

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.490
culture and just gave him like three

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:05.840
days he's like I'll be the best at

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.630
everything here it's true Last Samurai

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.080
Tokyo Drift dude it's a safe thing

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.310
studying martial arts for thousands of

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.490
years that give me a stick and he's like

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.860
you guys immediately the guys why he

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.820

yeah like whisper broken English Joey's

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.580
like yeah it all makes sense now

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.730
ya know why samurais know the ending of

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.740
that is like bizarre because like he's

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.540
being killed he's going into battle

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.580

Biden tried to play that card which is

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.630
like way more tragic than being like a

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.450
light-skinned black guy that's had a

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:19.210

vampires that's weird because I also am

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:14.110
obsessed with elite pedophiles and

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.320
Robert De Niro is not on my radar well

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.540
in fact I recently rewashed he'd and

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.210
when you get shot that's me that's me

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:24.730
I'm so close to getting out of this

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:26.590
[ __ ] life and I just won't it won't

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:28.300
happen which pedophile would you bring

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.830
down if you had a choice which elite

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:35.320
pedophile Geffen's at the top or

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.770
Spielberg one of the two

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:42.850

you just good and then you say whatever

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:55.110

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:58.540
yeah I'm on the official record yeah hmm

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.400
you're gonna kill yourself after this

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.990

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:09.970
night deliberately take I mean I do

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:10.840
worry about that

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.510
luckily I'm just some idiot but no no no

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:14.770

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:25.990
all big the singer Linkin Park was able

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.420

crack the case yeah yeah yeah that's my

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:36.970
favorite reminds Travis Barker in

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:39.190
Lincoln Park I think you can wave saying

the numbers to cheer themselves out no

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:17.489
shower true just lay in your bed too

00:47:17.489 --> 00:47:20.099
long you just got to just turn into like

00:47:20.099 --> 00:47:24.420
an 80 year old you're like letting my

00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:27.289
[ __ ] solidify around my legs for years

00:47:27.289 --> 00:47:31.140
add weight to my legs because I've

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:32.880
always been insecure about my thin legs

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:36.239
so I I've got probably about about 15

00:47:36.239 --> 00:47:39.359
years of dried cod oh yeah she like

00:47:39.359 --> 00:47:46.309
Jackson yeah no one notices it's weird

00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:54.150
like some nice cargo shorts you notice

00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:59.700
tried to come on your calf calves what

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.229
are you doing on the calf to shower

00:48:01.229 --> 00:48:04.229
because you're standing I forgot you

00:48:04.229 --> 00:48:06.210
stand-in jerk yeah that's a classic

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:08.460
shower don't tread on me man don't you

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:12.140
dare [ __ ] to not tread on boot

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:14.460
sanding standing and jerking off to me

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:16.710
is one of the artists I think it's just

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:18.719
crazy really well if you had finished at

00:48:18.719 --> 00:48:24.119
West Point you would understand it makes

00:48:24.119 --> 00:48:29.900
it a final-year a lot of punk there

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.670
that's that's that's all about getting

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:34.529
like getting caught jerking off and like

00:48:34.529 --> 00:48:38.279
defending my territory I've all right I

00:48:38.279 --> 00:48:40.650
just think catching catching standing

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:42.029
jerk-off would be the funniest thing

00:48:42.029 --> 00:48:43.799
it's open a door and see a dude just

00:48:43.799 --> 00:48:46.469
standing in the middle of his room don't

00:48:46.469 --> 00:48:49.589
