stand-up at every [ __ ] night truths

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.559
like tonight I have a show that's like a

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:05.740
drinking show what is it city what

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.289
it's like you have citywide specials so

00:21:08.289 --> 00:21:10.000
everyone has I will take a shot of

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.409
whiskey tonight while you're performing

00:21:11.409 --> 00:21:14.049
yeah which is fine but it usually one

00:21:14.049 --> 00:21:15.669
shot you know well that sets it off

00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:16.870
that's where it gets trouble

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:18.370
yeah because I can drink beer I can I

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:20.380

not get hammered

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.529
throw in a shot of whiskey and it's

00:21:23.529 --> 00:21:25.779
trouble what is what's the concept of

00:21:25.779 --> 00:21:26.049
the show

00:21:26.049 --> 00:21:28.090

citywide special is there but it's like

00:21:31.809 --> 00:21:34.029
a happy hour show there's like a five

00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:35.649
dollar special for a shot got you I

00:21:35.649 --> 00:21:37.120

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.889
you having to drink you just can't deny

00:21:38.889 --> 00:21:41.770
the deal we usually start the show with

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:43.180
being like hey this is the [ __ ] show

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.890

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:47.770

took a shot every [ __ ] time he went

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:03.580
out but that would be tight I'm six feet

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.170
cry sure I've seen comics do that he

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:10.030
would have faked Christ really all you

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:13.800
do is fill up a big glass with like

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.840
water and then just a couple of splashes

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.180
of Diet Coke and it looks like you know

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.410
it's brown

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:23.860
yeah just chug that onstage but give me

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.320
another one except somebody did it'd be

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.110
like the old days when magicians would

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:31.990
try to [ __ ] each other's tricks up like

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:33.580
other magicians would show up and ruin

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:34.780
someone's trick somebody would be like

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.580
yeah send him this one and send a real

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:40.560
whiskey and be like chocolate man I will

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:45.190
this one's not should puke everywhere I

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:46.960
think this one's actually just weirdly

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:51.070
coke in the soda water yeah being like a

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:53.230
fake drinker comic would be so I've seen

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:55.060
it I've seen comics do that I've seen

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.530
headliners do that do what what do they

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:58.210
do fake drink they do that they get a

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.580

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.520
everybody it does work though as far as

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.310

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:18.460

it's kind of where they say a lot of

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.610
that Christmas stuff comes from like the

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:43.960
idea of giving gifts and that there was

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.490
also a role reversal or I think they had

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.650
slaves the masters of the house would

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:49.270
serve the slaves for like a day or a

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:50.830
couple days yeah and then there was an

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.210
other so everyone was out in the street

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:54.430
giving each other like gag gifts and

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:54.950
then

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:57.080
getting [ __ ] hammered and there was a

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.820
guy called the mat it was a master fool

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.279
who led the whole party and would be

00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:04.519
like he would give like these sermons

00:24:04.519 --> 00:24:06.230
that were just ridiculous and kind of

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:08.179
like it is kind of like stand-up comedy

00:24:08.179 --> 00:24:09.830
back in the Roman Empire

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:11.929
people just get [ __ ] up and the slaves

00:24:11.929 --> 00:24:13.489
to be able they run around do the thing

00:24:13.489 --> 00:24:14.809
so good to party

00:24:14.809 --> 00:24:16.309
yeah the masters would serve the slaves

00:24:16.309 --> 00:24:18.169
ha ha that was the whole idea for 3 days

00:24:18.169 --> 00:24:19.639
there was a role reversal

00:24:19.639 --> 00:24:21.019
that was a [ __ ] that was an

00:24:21.019 --> 00:24:23.809
ill-advised plan look how [ __ ] sick

00:24:23.809 --> 00:24:25.820
this is for three days yeah then you

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.559
gotta go back after like a week of it we

00:24:27.559 --> 00:24:28.869
gotta get back to that

00:24:28.869 --> 00:24:31.389
these [ __ ] heads off for sure

00:24:31.389 --> 00:24:33.679
yeah I mean dude honestly that's like

00:24:33.679 --> 00:24:35.359
but then again imagine how terrifying it

00:24:35.359 --> 00:24:36.919
is with being a slave in the Roman times

00:24:36.919 --> 00:24:38.600
and they just have legions of [ __ ]

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.549
yeah they also they have lions yeah

00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:42.470

00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:58.129

I was like damn that sucks that question

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:28.390
sucks

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.580
yeah because most of them are like

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.980
issues yeah you could talk about your

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:34.600
what you're gonna like what would you

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.250

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:37.060
you gonna say something could your dad

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.010
beat up Putin's dead yeah he was just

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:41.320
like I would say he was just like well

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.080
first I'd say sorry I beat your guy and

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:49.990
it was like dude yeah so he flipped it

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:53.230
on its head yeah I mean young man that's

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:54.700
the kind of in its kind of innovation

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.710
creativity we need a new leader dude I'm

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:58.660
telling you I've been saying I know you

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.250
introduced me of the man it's a [ __ ]

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:02.110
man you introduced me to the game again

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:04.270
it's it's weird to think I mean dude

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:08.380
Trump has more American politics pretty

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:10.030
much forever now there's no going back

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:12.070
yeah the weird thing is it wasn't

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.390
knowing watching people be like well

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:14.950
I'll tell you what I'll do it's like I'm

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:16.510
going to not answer this question just

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:18.250
talk about well they'd still do this

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:20.050
[ __ ] I still do they do that still yeah

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:21.580
but the more you can the more you can

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:24.190
like enter where you're being an actual

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:26.650
person yeah people are like huh what's

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:28.930
this Oh [ __ ] Booker tried to do that

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:30.490
last night which was pretty great what

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:32.560
do you do he was like yeah everybody

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.690
gets closing statements yeah and he's

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:37.090
like oh I had a speech prepared but I

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:38.740
saw a longtime friend out in the

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:39.970
audience and I want to talk and then he

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:41.410
just gave a speech it's like you

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:44.440
prepared a [ __ ] like I'm just gonna

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.240
be real right now and then he gave a

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.170
speech he like threw a parry through

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:50.580
and pulled another one out yeah yeah

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.620
yeah but everybody's closing speeches

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.050
just most of them just stunk yeah it was

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:57.000
just like I believe we can unlock the

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.190
true potential of this country when

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:01.140
Americans are together working to get

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.000
psyched dude shut the [ __ ] up we've

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.940
heard this everyday exactly well the

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:07.770
whole thing sucks it's like this is on

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:11.100
TV it's [ __ ] it's just a spectacle

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.440
yeah it just sucks yeah it's [ __ ]

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.450
yeah total [ __ ] [ __ ] that's the

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:17.250
other thing too uh Warren was coming out

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:19.350
hard against Wall Street weren't also

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:21.780
like basically somebody who somebody

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.510
that wanted questions like only whatever

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:25.980
percent serve in the military in this

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.120
country it's real though it's like

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.940
[ __ ] 1% yeah and it was like do you

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:31.650
think that should be higher and she kind

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:33.690
of like hinted that like mandatory

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:35.550
service and it was like Israel kind of

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:37.200
yeah where she was like I think everyone

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.410
should and then her experience was just

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:42.510
her brothers served she's like so I

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:44.280
think yes all men should certainly kind

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.520
of like that whoa it was like I remember

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.840
when my oldest brother was in Vietnam

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:52.320
and just my the the biggest part of our

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.180
day was my mom checking the mailbox like

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.790
she'd be so happy if he if she got a

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:58.590
letter from him and you know if he

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:01.410
didn't she'd just be excited about the

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:03.870
next one so yes I think more people

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:05.940
should serve in the moons like what the

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:08.360
[ __ ] kind of weird answer was that I

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.310
mean do you imagine that you think about

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:14.550
post podcast anxiety you imagine going

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:16.140
home from a presidential debate being

00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:23.040
like that must be like cellphone smash

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.470
yeah but I didn't Biden had a couple

00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:27.900
oh my god I was watching that's what

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.070
that was going on the group texted a

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:30.540
there's a bunch of [ __ ] Biden gaffes

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:34.350
of him and just being like yeah yeah

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:36.510
like him yeah yeah yeah yeah when you

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:38.250
just like stuttered yeah something so

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:40.320
[ __ ] dumb he they keep saying he's a

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.970
front-runner they're like no no for real

00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:43.800
yes how

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.800
cuz he's up against a lady so people

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.660
don't like that with Elizabeth Warren

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:52.080
yeah and Bernie just is like very very

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:56.070
very far left warns pretty warns pretty

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:58.710
wild warning and Biden are both very far

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:01.350
left a warning Bernie you mean yeah and

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:02.990
Biden's

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:05.600
Biden's like it Biden's like us going

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.520
back to what we had just I guess it's

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.380
just like saxophone playing chill the

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.120
[ __ ] out let's just go back to what we

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:11.540
were doing

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.270
yeah let's have a guy who's just a

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:16.760
politician who just but then Bernie and

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:19.520
Warren are very well cheap so she came

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.960
out against like trying I think trying

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.830
to tax like Wall Street exchanges and

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:26.330
they were like apparently I read an

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:28.400
article the one day being like they were

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.470
they basically people with certain banks

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:32.210
told the DNC like we're not giving any

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:33.590
of you [ __ ] money unless you

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:35.180
guys all start distancing yourselves

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:37.370
from Warren right now yeah and then I

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:39.200
saw that and then the next day an

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.720
article online was like Warren extreme

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.580
positions blah blah blah and it was just

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.890
like damn dude yeah so you don't even

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:47.240
have no one has any [ __ ] clue what's

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:47.780
going on

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:50.540
yeah it's they just like right away

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:52.100
we're like and people are upset at her

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:53.660
extreme can it's like are people mad

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.130
about people saying you know take like a

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:57.080
point two percent attack stock

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.640
transactions everything will still keep

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.370
moving Bernie was talking about like the

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:03.770
people that run the fossil fuel industry

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:05.450
being like criminals and he's like when

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:08.360
we investigate like we need to not only

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.070
get rid of fossil fuels but we need to

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:11.150
look into who's running it and

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:12.650
investigate them because they've known

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:15.650
that this was a harmful thing he's like

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:16.880
we should lock them up it's like all

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.280
right you know lock up oil executives

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:23.110
dude yeah man you're gonna get shot soon

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:25.430
Chili's probably he's probably waiting

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:27.080
for death you just had a heart attack

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.550
it's like I wished yeah if I can take

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:30.890
him out shoot me in history he is old

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:32.600
enough to have that attitude you ever

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.670
get the plastic bag game that's

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:38.060
apparently a real seedy business no he

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:39.770
applies there's like a whole humungous

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:41.450
plastic bag industry they're like

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:44.390
they're like horrible because there's no

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:45.440
reason there could be definitely

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.810
different bags and materials for use and

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:50.360
they're just like now doing plastic I

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.190
mean it's cheap as [ __ ] yeah I was

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:54.170
wondering this straw industry got [ __ ]

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:57.050
by by us like people being like yeah

00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:00.640
just use paper straws are no straws

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.870
straw industry they must had a weak

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:04.760
Lobby well they also it is a things

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:05.900
we're all Robbie was like they're never

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.460
gonna come for us there's plastic bags

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.230
they still got to get them the problems

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:11.900
are easy the problem is is that like we

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.580
can definitely create it's a simple

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:15.619
vehicle to draw liquid to our mouths

00:37:15.619 --> 00:37:17.299
yeah so we can easily come up with a

00:37:17.299 --> 00:37:18.769
thing that doesn't sit around for like

00:37:18.769 --> 00:37:23.569
nine hundred years lift your people who

00:37:23.569 --> 00:37:25.460
are like Germany weird about that things

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.529
but the fact that we cannot come up with

00:37:27.529 --> 00:37:29.569
a simple device to draw a liquid to our

00:37:29.569 --> 00:37:31.579
mouth that doesn't exist for like nine

00:37:31.579 --> 00:37:34.160
hundred years after we use it is insane

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.469
yeah be like I love the technology we

00:37:36.469 --> 00:37:37.940
simply don't it's like it the [ __ ] out

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:39.410
of here yeah it's crazy

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:42.440
dude we're both very very anti you know

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.749
I'm I'm a big environmentalist we're

00:37:44.749 --> 00:37:46.099
both environmental I'm just trying to

00:37:46.099 --> 00:37:47.839
shift people I also rise woman's right

00:37:47.839 --> 00:37:49.549
dude it's her body

00:37:49.549 --> 00:37:51.680
I mean ecofeminism bro I'm an eco

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.599
feminist me a big again feminine I'm an

00:37:53.599 --> 00:37:55.039
eco-friendly I just read about that on

00:37:55.039 --> 00:37:57.440
patreon really someone sent me a [ __ ]

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.119
link on patreon I was talking about

00:37:59.119 --> 00:38:01.430
earlier with the the fact that we have

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:03.950
more debt than we have capital yeah and

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:06.710
how the [ __ ] like we're never going to

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:08.029
pay back the debt we owe all these

00:38:08.029 --> 00:38:10.190
countries they're saying like they're

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:11.960
it's it's just it's unfathomable it

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.599
grows by whatever it is a day like 27

00:38:14.599 --> 00:38:16.039
million dollars a day and like it's just

00:38:16.039 --> 00:38:18.619
never in like the debt is just showing

00:38:18.619 --> 00:38:21.079
us that wealth is infinite like it's

00:38:21.079 --> 00:38:22.369
just showing us like look how much money

00:38:22.369 --> 00:38:23.809
is all this money but they're like it

00:38:23.809 --> 00:38:25.670
like it spins on nothing real there yeah

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.799
we fully gone into it like a pure fiat

00:38:27.799 --> 00:38:30.380
system and I articles like really I

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:31.369
didn't get through the whole thing but

00:38:31.369 --> 00:38:32.869
sick thinking about how we have more

00:38:32.869 --> 00:38:34.729
[ __ ] debt than capital is just like

00:38:34.729 --> 00:38:36.799
I'm used to that how does that even

00:38:36.799 --> 00:38:38.539
exist I know how that exists I mean I

00:38:38.539 --> 00:38:41.630
sure a personal level yes that makes no

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:43.910
sense though yeah do you have all this

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:46.400
money and it's just weird debts people

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:50.210
owe that they can't walk away from or

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:52.700
and you have capital it just [ __ ]

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:55.309
crazy that was the first debate I

00:38:55.309 --> 00:38:58.700
watched and it's like well the first was

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:00.289
the first that was the first democratic

00:39:00.289 --> 00:39:02.569
debate I watched this year how do you

00:39:02.569 --> 00:39:05.539
like it it's pretty brutal man I did I

00:39:05.539 --> 00:39:07.489
tapped out pretty quickly I tried I was

00:39:07.489 --> 00:39:08.569
like I'm going to watch they do that

00:39:08.569 --> 00:39:10.249
thing where they give you four examples

00:39:10.249 --> 00:39:13.369
of people that [ __ ] annoys me every

00:39:13.369 --> 00:39:15.559
single time I wonder what the what the

00:39:15.559 --> 00:39:16.759
thing is they're like if you say

00:39:16.759 --> 00:39:18.640
somebody from a town the town likes you

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.289
yeah the town will watch that clip or

00:39:21.289 --> 00:39:22.789
something there's that and there's all

00:39:22.789 --> 00:39:24.739
of that there's that there's also like

00:39:24.739 --> 00:39:26.210
no cuz they've been doing that forever

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:28.069
where it's like I met a family and it

00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:29.130
makes you look down

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:30.779
yeah and we were talking and she said

00:39:30.779 --> 00:39:33.329
she had to walk three miles just to get

00:39:33.329 --> 00:39:35.430
to the bus yeah it's to show you like

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:38.069
I'm down with a small-town vibe like I

00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:42.180
saw there's this troop of down in very

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.690
perfect middle of the country somebody

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:48.930
should just be like I met a I met a man

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:52.230
named Walter in which I say made-up town

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:57.359
I'll [ __ ] I met a man in Des Moines Des

00:39:57.359 --> 00:40:01.049
Moines Des Moines his whole family died

00:40:01.049 --> 00:40:02.549
his whole family were soldiers they were

00:40:02.549 --> 00:40:03.420
[ __ ] dead

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:07.369
they all died so yes I think we should

00:40:07.369 --> 00:40:09.930
go bag is like stop and go to something

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:13.289
yeah the whole thing is just horrid you

00:40:13.289 --> 00:40:15.690
know it's just you see people that are

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:17.430
up on the stage like what are you doing

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:20.099
on this stage you have no shot I looked

00:40:20.099 --> 00:40:22.589
at you I saw you try to speak into the

00:40:22.589 --> 00:40:23.880
camera and it's like I you should leave

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.579
now wasting everyone's [ __ ] but

00:40:26.579 --> 00:40:29.130
there's a lady [ __ ] name there like

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:31.019
the WWF wrestlers that are just named

00:40:31.019 --> 00:40:40.980
like Kevin comes out to like a random

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:45.150
Nickelback song just a guy goes out a

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:46.650
speedo it's like guy this guy sucks

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:49.740
this guy's gonna lose they do have a

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.890
bunch of those wrestlers definitely and

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:54.779
this is this lady I forget her [ __ ]

00:40:54.779 --> 00:40:56.670
name she's got a weird name yeah

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:58.529
oh I think I know you're talking about I

00:40:58.529 --> 00:41:02.039
saw eclipse gotta her hair the way her

00:41:02.039 --> 00:41:03.900
bangs were last night like any time she

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.940
talked to her hair was just looked like

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:07.740
she was quivering the entire time she

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.839
was not the hair was shaking the whole

00:41:09.839 --> 00:41:11.549
time she was talking that [ __ ] sucks

00:41:11.549 --> 00:41:13.200
and she's like a moderate dude she's I

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.730
mean there's definitely people that are

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:17.069
in there to lose yeah but just to get

00:41:17.069 --> 00:41:18.480
like to keep being like this is where

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.609
the party sands she's one of them she's

00:41:20.609 --> 00:41:22.500
like a moderate she's with Biden yeah I

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.119
wonder what that she's in there to kind

00:41:24.119 --> 00:41:25.349
of be like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie

00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:26.130
are crazy

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:27.269
they're counterweight and everything

00:41:27.269 --> 00:41:28.680
like if we want to win this we got to

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:29.910
get the middle of the country we can't

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:32.309
just keep being far left which I agree

00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:34.410
with them yeah it sucks cuz Bernie and

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:36.089
them are like kind of right I know

00:41:36.089 --> 00:41:38.549
that's like we should [ __ ] in fossil

00:41:38.549 --> 00:41:39.779
fuel it'll lock these [ __ ] now

00:41:39.779 --> 00:41:41.609
I don't know the repercussions obviously

00:41:41.609 --> 00:41:42.480
because I'm dumb

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.980
yeah because I think that would halt our

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:46.530
industry I don't know how things work

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:48.710
I think people if we have you unleashed

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:51.690
human-like ingenuity sure you'd be fine

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:53.670
but or even come up with a plan to be

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:55.290
there all right we're stepping we're in

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:57.300
a we could gradually step ourselves off

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.950
yeah yeah yeah you know that people get

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:00.540
to spewing its silver out of whenever

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:01.980
you talk about this [ __ ] to like so you

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.869
better here's here's a one wink I found

00:42:03.869 --> 00:42:05.310
you better check that [ __ ] you were

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:06.840
saying that's like all right dude thanks

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.359
but the it is especially when you again

00:42:09.359 --> 00:42:10.800
you're watching that history [ __ ] where

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.720
they talk about how like the French the

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.790
French we're like just one class had all

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:16.530
the money and no and they controlled all

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:17.730
the wealth and it turned they like

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:19.560
foreign tasks they weren't taxing the

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.600
other rich and they were like yeah and

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.640
finally the peasants like all right yeah

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.160
I know enough dude enough of this [ __ ]

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:30.270

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:32.070
chicken about it we can't be chickens

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:32.340

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:35.700

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:37.859

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:57.660
to be we need to focus a campaign of

00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:00.450
generosity and welcoming or as we in

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:08.130

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:27.210
to have green eyes first of all yeah and

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:28.739

something so yeah that credit card debt

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:06.920
and they were just they just fizzle out

00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:09.770
so it's like yeah that's what happened

00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:11.960
with my student loans I didn't know that

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.660
this was this is a federal loan there's

00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:16.250
a federal student loan so it's like

00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:18.250
they're just like all right well they're

00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:20.599
they're gonna start garnishing all the

00:56:20.599 --> 00:56:22.549
wages you make and I'm like well I'm

00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:26.089
making comedy money's who cares yeah but

00:56:26.089 --> 00:56:28.069
then I got a check from the same company

00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:30.049
and I was like [ __ ] they're gonna just

00:56:30.049 --> 00:56:33.950
take this yeah [ __ ] now I enough money

00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:36.349
to pay them now yeah you might have US

00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:38.059
Marshals popping up on you dude no I

00:56:38.059 --> 00:56:39.500
mean they get real serious if you know

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:40.910
they're like yeah well you defaulted on

00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:43.069
your federal loans oh they'll come take

00:56:43.069 --> 00:56:44.180
a [ __ ] yeah yeah

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:45.890
they will come take your [ __ ] [ __ ] them

00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:48.170
they'll hate your bank account yeah it's

00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:52.369
kind of [ __ ] man kind of it is kind

00:56:52.369 --> 00:56:54.200
of that's what sucks about it's like yes

00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:56.299
it is because when you agree to take a

00:56:56.299 --> 00:56:58.039
student loan you're a [ __ ] Stute

00:56:58.039 --> 00:56:58.700
you're an idiot

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:01.220
you're like [ __ ] 17 true but the

00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:02.750
other thing too is if the so they they

00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:04.460
forgot about making college of business

00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:06.170
and they're like look we're gonna set it

00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:07.279
up so everyone here's all the

00:57:07.279 --> 00:57:08.900
information you need we're gonna set it

00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:11.180
up so everyone can like if you can if

00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:13.430
you can get into this place you're good

00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:15.319
good yeah and then the market could

00:57:15.319 --> 00:57:15.950
thrive

00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:18.589
of all these people knowing how to do

00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:20.780
all the showing how that boys are bad

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:22.460
and girls are good you know that's the

00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:24.320
problem is falling it yeah exactly it's

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:25.880
falling into that but it's like it's all

00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:27.349
about those people are paying for it you

00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:29.119
pay for that bro imagine paying for your

00:57:29.119 --> 00:57:31.040
boys are bad girls are good I mean I am

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:32.619
right now

00:57:32.619 --> 00:57:35.540
but at least I have like a clear thing I

00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:38.750
can do afterwards but dude oh dude

00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:41.960
speaking of which so I did my first [ __ ]

00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:43.010
you know start did I tell you about that

00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:45.579
was doing my money like THC deep dives

00:57:45.579 --> 00:57:47.839
no so I had them have a micro dosing

00:57:47.839 --> 00:57:51.530
program a bunch of the dogs so that

00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:53.119
we're all doing it I for me personally

00:57:53.119 --> 00:57:55.339
the micro dose and mushrooms every two

00:57:55.339 --> 00:57:58.070
days every three days it's its most

00:57:58.070 --> 00:57:59.720
counterproductive for me I couldn't I

00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:02.630
couldn't uh there's a there's people in

00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:04.250
my you know in the mini camp who are

00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:05.510
doing it who are like nothing but

00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:08.359
positive things for me personally bro I

00:58:08.359 --> 00:58:10.250
just kind it was like you know

00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:12.440
especially like at work and [ __ ] I it's

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:13.849
just too much for me it's distracting

00:58:13.849 --> 00:58:16.250
cuz I'm like talking to people that like

00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:18.170
in-depth emotional stuff and it for me

00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:20.150
it's just [ __ ] up because I'm not

00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:22.010
present like I'm not present enough in

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:23.240
what I'm doing it's kind of like

00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:24.859
throwing me off yeah so I had to make

00:58:24.859 --> 00:58:26.720
the hard call to say like alright I'm

00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:28.220
gonna back off this I'm gonna keep this

00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:30.140
as more of like a weekend every now and

00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:31.250
again thing because that's what it works

00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:32.569
well for me when I start doing too much

00:58:32.569 --> 00:58:34.700
micro doses I start going into like

00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:36.650
funny world a little - it gets a little

00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:37.310
too weird

00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:41.119
and it also for me messes with my sleep

00:58:41.119 --> 00:58:42.859
it makes it kind of like stimulates me

00:58:42.859 --> 00:58:44.359
in a way we're like it makes it harder

00:58:44.359 --> 00:58:45.890
for me to fall asleep yeah especially

00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:47.660
after like the third one in a row it is

00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:49.040
dude it is tight it I think it

00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.750
definitely helped me but the other dogs

00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:52.220
in the program are saying like nothing

00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:54.349
but awesome stuff they're crushing it so

00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:55.250
I'm like that's what's up

00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:57.740
ice I've branched off now and got in the

00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:00.020
the realm of THC deep dive zoo which is

00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:02.780
so [ __ ] sick I think that's how yeah

00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:05.500
that's full that the problem is is like

00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:08.240
the being slightly altered during your

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:10.040
daily tasks is you know that's cool for

00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:11.540
some people for me I have like two weird

00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:12.920
and wacky of an imagination

00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:15.470
I get really kind of thrown for a loop

00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:16.730
when I'm out in the world trying to do

00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:18.560
the stuff I'm doing yeah imagine being

00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:20.750
I'm in a room with people a small tiny

00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:21.859
room and they just coming in this

00:59:21.859 --> 00:59:23.030
[ __ ] on little the problems and

00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:24.319
you're just sitting there just like yeah

00:59:24.319 --> 00:59:26.540
it's a it's irresponsible to be not

00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:28.940
you're like perfect state of mind it's

00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:29.860
irresponsible to not

00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:33.000
be high yeah but it's not it's not it's

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.880

I went in the room and it's like [ __ ]

00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:42.160
and I like just spun everything around

00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:44.110
and made it like nice look nice I'm

00:59:44.110 --> 00:59:46.150

00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:51.520
when you're microdose and you get real

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.230
in touch with physical environments and

00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:55.540
surroundings you're like this is wrong I

00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:57.070

like three-quarters of the way through

01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:46.089
that thing and I'm like I'm comfortable

01:01:46.089 --> 01:01:48.490
I'm comforts get super [ __ ] because

01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:49.930
the redoubtable hasn't kicked in yet

01:01:49.930 --> 01:01:52.390

get high dude so I [ __ ] I've ripped

01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:02.560
this other volcano bag to the point

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.300
where I'm like alarm bells are ringing

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:05.920
I'm like alright this is I'm in the edge

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:07.330
of weirdness so I'm like my eyes are

01:02:07.330 --> 01:02:10.089
closed I've like a little [ __ ] like

01:02:10.089 --> 01:02:12.849
gushing creeks and stuff I'm like this

01:02:12.849 --> 01:02:15.880
is what it's about so I'm like I found

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:17.440

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.109
morph bag and I'm on that couch dude I

01:02:20.109 --> 01:02:22.359
can't explain this but I close my eyes

01:02:22.359 --> 01:02:24.250
and then by then it's like you know I'm

01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:26.109
spacing this out this is 45 minutes and

01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:28.420
I'm so stoned I don't even notice the

01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:30.160
weed edible kick in because you're just

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.420
so you close your eyes and start

01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:34.030
meditating dude I went to it and I I was

01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:36.839
literally eyes closed in another space

01:02:36.839 --> 01:02:39.190
so I and I got real into like religious

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:40.780
because then you're hit with this rush

01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:42.940
of anxiety so I got real endure like

01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:45.460
religious thinking for like using

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.170
religious tapping into like that

01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:48.790
whatever synced up between your brain

01:02:48.790 --> 01:02:50.170
and body in terms of what religious

01:02:50.170 --> 01:02:51.910
thought does for people so I like I'm

01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:53.470

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:54.730

something I used by the behemoth but I

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:52.840
think it's called something else and it

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:55.270
might just be the behemoth but the so

01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:56.800

fact that it's like things are good you

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:18.730

01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:20.620
so I start being like getting and

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:22.180

01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:46.150
religion is different dude if I get

01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:48.400
shit-faced enough I'm like gods in my

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.880

around and say you suck dude I'm telling

01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:01.810
you the so I got real so I'm sitting

01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:03.880
there and I got really what was I stuck

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:07.510
on I got real into negativity in general

01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:09.010
so I'm doing I'm literally I'm in my

01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:10.109
head I'm imagining

01:06:10.109 --> 01:06:12.150
like literally observes the cement walls

01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:14.670
around me and it was as if in a certain

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:16.470
way I was kind of like moving through

01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:18.150
into like this other realm where I'm in

01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:19.589
my eyes closed sitting in this realm

01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:21.450
where it's like you're not supposed to

01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:23.400
be here dude you're supposed to be up

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:24.869
around you're supposed to be bugging out

01:06:24.869 --> 01:06:26.819
your basement being like I'm too high

01:06:26.819 --> 01:06:29.670
this is uncomfortable then I just fully

01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:31.140
transcended the idea of negative

01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:32.549
thoughts well you know at least for the

01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:35.369
moment and all I started thinking about

01:06:35.369 --> 01:06:38.400
was when people think negatively

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:41.249
they're just crying with words so when

01:06:41.249 --> 01:06:42.690
people are just sitting there being like

01:06:42.690 --> 01:06:45.059
Moo sucks this is unfair like when you

01:06:45.059 --> 01:06:46.619
see grown people walk around an office

01:06:46.619 --> 01:06:48.989
being like oh man we [ __ ] promoted

01:06:48.989 --> 01:06:51.210
blue-blue you're just literally you're

01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:52.680
we're all seeking the amp we're all

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.630
seeking the womb again so like this just

01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:56.309
a person yeah if they're like if I cry

01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:57.720
enough someone's gonna come pick me up

01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:02.069
off my feet and be like Oh sounds like

01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:03.749
damn dude people majority people just

01:07:03.749 --> 01:07:05.039
walking around crying with words and

01:07:05.039 --> 01:07:06.989
they could just be [ __ ] going into a

01:07:06.989 --> 01:07:09.720
trance state dude I saw there was a I

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:11.130
got real into like simulation theory

01:07:11.130 --> 01:07:12.089
during this time it was like an hour

01:07:12.089 --> 01:07:14.549
long my eyes closed I'm so [ __ ] high

01:07:14.549 --> 01:07:15.809
and I'm sitting there and I was just

01:07:15.809 --> 01:07:18.779
like I started accessing my fear so I

01:07:18.779 --> 01:07:20.430
was like interacting with my deepest

01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:22.049
darkest fears I can't I can't remember

01:07:22.049 --> 01:07:23.940
them or I can't really remember them but

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:25.710
I was in a spot where like you know

01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:27.150
where I'm it's like a transfer you're so

01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:28.650
stoned you're also meditating there's

01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:30.569
like the nature music I'm sitting there

01:07:30.569 --> 01:07:33.089
blindfold and then I'm like my deepest

01:07:33.089 --> 01:07:34.829
darkest fears I was pulling them out one

01:07:34.829 --> 01:07:36.450
by one out of like a server kind of

01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:37.559
thing this is all I can imagination

01:07:37.559 --> 01:07:39.239
exercise I wasn't like hallucinating all

01:07:39.239 --> 01:07:41.130
this yeah but it's like pretty vivid and

01:07:41.130 --> 01:07:44.099
I'd pull it out and then it was like

01:07:44.099 --> 01:07:45.779
boom that's gone and I would feel what

01:07:45.779 --> 01:07:47.700
it's like to have that like baseline

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:50.730
fear removed from my life gone I'm like

01:07:50.730 --> 01:07:52.079
man that's really nice and then I you

01:07:52.079 --> 01:07:53.190
know I'm sitting there this is the next

01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:56.369
like hour so no fear at all and then

01:07:56.369 --> 01:08:02.849
dude when it starts what [ __ ] what well

01:08:02.849 --> 01:08:04.499
that's them down here I'm afraid

01:08:04.499 --> 01:08:06.210
something deleting files from my fear

01:08:06.210 --> 01:08:08.130
server get the [ __ ] out yeah dude so I'm

01:08:08.130 --> 01:08:10.259
like I have to get the bags look in the

01:08:10.259 --> 01:08:14.970
bags they're like well this is crazy and

01:08:14.970 --> 01:08:17.219
then there was that there's the fear

01:08:17.219 --> 01:08:18.750
server getting out there's the idea of

01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:20.819
like just us all moving towards the womb

01:08:20.819 --> 01:08:21.450
just like we're

01:08:21.450 --> 01:08:23.010
out of it man like trying to set up

01:08:23.010 --> 01:08:24.360
situations so we can completely just

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:26.130
bliss out again you know obviously we

01:08:26.130 --> 01:08:27.780
don't have that till he died and the

01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:30.690
ecologist loved the womb dude yeah so

01:08:30.690 --> 01:08:32.610
where we come from and there was the

01:08:32.610 --> 01:08:34.950
idea can you conceptualize death as the

01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:36.210
womb are you thinking that's kind of

01:08:36.210 --> 01:08:37.890
some horrible cliff you fall yeah I

01:08:37.890 --> 01:08:39.060
think I think it's gonna be like that

01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:39.330
again

01:08:39.330 --> 01:08:41.850
yeah just gone again exact same thing

01:08:41.850 --> 01:08:43.890
like before but it's also like are you

01:08:43.890 --> 01:08:45.660
gone you go back into matter you know

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:47.490
I've been reading a lot of young John

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:49.020
I've been reading a lot of young about

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:53.130
how answers a job about how man I

01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:55.080
there's no way I can explain this don't

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.660
sound like a total [ __ ] [ __ ] just

01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:59.760
that whole idea of like God is

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:01.290
unconscious and we're a little [ __ ]

01:09:01.290 --> 01:09:03.030
physical manifestations to become

01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:05.280
conscious for God and be like well this

01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:07.680
is what we're supposed to do mm-hmm but

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.060
either way I'm not gonna get it I I'm

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:11.310
unqualified what are we at right now our

01:09:11.310 --> 01:09:11.940
night

01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:13.890
don't worry about it I'm getting close

01:09:13.890 --> 01:09:15.180
well you got you gotta leave I got a

01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:17.070
drive to [ __ ] in New York again Oh get

01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:19.440

that [ __ ] yeah I all that's all I have

01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:23.010
to say dude the fear server's tight and

01:09:23.010 --> 01:09:24.750
so what happened at the end wore off I

01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:27.480
could feel my body adapt my nervous

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:30.440
system go back to my usual kind of like

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:32.940
felt that come back feel all the ego

01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:35.370
Ellis yeah dude knows a guy that was

01:09:35.370 --> 01:09:37.230
gone that was going for like an hour and

01:09:37.230 --> 01:09:38.970
then you come and leave the trance and

01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:41.130
it just like fully but in the rest of

01:09:41.130 --> 01:09:42.660
the day every time I get [ __ ] it's

01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:45.090
gone for like seven hours dude I'm going

01:09:45.090 --> 01:09:46.680
but then here's the thing though you

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:48.150
know I lose consciousness

01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:50.580
I know I'm out of that realm dude

01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:52.560
different where does my consciousness go

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:55.110

01:10:05.490 --> 01:10:07.050
