the attorney

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.959
uh phrasing behind it what's your mind

00:09:50.959 --> 00:09:52.720

why are you objecting i am objecting

00:10:00.959 --> 00:10:02.000
because

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.839
what shane it seems that shane is

00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:05.360
unaware that

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.240
both sides of the bet are equally gay

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.800

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.399

and then when we went double for nothing

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.959

well i'd like to your honor i'd like to

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.000
point out four brady

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.559
downs it can be considered team

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:14.880
touchdowns

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.120
brady's on that team we're not defining

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.320
how it could be brady

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.600
that's the argument you want to make

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.760
also brady is the first person to touch

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.559
that ball

00:19:22.559 --> 00:19:24.240
they did not direct snap to the running

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.240
back they did not direct snap to a wide

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.039
receiver

00:19:27.039 --> 00:19:28.880
that ball went from tom brady to a

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.120
player to the end zone

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.160
my lawyer was talking i don't know i

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.080

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.840
please i i just have a question real

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.559
quick

00:19:58.559 --> 00:20:01.760
did this fourth touchdown

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.840
was it a rushing touchdown from tom

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.080
brady

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.240
did he run the ball in or are you guys

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.600
talking about a handoff and you're

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.400
giving him credit for a touchdown

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.480
i i'm sorry you'll have to do your own

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.000
research i'm not here to tell you who

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.880
scored and what i expected as a lawyer

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.120
against

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.039
it was the carolina panthers mr

00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:26.240
fournette could not have scored that

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.840
touchdown without being given the ball

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.679
oh you [ __ ] guys you know that's

00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:31.600
[ __ ] it was a handoff i thought i

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.240
thought

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.080
i just remembered the saints russian

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.080
touchdown that tom brady had that's what

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:36.559
i was

00:20:36.559 --> 00:20:37.919
i thought you were talking about he ran

00:20:37.919 --> 00:20:40.720
one in you're he literally handed it off

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.080
and you guys are trying to claim that's

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.360
a touchdown

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.120
that's [ __ ] crazy you know that's

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.480
crazy

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.480
yep again like i like like i want to

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.159
repeat if you listen to the whole show

00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:52.559
we later amended and we said tom brady

00:20:52.559 --> 00:20:56.000
is responsible for that we didn't say

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.159
you haven't seen that part yet this is

00:20:58.159 --> 00:20:59.760
crazy you said we haven't

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.360
do we have that audio do we have the

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.360
audio of you saying that he would be

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.400
responsible

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.360
i mean i i hope maybe the defendant can

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.280
get it this is his responsibility to get

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.480
it

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.600
it's my lawyer's responsibility to find

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.080
what the score is here's the deal i'm

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.080
i'm hoping that a producer who got your

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:18.799
audio

00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:20.480
was able to get that audio as well if

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.400
not though i trust that when the judge

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.840
is given the whole episode and he could

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.520
watch it in its entirety he'll be able

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.120
to make the decision for himself but

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.559
there is no decision

00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:31.600
there's no this is literally nothing you

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.720
guys have zero

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.600
[ __ ] like what are you talking about

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.240
if you're not

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.039
winning fits you must acquit no matter

00:21:39.039 --> 00:21:39.360
how

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.200
assertive you hear that chain it doesn't

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.280
mean that it's okay it means

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.039
i mean i'm telling you i said the bucks

00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:46.480
would score four touchdowns

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.159
tom brady would be responsible for those

00:21:48.159 --> 00:21:49.919
four touchdowns they did

00:21:49.919 --> 00:21:53.919
they won the game therefore glutes

00:21:53.919 --> 00:21:56.799
part of the clip for the touchdown it

00:21:56.799 --> 00:21:58.159
was a handoff okay

00:21:58.159 --> 00:22:00.960
what'd you say much uh there is more to

mr brady was responsible uh five

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.080
pieces of bush kill the audio go ahead

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:42.480
pete

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.360
mr brady was responsible in his uh 23 of

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.000
35

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.760
passing attempts he moved that ball down

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.840
the field directly responsible for each

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.520
and every score that the buccaneers had

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.559
whether it was from

00:24:52.559 --> 00:24:54.559
the field position given to the kicker

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:56.720
or the handoff given to the running back

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.400
mr brady was responsible for each and

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.159
every one of those scores

00:25:00.159 --> 00:25:02.799
i mean my lawyer can you please say

00:25:02.799 --> 00:25:04.720
something on that

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:08.640
keeping for the results look

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.120
i mean i get it this is you got to do a

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.080
bit here we got to

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.919
drag this thing on but there's literally

00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:15.919
[ __ ] you can't give him a touchdown

00:25:15.919 --> 00:25:16.480
this is

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.640
stupid [ __ ] this you lost the bet

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.240
you gotta get fingered by pete or

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.840
whatever

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.240
find that audio i think that's the audio

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.760
i heard pete's gotta figure you

00:25:38.159 --> 00:25:39.840
it appears to me your attorney is trying

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.919
to act out some sort of sexual fantasy

00:25:41.919 --> 00:25:43.120
that i'm not interested in

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.960
me and bobby are only interested in gay

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.520
sciences

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.559
you were just fired by your client i

00:25:52.559 --> 00:25:53.919
think

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:54.990
what happened

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:57.360
[Music]

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.200
i'm here something happened he just

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.960
became a fugitive i just ordered a bench

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.880
warrant for bobby

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.840
testing the linguini bobby's jerking off

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.559
i'm not kicking it off i'm here

00:26:08.559 --> 00:26:11.679
got him fired up i understand shane's

00:26:11.679 --> 00:26:12.080
point

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.880
i i yes tom brady points to tom brady

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.320
get on that play

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.240
how many what how many fantasy points

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.760
did he get

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.760
i don't know because you don't get

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.880
credit

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.799
for touchdowns that somebody else scored

00:26:27.039 --> 00:26:28.320
i don't know i don't play fantasy

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.720
football well that's how it works

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.120
you don't get a quarterback there's zero

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:33.919
stat line

00:26:33.919 --> 00:26:37.440
that says handoff touchdown for tom

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.120
brady find me that stat how many

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.080
handoffs

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.919
for touchdowns do quarterbacks have

00:26:41.919 --> 00:26:45.200
right but the the idea was that it was

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.880
not excuse me the team was not going to

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.039
do well because tom brady was past his

00:26:51.039 --> 00:26:51.679
prime

00:26:51.679 --> 00:26:54.400
and my argument was that tom brady will

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.000
take that team

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.880
to uh the victory and there will be at

00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.520
least

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.240
four touchdowns scored the only pass

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:02.559
group

00:27:02.559 --> 00:27:05.360
look at it jesus christ this isn't even

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.799
close

00:27:06.799 --> 00:27:09.440
uh mr celta i will remind you to please

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.679
not lie in my courtroom

00:27:11.679 --> 00:27:15.039
why you play fantasy football

00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:18.159
i know that for a fact oh i'm i'm on a

00:27:18.159 --> 00:27:21.840
team that plays

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.679
i don't understand the scoring of

00:27:25.679 --> 00:27:27.679
fantasy football you get one

00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:29.200
you get one otherwise i hold you in

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.799
contempt next time

00:27:30.799 --> 00:27:31.919
i don't believe shane was really

00:27:31.919 --> 00:27:34.159
watching super trooper

00:27:34.159 --> 00:27:38.640
no story oh sorry how dare you

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.080
even worse starship this is the type of

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.840
person we're dealing with though that's

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.320
that's who you're dealing with he lies

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.960
he doesn't listen he i mean this is it

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:53.120
i mean i knew you said i i know you said

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.840
[ __ ] troopers i know you said that

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.720
everybody did he's not even listening

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.080
how many touchdowns did he throw

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.360
one how many touchdowns did mr brady

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.640
throw in that game he threw two to his

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.240
running back in the belly who ran them

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.320
in

00:28:13.279 --> 00:28:15.360
have you ever been what are you doing

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.640
you're embarrassing yourself you don't

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.880
[ __ ] football like that

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.840
you sound like a girl

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
i like to point out mr gillis is sector

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
yeah yeah yeah that's why i think that

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.840
the real the real problem here is mr

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.159
kelly's um love for mr brady and his

00:28:34.159 --> 00:28:35.679
sadness so that he no longer plays in

00:28:35.679 --> 00:28:38.159
new england

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:43.760
yeah that's neither here or near

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.399
you're on it i mean how much i love

00:28:46.399 --> 00:28:46.960
brady

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.880
has nothing to do with this and this is

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.120
just pure [ __ ]

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.120
these are these are pretty much tampa

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.559
bay fans who

00:28:54.559 --> 00:28:56.960
don't know what winning is they don't

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.320
know how it feels

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.240
so they get a little taste and they

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.080
[ __ ] lose their minds

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.000
and they're delusional it's like they're

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.480
on a drunk oh my god we got 15

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.919
touchdowns we got 20 he threw for 26

00:29:09.919 --> 00:29:11.120
touchdowns

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.960
they don't understand i don't blame them

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.440
but it's it's just they're [ __ ] false

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.760
i'd like to ask all parties involved

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.960

this

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.840
to four touchdowns seems to have been

definitive bet outlining what's

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.440

trying to claim

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.880

i'll out would you would you personally

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.640

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.519
quarterback

00:33:31.519 --> 00:33:33.360
if you only had one passing and the rest

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:36.080
were [ __ ] handoffs

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.600

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.519

00:33:39.519 --> 00:33:41.279

00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:44.880
ruling i can't tip i can't tip my hand

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.080
thank you thank you good job shane yeah

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.200
that's not even

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:53.840
it's embarrassing this is

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.240
this is why you guys should just stop

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:58.880
being bought

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.200
you should say i cheer for the red team

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.640
from now on that's what you guys should

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.320
say

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.320
how much is the kick how much does it

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.000
count if they kick it

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.919
what what did you say jane shane you

00:34:09.919 --> 00:34:11.440
said had a similar instance

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.879
and that's why you chose him as your

00:34:12.879 --> 00:34:15.200
lawyer

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.720
what you yesterday said that you picked

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:19.679
chain because he had been through

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:20.000
something

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.800
similar to this oh no shane has been

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.679
through

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:27.119
many situations where he's uh

00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:30.560
had to uh deal with people who

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.320
say the wrong thing who make their own

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.800
[ __ ] scenarios up and he's dealt with

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.359
it so i know shane number one

00:34:39.359 --> 00:34:41.040
he knows football because he's a real

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.200
man number two

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.639
uh you know uh he is going to stick up

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:48.240
when you say a real man you mean a man

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.919
that would suggest shoving macaroni into

00:34:49.919 --> 00:34:51.280
another man's [ __ ]

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.359
that kind of man he understands that

00:34:53.359 --> 00:34:55.200
that's the manliest thing ever

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.200
because if you're a man then you think

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.320
you guys gonna win

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.400
then put your ass on the line yeah you

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.040
can't have you put

00:35:03.119 --> 00:35:05.680
what look i i'm asking shane if he's

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.880
ever been his [ __ ]

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:11.200
before if he's a real man i

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.200
look my dad taught me at a very young

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.839
age only putting that online

00:35:15.839 --> 00:35:17.200
bet your [ __ ] if you know you're

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.960
gonna win son right

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.640
so i've risked it but it's only been

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.079
guaranteed wins

00:35:22.079 --> 00:35:23.760
okay and there's nothing gay about you

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.520
know sexually assaulting and physically

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:31.839
dominating another man

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:52.880
uh i like the eagles though the nfl okay

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.720
i don't know i i feel there may be some

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.000
bias there

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.440
even though the pittsburgh steelers

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.440
picked up claypool from notre dame i

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.440
would not let that sway my decision

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.440
i do like claypool's the man steelers

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.480
steelers are actually cool

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.160
also i used to love the bucks dude the

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.079
bucks used to be my [ __ ] team

00:36:08.079 --> 00:36:09.680
when i was younger right when they got

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.520

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.960
i haven't i haven't ruled yet no you're

one you weren't you're a bully

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.560
you're a bully you definitely won

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.160
there's no questioning one i

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.560
i genuinely thought when you called me i

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.280
thought

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.040
i just remembered tom brady's rushing

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:44.800
touchdown against the saints

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.599
so i thought he passed for three and

00:36:47.599 --> 00:36:48.880
physically ran one in

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.040
himself and i was like that's gonna be a

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.640
tough argument but if you said

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.960
throw for four that count and then you

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.800
guys are talking [ __ ] one touchdown

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.320
he was responsible for

00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.920
and he handed the ball off and you're

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.520
claiming it no

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.280
i mean this is not you have to get

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.359
actually broken by somebody

00:37:05.359 --> 00:37:09.040

rule on what i hear what is presented to

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.560
me so you have to present

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:57.359
everything so far the audio that i have

00:43:57.359 --> 00:43:58.880
is that the last

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.520
piece of audio that we just heard is

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:02.000
that

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.400
the last piece of audio that i'm going

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.440
to be hearing from this

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:08.480
hey hey pete step back a little

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:11.440
uh i i i think that if you listen to

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.720
that whole episode which

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.720
i i hope that you would your honor you

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.640
will find the parameters of the bet

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.560
clearly laid out which for some reason

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:20.400
the producer that bobby pays did not

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.079
provide that for today's show

00:44:22.079 --> 00:44:23.760
what i'm asking you though is listen

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.240
listen so we heard the two clips earlier

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.800
okay and that was from a show that was

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:29.599
prior

00:44:29.599 --> 00:44:31.599
to this show that we just heard this

00:44:31.599 --> 00:44:33.599

00:46:47.119 --> 00:46:48.000
the

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.599
defendant using the word throw pass

00:46:51.599 --> 00:46:54.240
you've you've now understood that we saw

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.599
the score there was not

00:46:55.599 --> 00:46:57.520
four touchdowns thrown there was not

00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.480
four touchdowns by mr brady

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.319
they were i mean you i'm just saying

00:47:02.319 --> 00:47:04.960
that the evidence we presented today

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:08.880
i feel entrusted that's enough evidence

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:09.440
to clear

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:12.640
my good name and and to

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:16.240
show you what uh how this man

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:19.200
has tried to manipulate court manipulate

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:19.599
by

00:47:19.599 --> 00:47:21.839
this this court will not be manipulated

00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:23.040
that's why and also

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.520
wanna i wanna show i've been keeping

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:27.599
notes i am very aware of everything

00:47:27.599 --> 00:47:28.960
that's being said

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.880
you're right can i say something too i

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.200
asked you to be to try this case

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:38.240
and the defendant said no um

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:40.800
get your linguini out of my [ __ ] mr

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.440
kelly

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:44.720
yes go ahead mr calzone i think what we

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:45.520
learned today

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:49.440
is that bobby manipulated

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.359
our producer to provide the audio that

00:47:51.359 --> 00:47:52.480
only

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:55.200
that only helps him and i guess that's

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.040
my fault for trusting that our producer

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.960
would be fair and equal

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:02.319
and uh i've rest on the fact that you're

00:48:02.319 --> 00:48:05.280
going to review objections

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:08.880
at the paralegal council uh i found all

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:09.200
the

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.520
audio from that episode and i did play i

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:12.240
did not

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:15.200
restrict anything mushroom yeah you know

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:15.839
you did

00:48:15.839 --> 00:48:18.720
mush did i ask you anything today i was

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.400
not prepped by either side

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.800
as to what to do and not put so thank

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.640
you as my own

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.680
thank you thank you mr mush uh i will

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:28.319
tell you this

00:48:28.319 --> 00:48:31.520
uh mr celta as i ruled austin is a

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:33.040
producer for both of you

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:36.079
under the guise of celta and kelly uh

00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:38.640
you talking to mush goes under the same

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.559
ruling so he should have got you stuff

00:48:40.559 --> 00:48:42.400
if he didn't that's on him that's also

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.760
on you so

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:47.359
but i am allowing for you to get me any

00:48:47.359 --> 00:48:48.160
other audio

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.920
and make sure that it's sent to kelly's

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:52.160
side as well so that they can review it

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.240
and they can confirm it as well and we

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:55.920
will have that up until

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:59.040
the uh final verdict tomorrow uh and i'm

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.119

00:49:01.119 --> 00:49:02.960
think that the only thing that we've

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:04.160
really

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.000
really found out today for sure is that

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.240
bobby really wants to put macaroni in my

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.200
[ __ ]

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:11.760
and his and is dead set on doing it and

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:12.800
i don't know

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:16.079
as a man as a man

00:49:16.079 --> 00:49:20.160
and a man yes i do to show you

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.960
what being a man is all about number one

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.079
you make a bet

00:49:24.079 --> 00:49:27.359
you lose you keep it be a good

00:49:27.359 --> 00:49:31.119
loser don't be a sore loser out there

00:49:31.119 --> 00:49:33.760
i'm teaching men out there how to be men

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:37.119
by sticking linguini in your butthole

00:49:37.119 --> 00:49:38.559
i would also like to point out that i do

00:49:38.559 --> 00:49:40.640
not win if bobby wins because instead of

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.480
your butthole my butthole gets touched

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:42.880
now

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.920
attacks the bobby's double or nothing

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.880

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.680

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:54.880

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.240

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:01.280
no that's it i i what

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:05.200

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:08.559
yes okay what

00:50:08.559 --> 00:50:13.839
that right there what

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.760

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:21.200
brady yeah this is uh this is this is

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.960

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:25.280
doing this mr

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:26.720
you're wasting the court's time we all

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:28.240
know what mr brady looks like he's

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:30.640
beautiful

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.280
not in the tampa bay outfit he's not not

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.280
that ridiculous logo

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:38.240
like this pewter brings out her eyes his

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.359
beauty

00:50:39.359 --> 00:50:42.000
his beauty does not change his stats i

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:42.400
will

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.720
leave it at that and uh i will accept

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:45.920
the audio

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:48.800
real quick save you some time i did find

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.000
more audio it is

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.480
prior to what you've heard already so it

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.480
is in between the two clips

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:56.720
you have already heard so this is this

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.559
is before that's me okay explain it to

00:50:58.559 --> 00:50:59.440
me much this is

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:01.280
uh in between the first two clips and

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:03.280
the last clip i heard

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.280
correct you heard you saw two clips from

00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.640
the show this is in between those two

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.000
clips when i was asked to stop

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.040
playing okay

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:14.880
go ahead and play that got it

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.960
you gotta admit you're you might you're

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.319
gonna be a little scared

00:51:20.319 --> 00:51:23.359
if he loses next week and he doesn't

00:51:23.359 --> 00:51:25.040
throw a lot of touch sounds that's his

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:25.599
fault

00:51:25.599 --> 00:51:27.520
because the buccaneers defense played

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:28.880
like [ __ ] too they couldn't stop the run

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:29.760
at all

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:33.040
so if if it's all tom brady's fault if

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.480
he throws two interceptions again and

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.000
then we got a problem

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.800
yeah but i also think it's a culmination

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.640
of a bunch of things

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.240
one none of those guys have ever played

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.000
together before and he's learning a new

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:44.640
scheme

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:48.800
a new team team a new scheme what is it

00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:50.480
madden

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:52.960

high your dimples are

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:57.839
ah both descriptions were his fault

00:51:57.839 --> 00:52:00.000
yeah that's all they have audio from

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.280
what you guys talking about football on

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:02.640
