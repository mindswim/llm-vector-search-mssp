i think people are pretty yeah people

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.800
are pretty relaxed about it honestly i

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.560
tried to get it dorne covid

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.880
i was bug shaking during

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.039
i tried to get hiv

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:46.720
no luck looking for paws loads on

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.400
craigslist i think i [ __ ] up i only

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.759
had sex with my wife that's why i think

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:52.000
i didn't get any hiv was that i was blog

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.440
chasing i was like if she has it she has

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.320
it was there a moment

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.160
was there a moment when you were younger

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.440
on the internet when you and your boys

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.520
found out that uh you could search for

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.440
paused loads on craigslist and find bug

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.160
chasers what what what what is this not

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.160
common knowledge what are pause loads

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.800
there was like it was probably all fake

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.560
but the the story was that there was

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.160
like dudes going on craigslist looking

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.000
to get aids so they would post like

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.360
looking for pause loads oh shot positive

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.600
positive and hiv positive loads why were

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.880
they trying i mean i guess that's just

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.080
the question of the bug chaser why

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.199
aren't you so you can fit in with

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:28.560
everybody else

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.840
i guess so you can just get over the

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.680
hump and just like i mean if i never use

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.600
a condom if like six out of your ten

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.440
friends have hiv there's pressure to get

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.919
it true yeah you know and condoms do

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.440
suck that bad

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.560
all right so what's the deal with this

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.160

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.080
condom it's like yeah it doesn't kill

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.440
you anymore

yeah i mean i feel like yeah

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.039
i might start yeah i think if you die

now you really are just not aware

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:55.440

being gay

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.959

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.680
manchester united the dsm the

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.080
big book and you're supposed to pick

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.120
from one of those in order to get

cool and then they'll like fund you but

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.240
that there was you could like diagnose

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.920
people up until i think 1972 as being

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.399
homosexual oh wait a second disorder oh

00:09:56.399 --> 00:09:58.160

wait so they knew about hiv in 1972

00:10:10.079 --> 00:10:11.920
i don't know for some reason for some

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.240
reason they do say is that why when you

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.920
give blood like have you had sex with a

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.720
man

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.800
prior to 1972 or they say something

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.079
there's like a cut-off thing no i think

00:10:20.079 --> 00:10:22.240

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:25.680
i'm telling you there's there's a

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.959
there's a question on there might be the

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:29.040
same thing there's a question on there

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.560

experience oh please dude that's very

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.399
interesting [ __ ] we gotta have a

00:12:02.399 --> 00:12:03.680
phone

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.079
bluetooth dude the um

00:12:06.079 --> 00:12:07.600
it is the

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.440
wildest [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.079
the absolute wilder [ __ ] so i

00:12:12.079 --> 00:12:15.200
you but you smoked dmt before yeah so

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.560
you know i'm talking about noah noah's

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.560
here today also noah smoke dmt we both

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.920
smoked it

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.560
dude so the first time i showed up or

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.000
it was really just one time but i first

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:24.959
got there

00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:26.720
and uh tom and spud were like here just

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.639
take it i had this thing like take three

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:30.720
hits and you'll blast off

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.480
this was changus so it's like diluted

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.240
into an herbal format i think so like

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.519
burns easier

00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:36.800
right because with dmt you have to

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.560
actually like vaporize it you guys smoke

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.560
like a crack pipe yeah yeah the change

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.680
when you infuse it in the channel you

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:42.800
can actually just burn that with a

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.160
lighter it's burnt and it was kind of

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.240
nice too is that like it's so gross yeah

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.120
i think i'd rather do that i think if i

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.720
smoke anything out of anything that

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.079
looks like a crack pipe i'll have to

00:12:52.079 --> 00:12:54.160
sell my furniture like right away just

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.000
like that's true

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
yeah yeah it's it's the crack pipe's

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.360
unallowing to me as well but what

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.880
happened so

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.320
i'm like i heard like you just need

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.160
three hits and you're done so i just

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.160
focused on getting three quick hits and

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.600
there was two grades of the change there

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.560
was like

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.160
one strength and a double strength so i

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.480
was smoking the lower strength and i was

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.600
like just do that the first time to get

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.959
accustomed

00:13:14.959 --> 00:13:16.399
so i'm like thinking i'm gonna blast off

00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:17.839
i had what's called a misfire when you

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:20.000
don't smoke enough dmt and it is the

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.160
worst [ __ ] feeling dude everyone said

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.600
it's worse to have a misfire than to

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.920
like just go smoke way too much what is

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.240
the misfire dude so you smoke it and you

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.519
get this

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:31.839
indescribable body load that's i don't

00:13:31.839 --> 00:13:33.519
find it very pleasant at all

00:13:33.519 --> 00:13:36.160
and you get hot so i just laid on a

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.639
couch just piping hot

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:40.560
and just like felt just everything has

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.800
peacock feathers i didn't see anything i

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.000
didn't get any visuals get my eyes

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.079
closed the whole time oh man yes i was i

00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:47.360
was sitting there it was the saddest

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.639
thing i was sitting there like i'm

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:50.959
putting a blast off any minute

00:13:50.959 --> 00:13:52.720
i was like i hope i didn't [ __ ] this up

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.160
so i'm definitely not doing this again

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.920
it sounds like a quaalude story from

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.480
this dude i'm telling the wolf

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.839
waiting room i was the wolf of wall

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.279
street for seven minutes i laid on the

00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:03.839
chair just hot it was like

00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:05.199
i just kept my eyes closed like it's

00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:06.639
coming and then fine i was like i don't

00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:08.079
think i did this right yeah it also

00:14:08.079 --> 00:14:09.839
sounds like the internal dialogue of

00:14:09.839 --> 00:14:11.760
like a person in an audience watching a

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.519
comedian that looks like they're about

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:16.399
to be funny but never tells a funny joke

for like 45 minutes really yeah it's

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:57.440
pretty cool though just a nothingness

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.600

like muddy and it was like

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.760

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.079
getting like washed around in like weird

00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:14.800
fake shapes so if virtual boy was a

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.079
reference i don't get that right it's

00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:17.760
like it was like a shitty old video game

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.279
thing where it was just red lines on a

00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:20.720
screen yeah you could put it just like

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.120
extremely low like visual gotcha uh yeah

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.320
someone explained it weirdly enough

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.680
someone explained ketamine they felt

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.759
like they were on like a like a mario

00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:30.959
pirate ship

00:15:30.959 --> 00:15:33.279
just [ __ ] buzzing around the darkness

00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:36.000
okay getting yeah fired at him yeah yeah

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.959
yeah yeah

00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:38.720
kind of activity little dude's popping

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.759
out of the floor and like just throwing

00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:40.630
wrenches at you

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:43.199
[Laughter]

00:15:43.199 --> 00:15:44.160
that was like the way you described

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.079

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:48.160
ketamine and go on my pirate ship cool

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.759
like a dark pirate ship you were to sail

00:15:49.759 --> 00:15:51.360
around on yeah i felt like i was stuck

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.279
to the ceiling of a thing or like a

00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:55.199
conveyor thing and i was going over

00:15:55.199 --> 00:15:57.279
different weird [ __ ] and i had like

00:15:57.279 --> 00:15:59.600
virtual boy or like daredevil vision

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.040
really yeah

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.040
and i was completely sedated that sounds

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.800
sinister like i feel like i couldn't

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.399
even move my face i couldn't even open

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:08.639
my eyes if i wanted to but it was so

00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:10.320
nice though this was 45 minutes of just

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.320
bliss dude double vision yeah daredevil

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.240
vision sounds sick yeah you can like see

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.160
behind things with your eyes closed

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.160
sonar yeah yeah but there's it's so

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.399
abstract yeah yeah yeah anyway anyway

00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:22.560
cool i'm recommending it

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.000
bats are just eating the noise they're

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.279
here

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:26.720
like that's how they use sonar they're

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.560
just like you're they're moving toward a

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.839
noise and just eating it and there's

00:16:29.839 --> 00:16:31.040
just happens to be bugs there because

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.639
that's like what so what about so well

00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:34.399
is that real yeah messing with me no i

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:36.160
swear to god that's so stupid is that

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.360
what it was so much more refined than

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.800
that yeah cause there's a there's a

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.360
blind guy that travels he travels around

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.680
he rides a bike he's doing clicks yeah

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.199
he'll go in like a he'll be like a

00:16:45.199 --> 00:16:47.120
parking lot yeah yeah riding his bike he

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.560
just doesn't hit anything he's eating

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.839
until he eats a curb

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.600
has he ever had like a wide shot on this

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.120
operation i'd love to see the course

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.040
they have set up for this guy yeah yeah

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.639
yeah there's a pretty good optimal

00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:02.160
obstacle course like paperboy they

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.560
should make them paperboy

00:17:07.039 --> 00:17:08.799
he's really riding a bike using [ __ ]

00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:10.640
yeah locations that's his wave he just

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.880
rides around using echo

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.640
yeah because they send it they send like

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.959
a he's asian yeah but could he could he

00:17:16.959 --> 00:17:19.520

rc car and like a guy break dancing

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.919

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.280
it was a very stereotypical and it's

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.240
like the gettysburg of this battle

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.880

third or fourth in line and there's a

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.480
very stereotypical asian lady

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.080
like she looks like she's from every

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.760
hood movie that's ever been made in the

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.840
90s oh i can picture it she's wearing a

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.559
flower shirt

that's the ultimate broke flex too you

00:24:08.159 --> 00:24:10.240
talk about this mystical bank account

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.760
i know a dude who was trying to borrow

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.360

thought there was a lot according to the

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.400
movie

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.720

that documentary uh crazy rich asian

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.919
stuff oh yeah yeah yeah no he's unhinged

00:25:51.919 --> 00:25:53.840
rich asian you know what i mean

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:54.960
is that what it was

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.640
like were they crazy were they like they

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.159
were lunatics oh you're saying you've

00:25:58.159 --> 00:25:59.840
never seen that movie no i've never yeah

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.360
so it's people watching ethnic movies

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.320
it's

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.320
not out of my house no i don't play that

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.559
don't play that [ __ ]

00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:08.480
basically what it is it's just like um a

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.760
bunch of asians are in a mental

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.200
institution

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.200
and uh they get like abused there and

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.279
then david james has never told me the

00:26:15.279 --> 00:26:16.880
truth i swear to god

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.520
i swear that says i've known him he has

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.679
never told me the truth

00:26:21.679 --> 00:26:23.520
ever once yeah i don't think that's what

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.200
that shows about either sid i'm with you

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.360
yeah

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.840
yeah that's a that's japanese guys got a

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.600
tough break on the whole internment camp

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.559
thing

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:34.880
because that was like nobody truly truly

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.480
nobody cares about that at all

00:26:38.559 --> 00:26:40.080
oh my god i feel so bad about that

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.159
everyone's always like ah yeah it was

00:26:42.159 --> 00:26:43.520
like a minute though dude as soon as we

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.799
realized you guys were good we let you

00:26:44.799 --> 00:26:46.240
go what are you complaining yeah they

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.000
get the ultimate [ __ ] the internment

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.919
denial where it's like yeah barely sort

00:26:49.919 --> 00:26:50.640
of

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.000
cause their internment was you know i

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.600
think that's the power of pearl harbor

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.840
dude i think pearl harbor got leveraged

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.840
so hard that it's like shut the [ __ ] up

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.559
if you're japanese

00:27:00.559 --> 00:27:02.080
it's like how many

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.159
like 3 000 soldiers died and they

00:27:04.159 --> 00:27:06.559
treated it like it's like we got a tiny

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:09.200
we counted a holocaust with it oh yeah

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.720
um for sure

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.960
yeah we counted a nuclear holocaust yeah

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.799
and we're just like dude and then at

00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:16.400
that being like that's obviously not a

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.640
full holocaust but like dude we ring

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.919
we've rung that out i think it's

00:27:19.919 --> 00:27:22.320
technically counted as a holocaust

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.600
wait what if you kill a certain amount

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.880
of people it's a holocaust there's a

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.799
number there's a threshold i think so i

00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:28.640
think the final holocaust is just like a

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.480
massive killing

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.799
yeah it's not right the holy spirit yeah

00:27:32.799 --> 00:27:34.960
you

00:27:41.039 --> 00:27:44.159
how many is a holocaust

00:27:44.159 --> 00:27:46.880
i think six million

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.279
i think it stops at six mil

00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:50.960
that's what holocaust deniers really are

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.880
like no i was 500 therefore the

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.880
holocaust

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.760
is that what did you get noah

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.360
it's just a massive killing i don't like

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.320
that

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.320
i think it's a systematic thing

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.919
systematically i think that's what makes

00:28:03.919 --> 00:28:05.600
it a holocaust that's what you mean like

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.799
if you're like murdering people and

00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:08.320
there's a line it's a holocaust but if

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.760
you just drop it technically i think

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.000
chickens should be like an assembly line

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.039
yeah because it's like a systematic

00:28:15.039 --> 00:28:17.279

yeah

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.480
we're back in a liquor store this asian

he was being truthful about having fun

00:31:30.559 --> 00:31:33.760
he didn't bust out his cash

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.360
he's like i have a statement right here

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.000
wells fargo is like oh he's serious yeah

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.480
but uh yeah so she's calling him a bum

all i'm about to get to yeah yeah

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.519
because basically everybody had switched

00:31:51.519 --> 00:31:54.000
to her to the asian side oh because she

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.600

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.720
yeah yeah they're all rude for her and

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.480
then this one guy's like hey man i just

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.440

it so he could finish

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.080
and then she goes see you're a bum

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.519
people have to give money just so you

00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:23.440

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.600
the question he gave her material he

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.360
paid for that and he paid two dollars

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.640
just watched him get it and he kept on

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.399
saying i got money [ __ ]

00:32:30.399 --> 00:32:31.519
not today

00:32:31.519 --> 00:32:33.679

00:32:33.679 --> 00:32:36.240
your life oh yeah because i there was a

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.080
chinese place on my old corner when i

looked in the hood and it was like

00:32:40.399 --> 00:32:42.000
dude you could just stand on the corner

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.840
and watch the same interaction happen

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.600
fine oh it's over and over again it's

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.279
battle dude but could you imagine if it

00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:49.600
only like if you were in a situation

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.320
where it only cost you two dollars to

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.360
facilitate the utter destruction

00:32:56.559 --> 00:33:00.240
that's an impulse buy of somebody's soul

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.000
right at the counter

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.360
yeah true

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.839
forever that's in mid-summer

00:36:23.839 --> 00:36:25.520
that's that's true that's like well i

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:28.079
mean i think that's true for germans

00:36:28.079 --> 00:36:30.400
yeah yeah this is like a yeah it's a

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.480
thing whoa i've never seen midsummer did

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.160
anyone get it yeah that's your love

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.560
potion it's a love poem yes love potion

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.320
it's an old baby mama love potion it's

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.000
definitely not true i'm pretty sure this

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
is backed up yeah this is for sure yeah

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.599
i've inadvertently drank the love potion

00:36:43.599 --> 00:36:45.680
a couple times yeah just due to the fact

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.680
that i'm kind of reckless like that

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.359
and it didn't work i'll tell you that

you're gonna get me

00:36:53.119 --> 00:36:55.040

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.400
already has a kid

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.480
there you go that makes more sense

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.400
yeah imagine someone keeps on doing this

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.400
they don't know that stipulation

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.720
no one is in love with me it's not a

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.850
love potion this is

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:11.280
[Laughter]

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:15.040
oh my god you almost got stepped at it

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.040
there was a there was an old thing

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.160
people used to do back in the hunter

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.520
gatherer times where all the girls would

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.200
shave their pubes and like the one witch

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.839
doctor lady had to eat all the pubes

00:37:23.839 --> 00:37:25.280
and then from this they would construct

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.200
i swear to god i swear to god i swear to

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.040
god and she would eat all the pubes and

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.720
like that if her eating the pubes would

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.560
unleash like a spirit force like if like

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.079
the dudes got out of control it was some

00:37:34.079 --> 00:37:35.119
weird thing

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:36.560
it was like a female conspiracy to like

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.839
chomp all the pubes in the village and

00:37:37.839 --> 00:37:39.520
that would unleash like a

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.079
like a golem that's a good barrier to

00:37:42.079 --> 00:37:44.480
entry for being a witch doctor yeah yeah

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.640
what i mean like eating every pube in

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:47.760
the village

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.119
or if you need to give her like a tuft

00:37:49.119 --> 00:37:50.640
of your cubes it wasn't all your pubes

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.240

bv like bacterial vaginosis and that

yeah you're not homeless there's no

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.800
i think it's just going to be the age of

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.079
aquarius i think it's the way it's so

00:42:18.079 --> 00:42:19.599
you challenged they you walked you

00:42:19.599 --> 00:42:21.520
approached a couple eating dinner

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.920
outside yes and you challenged the woman

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.680
of the two to smell your armpits

00:42:30.079 --> 00:42:31.280
i was just going to be the voice of the

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.880
people that are not wearing deodorant

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.240
anymore oh i was going to real quick

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.160
drop some so she did this to shut you

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.319
down she did she was like

00:42:38.319 --> 00:42:39.760
she did wait was this a white lady

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.359
though it was a white lady she might

00:42:41.359 --> 00:42:44.960
have been hanging out dude she might be

00:42:45.119 --> 00:42:47.520
i really respect your smell's experience

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.440
that's what she was doing there's a very

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:50.720
high chance that that could have been

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.319
the case but probably terrified these

00:42:52.319 --> 00:42:53.599
there were there was not there was a

00:42:53.599 --> 00:42:55.760
natural there was a natural reaction she

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.160
had when she went in for the smell she

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.319
went

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.920
and then like me and her me and the guy

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.920
looked at each other and like like

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.920

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.000
meal yet or were they in the middle of

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.119

hammered yeah it was it was probably a

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:42.560
very such an intoxicating experience

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:43.920
that yes she doesn't remember it yes

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.359
that is true

00:43:45.359 --> 00:43:47.119
what's the beginning of her addiction

00:43:47.119 --> 00:43:49.280
now

00:43:50.079 --> 00:43:51.440
she can't go back

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:55.640
there's probably a subreddit for this

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.920
that'd be a tough joke though it'll be a

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.280
tough jones

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.800
try to like sneak up on black dudes and

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.400
sniff them that would be like yeah yeah

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:14.480

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.599
oh yeah yeah she needs a natty a natty

00:44:23.599 --> 00:44:24.880
smell that's hard to find in the black

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:27.359
community the natty approach yeah yeah

00:44:27.359 --> 00:44:29.599
to armpits and then she was like she's

00:44:29.599 --> 00:44:31.599
like wait she she was blown away by the

00:44:31.599 --> 00:44:34.560
fact that she was being drawn in and she

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.079
was like well let me let me just smell

00:44:36.079 --> 00:44:37.760

now let me check that belly hair was

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:49.560
that was the guy jerking off

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.640
he did listen cindy's going to be a

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:55.119
armpit cuckold

00:44:55.119 --> 00:44:58.319
he had a ponytail oh oh oh

00:44:58.319 --> 00:44:59.839
yeah the ponytail energy probably

00:44:59.839 --> 00:45:01.680
transcended he was wearing vibrating

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.400
panties

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:05.920
every time she went in for a snail she

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.599
pressed this button yeah he was doing

00:45:07.599 --> 00:45:09.070
that he was like biting his finger

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:13.280
[Laughter]

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.440
yeah so so yeah it was a victory it was

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.040
a victory for the deodorant free

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.119
lifestyle i'd say and the whole time i

00:45:19.119 --> 00:45:20.319
was just like i don't know something

00:45:20.319 --> 00:45:22.240
about this situation is not a dog it was

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.760
official i bet you that that lady had an

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:27.200
ace of spades tattoo on her somewhere

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:28.480
dude

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.720

deodorant

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.760
dude this has nothing to do with the

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:38.160
science

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:41.440

00:45:51.599 --> 00:45:53.599
an only fan's couple bro

yeah would you take a hall pass if the

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.160
con if a conditional was

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.560
but a dude has to be there fapping the

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.400
entire day

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.599
but you know you have sex with anyone

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:24.400
until that guy comes you gotta die

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.079

and just get so used to them that gets

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.599
more and more turned on rather like they

00:49:35.599 --> 00:49:36.800
say like in nature you're supposed like

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.480

trying to essentially cheat on at her

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.200
personal favorite thing to talk about no

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.480
one talks about this but like when

00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:57.359

while it's in the class

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:13.839

closed on a conversation that proves why

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.410
we shouldn't have a woman in the tooth

00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:40.640
[Laughter]

00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:42.559
she would have been so unfun during that

00:58:42.559 --> 00:58:44.319
part of the conversation trying to be

00:58:44.319 --> 00:58:46.240
all technical well i haven't gotten too

00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:48.880

player for that episode true i would

00:59:07.599 --> 00:59:09.119
just i'd worry that it would devolve

00:59:09.119 --> 00:59:10.799
into like 8th grade dance energy where

00:59:10.799 --> 00:59:13.119
i'd be like

00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:15.280
speaking of which did we do have we ever

00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.440

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:18.960
be the sickest dude ever have we ever

00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.400

00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:36.960
tiebreaker what do you guys think what's

got going on

00:59:38.799 --> 00:59:40.799
dude kenny g is the man he just lives

00:59:40.799 --> 00:59:43.200
his life to get good at [ __ ] all day

rage he is

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.280
and he's totally powered by nerd rage

00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:51.119
dude yeah that's completely that has to

00:59:51.119 --> 00:59:52.559
be the next assignment he could be like

00:59:52.559 --> 00:59:54.799
a lex luthor of cool of sick dudes like

00:59:54.799 --> 00:59:56.799

dudes and then exactly villains out the

00:59:59.599 --> 01:00:01.440
second that like the actual sick dude

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:05.200
it's fair that's funny he does rule the

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.680
dude is the dude rules but he's burning

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.720
on a dirty fuel source which is nerd

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.480
and i worry about that okay that might

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.240
be the dirtiest feeling the darker the

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.359
