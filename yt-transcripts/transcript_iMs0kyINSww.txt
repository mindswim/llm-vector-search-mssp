Title: Psych Naw Meditation Series: Ep 1- The Physical Level of Meditation
Description: Sup. 
In this video we discuss the very basics of meditation, breaking it all the way down to the mechanics of breathing and what not. Very chill. Very simple. 
It's part of a three video series that consists of three levels of practice and understanding. The first is the Physical level. The second is the Cognitive level. And the third is the Spiritual level.

WEBVTT

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.919
compulsive thinking going on and on and

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.440
on and on and on all the time

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.800
it's a habit you keep telling yourself

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.639
where you are who you are what's going

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.720
on how good it is how bad it is

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.320
reading the newspaper of your mind

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.320
so there's a difficulty about stopping

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.920
that activity and you really have to

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.039
stop it if you want to be sane

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.040
but first of all you have to learn how

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.680
to stop thinking

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.760
[Music]

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.650
well how do you do that

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.840
[Music]

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.520
as your mind becomes

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.920
more secure you will find

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.120
that thoughts move slow that's what

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.960
meditation will gradually

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.199
lead to you begin to see your thoughts

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.120
which in former times you could not see

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.000
because they move so rapidly and so fast

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.840
as long as your thoughts are going

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.760
faster and faster you cannot control

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.840
them they will control you

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.000
as your thoughts begin to go slower and

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.520
slower

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.119
you will recognize them you will be able

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.479
to regulate them

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.360
so in the same way as a muddy turbulent

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.400
pool

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.439
quiets itself when left alone

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.680
you have to know how to leave your mind

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.000
alone

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.159
and i'm testifying to you from

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.439
personal experience that

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.479
i don't have to keep my mind thinking

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.320
all the time

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.079
when it is not necessary it doesn't

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.079
think that's the way

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.200
you through using thought symbols

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.439
you free the mind from thought it's like

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.439
using a thorn

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.040
to pick out a thorn that's stuck in the

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.040
skin

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.719
this is permanent joy

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.680
this is the peace that passes all

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.920
understanding

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.959
between the thoughts under the thoughts

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.120
is the profound silence and all we have

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.540
to do is become aware of that silence

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.959
[Music]

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.480
all we have to do is become aware of

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.239
that silence

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.380
by realizing it's there

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.490
[Music]

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.239
welcome to psych knowledge mindfulness

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.160
and meditation module

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.640
um this is the psychedelic temple so

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.000
just relax

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.319
take it easy i've been actually really

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.599
looking forward to doing this video i've

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.800
been doing a lot of research about

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.920
meditation

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.519
and like the traditions it comes out of

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.040
and blah blah blah so

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.840
i think i have a pretty good idea in

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.440
terms of how to address a lot of the

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.920
hang-ups people have about meditation

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.519
and how to help people do it in a way

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.200
where they actually get benefits rather

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.480
than like sitting there with like one

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.519
eye open like

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:04.800
i don't know dude i don't know i don't

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.080
know if i'm having a breakthrough i'm

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.519
not even chilling i'm not chilling that

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:08.239
much or

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.080
maybe you're like you're doing minute

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.440
you know you're trying to do meditation

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.879
or you're meditating and your brain is

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.159
just going like this is

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.800
dumb this is dumb this is a waste of

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.200
time if i think it's dumb that means it

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.280
is dumb and i therefore adjust my

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.440
behavior accordingly because my thoughts

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.680
are correct but

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.760
it's like okay that's one way to live so

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.959
we're gonna address all that stuff we're

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:31.519
going to start

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.040
super basic and kind of step this down

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.319
in a different level so

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.920
all you have to do is chill

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.200
listen take the words in you can judge

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.560
after you're done

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.640
take the words in first we're trying to

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.400
penetrate through the ego the thinking

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.040
mind

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.560
through the clutter of judgments and

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.879
comparisons and anxieties and

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.560
blah blah blah blah blah all the stuff

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.920
that chatters in your mind while all

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.519
you're doing is supposedly

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.720
breathing and noticing your breath

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.000
all the other stuff is stuff you don't

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.439
need within the moment of meditation it

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:04.560
doesn't mean you're ditching it

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.159
or letting it go forever and becoming

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.319
some sort of mindless monk

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.560
it's just within the space of meditation

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.920
you're learning how

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.400
to put that nasty mind of yours

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.120
on a leash

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.720
and then eventually when you get good

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.199
enough you can let the leash go

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.199
and just let your mind do its thing and

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.840
it's not bothering you anymore you go oh

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.520
that's just my mind conjuring up

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.120
thoughts okay it's like a bird

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.120
being like and you're like what the

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.479
is that but what the did that bird

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:33.360
say

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.560
you start to view your mind as just a

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.160
natural phenomenon that produces things

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.440
called thoughts that you can notice and

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.880
do stuff with

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.160
or notice and just be like hmm a weird

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.720
thought

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.400
and going on about your day so

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.400
let's get started

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.240
all right we're going to do something of

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.000
a warm-up to get started but before we

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.479
do

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.320
let me say that this series of three

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.720
videos will break meditation down into

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.800
three distinct levels that correspond

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.479
with what a person might ultimately want

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:05.199
to achieve

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.199
the first or the physical level is the

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.600
simple relaxation of the mind and body

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.600
easy enough the second or cognitive

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.520
level is to help us sharpen or

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.360
discipline the mind so that we can enjoy

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.520
the benefits of meditation in the space

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.160
of time

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.639
outside of its practice so the first or

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.560
physical level helps us relax the mind

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.960
and body within the space of meditation

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.479
but maybe you're doing that it feels

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.080
good and then you walk upstairs or go to

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.520
work and you're just spazzing the

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.880
out all the time and you're like

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.080
i'm gonna meditate again i gotta

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.000
meditate again okay maybe you need to

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.440
take your practice to level two this is

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.880
what i'm talking about to

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.720
sharpen or discipline the mind so that

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.400
you're not creating all that tension to

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.479
release in the first place

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.520
and the third or spiritual level is for

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.240
spiritual or life fulfillment it is a

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.759
total deepening of your meditation

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.120
practice to the level where

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.120
it's pretty much all you think about and

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.639
the idea behind it is

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.319
if you do that correctly according to

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:57.759
the theory and the texts and the

00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:59.280
teachers and all that stuff

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.479
you can attain what is called moksha or

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:05.600
nirvana or samadhi or there's a million

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.440
words for this thing it's just that you

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.440
somehow rewire your brain to be

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.400
chiller than the word chill can even

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.039
describe

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:16.639
i haven't attained it obviously i'm

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.960
still kind of a spaz and a freak

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.160
but that is the ultimate path

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.639
so again you can say i'm not i'm cool on

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:26.000
the spiritual stuff let me just get my

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.880
heart rate down

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.720
no problem my brother you can stop at

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.240
the physical level you might say i kind

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.440
of want to sharpen the mind

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.960
no problem my brother you can stop at

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.639
level two you might say

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:38.080
i'm going all the way and i can say

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.440
here's a couple books you can read i've

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.360
read them and you know i still haven't

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.720
attained moksha or

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.919
nibbana but my mood has increased

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:47.280
significantly and i

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.520
don't freak myself out as much how do i

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.520
know

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.039
because i used to get stoned and freaked

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:55.039
out now i still get stoned and freaked

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:56.319
out but it doesn't really bother me that

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:58.000
much

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.840
that's just motion dude and a

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.000
lot of the weirdness around meditation

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.440
has to do with the fact that we're

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.199
seeking help on the first or physical

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:05.840
level

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.840
but we're watching stuff about the

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.599
spiritual practice of meditation

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:11.680
and it gets us all flustered and weirded

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.440
out and confused and like what the

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.039
this shit's for weirdos i just

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:15.680
want to chill

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.840
or maybe we want the benefits of the

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.759
spiritual level

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:21.199
but we're only doing stuff from level

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:22.720
one or two we get all confused thinking

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.560
like this just doesn't work for

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.919
me man

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:27.199
almost everyone i talked about

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:29.520
meditation who has tried it usually says

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.960
something to the tune of like

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.639
but i'm really just not good at it i

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:34.639
can't do it or sometimes it just doesn't

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:36.400
 work and these kinds of issues

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.840
will be addressed in the second and

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.000
third videos but for now

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.880
we're just going to try to form a very

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.639
basic foundation so that we can get

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:46.639
started and gauge where we're at

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:48.879
before troubleshooting our issues at the

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:51.039
different levels

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:53.199
so being that this is the physical level

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:54.160
level one

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.680
we're going to make sure we're breathing

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.199
properly before getting into all the

00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:58.160
other stuff

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.680
you might be thinking i'm breathing

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.199
properly i'm pretty sure i'm breathing

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:03.039
right now

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:04.960
and yes no doubt you are however there's

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.319
a ton of research on how

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.720
the way people breathe affects them

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.479
breathing in through the nose versus the

00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:11.199
mouth

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:13.039
pulling in through the chest versus into

00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:15.120
the diaphragm there's even a clear-cut

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.960
relationship between how many breaths

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.720
you take per minute and things like your

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.639
heart rate the way your heart beats

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:22.639
blood flow circulation

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:24.960
lung function digestion and a ton of

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.319
other important health things

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:28.160
we all just probably take for granted

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.360
think of it this way

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.680
how you eat is important if you eat like

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.680
 you will at some point end up

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.839
feeling like the same thing applies

00:08:35.839 --> 00:08:36.800
to breathing

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.399
and even though the science behind

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:40.399
breathing can get kind of technical and

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:41.919
tricky the practice of breathing

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:42.880
properly is

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.880
very simple and anyone can do it so

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:48.720
let's spend a few minutes getting into

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.120
the rhythm of slow and proper breathing

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.800
if you can do this lying down that's

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.320
great but if you're sitting up

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.480
that's fine too just make sure your

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.320
spine is as straight as possible

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.320
without tensing yourself all up if

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.680
you're lying down

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.720
you don't have to worry about any of

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.000
that stuff but again if you don't want

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.959
to lie down

00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:09.839
no problem

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.880
[Music]

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.360
okay so first just close your eyes and

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.760
try to notice the way you're breathing

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.760
put one hand on your chest and your

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.880
other hand on your stomach

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.320
notice the parts of your body that rise

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.000
and fall with your breathing

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.680
is your chest rising first when you

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.000
breathe or is the area surrounding your

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.760
belly rising first

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.600
try to relax and pay attention to what's

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.120
going on with your body while you take a

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.959
few more breaths in and out

00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:42.640
to let go of any tension or thoughts

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.560
about what you're doing all we're doing

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.160
is paying attention right now we're just

00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:51.839
noticing

00:09:56.399 --> 00:09:58.160
ideally we want our stomachs to be

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.600
rising first when we breathe

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.279
right in that area right underneath our

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:02.720
rib cage

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.279
but to do this we need to relax and just

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:07.440
soften our core

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.519
so let's let's give it a try exhale all

00:10:09.519 --> 00:10:11.200
of the air in your body just let it out

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.120
no need to force it out or strain just

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.640
just relax and just let it out of your

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.000
body

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.839
now keeping one hand on your chest and

00:10:17.839 --> 00:10:19.440
the other on the belly

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.320
inhale slowly through your nostrils

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.920
imagine that there is a balloon right at

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.680
the bottom of your rib cage filling as

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.480
you breathe

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.360
which we can feel as our belly rises and

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.120
exhale through the mouth relaxing the

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.079
body

00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:36.160
letting the belly fall as the air leaves

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.000
and back in through the nose

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.399
filling the balloon as we pull the air a

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:44.560
little deeper down into the kegels or

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.120
what's called the taint area

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.399
and back out through the mouth

00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:52.560
take a few more breaths like this and

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.399
just play around with this

00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:56.240
don't worry about getting it right or if

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.600
you're doing it wrong just

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.839
just mess around if your chest is

00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:01.120
feeling tense

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.680
that's okay just relax the body and try

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.760
to breathe a little more slowly

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.600
there's no need to pull the air in with

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.680
any force whatsoever

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.760
all we gotta do is send the air down to

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.800
our belly

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.399
make sure that the belly is rising

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:16.480
before the chest

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.600
so keep breathing keep feeling the belly

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:29.839
rise and fall

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.519
so we're going to take a few more

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:38.959
breaths but these ones actually are

00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:40.880
going to be a little bit bigger

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.880
keeping the hands in place belly and

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.079
chest draw

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:46.480
a big full breath in through the nose as

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.360
much as you can

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.920
into the belly and you might notice that

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.440
the chest also rises

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.560
after we fill our bellies and let it out

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.480
this is good there's nothing wrong with

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.240
feeling an expansion in the chest while

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:00.959
breathing

00:12:00.959 --> 00:12:02.880
as long as the lungs are being supported

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.760
by the diaphragm

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.160
so let's do another breath in through

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.120
the nose filling the belly

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.800
chest expands and release

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.839
and last one in through the belly

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:20.880
pulling air down to the kegels filling

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.600
the entire body with air

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.880
and back out through the mouth

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:30.639
and we're back just a little warm up

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:31.839
nothing crazy and

00:12:31.839 --> 00:12:33.920
just a recap there's nothing wrong with

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.240
activating the chest while breathing

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.800
but we shouldn't lead with the chest

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.440
because

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.760
that's the job of the diaphragm in terms

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:42.720
of taking air

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.279
into the body a lot of us do the stress

00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:46.160
and whatnot

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.560
adopt a pattern of chest breathing where

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.639
we lead the breathing process using the

00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:52.240
upper portion of the lungs

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.839
that are really just there to lend the

00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:56.000
diaphragm a hand when we get over

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.839
exerted and need more air like if we're

00:12:57.839 --> 00:13:00.480
exercising or stressed out or something

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.639
chest breathing is like running a house

00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:04.480
on a tiny backup generator

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.240
when we can be tapping into the power

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.600
lines instead

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.360
by using our diaphragm and it makes

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.279
sense that we do this considering all we

00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:12.959
ever hear about are the lungs when it

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.160
comes to breathing

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.000
though it helps to think of it this way

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.079
the lungs are more like a laboratory

00:13:18.079 --> 00:13:20.399
they're here to process the air we take

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:22.720
in absorbing all of the oxygen molecules

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.920
and getting them into the bloodstream

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.440
while at the same time getting rid of

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.800
any excess co2

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.120
the diaphragm located at the bottom of

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.120
the ribcage above the stomach is meant

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.440
to actually pull the air into our body

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.200
so that it can be delivered to the nerdy

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.040
scientists working in the lungs

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.959
when we pull air into the bodies using

00:13:38.959 --> 00:13:41.440
just the chest we are forcing the nerdy

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.959
scientists of the lungs

00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:44.480
to do the heavy lifting that should be

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.160
reserved for the jacked

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.839
chad-like teamsters that make up the

00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:50.160
diaphragm so what's happening when we

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.240
belly breathe is that the diaphragm is

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.920
expanding in the front

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.720
the sides and back of our body a full

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.040
360 degrees it's like a balloon that's

00:13:59.040 --> 00:13:59.920
inflating

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.160
and when we release it letting go of the

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.320
breath it acts like a pump

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.279
moving any excess co2 out of our lungs

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:09.519
which in turn allows the lungs to absorb

00:14:09.519 --> 00:14:10.399
more oxygen

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:12.079
which in turn helps the heart relax

00:14:12.079 --> 00:14:13.839
since it doesn't have to beat and pump

00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:14.880
as hard to move

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.199
oxygen through the blood which in turn

00:14:17.199 --> 00:14:18.800
chills out the nervous system since the

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.000
heart rate slows down

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.760
which in turn chills us the person out

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.839
now that's just one piece of the puzzle

00:14:25.839 --> 00:14:27.120
it's a big piece of the puzzle

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.720
and i encourage everyone to continuously

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.240
practice that throughout the day or set

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.000
aside time in the morning do a couple

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.199
minutes of it in the morning

00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:34.639
a couple minutes before you go to bed

00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:36.639
that way you can try to retrain your

00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:37.360
body just

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.560
to start breathing like that

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.480
unconsciously

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.000
the other piece of the puzzle is how

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.079
many breaths we take per minute

00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:46.240
a nice pace for meditation is six

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.360
breaths per minute

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.279
if you do seven or five that's fine it's

00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:51.040
nothing to freak out about but six is

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:51.360
just

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.279
easier to track given that a minute is

00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:55.839
60 seconds so we're gonna try to do

00:14:55.839 --> 00:14:58.880
two minutes of slow

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.040
belly breathing or diaphragmatic

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.639
breathing and see what's good with this

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:03.920
we heard about it

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.680
kind of experienced a little taste but

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.120
let's see if we can go for

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.519
six breaths per minute while focusing on

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:11.600
taking air in through the belly

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.360
keeping a straight spine again if you

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.639
gotta lay down lay down

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:16.959
so just relax and we'll continue to do

00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:18.399
this we're gonna do two minutes

00:15:18.399 --> 00:15:21.040
six breaths per minute i have a timer

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.079
all you need to do

00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:24.320
is just if you follow along with me i'll

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.079
be on the timer and then you'll be on

00:15:26.079 --> 00:15:27.730
time as well

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:31.910
[Laughter]

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.839
[Music]

00:15:35.839 --> 00:15:37.839
alright so take a breath in through the

00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:42.079
nose just let that belly rise

00:15:42.079 --> 00:15:47.519
and into the nose

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.800
and back out

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.040
in

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:02.320
out through the mouth

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.839
breath in

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.480
and out

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.199
into the nose

00:16:18.639 --> 00:16:23.120
out through the mouth

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.360
in

00:16:28.399 --> 00:16:30.880
and out

00:16:33.839 --> 00:16:37.839
into the nose

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.279
out through the mouth

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.519
breath in letting the belly rise

00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:52.560
back out through the mouth

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:57.519
into the nose

00:16:59.199 --> 00:17:04.959
now through the mouth

00:17:04.959 --> 00:17:07.839
into the nose

00:17:09.039 --> 00:17:12.240
and out through the mouth fully exhaling

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.199
clearing your lungs

00:17:15.679 --> 00:17:19.839
into the nose

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:23.199
and out of the mouth

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.319
one more into the nose

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.480
and out through the mouth let all the

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.880
air out

00:17:39.679 --> 00:17:42.960
and gently open your eyes back to

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.679
reality

00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:45.360
so that's it that's diaphragmatic

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.679
breathing that is slowing your heart

00:17:47.679 --> 00:17:48.880
rate down

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.720
just by being conscious of the way you

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.799
breathe so

00:17:52.799 --> 00:17:54.880
you technically just meditate that's all

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.840
it is that's the

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.840
physical aspect of meditation it's

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.160
indisputable

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.720
if you breathe properly and you take

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.200
nice

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.080
full breaths trying to exhale more than

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.520
you take in

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.760
you will calm your nervous system your

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.520
heart rate will slow down

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.799
you'll relax that'll just happen

00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:17.520
now here's the trick we haven't really

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.120
dealt with the mind yet which we'll get

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.720
into in the next one we'll

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.480
we'll mess around a little bit with it

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.080
in this one but we'll kind of explore

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.120
way more detail

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.320
because again that's the trick of

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.240
meditation we can do

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.320
all of this stuff we we know how to you

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.480
know jump start the car we can kind of

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.320
override our physiology

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.600
consciously to slow it down but when the

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.039
mind enters the picture it can start

00:18:39.039 --> 00:18:40.559
being like this is dumb

00:18:40.559 --> 00:18:42.400
what are we even doing i hope someone

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.880
doesn't come and see me doing this

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.240
now you're speeding the body back up

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.360
you're trying to slow it down but the

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.400
mind's being like no no

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.400
no ramp it back up something bad is

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.280
going to happen your body's like oh

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.520
so we're going to do a little bit more

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.200
of a meditation

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.760
just kind of touching on the idea of how

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.240
do you

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.799
when that thing comes up what is the

00:19:02.799 --> 00:19:04.640
mechanism of letting go

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.400
and just kind of releasing that tension

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.240
created by the mind we're going to dab

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.160
our toes into this just to kind of take

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.840
us to the end of this video

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.960
and just know when we get into the

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.720
second one we'll go into the subject in

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.440
depth

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.679
but i just want to give people like a

00:19:17.679 --> 00:19:19.120
basic understanding of what they might

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:25.840
be getting into

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:29.470
[Music]

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.280
so we're going to close the eyes again

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.600
we're jumping back into the meditation

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.000
just like we learned already take a nice

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:36.720
easy breath

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.280
in through the nose expanding the area

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.400
below your rib cage

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.760
and letting it back out

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.520
back into the nose expand the belly

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.559
and out through the mouth

00:19:55.679 --> 00:19:57.520
continue to breathe like this very

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.200
simple

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.200
and as you breathe in notice what else

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.679
is happening in your body

00:20:03.679 --> 00:20:06.080
is there any tension we know our chest

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.120
our belly

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.440
they're kind of doing work right now but

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.799
maybe there's some tension in our

00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:12.080
shoulders

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.799
maybe there's some tension in our neck

00:20:14.799 --> 00:20:16.640
our jaw

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.200
chest back legs just let it all soft and

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.880
as we release our breath

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.799
so we're going to feel ourself expand as

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:25.039
we breathe in through the nose

00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:26.880
and then as we let go of the air within

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.120
us we're going to soften

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.799
just let go of anything if there's any

00:20:30.799 --> 00:20:33.280
thoughts coming up just for now

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.840
let him go and just notice the tension

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.200
melt away as we do this

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.640
breathe into the nose

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:48.159
back out and just softening our bodies

00:20:48.159 --> 00:20:49.919
and if there's any kind of thoughts kind

00:20:49.919 --> 00:20:53.919
of coming up just let them go

00:20:54.159 --> 00:20:57.440
breathing in through the nose

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:01.440
expanding the belly and releasing any

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:01.679
and

00:21:01.679 --> 00:21:05.039
all tension just getting more relaxed

00:21:05.039 --> 00:21:06.799
just letting go more if we can do it

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:08.799
just

00:21:08.799 --> 00:21:10.559
you can even make weird noises like that

00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:14.080
it works in through the nose

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:20.080
scan for tension and then just let it go

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.480
once you feel relaxed just continue to

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.280
breathe

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.120
there's no need to continue trying if

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.440
you feel like you're scanning too much

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.640
just let go of that thought you're done

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.480
just expand when you breathe let the

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.559
belly rise

00:21:36.559 --> 00:21:39.760
and just let it all fall away let it out

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.559
just

00:21:40.559 --> 00:21:44.720
let go of all that air

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.799
as you breathe try to feel the surface

00:21:46.799 --> 00:21:49.120
of whatever you're lying or sitting on

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.640
this could be the force of the ground

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.600
under your feet the seat under your butt

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.520
or even the couch or the pillows

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.240
whatever you're lying back against just

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.360
feel the way that supports your body you

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.799
don't have to think about it if thoughts

00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:03.600
arise

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.200
that's fine but you don't have to engage

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.240
them see if you can notice

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.360
instead of think try to feel the

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.559
difference between those two things

00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:16.960
no need to get it right or be perfect

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.720
just play around with this idea

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.120
again if your mind's producing thoughts

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.760
or if you've just completely drifted off

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.240
totally fine just come back to the

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.360
breath

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.919
come back to the focusing on the rise of

00:22:31.919 --> 00:22:33.600
the belly

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.640
just letting it fall as we feel

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.080
ourselves supported

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.840
by whatever we're sitting or lying down

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.000
on

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:47.200
continuing to breathe letting it go

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.360
there's no need to be doing this right

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.880
we'll be good at this

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.000
that doesn't apply to the space we're

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.280
just breathing we're just noticing what

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.919
the mind's doing

00:22:59.919 --> 00:23:02.880
we're becoming aware of what awareness

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.679
is

00:23:03.679 --> 00:23:07.039
versus what thinking is thoughts

00:23:07.039 --> 00:23:11.039
judgments all of that other stuff

00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:13.760
just in this space of meditation we

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.280
don't need it

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:20.480
we're just relaxing so in through the

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.159
nose

00:23:22.159 --> 00:23:25.280
back out through the mouth

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.799
just sinking deeper and deeper into the

00:23:30.799 --> 00:23:37.840
relaxation just

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.039
because we know that we can calm our

00:23:41.039 --> 00:23:43.520
bodies it's a fact

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.640
when we breathe in slowly we breathe

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.799
improperly

00:23:48.799 --> 00:23:51.120
we let it go our body relaxes oh we're

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.159
doing our bodies a favor right now

00:23:54.159 --> 00:23:56.159
the mind will still be there we just

00:23:56.159 --> 00:23:59.039
don't need it right now

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.400
take in a few more breaths and when

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.760
you're ready

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.960
slowly open your eyes

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.039
okay so that is a very basic form of

00:24:13.039 --> 00:24:13.840
meditation

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.320
just relaxing noticing stuff and letting

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.480
go of tension and honestly you could

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.919
stop the video right there if you want

00:24:19.919 --> 00:24:21.600
to and just do that for five minutes a

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.200
day and you'll be better off as you are

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.400
now a master

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.400
of the first or physical level of

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.880
meditation it is literally that easy

mental benefits blah blah

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.039
just learning how to breathe properly

00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:48.960
alone and making a habit of that helps

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:49.919
as well

every one or two hours or so throughout

00:24:59.039 --> 00:24:59.600
the day

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.159
when the bell goes off take a second

00:25:02.159 --> 00:25:03.679
acknowledge whatever you're thinking or

00:25:03.679 --> 00:25:04.559
feeling

00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:07.120
scan for physical tension and then do

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.880
this kind of meditation for three to

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.480
five minutes or even one minute

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.240
and you will significantly lower your

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.760
stress throughout the day

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.760
and brother that's a guarantee you might

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.039
be thinking like dude

00:25:17.039 --> 00:25:19.520
what that's it it's so simple and you're

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.679
right the practice of meditation

00:25:21.679 --> 00:25:24.720
is very very simple there's nothing

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.320
really to it other than breathing

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.200
relaxing

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.679
and noticing what's coming up but our

00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:30.640
minds

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.120
in this relaxed state usually for some

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.440
reason start to protest we get bored

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.840
we make judgments we assess whether or

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.360
not it's working

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.720
or whether or not it meets our

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.559
expectations all of that stuff and

00:25:42.559 --> 00:25:45.200
mind you none of this has anything to do

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.840
with the simple practice of meditation

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.960
of breathing of being still being silent

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.799
and noticing what's occurring that's

00:25:52.799 --> 00:25:56.000
all you have to do you start to see that

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.840
the thing that makes it difficult

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.600
is that which you will recognize if you

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.960
watch the second video

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:05.279
as your thinking mind or ego

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.200
wait what yes dude everything you think

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.279
is right is no

00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:13.200
um but no there's a part of us that's

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.960
completely rigid in what we think and

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.080
feel

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.480
and we interpret things in a certain way

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.720
that's not always very helpful to us

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.159
does it mean we have to ditch it all and

00:26:22.159 --> 00:26:24.000
let it go no no no

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.760
but you know on every steak there's a

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.039
little bit of fat that you can kind of

00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:30.559
slice off if you want to

00:26:30.559 --> 00:26:32.000
so in the next video we're going to

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.159
descend into the depths of the cognitive

00:26:34.159 --> 00:26:34.960
level

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.120
we did a good job relaxing and releasing

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.000
tension today but

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.520
maybe just maybe we can figure out

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.360
how to not create so much tension to

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.039
release in the first place

00:26:45.039 --> 00:26:46.720
but to do this we need to learn how to

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.880
deal with the mind like we said

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.480
in the next video which will be longer

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.000
and a bit more complicated

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.559
we will begin the path of mental mastery

00:26:54.559 --> 00:26:56.480
of organizing our thoughts and feelings

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.279
within the context of our awareness

00:26:59.279 --> 00:27:00.960
rather than our default mode which is

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.120
the other way around of just

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.200
our awareness being sucked into our

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.559
thoughts and feelings and just

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:07.919
us on a little hamster wheel of trying

00:27:07.919 --> 00:27:09.039
to feel good trying to feel good trying

00:27:09.039 --> 00:27:09.600
to feel good

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.320
oh my god nothing's working or we can

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.320
say hey you go

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.000
you're a helpful ally i appreciate you

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.840
but i'm gonna call the shots from here

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.120
which we'll see how to get into and how

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.720
to do

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.760
so be brave

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.440
for the next video you are to enter the

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.360
ranks of a level 2 meditator

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:35.840
the level of the mind see you there

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.720
you
