00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:42.560

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.199
i'm like a [ __ ] lizard the whole time

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:54.560
i was like i just have no thoughts

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.080
almost like a [ __ ] animal just walks

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.319
around like and then i crunch my nuts

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:00.240

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.680
nutsack and i

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.560

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.319
break and stopped and held my stomach

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:10.400
i almost fell down today in the living

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.639
room by myself i almost fell over and i

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:14.319
was like oh my god dude i'm pathetic oh

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:16.880

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.560
on the table or something

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.800

retrograde i'm not particularly

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.599
religious

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:31.520
it's like i love family it's like i like

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.680

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.960
family

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.400
i don't get like awful i don't go home

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.840
like and sit at the dinner table like

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.520
this is what it's about yeah true i'm

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.639
usually kind of looking around like all

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:41.840
sick you're not

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.280
fast and furious yeah i'm not that into

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.080
family dude yeah yeah but i was like

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.199
how can we

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:49.039
dude how can we even forget about how we

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:50.400
can talk about it

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.800
forget the lyrics

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.639
how can we not even talk about family

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:56.160
family is all we got matt that's

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.400
literally that's been my mental bug all

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.199
day

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:00.960
and i just like it's like it was funny

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.639
because in the morning

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:04.560
i like said hi to if my new thing now

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.000
it's a weird hangout before i say hi to

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.599
people and they don't like absolutely

00:08:07.599 --> 00:08:09.360
greet me like aesthetically i'm just

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.720
kind of like what the [ __ ] that's what

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.080
happened with me and o'connor on sunday

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.400
really i walked upstairs to get in the

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.000
shower he was coming out

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.680
he didn't even say what's up he just

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.360
like stared at me and then walked into

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.879
his room

00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:22.560
so the whole time and i just woke up so

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.639
i was grumpy i was so mad you're a grump

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:26.960
i i was so grumpy for some reason i was

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.720
furious but i was just in the shower

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.800
just like [ __ ] [ __ ] didn't [ __ ]

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.200
say that's just so funny well i think

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.120
it's really unnatural for like

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.000
30 year old men to live together

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.519
yeah because there's like everyone

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.120
develops their own like neuroses and

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.800
then like you should go take that by

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.800
yourself and just like take it out on a

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.800
woman quietly like you shouldn't have

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.880
mentioned battle like like i shouldn't

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.000
be sitting there and have someone look

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.440
at me weird now i'm like what the [ __ ]

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.200
their [ __ ] problem what the [ __ ] he

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.240
[ __ ] looking at what the hell is he

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.839
doing it's like i don't think it's

00:08:55.839 --> 00:08:57.120
healthy uh

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.640
i don't know that's interesting you

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.160
should quietly

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.000
find a girl and be like look she just

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.680
[ __ ] told you butcher times no that's

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.080
just because that's what you're doing

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.120
i don't

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.120
i'm super chill no i know you're super

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.519
chill but you stopped living with men

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:13.360
i know but i'm not just saying it now i

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.720
believed it when i was living with men

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.560
i'm like dude this is like

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.200
this is weird we're too old

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.800
but it's not bad it makes sense to save

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.519
money but i remember being like

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:25.279
it's just weird to be like it's

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:26.880
somewhere and then like you hear someone

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.959
making noise and you're like man i wish

00:09:28.959 --> 00:09:30.399
everyone to bed at the same time i went

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:31.680
to bed because i don't feel like hearing

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.120
people right now yeah i usually don't

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.720
have that though yeah i usually don't

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.880
care your last man standing usually yeah

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.200
nighttime

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.440
even if i'm not like even when i was

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.279
working i really didn't give a [ __ ] i

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:44.959
hate it it was just annoying to hear

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:46.480
what people were laughing and yelling

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.839
that's the thing too yeah they were

00:09:47.839 --> 00:09:49.360
actually funny at the time i'd be like

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.279
all right that's funny i'll let them go

00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:52.800
but if they're just yelling for the sake

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.040
of yelling that's [ __ ] annoying yeah

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.760
but uh this place has worked out for me

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.680
i'm not i'm not here

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.600
that often yeah

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.600
i'm not trashing the dig so i but this

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.920
this is different than like

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.440
i don't want the listener to think this

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.440
is like some [ __ ] real world episode

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.160
where it's oh now you're trying

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.320
eight people in one house just because

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.920

[ __ ]

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.080

it's okay to be white

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.400
and then to have people freak out just

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.000
to look like [ __ ] [ __ ] that is

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.600
funny it's pretty wonderful they um

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.799
they've been getting it's funny how it

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:52.159
goes back and forth it's like the right

00:20:52.159 --> 00:20:53.440
does something bad the left is something

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.880
bad recently the left took a couple

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.080
elves with that

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.000
lindsay shepard what happened there was

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.760
her name lindsay shepard that i forget

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.960
i'm probably butchering her name but it

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.600
was the ta in canada that like she had

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.039
like a secret recording of her meeting

00:21:05.039 --> 00:21:06.640
with people she just showed a video of

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.559
jordan peterson and she introduced it

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:11.760
saying like this is just one take on the

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.760
on the grammar like thing of her i think

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.120
it was saying like they

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.120
can't be used in the singular

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.640
and that was like jordan peterson's

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.039
thing on that and since she showed that

00:21:21.039 --> 00:21:23.280
she's like i have no dog in this race i

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.559
just want to show you the opinions that

00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:25.520
are out there and you guys can talk

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.320
about it some one student complained

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.159
about it and they had her in saying like

00:21:30.159 --> 00:21:31.760
you can't do that they're kids they

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.200
can't handle videos like that and it was

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.280
nothing bad either that he said and she

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.960
recorded them and it's they sounded so

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.559

00:21:38.559 --> 00:21:39.840

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.440

00:25:20.159 --> 00:25:22.400
she's like that i passed out

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.799
and then i woke back up so deep put that

00:25:24.799 --> 00:25:27.279
ass to sleep i don't know what happened

00:25:27.279 --> 00:25:29.120
that got taken down though that account

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.159
got taken down of course you're not

00:25:30.159 --> 00:25:31.440
going to be like man this sexual

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.440
predator was [ __ ] great

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.640
it was not even she was saying like

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.840
trying to say like i was in so much

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.200
shock from like being called in to be

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.960
like take off your shirt she was like i

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.799
was so scared for my job i had sex with

00:25:40.799 --> 00:25:42.720
him up dude that was that was the thing

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.919
but so all right

00:25:43.919 --> 00:25:45.520
i keep cutting you the [ __ ] go ahead

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.720
please that's the whole point of this

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.400
but i'm so

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.000
and this is going to be a horrible take

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.919
yeah this is not i'm already ahead of

00:25:51.919 --> 00:25:53.919
this one with anxiety this is going to

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:56.000
be a good take but you hear these

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.440
stories and this is probably not the

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.880
best example but like yeah you know how

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.039
we all day you get online and and

00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:02.559
facebook and instagram like all that

00:26:02.559 --> 00:26:04.559
[ __ ] it's like this kick-ass woman did

00:26:04.559 --> 00:26:07.520
this women are [ __ ] badass yeah and

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.200
then the next story is like i didn't

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.840
know what to do because i can't do

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.760
things with you yeah yeah that's like

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.279
are women kick ass or are they

00:26:15.279 --> 00:26:17.600
completely helpless retards that we need

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.960
to shelter

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.159
yeah and that's probably the worst

00:26:22.799 --> 00:26:24.159
that's the age-old question though

00:26:24.159 --> 00:26:25.679
because it's like they're like well

00:26:25.679 --> 00:26:27.120
clearly it's not fair because he holds a

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.960
position of power and it's like

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:29.840
okay

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.440
then tell matt lauer be like kindly

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.679
press that button before i scream rape

00:26:33.679 --> 00:26:35.760
in your room and you get fired yeah and

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.279
let me the [ __ ] out and if you fire me

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:38.799
so be it i'm not having sex with you

00:26:38.799 --> 00:26:41.120
dude but apparently so she was like i

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.400
feared for my job i didn't know what to

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.480
do so i had sex with matt lauer and her

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.559
husband divorced her was that the first

00:26:46.559 --> 00:26:48.320
thing was like he called me in order to

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.320
take off my shirt we kind of started

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.760
having sex but i passed out so i don't

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.520
really know when i woke up

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.279
and then like there was like also

00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:57.760
husband divorced her so it's like

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.120
she was like i didn't know what to do

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.279
and her husband was like divorce yeah

00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:03.520
that's your [ __ ] husband yeah so it's

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.159
like it's like so you chose matt lauer

00:27:06.159 --> 00:27:08.559
possibly not liking you at your job over

00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:10.480
your husband and marriage

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.799
basically but it's like it's like that

00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:15.279
was another not a good one

00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:17.360
but it's also that is it's weird though

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.039
to be like

00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:20.480
and i i won the same thing because it's

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.960
like are you a fierce independent

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.799
[ __ ] it's like obviously you have to

00:27:24.799 --> 00:27:26.799
shelter women to some extent but like do

00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:28.080
you think it's obvious we need to

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.720
shelter women yeah dude you know if matt

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.480
lauer [ __ ] locks the door on a woman

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.679
you gotta be like you gotta yank the

00:27:33.679 --> 00:27:35.120
other side like matt open up your

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.440
[ __ ] weird rape door dude why who the

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.279
[ __ ] installs a rape door apparently

00:27:39.279 --> 00:27:40.640
they were saying like well like and then

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.840
so the network had to come out and be

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.520
like well it's just an ego thing because

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.600
they're playing middle no it's they were

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.279
like it was just an ego it was a gag

00:27:47.279 --> 00:27:49.039
blah blah blah and it's like

00:27:49.039 --> 00:27:50.400
it's an expensive [ __ ] door to

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.919
install dude

00:27:51.919 --> 00:27:53.279
and you can't just do things around an

00:27:53.279 --> 00:27:54.480
office building without having people

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.159
like sign off matt lauer didn't pay for

00:27:56.159 --> 00:27:57.200
the [ __ ]

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.279
store i just wish we could agree on what

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:01.679
side of the spectrum women were on well

00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:03.200
are they helpless retards or are they

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.320
kick ass

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.000
they're like snowflakes

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.360
they're like individual snowflakes

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.399
because if they're all badass

00:28:08.399 --> 00:28:10.720
independent women then that lady has no

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.720
room to stand by being like i didn't

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.520
know what to do i felt pressured so yeah

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.279
but if she was a helpless [ __ ] then

00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:18.880
yes matt that's

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:19.760
wrong

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.000
matt lauer is a bad boy apparently

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.279
he was having sex with a lot of people

00:28:23.279 --> 00:28:24.559
in that building according to these

00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:27.279
reports yeah no [ __ ] it's matt lauer and

00:28:27.279 --> 00:28:29.440
he's apparently dealing with helpless

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.679
retards and all he has to say is hey

00:28:31.679 --> 00:28:33.039
come into my office take your shirt off

00:28:33.039 --> 00:28:34.640
we're gonna have sex yeah and then every

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.919
single one of them was probably like

00:28:35.919 --> 00:28:38.399
okay i don't know what to do

00:28:38.399 --> 00:28:39.840
where the [ __ ] damn this is not good for

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.000
me well it's it's

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.279
interesting though because it's like

00:28:43.279 --> 00:28:44.480
that's not really how i feel i'm trying

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.559
to be funny well

00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:48.000
yeah it's actually

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.440
kind of true too because my thing is

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.799
like that in mind that's the part of

00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:52.159
these things that bother me when it's

00:28:52.159 --> 00:28:52.960
like

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.640
like yeah you but the whole the whole

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.240
answer to that is that matt lauer is in

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.480
a position of power and he's abusing

00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.760
that power

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.279
so like it's not these women's fault

00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:03.279
because he's so powerful

00:29:03.279 --> 00:29:05.200
so like they're like they're like just

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.600
quaking in the majesty of matt lauer's

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.240
[ __ ] job as a news reporter and it's

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.520
like

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.960
you don't have to [ __ ] matt lauer man

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.039
like yeah but then when you say yes to

00:29:15.039 --> 00:29:16.960
it the power thing goes out the window

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.960
it's just well no you you don't you say

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.559
yes but it's you don't mean yes you're

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:23.360
just so [ __ ] obliterated by matt

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.960
lauer's [ __ ] sick officer at 30 rock

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.559
that it's like

00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:30.000
what would you do

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.520
i would i'd

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.200
suck his [ __ ] fat dick right you'd

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.399
have to dude

00:29:34.399 --> 00:29:36.399
yeah but yeah that's the that was that

00:29:36.399 --> 00:29:37.840
was the part of it that bothered me i

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.279
pressed the button i'd be like lock this

00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:40.880
[ __ ] door i'm about to suck your dick

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.880
yeah [ __ ] put that thing down open

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.919
the door i'm gonna suck your dick

00:29:45.919 --> 00:29:47.440
but that's the funniest part too and

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.039
they're like well he just has power it's

00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:50.159
like

00:29:50.159 --> 00:29:51.919
i don't know you could probably like

00:29:51.919 --> 00:29:55.039
quit i've quit a lot of jobs mm-hmm

00:29:55.039 --> 00:29:56.480
some guy yeah it's you know but you can

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.080
never put yourself in next or like well

00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.360
you're a guy it's easy for you to say

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.960
and it's like of course it's like yeah

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.720
if i was attracted to [ __ ] powerful

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.480
men i'd yeah [ __ ] it

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.320
that's that's also though for to be like

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.480
yeah well you're a guy so you don't

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.559
understand my thing is so wait we're not

00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:11.440
equal

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.440
yeah that's a whole other way yeah am i

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.640
a guy and it doesn't matter to me

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.679
because i'm

00:30:15.679 --> 00:30:18.159
more powerful and intelligent than you

00:30:18.159 --> 00:30:19.840
or what you're getting it

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.600
it's it's a no win it's a no win you

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.200
literally just have to be like yeah matt

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.200
lauer i'm glad he's obvious don't get me

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.960
wrong i hate matt laughs matt lauer i

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.080
didn't even hate him because of that i

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:28.799
just

00:30:28.799 --> 00:30:30.880
hate news people yeah [ __ ] them i just

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.080
don't i don't get along with them you

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.679
know my one time i hung out with them or

00:30:33.679 --> 00:30:35.679
two times but but you just watch them

00:30:35.679 --> 00:30:36.960
you're like what the [ __ ] these dudes

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.200
[ __ ] yeah they suck but dudes

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.320
that was i mean he could have just

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.720
gotten fired for

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.919
sho and dong

00:30:43.919 --> 00:30:45.360
first of all that's a very you can't

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.720
show dogs

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.880
yeah you can't show dong dude and then

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.799
you [ __ ] can't buy your co-workers

00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:52.799
dildos that's an also a weird one unless

00:30:52.799 --> 00:30:55.200
you work at spencer's

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.960
that's a weird gift

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.200
tiny condoms yeah yeah the uh or

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.279
apparently too him and his wife

00:31:01.279 --> 00:31:03.039
have been sleeping in separate rooms for

00:31:03.039 --> 00:31:04.720
a long time too

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.200
so matt lowy has been just a boy on the

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.880
prowl for a long time and his wife his

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.559
wife was just like

00:31:10.559 --> 00:31:13.039
guy has a lot of money man now if he if

00:31:13.039 --> 00:31:16.240
his crime was strictly

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.840
if there was no locked door in there

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.200
because that's that's a real [ __ ]

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.320
weird one

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.919
yeah that's the that's if the girls

00:31:21.919 --> 00:31:24.159
didn't know about the lock store

00:31:24.159 --> 00:31:25.840
then that's irrelevant

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.559
but

00:31:26.559 --> 00:31:28.080
yeah but he still has the locked door

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.600
that's [ __ ] weird but if his only

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.679
crime was being like take your shirt off

00:31:31.679 --> 00:31:33.760
and have sex with me right now

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.840
i mean yes that's a fireable offense

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.600
yeah but that's not sexual assault

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.760
really i don't think i mean not by and

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.279
that's the thing it depends on how you

00:31:41.279 --> 00:31:42.240
they're not no i don't think it is

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.000
either obviously that's [ __ ] crazy my

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.279
thing is they're like well these men

00:31:45.279 --> 00:31:46.559
have all this power and it's like yeah

00:31:46.559 --> 00:31:48.559
but power is a two-way street

00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:49.919
so it's like

00:31:49.919 --> 00:31:51.360
like well they're using power on it's

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.640
like yeah because you're participating

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.000
in this weird power interaction if you

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.600
were to stop and be like

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.880
all right [ __ ] it i'll go get a job

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.000
somewhere else or just be like i'm gonna

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.240
say no to [ __ ] matt lauer and just

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.640
see what happens it's like it

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.399
it's like yeah you're not scary you have

00:32:04.399 --> 00:32:06.399
no power over me exactly yeah matt lauer

00:32:06.399 --> 00:32:07.440
that's the weird that's the weird part

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.120
about it it's like [ __ ] dildo dude

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.399
it's like so

00:32:10.399 --> 00:32:12.240
if all these things are kind of like

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.399
that's that's kind of like behavior of

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:16.880
like a a very power hungry person to be

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.799
like i'm gonna i [ __ ] i'm in my office

00:32:18.799 --> 00:32:20.000
it's like you're gonna suck my dick

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.519
check out my dick and it's like very

00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:23.279
bill clinton-esque very bill clinton

00:32:23.279 --> 00:32:25.919
asked but it's like these guys

00:32:25.919 --> 00:32:27.360
i'm like there there's not going to be

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.399
any

00:32:28.399 --> 00:32:29.919
like we got to remove these positions of

00:32:29.919 --> 00:32:31.919
power and it's like you're not going to

00:32:31.919 --> 00:32:33.360
the whole point of getting power is to

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.440
use it on other people otherwise it's

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.600
not power yeah

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.799
that's the only reason i would want to

00:32:38.799 --> 00:32:40.799
host the today show is to be like to

00:32:40.799 --> 00:32:42.880

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.640
so that's the killer

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.920
you can never tell your girlfriend how

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.599
much money you make or what you do that

00:37:41.599 --> 00:37:43.359
day yeah it's tough for me to escape

00:37:43.359 --> 00:37:45.839
like i got she doesn't understand that

00:37:45.839 --> 00:37:47.680
playing madden is more important than

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.359
that phone call dude especially because

00:37:49.359 --> 00:37:51.599
it's a mindless phone call if she and

00:37:51.599 --> 00:37:52.880
that's what i told her

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.160
i was like if you called me with

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.560
something to say or something to ask

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.400
or really something to tell me other

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.280
than

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.640
hey

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.320
oh my god my kids were crazy today it's

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.920
cool blah

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.040
so she calls you right when she gets out

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.000
of work

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.280
well yeah she was driving home that's

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.880
the best driving to all these that's my

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.880
baby as soon as she gets out phone call

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.920
and it's like

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.240
everything stops like so what happened

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.000
oh my god that [ __ ] [ __ ] no way

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.680
really and it's just

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.240
dude it's every day man

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.520
it's crazy i'm telling you and it's like

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.960
they get like in wrapped up in like

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.599
three little beefs a day like [ __ ] yeah

00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:27.520
all dude it's like never any beefs of

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.200
just like it's i've coined this the

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.359
perpetual girl problem perpetual girl

00:38:31.359 --> 00:38:33.200
problem girl's having this never-ending

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.200
problem that just constantly changes and

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.720
morphs and like takes a different shape

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:37.920
every day and it's just like a

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.320
never-ending yarn about like this

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.160
weird thing that's happening that's a

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.280
very good

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.200
terminology never-ending girl problems

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.160
are perpetual girl problem it's the pgp

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.800
it's a pgp you got the ptp's and then

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.240
dude don't start me on the female ego

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.680
that's the second twisted world of that

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:54.800
i don't even want to get into that i

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.320
think we we've touched we've touched on

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.839
it and the female ego especially when it

00:38:57.839 --> 00:38:59.119
comes to getting engaged and getting

00:38:59.119 --> 00:39:01.920
married it's and baby showers

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.760
gender reveals the weird interaction

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.280
between women depending on their looks

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.960
they kind of establish just like they

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.480
fight to establish this weird pecking

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.079
order and then there's like

00:39:10.079 --> 00:39:11.920
girls who are friends with guys and then

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.280
guys start dating another girl then the

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.640
girl will call the other girl to like

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.880
meet the guy's girlfriend and try to

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.000
start comparing with her dude i've

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.440
gotten a lot of insight into this and

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.119
it's like

00:39:21.119 --> 00:39:22.720
it's just like a you like lift it up and

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.240
look into it and go holy [ __ ] i don't

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:25.680
want to think about that anymore it's

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.440
insane it's crazy it's like looking into

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:30.560
us a boiling pot of

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.240
sauce and the steam just comes up and

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.760
hits you in the face you're like oh [ __ ]

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.280
i don't understand it

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.040
dude it's crazy i've watched that before

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.640
i've watched like women kind of compete

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.160
for like the attention of a like a

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.240
specific man and i've been like this is

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:43.920
odd i dated a girl who did that we were

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.839
hanging out with her ex-boyfriend and

00:39:45.839 --> 00:39:47.200
her the ex-boyfriend's current

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.560
girlfriend gross why were you doing that

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:51.760

i'm cool i can handle this and like and

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.560
i was i actually met the guy and we were

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:01.760

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.599
of course but i like was watching this

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.680
oh you still [ __ ] love this guy and i

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.960
had to like sit there and watch it the

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.640
whole time and then like

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.760
it was bizarre and they were like

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.960
literally competing for this guy's

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.320
attention i was just like chilling just

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.119

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.839
open-minded guy

00:40:17.839 --> 00:40:19.040
yeah that's that's that's one of the

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.560
downfalls of smoking a lot of weed

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.320
what's that you like your open mind i

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.920

take this it's cool i'm chill and like

00:40:25.839 --> 00:40:27.200

i think the older i've gotten too i've

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.400
started to realize like things i can

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.040
feel things affect me like i can re like

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.880

i get that if i get like a heated

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.599
conflict where i'm like really like like

00:40:53.599 --> 00:40:55.200
i've chilled out on a big time but like

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.119
when i was like arguing with strangers a

00:40:57.119 --> 00:40:58.800
lot when i was driving

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.400
i would get so mad like my heart would

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.200
skip beats and i'd be like

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.839

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.319
felt anything

00:41:14.319 --> 00:41:15.839
when i was young if i had sugar or

00:41:15.839 --> 00:41:16.960
something i would never be like oh my

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.560

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.359
you're slowly dying now yeah

00:41:21.359 --> 00:41:22.880
yeah of course

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.400
i'm saying i feel everything now i used

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.599
to know i should be able to chug

00:41:25.599 --> 00:41:27.359
everywhere i feel like when i when i

00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:29.440

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:31.200
everything yeah that's dude so i i had

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.040
an apple watch i don't use it anymore i

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.599
go back and forth but uh i got to the

00:41:35.599 --> 00:41:38.079
point where i could be working out and

00:41:38.079 --> 00:41:40.400
be like i'm at 97 beats per minute with

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.839
my heart rate check it and i was usually

00:41:41.839 --> 00:41:43.200
within like one or two days per minute

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.839
yeah that's how i'm like

00:41:45.839 --> 00:41:47.359
you are obsessed with your heart yeah to

00:41:47.359 --> 00:41:48.960
like a really unhealthy amount i'm

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.160
convinced i'm gonna have the big one

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.079
yeah so probably will

00:41:52.079 --> 00:41:53.760
i know i will and chances are you will

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.280
well the ultrasound in my heart said it

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.040
was like awesome they're like your heart

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.480
looks great but

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.079
i know my heart dude sure it looks fine

00:42:00.079 --> 00:42:01.520
it's set to [ __ ] burst it's gonna

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.599
explode it's set to burst i'm gonna i'm

00:42:03.599 --> 00:42:06.480
definitely on the highway to hell dude

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.240
i'm out here doing yoga i'm trying to

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.640
[ __ ] escape this hell

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.400
yeah that's uh

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.880
but whatever yeah but yeah that was my

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.560
uh that was my big revelation this week

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:17.920
though i was like they should pay

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.680
newscasters like as much as an

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.880
electrician it should be the same

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.560
[ __ ] job

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.160
it would be probably the same exact

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.760
outcome in terms of dicks coming out of

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.599
pants and everything but like for sure

00:42:27.599 --> 00:42:29.280
there's still gonna be dongs out yeah i

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.560
was gonna say at least we can't hide

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.319
behind the idea that he was so powerful

00:42:32.319 --> 00:42:34.240
that we did it exactly yeah

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.480
in which case like also though he was so

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.640
powerful we did it

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.079
isn't that kind of what happens every

00:42:40.079 --> 00:42:42.480
single time a guy has sex with a lady

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.480
what do you mean a lot of times

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.480
but i mean he has a characteristic they

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.359
like and respect so they do it

00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:51.040
yeah but then the guy has sex with like

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.119
50 other women and it's like

00:42:53.119 --> 00:42:55.359
but again again it's like

00:42:55.359 --> 00:42:59.040
just like power's one of the things

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.960
that's like i love how it falls on him

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:15.359
though it's like he's at work and he i

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:16.720
mean it's like i mean she [ __ ] him

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.319
[ __ ] it she should be fired too she's

00:43:18.319 --> 00:43:19.680
out here [ __ ] guys at work i mean how

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.280
do you [ __ ] your co-workers you can't at

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.119
all you can't [ __ ] your co-workers at

00:43:23.119 --> 00:43:24.960
work or you're both fired

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.800
unless one of you apparently is powerful

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.480
and then he's the one who gets fired and

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.160
you're sitting there like but i didn't

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.000
know what to do what about jim and pam

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.160

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.880
at work yeah well well he like set it up

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.480
it was so you could you set up at work

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.240

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:41.440
office

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.079
glory pam got duped into a [ __ ] gym

that documentary i just the only thing i

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.520
remember about that is they played that

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.839
one song with the harmonicas in it

00:46:43.839 --> 00:46:47.119
john male room to move he's like

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.200
dude there's a part so ornie adams he

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.880
gets just for laughs mantra he gets

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:54.000
represented by jerry seinfeld's agent so

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.359
that's why he's blown up he gets all

00:46:55.359 --> 00:46:57.440
this [ __ ] he gets like a letterman spot

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.800
he gets just for you they did it just

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.319
for this documentary

00:47:00.319 --> 00:47:02.000
i don't know he was pretty bad when i

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.440
remember he

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:04.720
he's gonna be the helium in like two

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:07.599
weeks is he really yeah he's still going

00:47:07.599 --> 00:47:08.960
i think he's toned it down but at the

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:10.960
time he was 29 in the documentary too i

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:12.560
remember that wow what was what was

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:14.240
mercury doing at the time

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.839
mercury was definitely in retrograde it

00:47:15.839 --> 00:47:17.440
was very

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.119
i don't know what that means

00:47:19.119 --> 00:47:21.119
what's it mean i think it's behind like

00:47:21.119 --> 00:47:23.119
jupiter or something yeah okay it's

00:47:23.119 --> 00:47:24.480
funny too because i always thought of

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.960
mercury as the literally the substance

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.800
the element being in retrograde some

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.960
sort of thermometer and it's moving up

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.240
and down i don't know what retrograde

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.160
means i think it's [ __ ] [ __ ] up but

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.599
no uh

00:47:35.599 --> 00:47:37.680
orni adams like the the camera comes up

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.119

00:47:39.119 --> 00:47:40.560
the one before one show he's like

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.560
looking at the cameras the stage is just

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:45.040
like a woman like i just wanna i just

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:48.319
wanna mount her and destroy it yeah

00:47:48.319 --> 00:47:50.720
like he is [ __ ] at one point he's

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.800

and he's sitting there by himself and he

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.839
like looks at the camera he's like you

00:48:05.839 --> 00:48:07.440

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.119
i think every year collectively like

00:50:43.119 --> 00:50:44.319
around the world of the amount of people

00:50:44.319 --> 00:50:46.400
who watch porn is like the existence of

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.000
the universe the amount of hours i think

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.440
it's like the amount of hours spent in

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.760
like 10 years is like literally the

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:52.640
whole

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.800
human enterprise nice that's how much

00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.480
time people spend watching porn true

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:57.760

it's like civilization yeah that's great

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.040

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:04.559
one year of people watching porn it's

00:51:04.559 --> 00:51:06.880

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.160
awesome

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:11.599
well if you think about it one year how

00:51:11.599 --> 00:51:13.680

[ __ ] skinnies he was an ant there he

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:02.319
was calling this book an anti because he

00:53:02.319 --> 00:53:04.160

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.599
regime i don't know if you know the guy

00:53:05.599 --> 00:53:08.240

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.079
i forget it's like abu babie or some

00:53:10.079 --> 00:53:11.440
[ __ ] and uh

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:14.240
so the grandmom just like went [ __ ]

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:16.800
rogue and had a bunch of women from the

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:19.440
village come or mogadish or whatever and

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:21.359
they hold you down you have someone

00:53:21.359 --> 00:53:22.800
holds each of your limbs and they took

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:25.040
literally scissors a guy comes in and

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.800
[ __ ] cuts off their labia and

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.400
clitoris with scissors

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:30.480
and then they stitch it up so like the

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:32.800
scar tissue forms around the vagina i'm

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:35.200
195 listening to this dude i told you i

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.280
almost passed the [ __ ] out i was driving

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.040
i was like i'm gonna fall out on 95 and

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:40.640
[ __ ] kill someone but i kept

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.480
listening because i had to but they

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:44.800
[ __ ] stitch it up then scar tissue

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.720
forms around where it was and this weird

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.559
guy comes a week later takes the

00:53:48.559 --> 00:53:50.160
stitches out stitches out so now you

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.680
have this like

00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:53.599
no clitoris no lips just hole for a

00:53:53.599 --> 00:53:54.960
vagina and they give you a little hole

00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.960
to pee out of meanwhile then the two

00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:58.640
weeks you you spend recovering your feet

00:53:58.640 --> 00:53:59.839
are tied together you have to lay still

00:53:59.839 --> 00:54:01.040
and you can't move otherwise the stitch

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.160
is ripping the guy has to sew up your

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.440
[ __ ] again

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.839
so the the flesh is how old is the girl

00:54:05.839 --> 00:54:08.319
when this happens seven years old

00:54:08.319 --> 00:54:11.680
[ __ ] yeah dude it's [ __ ] up so then

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.760
flesh kind of scar tissue forms around

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:15.520
like the opening of the vagina so it's

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.400
like

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:18.880
impenetrable but the like so

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.880
basically it should only be opened by a

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:22.720
man's heart penis so like the night you

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:25.040
get your bride you thrust in and break

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.559
this scar tissue and you know she has

00:54:26.559 --> 00:54:28.720
been reserved for you and if she hasn't

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:30.079
her whole family all the males in her

00:54:30.079 --> 00:54:32.160
family are saying pringles can you pop

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.880

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.280
[ __ ] me up i was driving i was just

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:40.480
like

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:41.440
ew

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:43.760
that's disgusting dude she's crazy and

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:45.040
her sister's ripped and had to be like

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:47.920
re-sewn up by the weird man oh god

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:49.520
and the brother got circumcised when he

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.440
was [ __ ] like i might go watch black

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:53.280

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:55.839
really watch us [ __ ] light them up no

00:54:55.839 --> 00:54:57.359
yeah that's not that's not the way to do

00:54:57.359 --> 00:54:58.720
things dude you don't cut off women's

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:01.440
vaginas dude with scissors especially

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.680
just like somalia scissors kicking yeah

00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:04.559
they might have been pretty sharp they

00:55:04.559 --> 00:55:05.839
probably don't have much safety scissors

00:55:05.839 --> 00:55:06.720
because

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.079
there's probably

00:55:08.079 --> 00:55:09.520
everything in smiley sucks so that

00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:12.480
probably really really sucks oh dude

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:13.599
literally cut off her [ __ ] with

00:55:13.599 --> 00:55:15.520
scissors yeah and you just have to bite

00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:16.720

the people will talk

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:22.720
you have to just lay there and just take

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:23.680
it

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:25.599
and then you just don't have a [ __ ] now

00:55:25.599 --> 00:55:26.880
you have this go through life being like

00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:27.839

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.359
medicine knows what to do with this dude

01:00:19.359 --> 01:00:20.799
it's [ __ ] i need this is an easter

01:00:20.799 --> 01:00:23.520
medicine practice

01:00:23.599 --> 01:00:24.799
all right

01:00:24.799 --> 01:00:26.319
i mean that's just how it's going right

01:00:26.319 --> 01:00:27.680
now

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.760
that's the way what's going right now

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.280
the whole thing with west first east did

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.559
you know about this

01:00:32.559 --> 01:00:34.880
we basically dominated the east right

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.640
through like economics and everything

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.960
and spiritually they're dominating us

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.400
because now like we're all doing yoga or

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.680
all this new age stuff that's

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.319
infiltrating all of our belief systems

01:00:44.319 --> 01:00:45.440
so we've kind of like conquered each

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.480
other on different levels kind of weird

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.319
to think about no they haven't conquered

01:00:48.319 --> 01:00:50.400
us spiritually slowly

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.640
do not people religions dropping people

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:55.200
who are religious are dropping off well

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.559
buddhism it's i'm telling you we're

01:00:56.559 --> 01:00:57.839
getting they're going to conquer us

01:00:57.839 --> 01:00:59.920
spiritually no and they're going to be

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.119
the ones who are just like total

01:01:01.119 --> 01:01:02.480
capitalist pigs and they're going to

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.960

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.640
local news in australia they were

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.400
interviewing this

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.480
somebody some head of

01:03:50.799 --> 01:03:53.200
i've got no problem with what a man does

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.119
with another man that's fine and then he

01:03:55.119 --> 01:03:57.119
got real serious and was like

01:03:57.119 --> 01:03:58.799
the real problem is we've got these damn

01:03:58.799 --> 01:04:00.960
crocodiles up here even three people a

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:01.920
year

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.920
nobody cares well it's actually pretty

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.359
rare yeah crocodiles originally i know

01:04:05.359 --> 01:04:07.280
he was talking about three a year yeah

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.559
that you think would be that's crazy

01:04:08.559 --> 01:04:10.240
they don't really know but in one town i

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:12.240
mean yeah no i did three a year that's

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.319
too many crocodiles yeah that's insane

01:04:14.319 --> 01:04:15.680
yeah that sucks

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.520
but it was it was like it'd be like 40 a

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.119
year it's funny to see a guy that was

01:04:19.119 --> 01:04:20.079
like

01:04:20.079 --> 01:04:21.119
somebody they asked him about gay

01:04:21.119 --> 01:04:22.559
marriage and he was like oh no i don't

01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:24.000

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.520
about these crocodiles eating people

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.039
that's a good [ __ ] call that's a real

01:04:27.039 --> 01:04:29.039
problem that is a real problem i love

01:04:29.039 --> 01:04:30.799
that that was a real problem that that

01:04:30.799 --> 01:04:32.160
guy has to face he's like we got these

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.760
damn crocs

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.200

i walk my dogs every morning and

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:39.359
like

01:04:39.359 --> 01:04:40.720
there was a weird thing i noticed about

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.480
how and i this is my theory i've still

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.160
been sticking to where like

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.599
black people say hi to each other in the

01:04:45.599 --> 01:04:47.119
morning and wish each other good morning

01:04:47.119 --> 01:04:48.160
and white people see each other in the

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.079
morning strangers and they're just like

01:04:50.079 --> 01:04:51.359
you just look at the other person it's

01:04:51.359 --> 01:04:52.799
like what the [ __ ] you looking at but

01:04:52.799 --> 01:04:54.240
black people will see each other and go

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:56.640
i could do more though i say what's up

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.160
i say what's up to people i say what's

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.000
up to people but a lot of times if i

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.200
walk by another white guy and i'm like

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.200
hey what's going on there it's like

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.480
true true walk by a black dude in the

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:06.839
morning like good morning it's like good

01:05:06.839 --> 01:05:09.280

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.359
i'm walking my dogs to say hi but every

01:05:17.359 --> 01:05:18.720
now and again

they'll be like uh

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.760
usually it's like older black a lot of

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:22.960
older black ladies say hi to me but i'll

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.799
be like a 40 year old black lady i'll

01:05:24.799 --> 01:05:26.640
see her and be like good morning and

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:28.000

a dirty look and then like

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.760
mild i have dogs so they're kind of like

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.119
walking away from the dogs and in my

01:05:33.119 --> 01:05:34.799

and dirty after you do it you're going

01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:03.759
to be out of breath and that your heart

01:09:03.759 --> 01:09:04.880
rate's going to be a little faster than

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.319
normal you'll be like what the [ __ ] was

01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:09.120
that john wax will ward off genies yeah

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.120
good for butt masturbation if you want

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.799
shines your bird

01:09:12.799 --> 01:09:14.960
anything else

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.440
um does it protect this is a theory this

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:18.640
is a theory

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:21.040
uh no

01:09:22.239 --> 01:09:24.319
you don't put like a fat based

01:09:24.319 --> 01:09:26.880
lubricant into a woman's vagina okay

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.480
that can actually that's not good for a

01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:30.560
woman so don't use a dong wax for sex

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.839
don't well

01:09:31.839 --> 01:09:33.600
if you want but it's usually not good

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:34.880
for your girlfriend

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:36.400
so you should probably you should

01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:37.679
sterilize her first if you're going to

01:09:37.679 --> 01:09:39.600
do that sterilize your woman yeah get

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:42.719
some sort of dental damage

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.799
yeah it's pretty much good for that i

01:09:46.799 --> 01:09:48.640
also think that maybe like the lipid

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.239
like the fats in the coconut oil i've

01:09:50.239 --> 01:09:52.480
always like hope that the fat cells will

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:54.320
like somehow osmose through my bird and

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.560
fatten it up fat give you a plump

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.159
that's my that's my theory i'm not

01:09:58.159 --> 01:10:00.880
ringworm riddled fat

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:03.199
that you can well be at least

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:04.719
ribbed for her pleasure dude at least

01:10:04.719 --> 01:10:05.840
ringworm

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.400
is better than genies that's true so

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.920
well that i think that's the genie in my

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.040
skin

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.480
so that was the genie where he touched

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.840
you touching the world

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:15.600
genie kissed my bird that's his lips

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.520
it's just lip print yeah

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:20.320
so you gotta watch out for that

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.239
