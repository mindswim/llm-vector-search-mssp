with it's awesome dude it's amazing and

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.170
there's like a running plan that's like

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.019
the first half is so easy it's like walk

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.280
five run 60 seconds walk three run two

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.290
minutes walk five it's like nice dude

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.299
I'm in such good shape and then you hit

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.069
that first run five minutes every minute

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.510
I'm staring at that clock on the

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.420
treadmill it's funny cuz you should do

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.220
about like the guts of a mile in five

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.100
minutes said I'm at like ten ten minute

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.780
pace for a mile for me that's yeah

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.970
that's some dude accident just invited

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.859
me to go run with them I think we'll

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.780
just do two miles and I'm like you

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.490
prepared to walk half of it yeah that's

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.080
a half hour yeah are you prepared to

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.150
walk half of this yeses you know

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.150
but the the funniest part is being like

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.160
gassed at the end of that five minutes

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.870
and trying to reach for this slow down

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.820
like you got to turn it down well I

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.320
tried little tricks we're like I would

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.660
like walk really fast then I can run a

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.400
little slower and I'm like power walk

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.169
they say you know just got a run yeah

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.060
doesn't do it it's not helping yeah bro

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.229
I went to the gym today too I'm getting

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.120

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.009
I'm balding holding so I'm saying you're

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:02.639
balding I am I am it sucks yeah it's a

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.530
slow it's a slow process for you you

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.660
have a balding just like I I like I

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.270
genuinely don't care when it comes like

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.470
what its gonna look like

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.320
yeah but the just the mortality of it

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.150
like in the shower looking at clumps of

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.650
hair oh so it's coming down like that

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.000
well yeah if I like shampooing my hair

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.490
I'll have like a bunch of hair in my

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.560
short buzz I'm gonna have to do it um

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.080
deadly strike now well I'm gonna let it

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.380
have a long bald head you get a [ __ ]

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.870
bi short buzz right now I'll be nasty

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.940
dude maybe if you like a fade or your

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.070
short buzz the face is sick we'll see

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.830
but I think going bald naturally and

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.720
keeping your hair long is [ __ ] sick

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.849
pretty tight a visit like just yeah

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.039
getting a Louie cut yeah that'd be

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.889
pretty cool too yeah I started watching

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.289
a show the main characters kind of bald

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:54.539
it's the show on HBO about the guy who

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:57.060
sells weed high maintenance yeah

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.669
McKeever isn't it what yeah the end of

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:01.710
last season was he really yeah damn I

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.030
wish I kept watching it's all Makita

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.080
yeah

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.880
yes is he acting it yeah he's like a

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.770
main character in the last episode now I

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.020
gotta watch it second season right on

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.240
whatever it was the most recent season

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.229
so he's one of those shows like

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:14.699
Californication it's the show I don't

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:16.080

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.729
like I'll just kind of keep watch yeah

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:20.010

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.320
of second season Trump wins so that

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.190

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.579
on the chevy cruze I mean just trying to

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:26.110
build any cars I don't know think so bro

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:28.900
there's never little Chinese uh I don't

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.280
there's any Chinese car companies I

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.750
bring up China dude well I'm just

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.520
thinking of um there's like how they

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.960
were [ __ ] munching bats and then why

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.200
everyone's getting sick huh

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:41.190
much of that soup whose bunch of bats

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:45.060
he's much the best they got cursed well

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.670
yeah they cursed by the bats and they

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.820
invented basically a new disease is it

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:55.680
getting people yeah these keep munching

00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:01.350
[ __ ] bats like Ozzy Osbourne is it

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:02.880
all like in a dramatic rock-and-roll

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:06.930
fashion yes or the line of ants to wash

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:11.130
it down no it's even crushing bat yeah

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.830
that's that's one of the things I solve

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.180
is they think it's coming from the bat

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.680
soup they've been crushing it it's not

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.150
even I don't know if you can imagine

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:19.890
this but it is just literally a bat just

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:24.630
sitting in a bowl at least like arrange

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.250

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:28.020
like the bat was cooks today they just

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:34.260

did they just are eating some of

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.660
munching bats and it could be causing

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:52.830

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.260
pandemic dude I don't know what is the

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.090

yeah about like when animals have a

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:05.550
disease and it gets mixed with a human

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:08.310
virus mm-hmm it's like quadruple e like

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:11.010

scratch chimpanzees yeah yeah there was

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.590
there was a wild theory someone [ __ ] a

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.360
monkey yeah well I think it's way more

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.990

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.980

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.690

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:05.380

I'm not so I'm what I'm saying is the

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:26.770
fact that we eat pigs is just as bad as

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:29.230
eating dogs pigs not a bad argument when

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.840
they study brain chemistry they use pigs

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.210
cuz pigs brains are so similar to ours

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:37.750

gonna get on the wave where we're like

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:20.000

economy was based was different back

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.160
exactly it was just different back then

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.600
yeah I think it'll be one of those

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.280
things will come to me like this kind of

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.440

also like again like chickens would go

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:47.630

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:49.640
together he not exist or live that life

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.040

you're like those there's definitely

00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:14.020

00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:18.130

calling people racist here recently the

00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:29.980

Andrew hard on that yeah it was another

00:57:13.210 --> 00:57:15.250
hood somebody killed him there's enough

00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:16.180
people being like

00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:25.000
kill themselves I don't show people to

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:25.510
do that

00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:28.480
dude the so what was the article it's

00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.460
really it was pretty [ __ ] good goblin

00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:32.530
was in there in the room he was yeah so

00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:34.960
they well they broke down the reason the

00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:38.319
shift in families like you know why now

00:57:38.319 --> 00:57:39.880
like the divorce rate spiked and like

00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:41.260
how like now there's like the nuclear

00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:42.940
families no longer more of a thing we're

00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:44.740
going more towards like a co-parenting

00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:46.690
thing we're like it's more traditional

00:57:46.690 --> 00:57:48.339
net well it's yeah it's more traditional

00:57:48.339 --> 00:57:50.890
and it was before people to have like a

00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:53.530
dad step to a stepmom that's been kind

00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:55.630
of more the norm but they're saying the

00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:59.050
thing that first started that or one of

00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:00.790
the things was just the move of global

00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:03.040
global capital so when cat when people

00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:05.050
when billionaires were like you can go

00:58:05.050 --> 00:58:06.910
pay people 50 cents an hour and [ __ ]

00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:08.619
bait back then it's probably 3 cents an

00:58:08.619 --> 00:58:10.510
hour and the people like yeah you can do

00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:11.710
that because before is this year in your

00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:13.359
country you're doing your thing you

00:58:13.359 --> 00:58:14.589
would invade other countries and take

00:58:14.589 --> 00:58:16.240
their stuff like no no we're not gonna

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.440
bait them there's gonna pay them no

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.460
money and you know have all the jobs

00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:20.140
there so people billionaires or whatever

00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:22.630
we're like well that [ __ ] rule so

00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:25.030
like yeah let's [ __ ] let's do that so

00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:26.859
they did that so you have the bottom of

00:58:26.859 --> 00:58:29.950
the labor pool so you have a it was as

00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:31.900
poor black dudes see a poor black dudes

00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:33.130
who are just like striving for jobs

00:58:33.130 --> 00:58:35.619
already and then all of a sudden all the

00:58:35.619 --> 00:58:38.109
a lot of those jobs is you huh do you

00:58:38.109 --> 00:58:39.849
need to see I couldn't use tissue yeah a

00:58:39.849 --> 00:58:42.460
lot of those jobs go overseas yeah so

00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:43.839
they were the first ones to get hit with

00:58:43.839 --> 00:58:46.960
it so you know the black poor black

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.220
dudes so they were sitting there and

00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:49.510
like you know you're trying to have a

00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:51.400
family and then did Tucker d'oeuvres

00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:53.230
also to like the news probably wasn't

00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:54.579
covering the [ __ ] so they had like the

00:58:54.579 --> 00:58:56.410
whole [ __ ] on lock it's all hushed and

00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:57.819
then you're a black dude like no no I'm

00:58:57.819 --> 00:58:59.619
telling you like there's no I can't find

00:58:59.619 --> 00:59:01.329
a [ __ ] job see the news literally

00:59:01.329 --> 00:59:03.520
still is not covering it true they are

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:05.589
bought new headphones today from Apple

00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:07.990
yeah or yesterday it's like made in

00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:10.930
Vietnam and I was just like there's no

00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:14.260
way that's a nice factory no but I just

00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:16.299
was like there's not like Scott dude is

00:59:16.299 --> 00:59:17.530
also probably annoying the private

00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:18.849
design like an Apple store it's all

00:59:18.849 --> 00:59:20.109
bright and annoying and they're just

00:59:20.109 --> 00:59:22.420
[ __ ] uh that's gotta suck yeah some

00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:24.069
of these so these dudes are like trying

00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:25.599
to have families and you know it's just

00:59:25.599 --> 00:59:28.030
the resources are scarce so then like

00:59:28.030 --> 00:59:29.860
like black women would be like

00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:31.930
their mothers apparently what according

00:59:31.930 --> 00:59:33.400
this guy would instruct them to be like

00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:36.520
alright he gave you knocked you up hold

00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:38.020
off on the ring don't take a ring until

00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:39.340
he proves himself in terms of like

00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:41.230
getting education getting a job so then

00:59:41.230 --> 00:59:42.340
like this dude will be like alright I

00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:43.390
won't you be my wife and she'd be like

00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:45.070
that's kind of assumptive we'll see

00:59:45.070 --> 00:59:46.840
that's what that's what the guy said he

00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:48.520
did he said he did research and they

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:49.720
were like that was the most common

00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:51.850
answer of their mom being like hold off

00:59:51.850 --> 00:59:53.860
make sure this guy's not a bum so then

00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:54.910
these dudes like no I'm telling you

00:59:54.910 --> 00:59:56.320
dudes like they I don't know where the

00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:57.430
judge was they probably didn't have like

00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:59.200
I don't know where the [ __ ] jobs went

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.000
but the readers they're closing so then

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.920
so then obviously there's poor white

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.360
people right and get filled with bum

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:07.000
come throw do exactly bum coma even if

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.620
you did you had to be like well I'm not

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:10.180
just gonna like link up with you just

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.260
yet until you prove yourself send your

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:12.250
dude you're like we're gonna [ __ ]

01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:14.140
yourself in so then there's poor white

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:16.420
dudes are being like look I'll tell you

01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:18.780
what's wrong with you guys yeah and then

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:20.500
Global's they should hit them and

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.940
they're like god [ __ ] goddamn it what

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:24.280
the hell is your country say took jurors

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:26.470
real everybody taking jurors they took

01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:28.180
their [ __ ] jerbs so now there's this

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:30.790
weird thing we're like a whole level of

01:00:30.790 --> 01:00:32.680
the population has like they're losing

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.540
jobs that you know and the wages are

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:35.800
kind of stagnating cuz now it's like

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.060
there's no real reason to pay you more

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:38.470
cuz they can it's like [ __ ] [ __ ] you

01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:40.210
will ship your job off so in at the same

01:00:40.210 --> 01:00:41.650
time you have college-educated people

01:00:41.650 --> 01:00:43.900
who are like a little more richer or

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:45.100
like you know we're more rich and kind

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.300
of like elite from like the professional

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:49.210
class so at that time women were going

01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:51.070
to college a lot so you had these so

01:00:51.070 --> 01:00:52.150
then you have these households were like

01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:54.010
the money's just diminishing any of

01:00:54.010 --> 01:00:55.660
these other households were like Evelyn

01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.640
that dude has a job and then there's a

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.380
girl who's gone to college and she's

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:01.450
wait the women Turk heard herbs the

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:03.820
women took their jeers dude yeah but the

01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:05.200
funniest part was is then this is

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.890
according this paper that the women did

01:01:08.890 --> 01:01:11.290
like they didn't need the money they the

01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:12.520
guy made it enough is that you're

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:13.720
already in the professional class you're

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.040
marrying into a family where this dude

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:17.080
is just like a lawyer doctor manager

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:18.520
something he was making enough money to

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.440
sustain a family and then women were

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.150
like well I went to college so I'm going

01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:24.460
to get a job so then like the feminist

01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:27.370
movement that push of being like well we

01:01:27.370 --> 01:01:29.860
should work to you know do your thing

01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:32.050
but the income was totally unnecessary

01:01:32.050 --> 01:01:35.710
so you took income from you know I mean

01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:37.510
I guess kind of a bet for unfair way to

01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:39.460
put it but they just took jobs

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.650
unnecessarily so then not only did they

01:01:41.650 --> 01:01:42.970
have a job that someone else could have

01:01:42.970 --> 01:01:43.579
had

01:01:43.579 --> 01:01:44.719
we have more money than they know what

01:01:44.719 --> 01:01:46.789
to do with so that's what that's part of

01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:48.380
what kind of it was like globalization

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:50.180
and then like feminist push into the

01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:51.859
workplace of being like I should work

01:01:51.859 --> 01:01:54.319
too it's part of what created that big

01:01:54.319 --> 01:01:55.969
schism in terms of like stratifying the

01:01:55.969 --> 01:01:58.459
classes but so did he also include

01:01:58.459 --> 01:02:01.069
that's like a necessary thing what that

01:02:01.069 --> 01:02:04.209
that skit like that's a growing pain

01:02:04.209 --> 01:02:06.499
like when we finally include women in

01:02:06.499 --> 01:02:08.119
the workforce that's you know there is

01:02:08.119 --> 01:02:11.089
gonna be a couple probably decades you

01:02:11.089 --> 01:02:13.160
know the author wasn't being critical he

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.509
was like here's what happened that swai

01:02:14.509 --> 01:02:16.339
here's what happened this is to my best

01:02:16.339 --> 01:02:18.109
there's a zillion in others resilient

01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:20.239
variables here's kind of what went on

01:02:20.239 --> 01:02:22.430
but the funniest part is and then he was

01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:25.279
like these houses had so much money like

01:02:25.279 --> 01:02:26.869
they people didn't like most people

01:02:26.869 --> 01:02:28.400
didn't have that much expendable income

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.380
yeah then I have these houses that have

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:32.059
like just so much [ __ ] money that

01:02:32.059 --> 01:02:33.079
they don't need something to start

01:02:33.079 --> 01:02:34.430
advertising and selling more and more

01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:36.440
expensive [ __ ] than being like oh cars

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:37.459
are more expensive houses are more

01:02:37.459 --> 01:02:39.769
expensive now pretty [ __ ] wild yeah

01:02:39.769 --> 01:02:41.420
people were just kind of SR Nicole was

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:45.979
weird that's like yeah it's a bummer to

01:02:45.979 --> 01:02:47.539
read history when your people [ __ ] it

01:02:47.539 --> 01:02:49.819
up yeah or like just to know like things

01:02:49.819 --> 01:02:51.709
are complex yeah things are complex what

01:02:51.709 --> 01:02:53.089
like you know the billionaire is [ __ ]

01:02:53.089 --> 01:02:54.529
up and then women were like I'm gonna

01:02:54.529 --> 01:02:56.059
work too and it was like you know which

01:02:56.059 --> 01:02:57.650
you know by all means knock yourself out

01:02:57.650 --> 01:03:00.079
but now it's kind of like that sucks

01:03:00.079 --> 01:03:03.349
house a shitty move yeah also to it oh

01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:04.729

01:03:04.729 --> 01:03:08.479
it's like like I'm rule now a minute

01:03:08.479 --> 01:03:09.499
like figuring out my budget how much

01:03:09.499 --> 01:03:10.940
money do I need a month if I can make

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:12.109

so what are you gonna do with the money

01:03:16.759 --> 01:03:18.049
like what's the [ __ ] end goal here

01:03:18.049 --> 01:03:20.749
yeah just being like I want to do that

01:03:20.749 --> 01:03:23.029
thing just poises weird to just be like

I want to have that job and then it's

01:03:25.369 --> 01:03:27.049
like what the [ __ ] what's the point of

01:03:27.049 --> 01:03:29.749
the money just to have it this isn't

01:03:29.749 --> 01:03:31.130
being like women can't work but just for

01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:33.410
anything it's for anybody dude it's for

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:35.539
anybody it's like what's your [ __ ]

goal with it it's like I own make a lot

01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:41.359
of money it's like to do what it's weird

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:43.609
living in the service pure service of

01:03:43.609 --> 01:03:45.890

01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:47.930
to do yeah I'm a peer capitalist I

01:03:47.930 --> 01:03:49.940
understand it I get it Steve I enjoy it

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:52.279

01:03:52.279 --> 01:03:54.680
bread dude yeah I mean I'm running over

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:56.779
everything you need money obviously now

01:03:56.779 --> 01:03:57.260
that you're

01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:58.790

01:03:58.790 --> 01:04:00.170
don't know what this university what

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:01.490
hippie-dippie [ __ ] there

01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:02.870
indoctrinating you with but you better

01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:04.700
be careful so yeah because you're

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:07.100
straying from the path and the path is

01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:08.150
to get that quoi

01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:09.710

01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:18.410
plan for your course otherwise you're a

01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:20.900
money slave it was just weird to think

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:22.550
of a bunch of people being like I want

01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:24.380

did you do with all the extra money it's

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:32.000
just weird sure it's weird to think

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.890
