on the beach one year down there

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.760
i read the whole thing from chicken

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.600
george roots chicken george all the way

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.519
through yeah i read on the beach

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:43.839
with your wife no this is before i was

00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:46.160
in high school

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.440
i saw it was there i was like oh ho

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.639
roots and i started reading it i was

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:50.000
like this is actually pretty engrossing

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.160
it's a great tale on the be you sat on

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.519
the beach with richard

00:13:53.519 --> 00:13:54.560
yes you go to the beach for like a week

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.079
at a time dude i sold right through that

00:13:56.079 --> 00:13:56.880
book was great

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.360
nice but i learned uh the guy was a bit

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.399
of a liar

00:14:00.399 --> 00:14:02.560
which is so funny some horse feeding

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.399
yeah somebody was racist enough to be

00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:06.079
like

00:14:06.079 --> 00:14:07.760
i don't know if that's true and went

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.199
back and you know that's a tough that's

00:14:09.199 --> 00:14:10.959
a tough level of racism

00:14:10.959 --> 00:14:12.320
held his feet to the fire but the

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.160
problem is is like the guy

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.519
from what i understand was like kind of

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:16.959
right and the guy fudged a lot of stuff

00:14:16.959 --> 00:14:17.839
but it's also like

00:14:17.839 --> 00:14:19.199
i've gotten drunk enough to be that kind

00:14:19.199 --> 00:14:21.199
of racist let's also go on ancestry.com

00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:22.160
and try it

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.839
remember i think i got some drunken

00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:25.920
arguments where i was like it wasn't as

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.440
bad as they're making it seem

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.399
yeah it's a tough one but um it's tough

00:14:32.399 --> 00:14:33.839
one to get the recap from someone else

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:34.800
on

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.279
i don't think that's what i said it is

00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:38.560
exactly what you said i was like well

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.120
that's not what i meant

00:14:42.639 --> 00:14:44.320
i'm sorry what was the thing you wanted

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.000
oh yeah so like if you have

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.680
so if you have like a there's one where

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.040
there's people having a certain kind of

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.320
enzymes and obviously this is like a

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.000
continuum but it's like

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.279
you can drink a cup of coffee and

00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:54.399
immediately fall asleep there's some

00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:55.839
people who like caffeine doesn't have an

00:14:55.839 --> 00:14:56.720
effect on them

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.760
and then there's other people like you

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.120
know normal functioning where you have a

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.480
cup of coffee like well i'm nice and you

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:00.800
know

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.480
yeah lively and like two hours later i

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.399
go there's a third type that's like dude

00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:06.079
after like it's something like 14 hours

00:15:06.079 --> 00:15:07.279
it stays in your system

00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:08.639
and the worst part is i drink a cup of

00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:10.639
coffee i'm fine it's something like when

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:12.000
it breaks down they must produce

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.360
something else that like dude when i go

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.639
to lay down i'll just sit there and be

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:16.959
like my heart's just like

00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:18.320
and i'm like what the [ __ ] i'm like oh

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.920
[ __ ] i had coffee today just i'll just

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.279
be up wow it's crazy

00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:22.880
that is what there's also like my

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.480
brother if he's drunk he smokes weed

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.040
same thing

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.440
spins throw up good night which one

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.320
kevin oh

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.240
if i'm drunk i'm sorry it was billy

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.600
billy doesn't really smoke weed

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.680
yeah but he probably would he probably

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.279
strikes me as a type who would spin out

00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:36.800
you know spin out of control

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.279
if i'm if i'm drinking i just you know i

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:39.839
just

00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:42.000
funny funny thing yeah he strikes me

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.199
someone without self-control

00:15:43.199 --> 00:15:44.959
though he would spin out of his spin out

00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:46.560
of like he would smoke weed when drunk

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.079
and just instantly be like

00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:51.040
oh for sure if i'm drinking i have to

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.160
smoke weed

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.240

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.759
compulsively start smoking weed and it

00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:05.040
literally like

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.560

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:13.920

who have different stomach enzymes here

00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:19.600

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.520
character he's ever done is just a

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.320
[ __ ] guy

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.919
i know 100 like this this whole movie is

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:35.200

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.399
insecurity typically people are funny

00:28:00.399 --> 00:28:00.720

00:28:04.399 --> 00:28:05.919
hide the amount of [ __ ] [ __ ] i'm

00:28:05.919 --> 00:28:08.399
getting you always get what you want to

00:28:08.399 --> 00:28:11.360

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:16.720
come on no no come on uh i can't believe

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.080
you're joking right now dude my [ __ ]

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.320
brother's in cbd rehab for cbd

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:24.240
what yeah this is not a time for laughs

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.720
was his were his joints not inflamed no

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.080
dude

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:32.420
so he drives a bus so cbd has

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.720
[Laughter]

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.039
cbd has a tiny trace amount of thc in it

00:28:37.039 --> 00:28:38.640
because the the hem plant

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.520
is legal so in order to be a legal hemp

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.159
plant

00:28:42.159 --> 00:28:43.919
it only can have i think point three

00:28:43.919 --> 00:28:45.360
percent thc

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.480
which you know per gram of hemp is three

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.559
milligrams of thc which is enough

00:28:50.559 --> 00:28:53.440
to trigger a drug test so it's like you

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.320
know but if you work

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.679
if you say so you're driving a bus say

00:28:55.679 --> 00:28:57.520
you have [ __ ] shoulder pain

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.919
you can be you could have like your eyes

00:28:59.919 --> 00:29:01.760
just closing on [ __ ] percocets and

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.120
xanax as long as you have a script and

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.799
you can legally drive a bus

00:29:04.799 --> 00:29:06.320
but if you happen to have trace amounts

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.399
of thc they're like you can't do that

00:29:08.399 --> 00:29:09.600
and he was like dude this is [ __ ]

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.960
[ __ ] like i don't do any drugs i

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.520
don't drink

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.120
i just take cbd oil i don't want to take

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.360
[ __ ] you know opiates blah blah

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.039
so they're like all right that's we

00:29:17.039 --> 00:29:18.399
understand what you're saying but

00:29:18.399 --> 00:29:20.720
for formality sake you have to go to a

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:21.679
rehab

00:29:21.679 --> 00:29:24.080
so he has to go to like no an input like

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.080
uh not an inpatient like he has to just

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.080
go and do like a program basically

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.679
dude so he goes in there dude it's so

00:29:29.679 --> 00:29:31.440
[ __ ] fun jesus so for steve

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.279
he goes in there for cbd dude has to do

00:29:33.279 --> 00:29:34.880
a [ __ ] thing that costs god knows how

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.679
much [ __ ] money

00:29:35.679 --> 00:29:37.760
he has to go like a patient first yeah

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.720
pretty much like

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.640
what are those called i used to when in

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.000
high school when i got called

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.600
what is urgent care yeah no no no

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.279
he has to go to a urgent it's an urgent

00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:49.039
care of rehab and it's like

00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:50.720
this is how social work works where it's

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.799
like you just everyone's writing these

00:29:52.799 --> 00:29:54.080
grants and then someone's like

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.600
here's fifty thousand dollars and you're

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.600
like whoo and everyone just goes on to

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.799
it dude so it's like

00:29:58.799 --> 00:30:01.039
he shows up he's like hey my job's

00:30:01.039 --> 00:30:02.559
making me go here or just for re it's

00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:04.799
for cbd and the ladies just like

00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:06.559
these things happen come on come on in

00:30:06.559 --> 00:30:08.080
there just like yo we're getting [ __ ]

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:08.960
so embarrassing

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.120
10 g's i mean he's like whatever i mean

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.240
it's not as embarrassing as going in

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.679
there for like [ __ ] smoking meth and

00:30:13.679 --> 00:30:14.320
[ __ ]

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.919
at least he can go in there and be like

00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:18.480
look i'm just i'm i have to be here

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.720
which is what everybody says true he

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.279
might be

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.840
[Laughter]

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.960
so it's like you go in there and they're

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.480
trying to keep it a little safe now

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.919
because like you have to go for one

00:30:29.919 --> 00:30:32.399
orientation in person and then you get

00:30:32.399 --> 00:30:33.120
to zoom

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.640
but they have this it's set up where

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.679
he's doing zoom rehab for cbd

00:30:37.679 --> 00:30:41.200
so so he can drive a bus

00:30:41.679 --> 00:30:44.399
so the first the first uh the first day

00:30:44.399 --> 00:30:45.440
he was there was an in-person

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.039
orientation but there are people who are

00:30:47.039 --> 00:30:48.559
zooming who are on screens

00:30:48.559 --> 00:30:50.159
so he was like him and like four or five

00:30:50.159 --> 00:30:51.520
other people and then there was a

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.200
six-year-old black dude on a screen

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.559
and they're all you know that ladies and

00:30:54.559 --> 00:30:56.799
gentlemen take a break so like you know

00:30:56.799 --> 00:30:58.399
cut your camera off whatever we'll come

00:30:58.399 --> 00:31:00.480
back the dude cut his camera off

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.120
didn't cut his mic so he put the [ __ ]

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.080

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.440
while they're on sound like lil wayne

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.320
up

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.279
he started fapping

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.720
so they're all in this room you know my

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.600

00:33:52.799 --> 00:33:55.039
here

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.480
yeah little forrest gump you remember

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.320
when he sat outside imitated that dude

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.039
coming

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:02.399
and forrest gump your brother should

00:34:02.399 --> 00:34:06.880
have done that to him

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.399
but yeah man that's so he has to go

00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:10.639
through cbd rehab so that he can reclaim

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:11.200
his uh

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.720
reclaim his job it's a sweet gig dude

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.159
you work for like basically like three

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:15.119
hours a day

00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:18.399
get paid pretty much septa i don't know

00:34:18.399 --> 00:34:18.960
if yeah

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.119
no no it's a school oh it's a school bus

00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:24.399
driver yeah it's a rehab

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.440
this is bad that's a good gig dude yeah

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.200
but arguing like i should be able to

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.280
have some [ __ ] weed in my system i'm

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.320
driving these kids

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.159
i mean the thing is if you take cbd oil

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:37.919
it's non-psychoactive

00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:39.440
and it just happens to leave the thing

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.440
is if you roll up what would you say if

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.359
if you got drugged if you tested

00:34:43.359 --> 00:34:45.599
positive for weed

00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:48.480
wouldn't you be like no it's cbd for

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.159
sure well you could technical but yeah

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:50.480
but

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.800
but if they were to like really hold

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.159
your feet to the fire they could take a

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:55.119
blood test and then look at your

00:34:55.119 --> 00:34:57.040
nanograms per milliliter of your blood

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.079
and they could tell you if that was

00:34:58.079 --> 00:34:59.760
[ __ ] or not

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.359
but it's also i mean you know forget you

00:35:01.359 --> 00:35:03.119
know okay that's one thing but it's also

00:35:03.119 --> 00:35:04.240
like dude

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.599
i'm sure a little bit of weed in a bus

00:35:05.599 --> 00:35:07.359
driver's system is

00:35:07.359 --> 00:35:08.560
the least of their [ __ ] worries it

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.560
should be mandatory but it's also like

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.000
the problem is is that yeah if you're

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
sober doing this i could legally

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.280
creep true dude you're gonna get some

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.000
bus ladies

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
yeah there's a ton of boss ladies yeah

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.440
well they're almost always bus ladies

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.400
are you talking about like

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.560
back in the days like the old school bus

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.920
yeah there was mostly one

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.920
well it was always just lesbian ladies

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.520
for the most in my town in my hometown

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.119
if you're a lesbian you did get shunned

00:35:31.119 --> 00:35:32.480
from the community and you just had to

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.119
be a boss

00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:34.400
hopped on the bus that was it you had to

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.079
be a school bus driver for sure dude it

00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:36.800
was at school

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.320
that was the treatment dude it was like

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.160
we had a lady who

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.440
pretty much yeah it was all ladies

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.119
actually for the most part the lady who

00:35:43.119 --> 00:35:43.760
was like our

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.839
like you know our usual bus driver which

00:35:45.839 --> 00:35:48.640
is crazy because you you'd think like

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.040
yeah it's a it's an awfully big bus for

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.400
a lady

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.920
she hit her she did hit a fire hydrant

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.599
once enough really yeah water shot

00:35:55.599 --> 00:35:56.320
everywhere

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.680
later found out you know through the bus

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.200
driver grapevine now that i have access

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.560
to bus driver gossip

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:04.000
she was on opiates yeah she's honest

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.440
she's gone but you can go get a

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.880
prescription to percocets as a bus

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.079
driver and be like

00:36:08.079 --> 00:36:10.079
[ __ ] like half your eyes closed on

00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:11.440
percocet that can't be true

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.200
yes you can dude there's no way you can

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.800
take

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.480
you can actively take percocets and

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.079
drive a bus yeah you can

00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:20.320
if you have chronic pain issues you are

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.079
by law you can't you couldn't say like

00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:22.720
hey

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.040
you can work this job but you can't take

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.480
y z on a fed like for the federal

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.119
government

00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:28.320
you're allowed to take any prescription

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.760
medicine medicine you want now if you're

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.200
working for the cia they they might get

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.400
into yeah but

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.920
the side effect of it is you can't

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.280
operate machinery so i think they would

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.960
be like

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.040
you can't take it and drive i'm pretty

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.320
sure you're able that was his whole case

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:40.960
like dude there

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.240
people can take prescription medicine

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.480
you can take [ __ ] i think you you can

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.960
take it but you can't take too much

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.960
dude think about the dudes when i worked

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.480
when i was uh and i guess they weren't

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.760
like testing these dudes like machine

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.200
operators and [ __ ] they're all on

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.240
percocets yeah

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.599
illegally no i think they're you're

00:36:55.599 --> 00:36:56.960
totally allowed to be cause we would go

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.960
get drug tested to work in hospitals

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.720
and i would we would i would go you know

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.240
go fake a drug test in the [ __ ]

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:02.960
hospital

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.560
little glove or whatever and dump it in

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.640
and then i would watch a guy who also

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.240
drug tested who are just [ __ ]

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.200
popping pills he's like i got a

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.359
prescription he was an operator

00:37:11.359 --> 00:37:12.880
so again correct me if i'm again i'm

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.240
always open to you know yeah cause i'm

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.680
not in a literal truth i'm just more of

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:16.800
a functional truth guy

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.680
matt i hear you obviously but could you

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.800
do me a favor yeah

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.599
did you talk to this hand dumbbell talk

00:37:23.599 --> 00:37:24.960
to their head why would i talk because

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.440
you're being a punk why am i beautiful

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.280
you can't take oxies and drive a school

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.560
bus you can take oxy

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:31.839
not actually cotton maybe but you can

00:37:31.839 --> 00:37:34.320
take percocets i can't do it i guarantee

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:34.560
it

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.000
i don't know i've seen people take perks

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.320
you can be a cop on perks

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.680
you can be a cop i swear to god you can

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.599
be a cop on perks and like all kinds of

00:37:41.599 --> 00:37:42.480
[ __ ]

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.079
i would argue like a fourth of cops are

00:37:44.079 --> 00:37:46.400
on psych meds to be honest

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.200

we won't give you this job if you have

00:38:04.079 --> 00:38:05.359
chronic pain you have to pop a couple

00:38:05.359 --> 00:38:06.720
perks

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.240
you have to pop some pancakes and syrup

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.079

they should they really should you would

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.400
think you would fall asleep

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.839
i mean dude i could be on like a dick

00:38:15.839 --> 00:38:17.599
shriveling amount of adderall and just

00:38:17.599 --> 00:38:18.800
go work for the government

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:19.920
and they're they're testing you and it's

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.280
like yeah that's what i take well

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.359
adderall would

00:38:23.359 --> 00:38:25.599
wouldn't [ __ ] you up like driving or

00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:26.960
anything that would [ __ ] me up

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.079
i got kicked out of a concert on

00:38:28.079 --> 00:38:30.160
adderall i tried to jump just adderall

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.200
yeah

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.720
what'd you do i tried it that was when i

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:33.920
tried to jump to the low i was at a

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.280
beastie boys concert and i tried to jump

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.119
to the ground level from my level

00:38:37.119 --> 00:38:39.359
got tackled by security dude it's so

00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:40.800
funny when i the

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.240
couple times i've taken adderall it does

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.079
the exact opposite where it like

00:38:44.079 --> 00:38:45.119
you know how they say like it helps

00:38:45.119 --> 00:38:46.320
people's impulse control if you have

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.680
adhd you take adderall

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.440
oh yeah when i take adderall it's the

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.599
total opposite it's like i'll like see

00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:52.800
something i'd like i'll be walking down

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.160
the street and see like a can of soda

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.200
next to like a bunch of people eating

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.880
and i kick that can i'm like okay

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.880
boom and i kick it i'm like oh my bad

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.400
really i was drinking too that was the

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:00.880
thing

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.960
so drinking an adderall for me yes like

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.160
oh my god yeah yeah

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.160
it's a disaster yeah that was the night

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.599
i kicked out of the beastie boys concert

00:39:07.599 --> 00:39:08.960
lost both of my shoes and had to walk

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:09.920
but you were drinking

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.680
at the beastie boy concert couple beers

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.200
man i've drank a bunch of time i never

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.000
did anything that crazy

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.680
it's when you give me when i'm drinking

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.119
and you hit me with the adderall

00:39:17.119 --> 00:39:18.800
because it's like i i have drunk

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.160
thoughts that are just bad ideas and the

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.839
adderall just gives me the energy to be

00:39:21.839 --> 00:39:22.880
like

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.720
let's go bro on the hop you got this it

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.240
gives me like this weird confidence that

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.000
i shouldn't have while i'm that drunk

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.920
yeah i can't do that i can't [ __ ] with

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.040
it it's crazy oh

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.200
it just makes you talk like [ __ ]

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.680
non-stop yeah it's [ __ ] insane yeah

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.880
i think this might be one of the voting

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:40.079
things let me see something

00:39:40.839 --> 00:39:42.320
hello

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.520
very good better hangout i i hope dude i

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.640
caught one of the voters

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.760
i caught one of them the other day on

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.440
the phone starting to start to hit them

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:50.880
with my theories on the two-party system

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.400
like we don't care who you vote for man

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:52.800
just hope

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.960
you vote it's like dude yeah you do stop

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.079
yeah yeah you do

00:39:56.079 --> 00:39:58.320
yeah for real you're telling me there's

00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.359
none

00:39:59.359 --> 00:40:00.880
yeah if people are like you need to vote

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:01.760
it's like i'm not gonna vote they're

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:02.880
like if you don't vote that's pretty

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.480
much like voting for trump it's like

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.920
all right so you need to vote democrat

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.440
yeah exactly because i could go

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.359
literally vote for trump

00:40:09.359 --> 00:40:11.680
but i'm saying i'm not gonna vote yeah

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.119
you know and then they're like oh you

00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:14.160
can't do that that's like

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.240
voting for trump i don't understand the

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:20.000
humongous boner that people get for this

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.359
being like i'm gonna wear the sticker

00:40:21.359 --> 00:40:22.800
i'm gonna show everybody blah blah blah

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.079
blah blah it's like

00:40:24.079 --> 00:40:25.760
i don't know i've been reading the uh

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.440
the denial of death dude it's such a

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.640
good i like read it for a little bit and

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.440
put it back down

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.720
what's it about it's about how most of

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.079
our and i haven't finished it yet but i

00:40:34.079 --> 00:40:35.680
haven't finished it yet but it's it's a

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.160
it's about how basically most of our

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.839
deepest insecurities and our kind of

00:40:39.839 --> 00:40:41.520
like the personas we build

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.880
so that we can kind of like go out and

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.319
function in the world or typically build

00:40:44.319 --> 00:40:45.920
on like a lie or like we like

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.760
restrict what we pay attention to so

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.119
that we don't freak out about the fact

00:40:49.119 --> 00:40:50.240
that we're just like floating through

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.240
space and we're gonna die so

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.880
we'll be like i'm a republican and i'm

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:55.680
not so like

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.920
when you so when you when you're younger

00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.119
you know you just kind of build a bunch

00:40:59.119 --> 00:41:00.480
of like a personality just to kind of

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.599
defend yourself from like the

00:41:01.599 --> 00:41:02.960
overwhelming

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.319
terror that's like existing in the

00:41:04.319 --> 00:41:06.000
universe so you start to kind of try to

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.359
like build an identity

00:41:07.359 --> 00:41:08.480
and they're saying that like you know

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.000
there's not two types of people but

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:10.560
there's

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:12.000
people following it like somewhere in

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.839
two camps where it's like there's people

00:41:13.839 --> 00:41:14.240
who

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.160
when they you know they kind of come of

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.440
age and they're like they see the

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.960
options presented to them by the society

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.240
they're in and they go like

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.680
i'll take up one of these parts and i'll

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:22.880
be this and i'll be then there's other

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.400
people who'll go like

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.400
[ __ ] this [ __ ] all of these things i

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.520
want to i want to like

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.359
i want to exist i want all this stuff to

00:41:29.359 --> 00:41:30.400
exist yeah i want to do everything i

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.359
want and you know

00:41:31.359 --> 00:41:33.040
kind of talking about how like the

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.880
average cat is just like an animal like

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.560
an animal animals run on instincts but

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.520
human beings

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.280
like can like think and reason so the

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.040
average human will like kind of like

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.480
have their nose down and like the the

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.920
standard stuff of like

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.920
football you know like tv politics

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.599
sports and like they're saying like when

00:41:47.599 --> 00:41:48.079
the average

00:41:48.079 --> 00:41:50.079
cat like lifts their nose from like

00:41:50.079 --> 00:41:51.599
their regular pastures and starts like

00:41:51.599 --> 00:41:52.880
to contemplate like their place in the

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.560
universe they're just like

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:58.000
going it's pretty good yeah and i'm not

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.599
doing it justice it goes into like deep

00:41:59.599 --> 00:42:01.359
psychoanalytic stuff it's pretty [ __ ]

00:42:01.359 --> 00:42:03.760
tight what was it called denial of death

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.520
it's pretty tight it's you like it i

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.880
might deny death dude

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.640
every we all do i mean it's i know i

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.240
mean i might like actively start like

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.359
publicly denying it

00:42:11.359 --> 00:42:13.920
yeah i don't think it's not real it's

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.200
coveted we've been here forever

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.960
government's lying dude don't get me

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.880
wrong all i can remember is being here

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:19.440
forever

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.200
heard that i don't i don't think we died

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.880
i don't think [ __ ] was going on before

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:26.720
true all i remember is from 1992

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.920
that's when the world started you're

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.079
born in 92 no i was born in 87.

00:42:30.079 --> 00:42:32.160
i was going oh when you came in like 88

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.920
when you came december 87. i don't

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:34.800
believe i was born in

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.240
86 at all i don't even believe i was a

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.400
baby i don't think i was a baby

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.079
i emerged as a five-year-old dude i

00:42:40.079 --> 00:42:41.440
think i'm timeless and i got hit in the

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.800
head in the 80s i don't know whenever i

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:45.599
was this big

00:42:45.599 --> 00:42:47.440
yeah for sure that's all i remember just

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.800
being this size forever

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.720
really it's pretty tight all i can

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.640
remember is being my exact size

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.400
i was actually thinking today about

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.760
buying uh

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.040
when i remember when you remember when

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.880
you first got money

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.280
like the first time two years ago no i'm

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.319
talking about like

00:43:02.319 --> 00:43:04.160
the first the first time the patreon

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.440
started doing well

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.359
talking about your first like contact

00:43:07.359 --> 00:43:10.560
with any kind of currency

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.960
i remember getting five bucks when i was

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.319
i mean i i think i got like tooth fairy

00:43:14.319 --> 00:43:15.680
hooked me up a couple times

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.359
when i was five when i was eight i

00:43:17.359 --> 00:43:18.640
worked with my dad for like a week

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.079
though helping i was holding a can of

00:43:20.079 --> 00:43:21.680

he gave me five bucks for like a week's

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.560
worth of work

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.480
and in like my in my universe remember

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.920
with penny candy you'd go into a store

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.040
and there would just be like

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.319
bins and you would be like dude i'm

00:43:32.319 --> 00:43:33.440
gonna give you a gummy shark and they'd

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.480
wait i was just talking about this they

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.240
still have that in spain do they really

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.440

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.599
do they they're just catching up so dude

00:43:39.599 --> 00:43:40.960
they have a gummy shark

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.200
stores you go in and it's it's so funny

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.160
was you and me talking about this

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.280
because i was munching those i was like

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.560
stealing them down the aisle

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.000
could have been yeah we may have been

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.280
yeah we made them in something we just

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.880
talked about last episode

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:54.720
did we talk about gummy sharks well

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.079
i don't believe it's not real dude i

00:43:56.079 --> 00:43:57.520
barely believe that dude i had an

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.200
inception yeah episode denying

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.560
i'm not at last episode never happened

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.400
dude i was like thinking about this when

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.839
i saw i was eight years old i got five

00:44:05.839 --> 00:44:07.119
bucks and dude like the

00:44:07.119 --> 00:44:08.960
feeling of immense power i had to think

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.560
because all i spent money on was just

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:11.280
penny candy

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:13.359
yeah so my head i was just like dude

00:44:13.359 --> 00:44:15.040
that's gonna be [ __ ] my grandma gave

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.520
me a hundred bucks one christmas

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.200
and i was like i have to buy we gotta

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.040
buy a dream cast

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.640
actually it was a thousand she won the

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.800
lottery won the lottery that year and

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.400
gave everybody one thousand

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:30.160
damn and i was like my parents just took

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:30.800
it

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.119
i never saw a penny never saw it and

00:44:33.119 --> 00:44:34.880
then as the years went on that that

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:36.240
thousand was

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.560
brought down to like 20. okay good for

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.440
her they taxed it

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.359
she started in the socialist regime

00:44:41.359 --> 00:44:43.200
absolutely yeah my grandma went full

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.760
[ __ ] mao

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:47.440
we overthrew her this year now she's

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.200
dead that's how she died there was an

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.119
uprising there's a coup

00:44:51.119 --> 00:44:53.040
um but yeah i was thinking about i was

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:55.119
like i can get a dream cast i mean

00:44:55.119 --> 00:44:56.880
a g i think it was in like fifth grade

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.800
yeah that's crazy never got it

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.440
i got three hundred dollars my junior no

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.800
just [ __ ] up from my parents

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.960
to take it i mean it makes perfect sense

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.079
can you imagine of

00:45:06.079 --> 00:45:08.240
being like your son like a fifth grader

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.520
having a i would take you i would take

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:09.760
her

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.760
same thing yeah i'd like there's no way

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:12.960
there's no way what

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.359
would you possibly do with it yeah like

00:45:15.359 --> 00:45:16.800
i got three hundred dollars when i could

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:17.440
have got

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.520
they should have gave me a dream cast

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.040
churro and then spent the rest at the

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:21.760
[ __ ] knights

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.359
you should have revolted at the night

00:45:23.359 --> 00:45:24.560
you think it all went to the next that

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:24.800
all

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.319
straight went to the they probably just

00:45:26.319 --> 00:45:27.520
bought you [ __ ] you needed with it

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.000
definitely

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.520
so they were like no [ __ ] we're not

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:33.200
spending this yeah

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.440
you should have got emancipated over it

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.960
like my parents stole a thousand bucks

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.240
i'm out of here i should still try to

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.400
get it

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.680
could you file i wonder if you can

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.400
however get like 24 you can file to get

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.560
i might that'd be so [ __ ] funny to

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.760
just be like legally you're not my

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:50.160
parents

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.800
yeah i went exactly i went like as a gag

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:56.079
as a gag i got emancipated

00:45:56.079 --> 00:46:01.599
you change your last name legally

00:46:01.599 --> 00:46:04.800
hey sorry for the quick jump

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.280
we uh had to edit we just you know had

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:08.720
to edit something there

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:09.920
i stood well i just started to talk

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:11.359

yeah it was perfect timing it was

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:18.319
perfect time we had to let the wood man

00:46:18.319 --> 00:46:18.720
in

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.560
we had to bring him in he brought a can

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.319
opener i guess look

00:46:22.319 --> 00:46:23.839
i apologize you trying to fall on the

00:46:23.839 --> 00:46:25.200
sword but let's let's say what really

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.800
happened lemaire started freaking out

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.400
again saying kovid wasn't real like he

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.520
did on the left oh

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.920
i forgot lemaitre john yeah you missed

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.520
out on one of the episodes

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.920
yeah on our patreon lamer was all like

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.280
dude this is crazy they make

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.040
people like afraid to like let the air

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.720
touch their face this is so stupid we

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:41.920
should we shouldn't have shut down the

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.200
economy and i was like well mayor people

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.240
are dying what the [ __ ]

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.760
and yeah matt was like we need to shut

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.000
down the economy that's a bold move for

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.720
your personal choice

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.160
yeah i was like i can't believe it yeah

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.000
the mayor started saying how like the

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
case fatality rate was like you know

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.839
like only not six times worse than the

00:46:57.839 --> 00:46:59.119
flu and it was like well

00:46:59.119 --> 00:47:00.880
they [ __ ] estimate the flu they only

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:02.640
had they only really tested like 20 000

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:03.839
people but then they're like well from

00:47:03.839 --> 00:47:05.040
that number we'll like say

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.880
that maybe 22 million had the flu but

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.240
with kovid they don't base it off the

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:08.720
estimate

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.160
and i was like lemaire just knock it off

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.000
yeah man that's come on you're out of

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.599
your house this is serious all right

00:47:13.599 --> 00:47:14.880
well mayor look the united states

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.400
government i know you don't think this

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.359
is true

00:47:17.359 --> 00:47:20.400
but they always have cared about super

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.000
old people

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.440
this whole government is set up to

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.040
protect those who we've abandoned in

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.319
nursing homes dude and if you don't

00:47:26.319 --> 00:47:27.280

[ __ ] to me remember when we invaded that

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.640

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.079
weapons of mass destruction turned out

00:47:34.079 --> 00:47:34.720
they weren't

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:35.920

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.119
we kind of [ __ ] that up and just went

00:47:37.119 --> 00:47:38.160

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.200
reason

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:40.640

00:47:49.359 --> 00:47:50.240
know if you've noticed

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.559
a lot of times but the news

00:47:52.559 --> 00:47:54.880
organizations are owned by

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:57.280
billionaires who have your best

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.040

heart so come on please i'll bring that

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.640

[Laughter]

and we're back we're back dude yeah so

00:48:10.559 --> 00:48:11.920
that's a i appreciate you trying to

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.280
cover for life i remember

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:16.400
yeah last week i i tried to step in when

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:16.960
you guys were

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:20.160
doing battle yeah there's no

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.000
dude i don't know if you got that but

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.079
matt's clearly the one saying

00:48:24.079 --> 00:48:25.520
yeah was this on the nate episode the

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:27.520
neighborhood no on patreon all i was

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:28.720
saying is if

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.960
like i let my my experience be the judge

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.240
of how i think about things because at

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.520
the end of the day it's impossible for

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.440
an average person to

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.040
figure out exactly what's going on you

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.720
pretty much you just watch the news

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.240
and you know that's you just believe one

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.200
thing or you don't and that's kind of

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.400
how you rock until like when people

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.319
start quoting the numbers it's like dude

00:48:44.319 --> 00:48:45.760
you can pick one study of anything and

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.960
be like oh here's what happened until

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:48.800
there's like a meta analysis of like oh

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.079
here's all of the data we you know

00:48:50.079 --> 00:48:51.520
people just don't have that right now

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:53.520
but i'll tell you what dude what

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:56.160
something munched my hand last night

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:59.760
yeah dude you see that

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.319
i think it was a mosquito bite but like

00:49:02.319 --> 00:49:04.400
it itched like crazy last night but now

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.760
it hurts like a [ __ ] like

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:09.599
bruise i got much i got monster

00:49:09.599 --> 00:49:11.680
secretly i'm not by the bar no this was

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:12.880
the middle of the night middle of the

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.319
night i got munched

00:49:14.319 --> 00:49:18.000
by like what we can only hope was a

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:18.720
mesquite

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:21.839
true instead of a spider it might be the

00:49:21.839 --> 00:49:23.440
next outbreak dude it could be a bad

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:23.839
spider

00:49:23.839 --> 00:49:25.200
we got a bat we could have a mutated

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:27.520
trouble

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:28.480
but yeah that's what i was saying to

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.559
lemare i was just like

00:49:30.559 --> 00:49:32.640

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.240
with saying let's talk

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.760
if you stop watching the news you

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.200
wouldn't be afraid yeah as afraid

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:38.640
because your direct experience there's

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:39.119
not like

00:49:39.119 --> 00:49:41.760

00:49:44.559 --> 00:49:45.839
i don't want anyone to get this but it's

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.160
we had two of them in like that i think

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:55.040
the 50s and 70s ask anyone who has lived

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.480
lived through that how it was like i

00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.160
don't know we didn't know yeah so it's

00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.680
like again it's bad it's not a good

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:00.960
[ __ ] thing because they wipe a ton of

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.240
people out but like

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.640

00:50:38.079 --> 00:50:39.040
annoying to be

i've like gone out of my way to avoid it

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:42.079

guy should be able to go do his thing

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:05.920

dude we had the whale man i'm thinking

00:54:07.359 --> 00:54:08.839
about the whale man that came to our

00:54:08.839 --> 00:54:10.960
school yeah we had a whale man

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.400
the guy came to us i don't know how he

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:13.760
lined this deal up this guy with a

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:15.359
ponytail was like an expert on whales

00:54:15.359 --> 00:54:16.880
and he was go to catholic schools and be

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:18.000
like

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.359
i should go talk to your school though

00:54:19.359 --> 00:54:20.480
the school's gonna need to know about

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:21.040
yeah

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.800
he was a secret neo-nazi as well that

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.960
was the other thing too confirmed by

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:27.440
my boy shutzke who said he he heard him

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:28.800
spitting on the church steps and he was

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.440
a satanist

i mean the fact that again it's

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.160
incredible that a guy was a whale man

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.480

00:55:33.359 --> 00:55:35.920
gonna let you're gonna let my man here

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:39.359
dunk on you on the covet where was that

00:55:39.359 --> 00:55:39.920
courage

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.599
remember last week when you had a bunch

00:55:41.599 --> 00:55:44.079
of courage

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.319
now this week nasa could come in here

00:55:46.319 --> 00:55:49.119
and dance on my main point was again if

00:55:49.119 --> 00:55:49.920
you stop by

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:52.000
dogging if you stop watching the news

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.359
you wouldn't be as scary

00:55:53.359 --> 00:55:55.200
yeah you're scared the news is what's

00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.880
hyping everybody up right now dude that

00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:58.559
was not your main point what was my main

00:55:58.559 --> 00:55:58.960
point

00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:00.960
it definitely wasn't that that was my

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:02.480
one of my top points your main point

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:04.400
was more of my top ones i think your

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:05.760
main point was we shouldn't have shut

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:06.480
down the account

00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.319
exactly that was it exactly and if you

00:56:08.319 --> 00:56:09.760
let your experience be the judge rather

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:10.559
than just being like

00:56:10.559 --> 00:56:13.359
what did you say don you're okay i'll be

00:56:13.359 --> 00:56:13.920
good and then

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:15.760
all of your relationships are based off

00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:17.680
that dude again once you get out of the

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:19.599
quest for literal truth

00:56:19.599 --> 00:56:20.880
way easier because you'll know you're

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:22.319
never going to prove anything right ever

00:56:22.319 --> 00:56:23.760
there's always conflicting information

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:25.839
outside and within you because you're in

00:56:25.839 --> 00:56:27.119
your head at some point you're having

00:56:27.119 --> 00:56:27.760
both

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.359
perspectives on some level otherwise

00:56:29.359 --> 00:56:30.960
you're not thinking that's what thinking

00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:31.359
is

00:56:31.359 --> 00:56:33.200
yeah here's the thing oh well maybe not

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.720
and if you just shut off the maybe not

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:35.760
part you just become

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:36.960
you know basically an automaton you

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.799
can't turn them maybe not off

00:56:38.799 --> 00:56:39.920
that's what people don't want to realize

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:42.079
strong maybe not everyone everyone does

00:56:42.079 --> 00:56:43.520
if you're paying attention

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:44.960
people are like i'm a republican it's

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:46.720
like yeah but within you there are

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:48.559
you do have a part of you that argues

00:56:48.559 --> 00:56:50.079
kind of the other side when you're like

00:56:50.079 --> 00:56:51.599
we got we can't have the you know the

00:56:51.599 --> 00:56:53.040
board we can't have kids coming over the

00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.400
border

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:55.920
come on boy can't have kids coming over

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:58.079
the border blah blah you have kids

00:56:58.079 --> 00:56:59.440
you know yeah well dude you know they

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.799
have like when people defend they'll

00:57:00.799 --> 00:57:02.720
have like kids who are like in tin foil

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:03.520
blankets and

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.839
over the border and people be like

00:57:05.839 --> 00:57:06.880
shannon came here

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:09.119
that's what you get but it's also like

00:57:09.119 --> 00:57:10.319
all right well maybe we could [ __ ]

00:57:10.319 --> 00:57:11.119
make it just

00:57:11.119 --> 00:57:13.119
you know teenagers and in their head

00:57:13.119 --> 00:57:14.319
they're probably like is that kind of

00:57:14.319 --> 00:57:15.200
[ __ ] up

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:16.720
no it's not shut up dude if you were in

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:17.760
your friend's circle if you guys were

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:18.400
all you know

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:20.079
a certain political persuasion and

00:57:20.079 --> 00:57:21.440
you're just like i don't know i think

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:22.240
it's kind of [ __ ] up

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.319
like shut the [ __ ] up dude so it becomes

00:57:24.319 --> 00:57:25.760
more about kind of like keeping your

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:26.559
social

00:57:26.559 --> 00:57:28.720
uh interactions in check versus like an

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:30.079
accurate picture of reality that's all

00:57:30.079 --> 00:57:30.960
the same dude

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.640
does this have to do with the the it's

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:34.240
something called individuation

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:35.680
the process of individuation that

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:37.200
happens to maturity do you know about

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:38.400
this can you just tell me about this i'm

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:39.839
trying to learn about it i know about i

00:57:39.839 --> 00:57:40.880
know a little about that

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:42.160
i know a little about that you know if

00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:43.200
you can get you know if you can get out

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.240
of the hive mind it's actually a

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:45.920
terrifying thing to do but the idea is

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:47.200
you're supposed to kind of

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.200
think about what you initially want to

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:50.960
do what you actually believe

00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:52.400
and try to pursue that as much as you

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:54.400
can this is what the whole matrix thing

00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.760
if like either a bunch of agent smiths

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:56.799
who come up and they're like stop doing

00:57:56.799 --> 00:57:58.319
that stop doing this stop doing that

00:57:58.319 --> 00:58:00.559
so but it's just it's just really just

00:58:00.559 --> 00:58:01.760
figuring out what you're actually into

00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:02.799
what you actually believe and trying to

00:58:02.799 --> 00:58:04.240
be as honest with that as possible i go

00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:05.520
through spells like 20 minutes on

00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:06.640
youtube where i'm trying to fix

00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.240
everything in my mind and then just like

00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:09.680
little words stick so i was like i have

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:11.680
no other chance to ask you so [ __ ] it

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:13.680
you text me somebody don't yeah but i

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:14.960
don't i'm not like an expert i know it's

00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:17.119
just the process of becoming your actual

00:58:17.119 --> 00:58:18.880
true self rather than your

00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:20.640
preordained social roles that you kind

00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:22.000
of take on and you know

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.240
live out that's all is that when you

00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:25.680
have to regulate how much you yell at

00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:26.720
yourself like you were talking about the

00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:28.319
two voices

00:58:28.319 --> 00:58:30.000
you know where you're like the one guy

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.520
thinks this and then you're what was the

00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:33.599
voice you said yeah that

00:58:33.599 --> 00:58:34.960
talking about paul you're like treating

00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:36.400
your thinking rational mind as a

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:37.200
roommate

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:38.960
yeah and then maybe i hope i'm trying to

00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.079
get out of it at this point because

00:58:40.079 --> 00:58:40.880
shane didn't look at me

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:44.160
i asked for help wait what was that

00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:47.520
no you said i'm dying you pointed me and

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:51.839
said what was your thing you called him

00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:59.119
[Laughter]

00:58:59.119 --> 00:59:00.799
yeah that's the idea that your pro your

00:59:00.799 --> 00:59:02.880
mind is typically trying to make

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.400
solve problems all the time it's trying

00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.680
to like completely it's trying to make

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:06.880
your life better and better and better

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.160
and better and better it doesn't really

00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:09.520
kind of look at things as they are like

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:10.640
i guess it's kind of sweet it's always

00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:12.000
like well that's this is sweet but

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:12.640
there's this thing

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:14.319
you know you kind of drive yourself nuts

00:59:14.319 --> 00:59:15.760
see that that's the one thing you call

00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:16.559
your mind

00:59:16.559 --> 00:59:18.319
you put your mind as like a different

00:59:18.319 --> 00:59:20.079
thing you call it paul or like joe or

00:59:20.079 --> 00:59:20.559
whatever

00:59:20.559 --> 00:59:22.079
so you're thinking like man this sucks

00:59:22.079 --> 00:59:23.440
this this sucks this sucks so you'd be

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:24.160
like

00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.760
thank you for your input joe but in the

00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:26.960
end and that's what i'm saying before in

00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.400
terms of literal truth like

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.839
you start figuring out like does this

00:59:29.839 --> 00:59:31.440
suck do i suck

00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:32.720
there's no way you can ever figure that

00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:34.079
figure that out but you can say like

00:59:34.079 --> 00:59:35.599
functionally does it work if i just

00:59:35.599 --> 00:59:36.720
ignore that and do the thing i'm

00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:37.440
supposed to do

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:38.799
the answer is yes dude that's about

00:59:38.799 --> 00:59:40.559
that's what functional truth's all about

00:59:40.559 --> 00:59:42.400
so all right but yeah if you're looking

00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:43.520
for literal truth the best thing you can

00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:44.880
get is a bunch of people who disagree

00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:45.359
with you

00:59:45.359 --> 00:59:47.119
and then you just make like a covert

00:59:47.119 --> 00:59:48.400
bond to like never disagree with each

00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:49.599
other on a certain level then you know

00:59:49.599 --> 00:59:50.480
that's just that

00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:51.680
people come in like well actually you're

00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:54.000
like [ __ ] you you [ __ ]

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.319
yeah echo chamber [ __ ] yeah you know the

00:59:56.319 --> 00:59:59.119
deal got there after yeah

00:59:59.359 --> 01:00:01.440
yeah but yeah i know look come on i

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.880
don't want to hijack the cast i thought

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:03.200
no

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.359
no i asked yes yeah i have other outlets

01:00:05.359 --> 01:00:06.720
you know this is good

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.319
thank you bro i got it i've been doing

01:00:08.319 --> 01:00:10.000
deep all i'm thinking about is just

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.119
all i'm thinking about is these two

01:00:11.119 --> 01:00:13.040
fighting that's all i want true well we

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.079
we could

01:00:14.079 --> 01:00:16.000
when we uh we do the patreon i do have a

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.280
thing i want to try with them i i went

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.480
to california and i

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.920
scored some weed goodies so i'm going to

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.040
have them i'm thinking of some

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.160
challenges we can do

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:25.520
oh i have two challenges two king sized

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.079
cones

01:00:26.079 --> 01:00:27.520
i would say there's a pull-up bar out

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.520
there oh that would be like a soccer

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.599
game dude that might be one nothing

01:00:31.599 --> 01:00:33.520
you think of you i think that's i think

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:34.720
that's a nil-nil draw

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:35.839
and don't get me wrong i'd be right

01:00:35.839 --> 01:00:38.079
there with you boys how many pull-ups

01:00:38.079 --> 01:00:39.680
you guys use my bug hand

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:43.040
dude i'm on break we shouldn't

01:00:47.119 --> 01:00:49.200
that could have been a widow it could be

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.880
a widow dude yeah because we had bed

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:51.760
bugs

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.920
two years ago i remember and i literally

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.520
cannot stop thinking about these [ __ ]

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.160
things really

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:58.160
for two years that's how do you ever get

01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.200
bed bugs yeah

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.000
i told you i was i was like i wasn't

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.520
well first of all i had fleas that was

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:04.319
horrible

01:01:04.319 --> 01:01:06.000
i had a hostel in brazil where they were

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.760

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.559
look at this thing dude so you think the

01:01:52.559 --> 01:01:54.079
bugs you think the bed bugs one you

01:01:54.079 --> 01:01:55.680
think there was one lone survivor like

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:57.599
one i am legend yeah dude that survived

01:01:57.599 --> 01:02:01.119
i think there was one marcus latrell

01:02:01.119 --> 01:02:04.799
mattress latrell i think matches the

01:02:04.799 --> 01:02:05.760
trail got me

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:06.880
let me see that i don't i'll tell you if

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.240
that's a bed bug but it's not a bed bug

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:09.039
no it's not a bed

01:02:09.039 --> 01:02:12.240
bug this thing is a either spider or a

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:12.960
mosquito

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.720
yeah but it is a spider should have two

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.039
holes you should have two holes

01:02:17.039 --> 01:02:18.720
that's definitely not a spider bite well

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.000
then how come it doesn't have one hole

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.760
from the mosquito

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:22.960
it could be something i think your

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.240
spider whole body could be something

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.520
with a boar it could be like some sort

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:25.760
of

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.640
horned caterpillar it could have been a

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.559
[ __ ] pokemon

01:02:30.559 --> 01:02:32.319
dude your body got rammed by a horned

01:02:32.319 --> 01:02:34.400
caterpillar this thing

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.039
this thing woke me up how bad it is i

01:02:37.039 --> 01:02:39.280
was itching my [ __ ] hand all night

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.640
and then i was like what i've never been

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.319
bit on the inside of a hand by a

01:02:42.319 --> 01:02:43.760
mosquito

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.860
true oh it could be an ant bite

01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:49.440
[Music]

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.599
yeah i thought ants had venom once i'm

01:02:51.599 --> 01:02:52.640
embarrassed to this topic

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:55.520
uh we got ants in the bed possibly well

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.200
ants dude like it's slight venom that's

01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:58.319
why it like itches

01:02:58.319 --> 01:03:00.400
no they don't it's like arguments hold

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:02.000
on what about this [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.680
had something wrong with his eye and he

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.440
claimed an ant got it in his eye

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:06.480
and it was venom because i thought it

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.079
was like daddy longlegs i've never i've

01:03:08.079 --> 01:03:08.640
never heard

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:12.000
any long legs have what was the issue

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.520
i just was attached to it after 10

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.799
minutes of telling you guys i understood

01:03:14.799 --> 01:03:15.599
that

01:03:15.599 --> 01:03:18.160
the daddy longlegs venom story is true a

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.520
lot of people believe that

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:21.839
okay about like they have so much venom

01:03:21.839 --> 01:03:22.960
that could kill a guy but they can't

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.400
puncture your skin

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.640
with their fangs damn yes it's not true

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.240
it's not true but that's a very

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:30.319
common [ __ ] lie it's common enough

01:03:30.319 --> 01:03:32.079
that a [ __ ] guy like me believed it

01:03:32.079 --> 01:03:35.680
true what's up with that foundation and

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.000
then

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.319
yeah he took the daddy longlegs legend

01:03:38.319 --> 01:03:39.760
and built it into ants

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:42.720
like everything had in the eyeball and

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.599
one day

01:03:43.599 --> 01:03:46.319
he had a [ __ ] up eyeball yeah i think

01:03:46.319 --> 01:03:48.960
clearly just pinkeye

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.240
a couple times that year yeah i think it

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.559
was 100 just pinkeye

01:03:52.559 --> 01:03:55.280
and he was like what i think happened

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.039
was

01:03:57.039 --> 01:04:00.720
i think an aunt was on my hand

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.760
yeah and i went like this and smashed an

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:04.079
ant

01:04:04.079 --> 01:04:06.319
into my eye obviously got the venom he

01:04:06.319 --> 01:04:07.760
thought he instead of just like

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.319
this was clearly [ __ ] pink eye yeah i

01:04:10.319 --> 01:04:12.400
think what happened was i picked up an

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.520
aunt

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.079
and shoved it in my own eye to be fair

01:04:16.079 --> 01:04:16.720
did you try

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.319
it was the actual was that close to what

01:04:18.319 --> 01:04:19.680
you thought that was exactly the math

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:20.319
that was yeah

01:04:20.319 --> 01:04:23.359
yeah and i had to it was one of those it

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:24.480
had to be one of those

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:25.920
like you usually you don't want to call

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.079
somebody out on like a blatant like

01:04:28.079 --> 01:04:29.280
you're wrong type thing i thought there

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.359
was wiggle room but this was like 100

01:04:31.359 --> 01:04:34.799
i was like no it came down so far

01:04:34.799 --> 01:04:35.920
the other way i was like there's gotta

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:37.920
be wiggly it would have been easy

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.160
well it'd be stable to try to stay on

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.839
the mic a little bit there one man

01:04:41.839 --> 01:04:43.599
would try to get up on it yeah there you

01:04:43.599 --> 01:04:45.280
go dude so

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.640

01:04:50.319 --> 01:04:51.839
an ant in your eye if you like if you

01:04:51.839 --> 01:04:53.119

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.719
foreman mills it's a [ __ ] cheap store

01:10:18.719 --> 01:10:20.800
it's like burlington cone factory you

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:21.840
don't know what former mills is i've

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:22.400
heard of it

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:25.040
i don't know factory yeah they sell like

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:25.760
uh

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.280
i went there i usually would go there

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.640
once i stopped doing this because of

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.159
this incident but i would buy like six

01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:31.280
pairs of sweatpants

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:32.480
i would go to four they're like [ __ ]

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.400
like four dollars so cheap then they

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:35.920
bought six pairs of sweatpants none of

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:37.360
them had pockets

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.880
i spent a winter just like holding my

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.480
phone involved oh it sucks

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:42.480
dude [ __ ] i just bought two illegals

authentic notre dame basketball shorts

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:50.400
but they're too authentic

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:53.360
and neither of them have [ __ ] pockets

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:54.480
so those you're talking about

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:55.760
players don't have their phone the whole

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.840
time while they're

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.719
man this thing hurts

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.679
do you think it's starting to pulse i

01:11:03.679 --> 01:11:05.040
don't know dude it's not good

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.880
let me see let me see that again let me

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.640
see where that thing is

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.320
that's definitely not where a mosquito

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.679
would ever bite you it would

01:11:11.679 --> 01:11:13.199
it would bite you i've never been bit on

01:11:13.199 --> 01:11:15.040
the inside i get munched by me it might

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:17.600
be the stigmata it's not swollen either

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:20.159
it's like deep tissue damage it hurts

01:11:20.159 --> 01:11:22.560
it's like nerve problems yeah

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:25.280
no you you do have it out for for little

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.320
bugs dude

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:27.600
you think there's little bugs getting

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.520
there was a time jerry walked into the

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.280
green room at helium and i had like my

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:32.320
jeans rolled up

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.760
yeah and he was like what are you doing

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:36.000
i was like i think we have fleas

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.239
i was looking in my legs for fleas no

01:11:38.239 --> 01:11:39.280
you see him immediately

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:40.880
and then yeah and then i finally saw

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.480
fleas like a year later for the first

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:43.760
time in my life and i was like oh i'm

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:47.280
[ __ ] nuts i'm nuts i keep looking for

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:49.040
tiny bugs which i think is like a form

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.560
of schizophrenia

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:53.440
or like it's like it's some type of

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.199
weird like it's a popular delusion

01:11:55.199 --> 01:11:56.880
early sign is like you're constantly

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.800
afraid of bugs one of the close ones

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.640
or the first ones you get so then the

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.239
denial of death they talk about this

01:12:02.239 --> 01:12:04.000
when like again you're the overwhelming

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.840
fear and terror of like just being a

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.400
person and being obliterated or whatever

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.920
that you start to pick these little

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.520
weird problems that like you can like

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.560
kind of

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.320
triumph over to where you're like i

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.159
can't try over the clothes

01:12:16.159 --> 01:12:17.840
i'm telling you but it's like bugs

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:19.679
instead of like i'm

01:12:19.679 --> 01:12:21.760
like alone if you don't think i'm really

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.280
hiring me i'm going to die

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.880
if your body's going to be destroyed i'm

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.719
entirely focused on being alone in the

01:12:26.719 --> 01:12:27.760
universe

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:30.400
you're out of your mind the bugs are

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:30.800
just

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.120
exactly what's they're on they're on

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.400
deck so you're on a different side of

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.000
neuroticism i fall on this as well that

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:36.560
you've

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.159
transcended all the social roles

01:12:38.159 --> 01:12:40.000
available to you and then typically that

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:40.640
comes with

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:42.159
a person who like again they say like

01:12:42.159 --> 01:12:44.719
the little humans as creatures have like

01:12:44.719 --> 01:12:47.360
sports social roles and like you know

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.480
like hey you're going to be a good

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.679
carpenter and you know you're not saying

01:12:49.679 --> 01:12:50.480
there's anything wrong with that but

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:51.920
like people would just get into those

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:52.480
like

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.000
you know here's tick tock on my phone

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.679
hear sports here's the news i believe it

01:12:55.679 --> 01:12:56.080
all

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.360
then there's dudes who lift their head

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.120
up from the pasture too long and they

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.239
start being like what else is out there

01:13:00.239 --> 01:13:01.840
and you know that's they say people bite

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:02.159
off

01:13:02.159 --> 01:13:04.320
a certain type of person who's neurotic

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:05.920
bites off way more they can chew

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.440
way more than they can chew and that's

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.760
typically uh you know

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.679
the stuff of heroes i would say they say

01:13:11.679 --> 01:13:13.520
neurotic i'm like heroes

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.920
absolute legends it's pretty funny to

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:17.440
think about people just biting off way

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:18.719
more than they can chew in life and be

01:13:18.719 --> 01:13:19.040
like

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:21.760
why isn't this working yeah yeah or they

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:23.120
said the other side of that people who

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.040
just don't bite off anything at all

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:27.199
and then that's a whole other uh hole

01:13:27.199 --> 01:13:28.480
you were talking about earlier

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:30.400
i have i had a couple friends that were

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.080
not funny at all

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:34.800
like we're even close to being funny

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.640
that's wild

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.320
like zero dudes who just aren't funny

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.760
dudes who can't be funny

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.679
yeah i mean my whole life yeah like he

01:13:41.679 --> 01:13:43.199
wasn't funny i knew a couple dudes that

01:13:43.199 --> 01:13:44.640
were just not funny every once while

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:46.159
they'll like text me trying to be like

01:13:46.159 --> 01:13:46.880
jokey

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.960
yeah and it's like dude you suck at this

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:50.080
it's like what yeah you're not even

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:50.400
close

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:52.000
what am i reading here the worst is when

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.280
people suck at it and then just hit you

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:54.640
with a hard ol

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:57.520
oh you ever run into those like being

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.719
mean to people

01:13:58.719 --> 01:14:00.400
off limit i'm kind of good at that i

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.560
think i'm good at being mean to people

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.640
in a friendly way without hitting people

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:05.600
too hard

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:06.719
and then they'll swing back with

01:14:06.719 --> 01:14:08.800
something like actually mean yeah it's

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:10.239
like what the [ __ ] are you doing

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:24.719
little bit

01:23:24.719 --> 01:23:28.320
but he like got out of jail in australia

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:29.760
and went to india and ended up doing

01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:31.040
like working for like indian crime

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:32.560
syndicates and he said he came across a

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:33.840
temple of people who like they weren't

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:34.639

then she wanted to well she wanted yeah

01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:51.520
she wanted to get off of the

01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:53.280
she wanted to get out she wanted yeah

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:55.040
she wanted to get as close to like a

01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:56.880
solid object as possible but i'm like

01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:58.320
dude the waves will

01:37:58.320 --> 01:37:59.520
rip us into that and that'll [ __ ]

01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:01.520
hurt so she's just pure panic modes when

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:03.360
we were jet skiing she was in panic mode

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:05.360
there was times where i felt my arms

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:06.880
turning from she was trying to steer

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.960
from behind with my arms

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:10.239
we're going to die she's trying to

01:38:10.239 --> 01:38:12.000
ratted to you into the rocks

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.119
she's trying to steer you should she's

01:38:15.119 --> 01:38:15.760
like

01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:17.119
just start moving my arms i'm like

01:38:17.119 --> 01:38:18.880
that's what like you can't be in dude i

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:20.239
let her drive for a little bit and she

01:38:20.239 --> 01:38:21.199
did it for two seconds

01:38:21.199 --> 01:38:23.040
like i'm not i'm i'm oh yeah dude we

01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:25.440
were [ __ ] flying dude it was awesome

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:27.520
that is good until we flipped we stopped

01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:28.960
well she was like stop stop stop

01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:31.040
so you thought staying on the boat or on

01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:32.800
the jet ski would have caused it to flip

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:35.119
we were flipping the jet ski was all it

01:38:35.119 --> 01:38:36.800
was tipping tipping tipping going more

01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:38.239
and more and more about the flip that's

01:38:38.239 --> 01:38:39.040
why i bailed

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:42.239
off but you bailed off why would that

01:38:42.239 --> 01:38:42.800
help

01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:44.159
because it's like if i'm watching the

01:38:44.159 --> 01:38:45.520
weight off the top or whatever yeah

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:46.719
because it's like if the thing's tipping

01:38:46.719 --> 01:38:47.600
and then we're

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:49.119

01:38:49.119 --> 01:38:50.960

we're like

01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:55.360
i'm like holy [ __ ] sea lion she turned

01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:56.560
around and we got to turn around and go

01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.840

01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:59.840
we start going up and i just went and

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:00.960
bailed off the thing yeah

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:02.800

it's just in a dude's head all day oh

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:37.840
man it's just like

01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:39.199
i can't believe i'm gonna have to have

01:39:39.199 --> 01:39:42.159
this argument oh dude yeah

01:39:42.159 --> 01:39:42.960
i feel like you should have gotten

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:44.320
credit for the rescue like that's what i

01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:45.280
was like

01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:47.920
three days later uh the let's go left

01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:49.600
i'm gonna take a hard right and flip the

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:50.960
thing

01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:52.639
that's understandably the problem was

01:39:52.639 --> 01:39:54.000
she's like right she was like turn

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.199
around and i would start to turn around

01:39:55.199 --> 01:39:56.639
no no turn left i'm like what the [ __ ]

01:39:56.639 --> 01:39:57.600
is the difference

01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:58.800

01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:00.400

01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:01.119
yourself credit

01:40:07.119 --> 01:40:08.880
because i was going like

01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:09.840

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:12.080

01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:22.719

01:40:22.719 --> 01:40:23.360

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:27.280

01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:27.679
angle

01:40:27.679 --> 01:40:30.400
and we were we were off if we had that

01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:31.440

01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:33.520
face down and like

01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:35.040
