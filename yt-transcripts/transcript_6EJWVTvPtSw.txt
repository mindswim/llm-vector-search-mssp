it's kind of

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:34.640
selfish in my opinion yeah to eat a

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.919
bunch of cheese as a person who doesn't

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:36.240
really

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.120
cheese either and then hop on a flight

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.839
mass actually i will say are they kind

00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:44.640

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.480
not gonna lie damn that's true

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.800
masks and the noise of the plane the the

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.480
plane has become the perfect fart

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.920
sure the noise wasn't and noise on a

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.440
plane wasn't even an issue but i also

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.640

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.240

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.480

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.240
sure i'm like

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:14.959
where are you get the whole look at

00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:16.640
their visa where you going to destroy a

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.080
western democracy you're like yeah here

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.040

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.839
dude

00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:25.680
long story short i eat this i ate the

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.880
whole [ __ ] deep dish i

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.480
ate most of it and i was how big of a

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.160
deep dish are we talking

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.600
i mean it's kind of racist but they only

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.360
do small for gluten freeze

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.800
so it's kind of [ __ ] up

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.200
so they only do like a personal size but

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.720
dude for a deep dish it's actually

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.360
perfect

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.959
yeah like if you eat the whole thing you

00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:45.120

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.000
hot tubs

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.200

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:02.640
slight case of myself

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.760
i'm sorry like two weeks ago and

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.440
i went over to swim at my friend's house

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.279
when his family was on vacation

00:11:09.279 --> 00:11:10.959

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:19.279
leave it i gotta change the filter it's

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:20.079

yeah you can't shut the pool i don't

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:22.480

just leave

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.360

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.360
kids shot the mccusker pool and it was

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:37.920
definitely

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.279
it was like a you have to dump a bunch

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:41.120
of chemicals and [ __ ] neutralize the

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.000
dump so you had

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.240

that was kind of helpful

00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:53.600

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.040
like it was so much dough and it's just

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.399
all just pushing through like that's so

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:58.079
much to absorb and like push through you

00:11:58.079 --> 00:12:00.639

seal dude he's like you don't enter the

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.720
world of like accepting the fact that

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.240
you're going to [ __ ] your pants and deal

bathroom oh you mean at someone

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.839
residential i thought you meant like a

00:13:05.839 --> 00:13:08.320
site in like a city i thought like

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.839
starbucks would be like no you have to

00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:11.440
buy something you got to rush

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.880
no i think there's i think there's an

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.480
addendum in the constitution where like

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.160
you can fully override a store

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.279
and be like you have to be a customer

00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:20.160
just be like giving quarters to soldiers

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.240
it's in there also i learned this the

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.519
reason for that is because they all had

00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:24.880
diseases

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.320
it's not because like every time i

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.480
remember like one of the things was like

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.079
you can't we don't have to give

00:13:30.079 --> 00:13:33.200
quarter to soldiers like it's it's a law

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.320
and so it is a law we have to give

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.959
quarter to soldiers no we don't we don't

00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:39.600
we don't have to but in in those days

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.639
you did like the

00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:42.160
england would be like oh this this army

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.519
is going to live in this [ __ ] town

00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:44.800
true you have to take care of them but

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:45.680
they would all have like

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.320
smallpox and kill the whole town and for

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.440
some reason in my mind i was like people

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.880
were probably like

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.199
annoyed they just had some british dude

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:54.800
on their couch all got sick

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.399
but it was it was actually much more

00:13:56.399 --> 00:13:58.800
serious it was because an army back then

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.079
had

00:14:00.079 --> 00:14:04.000
wild ree had sure anyway sorry also too

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.079
the guy probably [ __ ] your wife dude

00:14:06.079 --> 00:14:08.639
if you put up a soldier he's gonna like

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:09.440
yeah

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.880
he's got weapons and [ __ ] you've never

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.560
even seen red

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.959
on a piece of clothing ever [ __ ] he's

00:14:14.959 --> 00:14:16.639
got a red coat on it's like

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:18.560
[ __ ] i mean def your daughter means not

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.519
even a question your daughter's

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:20.959
definitely going down the question is

00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:22.639
is he gonna take down the misses and

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:24.959
also that it's almost any age daughter

00:14:24.959 --> 00:14:27.279
is fair game back then of course i was

00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:28.800

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.880

gentleman he was a senator

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.000

that down into like exactly what that is

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.279
sex passing yeah it's probably it's just

00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:56.320

absolutely know you're going to get one

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.279
which you can only do if you're married

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:25.839
which

00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:26.959
you can just ask you won't get in

you can when you're married

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.839

like the ada

00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:54.400

a cup there there should be something

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.480
some trough

dude did you see the whole video yeah i

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.080
didn't think he was that [ __ ] crazy

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.440
everyone's trying to say he's like fully

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.320
[ __ ] nuts

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.240
i mean what was what was super crazy

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.760
that you watched the whole thing

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.120
what his takes on abortion free cosby

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.640
i didn't see the free cosby thing he got

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.720
he got into free cosby which rules

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.400

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.159
stance give a million dollars to every

00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:12.799

00:24:23.919 --> 00:24:26.000
he's this out kanye's mind in my opinion

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.360
he'll say him something ridiculous like

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.559
a million dollars

00:24:28.559 --> 00:24:30.320
and then he's like or like 15 grand i

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.840
don't know whatever he's like i'm not

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:32.960
fun in this thing i'm just

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.640
dragging that i'm just putting the idea

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.880
out there buried trump he's good

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.400
i like the fact that he's going out

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.559
there and dude when he they were trying

00:24:40.559 --> 00:24:42.480
to say that the fact he cried makes him

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.000
crazy and it's like dude he was talking

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.159
about that almost being aborted

00:24:46.159 --> 00:24:48.320
that dude that's something yeah the

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.760
thing he was bringing up was basically

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.360
look if you're raped i get it

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.960
like if you're raped i get it we're not

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.640
gonna have it so you're in a back alley

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.919
it's just i think what he's talking

00:24:55.919 --> 00:24:58.000
about is like it's like some sort of

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.440
like [ __ ] rights

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.440
male and female to be out and slutting

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.480
around and being well just get an

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.720
abortion he was like that's [ __ ] up

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.480
i agree with that i think that's shitty

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.919
to do i i mean dude

00:25:07.919 --> 00:25:09.600
it's [ __ ] up yeah it's happened it

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.039
happened yeah yeah yeah yeah what he's

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:13.039
saying is like it's kind of shitty to do

00:25:13.039 --> 00:25:14.960
just to be like i'm inconvenienced by

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.559
i'm out having a good old

00:25:16.559 --> 00:25:18.159
and i'm inconvenienced by this life that

00:25:18.159 --> 00:25:20.559
i created he has a [ __ ] point it's

00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:21.679
kind of shitty you know

00:25:21.679 --> 00:25:23.440
i mean yeah of course anybody that says

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.880
abortion's bad has a point

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.960
but when you're on stage screaming in

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.080
front of like i mean that whole thing

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.200
was nuts

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.120
start to finish nuts i love that i

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.720
enjoyed it i think the person who should

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.320
be getting more grief is the

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.000
woman the white check who came white

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.840
chicken came up and yeah

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.159
she's also obviously nuts he was pretty

00:25:40.159 --> 00:25:41.279
gracious he was like

00:25:41.279 --> 00:25:42.640
he was very gracious he was very

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.760
gracious the whole time he was very

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.039
great he died his hair purple because

00:25:45.039 --> 00:25:46.400
it's the combination of blue and red

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.720
dudes [ __ ] got some ideas honestly

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.640
blue and red was great the purple party

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.080
i was [ __ ] like [ __ ] yeah dude that's

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:52.720
awesome

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.520
all right i'm i if you supported him i

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:55.919
would

00:25:55.919 --> 00:25:57.279
of the three candidates i would probably

00:25:57.279 --> 00:25:59.200
vote for him i swear to god

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.960
that's a good for anybody i really i

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.240
think it'll just be funny to see him

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.320
take a chunk of the election

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.240
and then have people be like trump won

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.600
because of kanye taking democratic votes

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.760
and blaming the election on kanye west

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.120
which could be pretty funny could have

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.240
been the plan this whole time when you

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.360
met with trump bro

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.799
dude they're fighting over the black

00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:19.679
vote like they study it like calculus

00:26:19.679 --> 00:26:20.320
dude

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.240
so right now biden is doing worse than

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.320
the black hillary is you know

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.840
i think i think black people can

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.600
surprise some people i think the whole

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.039
point of the election is to win the

00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:29.919
black vote

00:26:29.919 --> 00:26:31.520
i think so here's here's what i can tell

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.159
you and this is the observation i made

00:26:34.159 --> 00:26:36.559
yesterday yeah when i was touring the

00:26:36.559 --> 00:26:38.799

something's going on really that's the

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.760
strongest shift to black republicanism

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:52.880

thinking about it more and more i didn't

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.039
think about it until right now it's just

00:28:23.039 --> 00:28:23.840
something you notice

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.640
huh yeah it was like it's literally the

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.840
first time i've ever seen it

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.080

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.279

00:28:31.279 --> 00:28:32.960
you walk by it this is like they were

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.240
deep in they were on a tour that's what

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:34.720
i'm saying

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.799
yeah it was three bros on a tour of

00:28:36.799 --> 00:28:37.760
gettysburg yes

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.039
it's [ __ ] sick but mayor how do you

00:28:39.039 --> 00:28:41.600
feel about that

00:28:41.679 --> 00:28:43.840
about black republicans they i don't

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.760
think they were they were not

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.720
black republicans i'm saying just three

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.240
[ __ ] bros

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.799
at gettysburg they love this country

00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:54.159
that's nice to hear the red white and

00:28:54.159 --> 00:28:55.440
blue dude yeah they might not have been

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.720
democrat i'm telling you man i

00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.399
i don't thanks it's good input

00:29:00.399 --> 00:29:03.039
well i do the article i was reading

00:29:03.039 --> 00:29:03.520
about

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.360
so they do pulling things where like

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.039
hillary had in terms of you take the

00:29:07.039 --> 00:29:09.039
black vote hillary had i think like 83

00:29:09.039 --> 00:29:11.919
of it trump had the other 13 so now

00:29:11.919 --> 00:29:12.880
biden has like

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.360
76 of it trump has you know whatever

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.279
that is a little more that

00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:20.399
uh whatever 26 percent and uh whatever

00:29:20.399 --> 00:29:20.880
it is

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.880
so the black votes slowly drifting away

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.480
from the democratic party

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.880
according these figures the latino vote

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.320
forget about it bro

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.640
it's he latinos biden's not doing that

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.880
well again they still have the majority

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.120
but they're saying that like if they

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.880
lose even like

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.399
a couple percentage points of the black

00:29:38.399 --> 00:29:40.159
vote if it's a close race that can be

00:29:40.159 --> 00:29:41.039
they're saying that could be the

00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:43.120
determining factor

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.039
i wonder if it so they're bugging out

00:29:45.039 --> 00:29:46.159
right now about dude

00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:47.840
it's so funny to think about the job of

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.360
a president

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.080
right now is to like get black people to

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:52.640
like them

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.080
just kind of it's like what is this job

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.279
you guys are doing like we're just gonna

00:29:55.279 --> 00:29:56.240
get black people

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:59.120
whoever can trick black people the best

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.960
is the president so that's their there's

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.399
think tank they need to hire [ __ ]

00:30:02.399 --> 00:30:03.200

like oh here comes grandma we better run

00:30:29.919 --> 00:30:31.279

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.559
and this is this is a risky take

00:30:44.559 --> 00:30:47.200
yeah i'm gonna do it a little tight

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:47.840
tightrope

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.159
for the people uh so i got i got a

00:30:50.159 --> 00:30:50.960
little [ __ ] up

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.520
at the grove friday night so you went to

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.240

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.240
my buddy hated it left i had a great

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.919
[ __ ] gettysburg getting the grove

00:30:57.919 --> 00:30:58.320
that's

00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.519
that's the sound that's the combo that's

00:30:59.519 --> 00:31:00.960
a mechanicsburg [ __ ] that's that's

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:01.679
the hat trick

00:31:01.679 --> 00:31:04.240
one did you get out more the grove like

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.519
the first guy from the holocaust you're

00:31:05.519 --> 00:31:06.559
like there's black people like

00:31:06.559 --> 00:31:08.000
gettysburg like get out of here

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.200
yeah well there's also dude there's

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.399
occasionally there's black people with

00:31:12.399 --> 00:31:13.760
the grove too

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.320
yeah which is shocking yeah i mean

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.000
because this is the whitest thing

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.240
you've ever seen you mean you think you

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.679
think you're on your little iceberg dude

00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:22.640
it's melody

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.840
and then there's melatonin i thought

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.840
kyle orson would scare him off

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:33.360
he's like a scarecrow for black people

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.840
uh also kyle larson one dude started he

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.480
won again came back and won

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.000
larson went from nascar to just

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.360
dominating mechanicsburg's dirt track

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.320
just for saying the n word on twitch

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.840
anyway had a couple drinks at the

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.760
at the grove it ruled your friend left

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.039
my favorite part of the day was

00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:53.360
was my my friend's first time he went

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.399
sober though

00:31:54.399 --> 00:31:56.559
so it's tough sober especially horrible

00:31:56.559 --> 00:31:57.760
it's just like it's heats

00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.600
it's just one dude racing at a time for

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.919
the first like two hours that's awesome

00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:03.360
it gets a little [ __ ] boring

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.200
especially there's cautions every lap

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.640
because somebody crashes it's just

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.039
it's just gokart it's going 150 miles

00:32:09.039 --> 00:32:10.000
away you're trying to entertain them

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:10.480
you're like

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.240

00:33:55.279 --> 00:33:56.240
fun but

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.840
after so i'm sitting in my parents

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.000
recliner drunk

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.640
watching tv drunk at like 10. so you're

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.679
home early earlier

00:34:03.679 --> 00:34:06.480
well probably 11. the race ends and uh i

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.639
forgot i kind of forgot about the

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:10.879
the race war that was going on true you

00:34:10.879 --> 00:34:12.800
know what happens when you have a nice

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.919
night you've got a good day in your

00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:15.520
actual life you forget about the race

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.480
warfare yeah the raceway

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.760
by the media and then all of a sudden

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.599
there was i was just watching espn and

00:34:19.599 --> 00:34:21.119
there's just a commercial of like lebron

00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:22.079
dunking

00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:23.440
and like all these nba players and it's

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:26.000
like together we rise this means so much

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.440
more than basketball it's just dudes

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.639
dunking and it's like

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:30.560
[ __ ] racism i was like oh yeah i forgot

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.399
about the uh

00:34:32.399 --> 00:34:33.839
and then i was laughing just knowing

00:34:33.839 --> 00:34:35.520
that knowing that there's going to be

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.119
outdated commercials

00:34:37.119 --> 00:34:40.560
when when this race war kind of ends

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.679
it's funny to call it a race war by the

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:43.839
way that's a joke i know people could be

00:34:43.839 --> 00:34:45.520
posted they do they talk about racial

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.040
intentions in the news all the time like

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.639
they're saying like now

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:50.159
it's not only cobid we have to deal with

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:52.240
but now we're dealing with extra racial

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.760
that's been a thing the news is like oh

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.119
the racial tensions are horrible right

00:34:55.119 --> 00:34:55.919
now

00:34:55.919 --> 00:34:58.160
but i'm saying like how how commercials

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.520
are always like a little late

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.800
yeah but it'd be the same as seeing like

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.960
a nurses or heroes commercial today yeah

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.000
and you're like what

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.920
they're not [ __ ] heroes anymore yeah

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.520
true they're just now it's people

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.960
fighting cops they're the heroes now

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.440
true but it's gonna be funny to see like

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.119
an nhl commercial in like two months

00:35:13.119 --> 00:35:13.920
that's like

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.160
black power that's all they don't see

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.599
the tampa bay lightning

00:35:17.599 --> 00:35:19.839
pepsi pepsi i think pulled the trigger a

00:35:19.839 --> 00:35:22.079
little too early on like the uh

00:35:22.079 --> 00:35:23.680
like the weird well there's like a fun

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.440
protest propaganda propaganda

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.960
commercials that was like them all

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.560

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.079
chill that children yeah yeah yeah three

00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:31.920

00:36:13.839 --> 00:36:14.560
the muslims

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:17.040
the muslims yes but they're rounding up

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.079
it's not all muslims

00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:19.520

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.599
like kind of mandatory or whatever but

00:36:47.599 --> 00:36:49.119
so they'll come snatch your employment

00:36:49.119 --> 00:36:51.599
outreach so it's employment anyway

00:36:51.599 --> 00:36:53.520

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.280
they uh it's employment outreach and

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.560

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:57.920
like don't believe like rumors and stuff

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.040
about the government

like months of forced labor

00:37:15.839 --> 00:37:17.520

uh one guy that ruled was daniel sickle

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.800
yeah he's the man he was a general so

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.839
the north had like a

00:40:35.839 --> 00:40:37.760
long line there was a defensive line

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:38.960
yeah and

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.560
sickles like just ignored everybody and

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.560
just marched straight for some reason

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.480
got all his men [ __ ] murdered is that

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.720
a sickle yeah he got his leg blown off

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.720
and then afterwards was like [ __ ]

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.839
general mead's a [ __ ]

00:40:50.839 --> 00:40:52.960
[ __ ] he's just a [ __ ] but what

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.319
he's most known for he was the guy who

00:40:54.319 --> 00:40:55.280
married a 15 year old

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.960
did he really yeah and then he shot her

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.520
lover in front of the white house just

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.960
murdered him in broad daylight

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.960
how old was her lover uh it was probably

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.240
like his age his

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.480
her lover was francis scott key's son

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.079
what it's a small world

00:41:08.079 --> 00:41:09.599
francis scott key song yeah the guy who

00:41:09.599 --> 00:41:11.440
wrote this star spangled banner yeah he

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.560
[ __ ] a 15-year-old against

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.400
her new song got murdered for it we need

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.200
a new song got gunned down and then

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.400
sickles turned himself in and he was the

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.680
first

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:25.119
uh temporary insanity case ever because

00:41:25.119 --> 00:41:26.800
he was so mad he was so mad when he

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.560
found out that guy was banging his 15

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.359
year old

00:41:29.359 --> 00:41:30.560
he shot him in front of the white house

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.119
was she cheating when he was

00:41:33.119 --> 00:41:35.839
when she was 15 or was this later on it

00:41:35.839 --> 00:41:37.520
was before the civil war which is when

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.640
he married her so probably

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:42.160
she was probably like early teens

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.920
or like late teens that's a big deal

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.200
back then because it's like no one had

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.319
condoms obviously so

00:41:46.319 --> 00:41:49.440
yeah your chances of true getting like

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.359
like you know cuckolded in the classical

00:41:51.359 --> 00:41:52.480

you hitting your sweet little baby up

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.319

not pulling out if you're [ __ ]

00:41:59.839 --> 00:42:01.200

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.480
like yeah deal with it deal with that

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.119

back then

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.079
there was just like there was only four

00:42:24.079 --> 00:42:25.760

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.760

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.200
it was a rifle then he went and turned

like i did that [ __ ] i did that

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.359

00:42:45.359 --> 00:42:47.359
his name is seward

00:42:47.359 --> 00:42:50.480

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:51.680
war was actually

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.599
sickle's lawyer in that case and was the

00:42:53.599 --> 00:42:55.680
guy who came up with temporary insanity

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.000
which is still used today that was the

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.520
guy who first invented it he was just

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.280

you shouldn't do that it's not good dude

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:50.640

is i think that's going to be the cure

00:50:55.359 --> 00:50:57.839
for porn all the amateur porn people are

00:50:57.839 --> 00:50:58.400
shooting

00:50:58.400 --> 00:50:59.839
eventually the kids are going to have to

00:50:59.839 --> 00:51:01.200
reap that you know you're a kid's going

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.559
to be online and it's not going to be

00:51:02.559 --> 00:51:04.000
totally out of the realm of possibility

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:04.559
yeah

00:51:04.559 --> 00:51:05.920
seeing you brought that up to the dog

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:07.119
girl i brought it up she i don't think

00:51:07.119 --> 00:51:08.160
she really want to think about that

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:09.280
right now she's having a good time she's

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.400
young

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.160
yes you should but as i'm thinking it's

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:14.000
like a good time now includes almost a

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.680
public visual record

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:16.559
where it's like you know all your

00:51:16.559 --> 00:51:17.680
thoughts on twitter that's just one

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:19.359
thing but you want to go

00:51:19.359 --> 00:51:20.720
more and more girls are doing this this

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.319
only fan [ __ ] is like this cam grill

00:51:22.319 --> 00:51:23.200
stuff is like

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.520
you know girls i mean economically it's

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:26.640
a pretty good idea you're never going to

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.079
have that amount of like

00:51:28.079 --> 00:51:30.240
you know that business of being a hot

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:31.119
young chick

00:51:31.119 --> 00:51:32.880
you can make they can make so much money

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.200
online but the pay the thing you got to

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.800
pay for is the fact that your kid is

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.400
going to be online jerking off

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.240
and he might unknowingly jerk off to

00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:41.520
your body even if you're wearing like a

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:42.640
mask or something

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:43.920
and then maybe he'll figure it out and

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.079
just be like [ __ ]

00:51:46.079 --> 00:51:47.200
i think that's what i think that's going

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:50.000
to like slow porn down big time

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.400
that seems very unlikely i don't know

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.839
dude it's going to happen more it's

00:51:53.839 --> 00:51:55.119
going to happen more and more and more

00:51:55.119 --> 00:51:56.400
they're going to see

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:57.839
your people you know like your mom your

00:51:57.839 --> 00:51:59.280
aunt or somebody then i guess you just

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:00.720
jerk off to it keep it moving

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.319
that becomes part of the kink i guess

00:52:02.319 --> 00:52:04.319
you're just like [ __ ] dude

00:52:04.319 --> 00:52:08.079

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.920
oh and here comes a child soldier from

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:23.119
the armenian conflict

00:56:23.119 --> 00:56:25.119
and you're just like this could go one

00:56:25.119 --> 00:56:26.640
of two ways so there's they pull

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.119
it always goes the same way if you're

00:56:29.119 --> 00:56:30.720
from one of the stands

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.880
you're gonna you're a [ __ ] true

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.400
if especially if it's a stand that's not

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.040
a country

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:38.319
yeah like a dagger or a kurdistan or

00:56:38.319 --> 00:56:39.359
some made-up stand

00:56:39.359 --> 00:56:41.520
you live in a disputed territory if yes

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:43.520
if you think china owns where i live but

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.280
i'm not every from chechnya everyone

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:47.200
from cheshire or like if you see like

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:49.280
one of those countries like georgia yeah

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:50.400
pick them dude they're coming out and

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:51.760
they're the meanest dudes of all time

00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:52.799
but then they can escape

00:56:52.799 --> 00:56:54.400
like third world poverty by coming and

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:56.079
just beating the [ __ ] out of some

00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:59.520
dude from england yeah and then you hear

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.359
but occasionally you get tricked by it

00:57:01.359 --> 00:57:03.119
sometimes they have like a georgian flag

00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:04.079
or something like that but they were

00:57:04.079 --> 00:57:05.760
raised and born in england

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:06.960
sometimes they can trick you with that

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.079
in the post-fight interview they have

00:57:08.079 --> 00:57:09.280
