00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.200
kid

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.959
yeah i think hanson actually found

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.959
epstein's island i think he found enough

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.640

you know the people can defend the movie

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.000
and say oh well you know it's i think

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.120
the thing is they're like they're

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.360
preaching against pedophilia and it's

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.560
like

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.400
all right like we can all agree that you

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.640
don't do that but like dude to have

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.000
first of all to cast the movie

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.280
everyone's talking about like casting

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.959

did how was an adult do you cast a young

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.759
girl for a sexual role because you have

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.840
to there was a 40 year old man who was

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.120

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.880
literally watched the one

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.199
the first dancing and i was like

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.520
this it was it was genuinely making me

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.120
like i was like this is weird that i'm

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.759
watching this

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.440
i was watching [ __ ] monday night

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.880
football and i was like i'm gonna toss

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.720
this on real quick just sitting on my

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.400
phone and i was like i tried to record

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.199
it to send it to the group chat

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.160
and

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.919
if i i think netflix probably is a thing

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.120
where you're not allowed to record from

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.320
your iphone

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.680
maybe

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.880
maybe

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.960
like screen grab a netflix show i don't

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.000

are you watching this on your phone

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.560

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.160
technology exists

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.000

you know

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.320
but once it didn't record i was like i

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.600
don't need to try to record this and

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.880

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.280
how are you actually going to make this

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.360
we're like we can get some kids we can

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.680
get come on like dude the fact that they

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.360
were on set like no hump hump a little

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.880
heart like there was grown-ups

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.479
instructing her how to like grind the

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:50.960
floor and how to be more so like you're

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.560
telling me that 11 year old was that

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.720
sexual or was that 11 year old trained

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.560
to be that sexual again i haven't

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.759
watched it

00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:59.440
but it's like i'm thinking of checking

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.800
it out but it's like

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.240
as a director when you're trying to like

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.680
think about checking it out when you're

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.759
trying to tweak uh like a person as a

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:06.960
director we're trying to direct it's

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.160
like you have to tell an eleven-year-old

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160
like you gotta like did the

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.599
eleven-year-old come

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:13.440
as sexual as the director needed her or

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.080
was the director like no no like a

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.919
little more sexually like this and like

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:19.840
that it was true i wonder i wonder if

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.440
they sent like army recruiter type

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.160
people to like elementary schools

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.759
and we're like who's the biggest [ __ ]

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:27.440
here

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.880
ma'am you gotta serve your [ __ ] the

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.280
country of france true but yeah like

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.880
there's so many practical concerns of

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.599
like

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:36.560
how did they direct the child how was it

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.479
and it's just kind of like

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:40.479
i don't know man it's kind of weird it

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:42.880
opens up a lot of uh

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.199
weird [ __ ] to like dude everyone [ __ ]

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:46.240
about the movies it's like dude these

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.599
are there's so many parents out there

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:48.639
that are like take my daughter take my

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:50.080
daughter take my oh for sure it's like

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.599
you [ __ ] sicko

00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:53.599
for sure but

00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:56.000
yeah i was i was thinking

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.319
you know also they changed the verbiage

00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:00.000
on the description of the show which is

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.879
funny i noticed that what they they did

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:04.080
the description

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.039
the description of cuties was

00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:08.479
she joins a

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:10.479
twerk team

00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:12.639
and now it's like a free-spirited dance

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:14.560
team

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.479
it's pretty funny yeah they got a little

00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:17.680
people like yo this is a pedophile

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.639
they're like

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:20.160
we gotta get rid of twerking and change

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.280
it to

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.759
free-spirited dance team

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:26.800
but then keep the scenes in yeah man i

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.919
mean i i

00:08:27.919 --> 00:08:30.240
sp word from spud he's like it's soft

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.520
child porn dude

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.599
he's like this if that's the thing too

00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:35.360
if you're a pedo and you're watching

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.479
that

00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:38.800
that's got a rule so as a rule of thumb

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.640
it's like let's not try to get pitots

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.320
pumped

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.919
let's keep the fruit forbidden for the

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:45.920
pitots that way we can roll them up you

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.519
can't just be like they can be no no

00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:48.480
that's

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.320
[ __ ] cuties or they could be like i'm

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.560
working on an art house film like why is

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.000
there like an 11 year old getting [ __ ]

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.920
like no no no no

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.480
there's a film set i swear

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.650
he's not touching

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.760
[Laughter]

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.920
literally during the dancing first off

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.760
it's the first scene the first dance

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.360
scene is probably like it's like a two

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.120
or three minute like

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.360

00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:16.959
uh

00:09:16.959 --> 00:09:18.720

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.040
their ass while they're dancing

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.839

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.200
what yeah nothing well there there's a

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.120
scene where it's [ __ ] weird i think

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.399

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:45.600
step dad gets in trouble wait where is

we'll see i bet they added that to make

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.279
i was pretty i was pretty cavalier about

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:06.320

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.160
probably serious in answering questions

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.519
yeah they want you to put the duct tape

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:15.440

i spent 30 minutes

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.639
deliberating on whether or not to try to

00:14:58.639 --> 00:15:00.320

because

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.800

00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:16.400
yes

people always like veered away from them

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.000

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.920
this is everything it's just incomplete

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:02.400

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:53.119
you know like a horrible horrible

00:49:53.119 --> 00:49:55.599

00:50:07.839 --> 00:50:09.280
same thing like i don't want to yeah

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:10.960
yeah make people feel weird or just be

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:13.280

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:14.800
that yeah it's like you know i i

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:17.040
understand that but then like to have

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:19.200
paul paul rudd not him specifically but

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.000
like

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.760
governor cuomo and being like let's get

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.040
the young people fired up with a

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:25.599
celebrity and talk about billy eilish

00:50:25.599 --> 00:50:27.119
and blah blah blah

00:50:27.119 --> 00:50:29.359
i [ __ ] hate that line of thinking to

00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:31.680
be like look you're a [ __ ] idiot

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:33.520
here are three celebrities being like i

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.839
do it so you should too and just saying

00:50:35.839 --> 00:50:37.839
ironically mentioning science it's like

00:50:37.839 --> 00:50:39.359
dude

00:50:39.359 --> 00:50:41.200
if that people are always they are

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.559
always going to wear masks i was

00:50:42.559 --> 00:50:44.160
thinking about that

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.200
what do you mean people are going to

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.880
keep wearing masks oh dude we're trying

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:49.680
to dude we're trying here on out i used

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:51.599
to always be able to have a good old

00:50:51.599 --> 00:50:53.520
laugh when i'd walk a good laugh look at

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.960
that i'm wearing [ __ ] masks that's so

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:57.359
[ __ ] they wear masks yeah now here i

00:50:57.359 --> 00:50:59.200
am now here i i guess dude is that why

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.640
is that what it's like in china now if

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:02.240
you don't wear a mask like every

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.200

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.890
like 25 years

00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:12.230
[Laughter]

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.280
live over there

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:19.359
[ __ ] paul rudd probably sends you a

00:51:19.359 --> 00:51:21.280
message

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:25.000
[Laughter]

00:51:32.319 --> 00:51:34.720
but yeah dude it's like that must that

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.640
must be what it feels like to get like

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.079
kind of a

00:51:38.079 --> 00:51:39.280
constant

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.280
government propaganda especially if it's

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:43.440
one-sided at least we have like

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.440
two [ __ ] gigantic retards fighting

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:47.119
each other in the political sphere

00:51:47.119 --> 00:51:48.240
china's just

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.720
godzilla

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:55.920
[Laughter]

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.400
china's just one home team dude if you

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.480
like it it must have ruled be like yo

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.720
we're on the same page this rules but

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:04.480
like i mean if you were if you were

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:07.680
chinese and like let's say trump trump

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.920
like if they were that level of fans of

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.319
like hardcore trump fans yeah and then

00:52:12.319 --> 00:52:13.520
it's like yeah he destroyed the other

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.760
political party it's just him now oh

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:17.520
[ __ ] we got the best economy in the

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.920
world [ __ ] everybody owes us money oh

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:21.680
[ __ ] we're expanding like crazy it'd be

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.040
like yeah yo

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.800

definitely some hype piece for sure dude

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.200
those they must be so [ __ ] stoked on

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.800
what's going on yeah if you're getting

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.640
like if you're like number one dude if

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:33.920
you're like super loyal to the party and

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.280
they hook you up

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.760
it's like yeah this rules dude china

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.119
number one dude

00:52:39.119 --> 00:52:40.960
we need to get taiwan

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.400
true

hong kong dude we gotta go get them

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:46.880
i wonder man i i wonder if we'll fall

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:47.680
into it that's what everyone keeps

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:49.920
saying we're going to fall into uh

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:50.880
like a

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.720
socialist type everyone's convinced when

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:54.079
both sides are going to fall into some

00:52:54.079 --> 00:52:56.480
sort of like tyranny situation

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.240
yeah it'll rule either way because

00:52:58.240 --> 00:52:59.680
either way i get to be like a [ __ ]

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.440
renegade in the night and be like carry

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:02.960
the torch paul revere out and be like

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:03.920
stop

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.520
it's also gotta be yeah for sure it's

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.200
also like until we get like beheaded

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.040
early and they erase everything we've

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:11.280
ever made and uh well people yeah people

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:13.040
are super judging that's what happens

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.559
people are super judging about people in

00:53:14.559 --> 00:53:17.200
totalitarian systems it's like dude i

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:19.119
i'm feeling like just like a couple like

00:53:19.119 --> 00:53:20.800
there's a little totalitarian breeze

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.160
blowing around that i feel here and i'm

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:24.160
like i wouldn't [ __ ] i'd be like locked

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.760
in my basement like please don't [ __ ]

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:28.079
with me that's terrifying to go against

00:53:28.079 --> 00:53:29.920
like it's so scary

00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:31.440
yeah dude

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.119
yeah i'm afraid of like youtube taking

00:53:33.119 --> 00:53:35.839
us down yeah think of like them actually

00:53:35.839 --> 00:53:37.760
like coming to your house

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.599
they probably just taking your ship but

00:53:39.599 --> 00:53:41.760
you didn't [ __ ] like literally it's

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:43.359
if you really think about how powerless

00:53:43.359 --> 00:53:44.960
you are i remember they can't take our

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:46.240
argument

00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:48.079
dude keep your one gun they can bomb you

00:53:48.079 --> 00:53:49.200
well

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:50.800
no i will say that

00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:52.559
the guns actually and for a while that's

00:53:52.559 --> 00:53:53.680
how i thought i was like yeah i mean

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:55.359
what's what good is that gun gonna do

00:53:55.359 --> 00:53:56.400
against a tank

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.160
but they're not gonna be

00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.240
i i would be shocked if if the boys dude

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:02.559
if the boys turned on us yeah i well

00:54:02.559 --> 00:54:04.079
that's that's also true

00:54:04.079 --> 00:54:05.520
we always forget too that like you know

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.960
people like oh it's one gun but it's

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.640
like yeah but like dude think about 200

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.000
million people with guns it's like

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.680
that's a [ __ ] problem that's a

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.359
[ __ ] it's like world war z dude

00:54:13.359 --> 00:54:14.640
they don't even have to be accurate

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.079
they're just gonna it's gonna be hordes

00:54:16.079 --> 00:54:17.040
of people

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:18.000
what were the government do you think

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.839
the government would nuke if all i mean

00:54:19.839 --> 00:54:21.119
you know i don't know i'm gonna get my

00:54:21.119 --> 00:54:22.480
house [ __ ] storm but like if

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:25.040
everybody if everybody was just roll up

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:27.040
with guns and be like yo [ __ ] off i

00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:28.000
guess you couldn't do it because it

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.280
would just evolve and it would devolve

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.880
into a war itself all right i get to be

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:32.640
trump now they would all be like i'm

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.160
trump i'm trump

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:35.040
yes

looking at like

00:57:14.799 --> 00:57:16.319

as as a country

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:23.760

fatness is dropping a little what

00:57:27.839 --> 00:57:30.160
i think the last yeah i think i think we

peaked as far as the fatness

00:57:32.559 --> 00:57:35.040
i could be wrong

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:37.280
i don't think kids are as fat these days

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.280
yeah i could see that yeah remember like

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:42.319
you remember seeing drexel's campus yeah

00:57:42.319 --> 00:57:44.160

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:46.640
on campus

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.480

was the most stress i've had in

01:31:38.239 --> 01:31:39.679
a long time that was the most stressful

01:31:39.679 --> 01:31:41.760
experience i've had in a very long time

01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:43.280
backing out straight back out of a

01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:45.360
driveway in this [ __ ] truck both

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.120

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:48.960
like branches oh

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:50.719
and the car in front of me is like

01:31:50.719 --> 01:31:52.239
bumper to bumper

01:31:52.239 --> 01:31:54.480

falling off the road into like a ditch

01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:04.159
so i have to like ramp back up onto the

01:32:04.159 --> 01:32:06.639
driveway and then i have to slam on the

01:32:06.639 --> 01:32:09.040
brakes

01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:12.880

01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:14.239
eventually i was like [ __ ] i'm going

01:32:14.239 --> 01:32:16.159
off-roading and then i almost slammed

01:32:16.159 --> 01:32:17.920
into a post there was like a driveway

01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:20.239

everybody there watched me like like

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:34.719

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:43.280
everybody gazed at the stars and you

01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:45.679

01:32:45.679 --> 01:32:48.560
mortality and how how you know small we

01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:49.760
are in this universe and then everyone

01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:51.199
turned around and watched me back out of

01:32:51.199 --> 01:32:53.360
the driveway i was like

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:56.080
