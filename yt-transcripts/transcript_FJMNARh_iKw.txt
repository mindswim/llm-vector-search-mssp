00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:19.850
narrowed it up what would have happened

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:22.520
she would have been excited to see your

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.100
big dick she would have removed your

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.919
trousers brushed away all that come and

00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:31.130
sat there and looked at an average penis

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:33.440
and in her had been like it's not as big

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.450
as Shane said it was but I'm already

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:41.419
down here hello instead instead we you

00:29:41.419 --> 00:29:43.850
would have had her no you would she

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:45.650
would have been trapped no first of all

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:51.679
chasing with extension what we're an

00:29:51.679 --> 00:29:53.090
extent you know there's a need for an

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:54.890
extension no hang on wear a strap-on

00:29:54.890 --> 00:30:03.530
that's a big date confidence dude if you

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:05.270
in her mindset I would know if I was

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:06.919
going to let's just take her out of the

00:30:06.919 --> 00:30:07.820
equation because I just don't want it

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:11.210
yeah yeah let's say this was a different

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:12.919
female that you had said the exact same

00:30:12.919 --> 00:30:14.960
thing to and I was potentially going to

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:19.840
have sex with oh my god another girl

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:27.080

00:30:31.309 --> 00:30:33.080
the news about your average penis to her

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.000
and thinking about it like in 1940's

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.260
film or it's like I gotta tell you

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:37.790

other chicks

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.970
okay so I'm not trying to it's like a

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:54.259
weird science setup or you like

00:30:54.259 --> 00:30:56.470
digitally create a weird science chick

00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:01.100
no no no no hang on okay so obviously I

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.830
just understand what's going on here but

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:12.470
I must clarify our world and Shane and

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:20.169
this is access to all my text sex life

00:31:20.169 --> 00:31:24.049
why of a great friend know described it

00:31:24.049 --> 00:31:25.580
perfectly he was like you're like a mob

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:35.749
boss he was like he'd called me on the

00:31:35.749 --> 00:31:37.639
phone why you text her like that I was

00:31:37.639 --> 00:31:39.350
like well it was that there's mitigating

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:42.860
she's like yeah because the whole text

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:49.399
they talk dirty again everything she she

00:31:49.399 --> 00:31:51.830
and Steve talk about I hear about it

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:54.080
goes through me so I get like screenshot

00:31:54.080 --> 00:32:01.309
to Steve's [ __ ] like for a reason

00:32:01.309 --> 00:32:03.980
that we cleared the air up about so for

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:04.399
sure

00:32:04.399 --> 00:32:07.129
yeah but she she's fantastic but okay

00:32:07.129 --> 00:32:09.889
she is I think and I think you amazing

00:32:09.889 --> 00:32:12.139
yeah truthfully I think you two together

00:32:12.139 --> 00:32:13.820
is really great for both you don't see

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:14.690
that though because you're putting

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:18.350
pressure on her but what whatever okay

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:21.889
she's lucky to have you literally I told

00:32:21.889 --> 00:32:23.600
her that [ __ ] 10 times I was like you

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.519
[ __ ] lucky to have this guy it's

00:32:25.519 --> 00:32:27.769
better than that trash surrounding these

00:32:27.769 --> 00:32:29.600
[ __ ] girls well I appreciate comes a

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:34.330

established man okay good yeah you're

00:32:37.009 --> 00:32:39.169

00:32:39.169 --> 00:32:41.809
[ __ ] yeah again well thank you very

00:32:41.809 --> 00:32:45.909
much so what happened was she you know

00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:49.519
gave me particular parameters like from

00:32:49.519 --> 00:32:52.279
the start during the interaction so as

00:32:52.279 --> 00:32:54.379
you say she was like to fall in love

00:32:54.379 --> 00:32:57.230
with me yeah just like don't be nice to

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.480
me like you know I'm sure she gets I

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.250
showed you ripped her right as she said

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.730
she did fall

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:05.780
she did fall on the dance floor that

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:12.370
night use your fault oh you were talking

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:14.630
already that's the thing because she

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:16.580
said don't be nice and then like again

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:18.920
understandably from her perspective you

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.560
know she's 23 she's gorgeous she's

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.420
probably gets this constantly so it's

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.610
gonna be exhausting it's usually - nice

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:27.500

those parameters were set that night -

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.620

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.210
every text after that I felt the need to

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:45.890
like throw a pejorative in to be like

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:47.630

I am in a situation where I have access

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:25.740
to date somebody who's a very funny very

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:27.630
nice very attractive person and trying

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:30.600

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.400
funny so you made a good choice and you

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.340
came on this podcast yeah yeah you were

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:41.370
like this will help to call this podcast

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:45.540
is because I owe you like so much

00:46:45.540 --> 00:47:01.170
no you're doing me a favor he's doing

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:02.640
what you do and like a medieval father

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:05.100
figure he's like giving he's like thank

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:06.780
you so much for him she's basically your

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:08.250
daughter Shane has been like a

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:11.010
juggernaut for me plowing through walls

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:12.960
like grabbing me by the stream I just

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.960
want you to plow the walls I'm gonna say

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.400
this is your thing straight through all

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:17.760
this

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.560
be careful fine you can roll your eyes

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:25.200
he rolled his eyes at me what they love

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:36.360
Shane no here's what I'm saying and this

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:38.940
is it fair to say because again I'm more

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:40.830
of I'm like a scientific skeptic when it

00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:42.840
comes to chicks and when you meet a girl

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:45.660
on the second date like I hate to break

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:47.340
it to you all girls are awesome for a

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:48.030
second date

00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:49.770
they're like smoke do they [ __ ] hit

00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:51.660
this but it's a Holograms crazy and then

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:53.340
you you know you're they're [ __ ] like

00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:55.230
they're a hologram like what do you like

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:57.750
I like that then you find out where they

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:59.520
actually lay she might be that might be

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.960
your true authentic self that's my hope

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:01.980
so also

00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:05.850
I remain skeptical like a trick I think

00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:07.830
that's good yeah I'm saying I get

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:09.300
tricked a lot of times okay well

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:10.800
everybody gets tricked the first couple

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.270
dates and then you're tricking them a

00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:13.830
little bit for sure for the most part I

00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:15.390
mean I think the older you get you'd

00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:18.690
stop tricking them that's when you're

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:23.340
young well I was doing that behind your

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.330
back for you

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:28.050
right and I untracked her boy it's not

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:30.000
that gullible Steve I wasn't tricky

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.319
what's also

00:48:32.319 --> 00:48:35.059
don't get mad at me it's all relative to

00:48:35.059 --> 00:48:37.729
the size of their women like they have

00:48:37.729 --> 00:48:39.170
it depends how big their father's penis

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:41.509
was okay that gives them their inbuilt

00:48:41.509 --> 00:48:43.400
mechanism for like appraising penile

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.710
size yes so if you can meet the dad and

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:48.109
I kind of sauce out his breath yeah his

00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.760
bird works

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:51.430
[Laughter]

00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:53.359
seriously I have a thought I had a

00:48:53.359 --> 00:48:55.369
theory that like with women with smaller

00:48:55.369 --> 00:48:58.599
vaginas had dens with smaller penises so

00:48:58.599 --> 00:49:02.180
the shallower it is it's like shallower

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:05.479
yeah like a shallow vagina some have

00:49:05.479 --> 00:49:06.950
some have like shallower than others for

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:09.019
sure yeah some have the old [ __ ]

00:49:09.019 --> 00:49:15.349
Hogwarts hallway dude that's perfect for

00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:18.049
you though what's that

00:49:18.049 --> 00:49:20.180
Hogwarts hallway did you just fly in

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:21.799
there you look like Harry Potter you fly

00:49:21.799 --> 00:49:23.329
right up that hallway with that just

00:49:23.329 --> 00:49:24.619
sitting on a broom

00:49:24.619 --> 00:49:35.239
fueled by oh my god so instead of this

00:49:35.239 --> 00:49:39.410
is a date where you guys over the funny

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:41.539

suit I wear that suit okay so you're

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:39.440
wearing a cool suit yeah and then we

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:40.729
would go you know they had this thing at

00:50:40.729 --> 00:50:41.779
the Kennedy Center at one point it was

00:50:41.779 --> 00:50:43.160
called like summer solstice or whatever

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:45.019
and you they had bars set up

00:50:45.019 --> 00:50:46.069
and then you could go into different

00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:47.089
rooms and there was like different

00:50:47.089 --> 00:50:48.169
performances happening in different

00:50:48.169 --> 00:50:50.839
rooms so you get a little boozy you walk

00:50:50.839 --> 00:50:51.979
around the sequel [ __ ] you're all

00:50:51.979 --> 00:50:52.579
dressed up

00:50:52.579 --> 00:50:54.769
that's like ideal for me because we

00:50:54.769 --> 00:50:56.299
could pop out in the center we can talk

00:50:56.299 --> 00:50:58.099
we can watch some [ __ ] make fun of it

00:50:58.099 --> 00:51:01.249
what did what what's your from I didn't

00:51:01.249 --> 00:51:03.049
say anything I was wiping my nose I was

00:51:03.049 --> 00:51:04.549
just thinking about doing like a pretty

00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:05.719
woman fantasy type thing

00:51:05.719 --> 00:51:07.579
I wasn't drop my girlfriend off with

00:51:07.579 --> 00:51:09.349
like kna never stand out with the

00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:10.609
streetwalkers and come in a limo and

00:51:10.609 --> 00:51:12.229
like rescue her from a life of just

00:51:12.229 --> 00:51:14.959
prostitution yeah let her stay with me

00:51:14.959 --> 00:51:17.209
it'd be a nice little roleplay it's not

00:51:17.209 --> 00:51:18.380
much that's not second date material

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:20.719
that's more it's more like three years

00:51:20.719 --> 00:51:23.630
in keep it spicy in the [ __ ] shared

00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:26.509
house but I think at the end of the day

00:51:26.509 --> 00:51:29.029
like the date is it just depends on you

00:51:29.029 --> 00:51:31.009
know compatibility and you can have fun

00:51:31.009 --> 00:51:33.470
doing anything I think that's so sweet

that's the thing yeah it's tough it's

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:49.390
hard it sucks I hear us blows but you

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:50.140
were a pickup artist

00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:53.830
okay attempted pickup artist because the

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:58.930
the there was that fad in I think was

00:53:58.930 --> 00:54:00.760
like the 2000s where there's a book came

00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:02.800
out called the game yeah people started

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:08.020
getting [ __ ] became but ya know that

00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:09.550
was that was a big deal dude those shows

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:12.160
on vh1 and everything right and they

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.900
were like very specific instructions on

00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:15.010
how to do it and the thing is like at

00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:16.780
the time because I was in my like early

00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:20.350
20's then hmm and I had no ability to

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:21.940
you know talk to women

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:25.000
cuz I was seriously like I had just come

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.400
out I was delayed onset puberty so I had

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:29.500
just like hit I was you know and then

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.270
when you when you have that like long

00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:33.940
delay yeah then you're like you're in

00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:35.560
college suddenly like trying to catch up

00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:37.390
to everybody else who is like solid

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:39.070
years of like knowing how to flirt and

00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:41.740
do all these other things and then I was

00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:43.540
just the way I thought relationships

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:45.570
work was like friends were you just like

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:47.680
friendzone somebody and then you'd like

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.750
tell them outside the coffee shop yeah

00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:52.030
yeah yeah that's that's what I did it

00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:54.700
was a nightmare I was very very just

00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:56.800
it's cringe-worthy to think about the

00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:57.940
things that I did there's a lot of

00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:00.010
people to try now that's fine but guys

00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:04.510
that are friends with chicks I have no

00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:07.420
love for it yeah I have a strong hate

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:11.170
for it yeah really as if I were a girl I

00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:11.710
would hate

00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:14.550
- I mean that you wouldn't hate it yeah

00:55:14.550 --> 00:55:17.650
let me rephrase I would not find that

00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:19.540
type of guy attractive oh they they

00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:22.390
don't but here's some advantage and

00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:25.960
drain this guy attention but uh so then

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:27.700
you became a pickup artist and then of

00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:29.109
course like when I see this book I'm

00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:30.460
just like oh I didn't know there was a

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:33.040
way to do this yeah you found the

00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:36.490
playbook found the instructions right so

00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:39.339
the the the first thing you were told to

00:55:39.339 --> 00:55:41.589
do is you need to dress garishly so you

00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:45.339
had a peacock and my outfit so then I

00:55:45.339 --> 00:55:46.990
like put together a peacock outfit this

00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:49.839

00:55:49.839 --> 00:55:52.510
and you were dressing like a [ __ ] he

00:58:29.090 --> 00:58:33.860
make that purr a red heart so you were

00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:36.050
wearing you were dressed like a [ __ ]

00:58:36.050 --> 00:58:38.270
[ __ ] yeah and then it didn't last

00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:38.770
long

00:58:38.770 --> 00:58:41.240
how'd you feel when you're out like out

00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:43.160

couldn't I couldn't approach any women

00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:47.960

this isn't me yeah what

00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:56.510

00:58:56.510 --> 00:59:00.200
of someone dressed dressed that [ __ ]

00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:04.240
crazy it is taken by themselves like new

00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:08.390
dress like a [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:10.820

no wait it is sad but again this is

00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:17.630
another one of those things where I just

00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:19.610
feel like there are ton of guys that

00:59:19.610 --> 00:59:24.080
like this and it sucks in like I think

00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:27.320
you know the key is really embracing you

00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:28.940
know your own personality and just you

00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:32.770
have to yeah play that well who you are

00:59:32.770 --> 00:59:36.020
right take it or leave it but yeah my

00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:38.870
line was you had to have an intro and

00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:39.530
then

00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:41.690
my line was as khaki a color or fabric

00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:44.000
and then your did you hit it on anyone

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.800
yeah I hit it on a couple who was like

00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:47.150
middle-aged because I was like trying to

00:59:47.150 --> 01:00:08.870
see a [ __ ] and it was like let me just

01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:10.880
metabolize that for a second you just

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.320
approached a couple and you're like I'm

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.180
just gonna try my couple girls or a

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:16.100
couple of married couples oh it was like

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.720
a married College is trying to get the

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.340

[ __ ] husband say they're like I don't

01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:24.230

01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:26.660
the way somebody that sing-songy tone

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:29.590
when somebody's like get away from us

01:00:29.590 --> 01:00:31.970
why your thoughts with a couple though

01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:34.340

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:37.190

dude the one thing you were talking

01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:43.340
about that was making me laugh hardest

01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:45.230
[ __ ] you're talking about a sleep apnea

01:21:45.230 --> 01:21:51.350
mask I sleep under your covers so I just

01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:55.010
tell her that I was like oh the one

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:56.989
thing about because I forget how we got

01:21:56.989 --> 01:21:58.850
onto the subject about you know whatever

01:21:58.850 --> 01:22:01.699
sleeping sleeping over and it was like a

01:22:01.699 --> 01:22:03.290
one thing I had to tell you and what her

01:22:03.290 --> 01:22:09.770
face dropped because it's an STD tell

01:22:09.770 --> 01:22:10.730
you something before we sleep together

01:22:10.730 --> 01:22:13.040
right and once she heard what you're

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:14.449
about to say I'm sure she was like [ __ ]

01:22:14.449 --> 01:22:22.340
I wish it was herpes and at that point

01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:24.590

01:22:35.090 --> 01:22:37.190
exactly you told her you gotta wear the

01:22:37.190 --> 01:22:39.620
apnea mask sure and so but what I was

01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:41.000
telling Matt before you got here was

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.410
like actually the benefit I think I've

01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:43.790
told you this about sleep apnea I'm

01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:45.949
wearing the mask is you can sleep under

01:22:45.949 --> 01:22:48.440
the covers Wow cuz just a tube coming

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:51.670
out you get fresh air that's great yeah

01:22:51.670 --> 01:22:53.570
it's [ __ ] awesome that's what also

01:22:53.570 --> 01:22:55.489
I've actually tried to sleep under my

01:22:55.489 --> 01:22:57.170
covers multiple times I start getting

01:22:57.170 --> 01:23:01.130
depleted own oxygen right yeah that's

01:23:01.130 --> 01:23:03.410
great so you just lay in a room under a

01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:22.040
blanket like that you know if you're a

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:24.050
