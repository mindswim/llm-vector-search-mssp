afterwards and i thanked him for telling

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:07.919
the story because i feel like he's

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.000

straight from the horse's mouth and it's

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.559
a very interesting story if you're into

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.039
comedy if you're into the dynamic in the

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.520

outrage culture and all that um this is

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.600

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.240

those things where they like give uh

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.439

like as a bit the whole group is like

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.600
we'll pick that guy because i beat like

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.320
chappelle and burr like no i wasn't the

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.399

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.560
had a big year for

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.399
a first year in new york for sure yeah

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:05.360
that was your first year in new york

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.640
yeah i just moved here where you come

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.360
from uh philly okay philly moved up from

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.120
philly from the middle of pennsylvania

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.800
to philly than new york i feel like

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.640
that's like a kind of like a progression

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.160
right like the farm system yeah with the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
miners and you got quality bigs philly

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.080
and boston are good

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.480
starter yeah yeah good starters how how

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.239
would you compare new york and la like

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.959
the west coast podcasters and west coast

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.879
podcasters uh i mean they're monster and

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.000
they're in the comedy and all that i

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.120
feel like there's

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.400
not a rivalry but there's two different

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.879
like distinct types yeah i would say the

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.800
major difference is they're all rich

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.440
yeah yep yep you know what i i've always

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.040
said that that happened how were they

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.239
because they weren't they work with each

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.599
other they make they help each other get

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.519
rich yeah here it's like no i need my

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.360
stage time and i'm going to be big

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.280
nobody's big enough to just help

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.599
everybody else out yeah one of them see

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.080
yeah rogan there is big enough yeah he's

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.760
so big he doesn't care who he puts on

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.440
right he he is just and nobody's ever

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.959
going to like challenge him so it's like

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.440
it works so he's you know he's got zero

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.400
ego meanwhile everyone here yeah new

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.560

maybe

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.720

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.840
official for me

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.840
yeah i mean i i can understand there's

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.439
only you know so much time and money to

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.280
go around and you want to be on top but

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.040
yeah everybody's joking

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.000
i would have done the same like there

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.080
were people that you got your dicks

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.519
there were comics that came out and talk

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.120
[ __ ] like right away yeah on on me and i

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.439
was i couldn't be mad i was like i would

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:14.799
have done the same

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.880
i would have done this like

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.720
la podcasters and [ __ ] like new york

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.040
guys knew me but the la people never saw

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.960
me do stand up yeah so they were they

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.639
didn't they didn't know if i was funny

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.080
yeah so like right when all that [ __ ]

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.520
happened like

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.280
some pretty big comics like came out

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.560
right away i'm like well this guy just

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.479
sucks that's the problem

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.479
and yeah because like funny trump's all

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.160
so like if you're making some edgy jokes

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.320
references off color whatever and you're

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.400
known as funny yeah it slides it's okay

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.600
and if it's not you know you can be

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.199
perceived as maybe you're just doing it

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.880
for shock value maybe you really are

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.639
hateful maybe you are whatever it may be

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.479
yeah but to not not to not figure that

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:49.840
out to not get to know that is kind of

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.520
like stupid you know yeah but again i

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.000
would have done it

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.759
i think that's i do we talk about that

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:56.720
with everything we're like i'm not going

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.160
to research an opinion on this i'm going

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.280
to look at this one thing and be like

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.960
[ __ ] it or it's awesome it's one of the

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.639
other right i would have done the same

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.639
were you surprised by

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.600
you know the reaction the fallout the uh

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.880
all of it i am still surprised that like

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.680
it's still like a major

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.280
like it's it's in

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.120
time like it's in like the new york

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.800
times like it was in the new york times

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.960
like last week really still some article

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.280
came out from like apple news last night

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.039
so you quoted that the only time i've

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.199
ever responded was last night at like 1

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:29.039
40 a.m yeah

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.280
you know

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.400
hats off to you for having the control

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.039
dude as soon as i responded i was

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.280
i was just like in my room like oh [ __ ]

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.320
they're going to find other quotes

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.600
immediately

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.520
dude i did that like a couple of weeks

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.720
ago we were like getting in arguing

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.160
about cancel culture also this other

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.479
podcast is the mini hand show and oh

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.199
yeah by the way those guys i do support

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.199
them yeah yeah they they so we feel bad

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.120
that i did this first

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.960
because they were cutting that out yeah

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.800
obviously yeah

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.800
they went to bed so so we got into it

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.120
with them because we were basically like

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.039
that didn't surprise me like you you

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:07.600
were going to you were about to start a

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.560
job at channel 4 nbc network and they

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.600
found some [ __ ] you're saying some

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.520
pretty off-color stuff that i feel like

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.199
that's going to happen 100 out of 100

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:17.520
times yeah yeah and and we are kind of

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.639
of the school of thought especially

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:19.680
we've been doing this a long time so

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.919
like every all the time but you know

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:23.680
we've been making edgy off-color jokes

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.960
and kind of getting in trouble for it

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.960
and it's like you're not cancelled if

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.400
it's

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.680
the whole cancer culture thing spiral

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.800
out of control the other direction in my

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.479
mind so we were kind of saying like it

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:34.400
makes sense that nbc was like

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.000
oh we can't do that maybe there's more

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.360
to the story that i don't know but on

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.560
the surface it looked like they were

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.919
going to hire a guy there's some things

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:43.280
that don't fly for a network channel and

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.960
so those are kind of the consequences

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.080
whereas the manhattan show they will

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.319
champion anybody at all times no matter

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.080
what the fault is so i understand you

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.000
know liking them having your back yeah

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.160
yeah yeah no i i agree like i mean

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.840
that's why i never i never really

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.280
complained like while i was getting

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.960
fired like while i was getting hired i

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.199
was like are you guys [ __ ] sure yeah

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:02.880
like i would never

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.280
i would never even like apply

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.960
i didn't know

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.560
how did that even i did not apply how

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.720
does that work um they saw me at uh jfl

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.360
and comedy central's up next and they

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.680
liked me and uh

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.400
so then they were like they my agents

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.800
at the time were very like tied into snl

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.039
like they had a lot of snl people

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:26.479
on their roster so they were like

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:27.680
friends with everybody there and they

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.680
were like we can get you like do here's

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.560
a writer's packet to fill out for snl if

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.160
you don't know what that is it's like a

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.280
definitely not it's like a job

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.720
application basically for one of these

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.520
shows like they send you a

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.680
stack of papers that's like write like

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.759
five sketches with

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:46.960
the current cast in these sketches so

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.160
like i didn't know i don't know as a

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.000
[ __ ] current cast

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.879
and

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:56.639
and so i just didn't do it i was like

00:07:56.639 --> 00:08:00.160
i'm not to ever get snl i don't want snl

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.160
i don't care about that i got i came

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.520
here to do this that's like the urban

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.879
legend like i didn't write anything on

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:06.319
my college application i just turned it

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.440
into a blank this is what i'm writing

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.039
for real

00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:10.400
yeah and then

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.919
they saw me do stand up a couple of

00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:13.680
times and they were like we just

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.280

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.080
again the whole time i was there i was

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.360

but no the whole time i was going

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.959
through the audition like

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:20.640

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.160
saturday night live right like never in

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.920
my wildest dreams would i have ever

thought like i'll be on saturday night

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:26.320
live

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.440
out of like

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.200
reverence or just like not a very fit

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.440
like is snl still like i can't believe

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.040
i'm gonna be on the snl

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.040
all right for sure

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.760
i can't believe it but also like

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.519
i just knew i wasn't the right i didn't

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:41.120
think i was the right fit for it yeah i

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.680
just i never liked improv people

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.600
it's just like i mean just even in this

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.360
two minute conversation already like it

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.399
didn't seem like a natural fit no but

00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:51.920
they've you know maybe they're trying to

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.760
swing back to when they used to yeah

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.959
they couldn't they could kiss you by the

00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:57.200
way yeah they used to have comics on

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.000
i was thinking that we were kind of

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.360
talking about it beforehand where i was

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.480
almost liking snl to comics now as like

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.399
college for people where it's like the

00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:05.680
really successful people that didn't do

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.920
it yeah it was like i went in for a year

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.720
i think maybe i've worked in the

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.680
writer's room for a year i was like this

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.680
[ __ ] sucks i'm out of here if it and

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.519
like i don't know i have an extensive

00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:15.120
enough about knowledge about that to

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.040
like really say it but in my gut i'm

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.560
like i feel like all like the big comics

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.320
were like ah probably ebbs and flows

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.079
right it's not that they didn't want to

00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:23.920
do that they all definitely would have

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.360
done it but like i was just reading one

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.160
of them

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.200
i think he's in new york or something

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.079
like that and he's like i did it for a

00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:29.920
year and i [ __ ] hated it oh really

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.839
yeah yeah i think he wrote when he was

00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:33.519
like young yeah i think he was very

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:35.200
young yeah and i think the writer's room

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.880
there can be i don't know anything about

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.880
it like i i wasn't there yeah

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.720
i know just about as much as anybody

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.959
yeah uh i think it can be like pretty

00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:44.959
shitty as far as like just a bunch of

00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:47.040
like ivy league kids right and you want

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.800
to talk about your competitors and

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.920
cutthroat and [ __ ] like that they'll

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.440
play step on your [ __ ] mother's neck

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.240
you know

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.079
so uh i mean i think this is like the

00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:55.760
best thing that's ever happened you know

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.279
no

00:10:57.279 --> 00:11:00.160
bruh bro

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.000
no it is funny to have people say that

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.279
yeah like this probably helped you right

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:05.519
i'm like no dude

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:07.120
no

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.560
there is such thing as

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.800
at least it helped you with like having

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.079
friends in new york like people don't

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:13.440
hate you anymore right because you're

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.959
not going to be the successful one oh

00:11:14.959 --> 00:11:16.560
it's like all right everybody loves you

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.600
again you won an award bro come on

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.160
uh no now it's like

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.160
once once you get like a green light

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.720
publicly for people to [ __ ] on you

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.480

00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:42.399
experience

00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:43.920

00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:37.440
[ __ ] on

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.040

that's great see where you got me that's

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.000
crazy that they just like

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.519
you told them you had a podcast like

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:57.040
after they'd hired you yeah i feel like

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.320
that's something that like well they

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.680
don't have problems they don't hire

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.959
comics they hire improv actors

00:15:02.959 --> 00:15:04.320
but even if you're like during a hiring

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.600
process you think they throw you a

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.920
google

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.839
yeah this is their fault

00:15:09.839 --> 00:15:11.760
like their

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.680
i'm sure your podcast comes up right

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.639

you know what i bet it wasn't but they

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.360
were like all right let's do this and

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.639
then they look at like the catalog in

00:15:20.639 --> 00:15:21.760
the library and they're like this is a

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.519
lot i don't know it's probably good yeah

00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:25.920

gonna we only got 24 hours just [ __ ] it

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.360
it's physically impossible so it would

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.040
be good someone someone tweeted that to

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.559
the same prestige yeah but any chance

00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:04.000
you can be in the same conversation as

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.400
like eddie murphy and guys yeah i mean

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.840
there's there's definitely still value

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:08.720
in it that's how it works though it's

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.240
just like [ __ ] talk like i think i talk

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.760
[ __ ] on barstool i went through like a i

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.760
don't like barstool phase so i didn't

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.600
like port noise

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.360
i thought that guy came off like a [ __ ]

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.640
and then

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.039
i watched it

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.880
no no no then i started watching it more

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.799
and understood the bit a little bit more

00:18:24.799 --> 00:18:26.960
yeah

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.480
you're probably more correct in your

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.840
immediate assumption in barcelona sports

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.000
yeah really yeah so it's like an all out

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.720
right charge i've always

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.039
like if the jive was all right yeah when

00:18:37.039 --> 00:18:39.280
we when we started to or he i should say

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.120
started to dutch touch more into the

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.559
politics like

00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:44.720
the union thing and the aoc and donald

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.320
trump jr like he didn't give a [ __ ]

about any of like the yeah

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.840
the practices behind it he just wants

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.360
the attention basically

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.280
but yeah i always said he's like walter

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.880
white and heisenberg like in the

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.880
beginning good intentions and then like

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.080
he went full

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.000
full just like rich [ __ ] now which

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.760

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.960

[Laughter]

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:09.679
no

00:21:09.679 --> 00:21:11.039
the quotes that you responded to

00:21:11.039 --> 00:21:12.720
yesterday kind of filling in the blanks

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.960
like the rest of the quote which was

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.520
what uh that uh you can't be racist

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.039
against asians or something like that no

00:21:19.039 --> 00:21:21.120
i got a fantasy it was from like 2000

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.120
first off it was from like 2015 that

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.880
quote like i was like four years into

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.240
stand-up so

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.159
a lot of bad quotes

00:21:28.159 --> 00:21:30.159
but this was a good one thank god dude

00:21:30.159 --> 00:21:32.559
finally i had a good quote back then

00:21:32.559 --> 00:21:34.559
uh you don't wanna haystack man yeah

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:36.799
that's the one good one uh no we ran

00:21:36.799 --> 00:21:38.480
this show it was a [ __ ] really fun

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.280
show me and my friend matt mccusker

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.320
uh there was like a flat screen behind

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.559
the comic while they were on stage

00:21:46.559 --> 00:21:48.480
and it was a group text of other

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.480
comedians about the comic that was on

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.720
stage and it was an anonymous group text

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.480
so you you could just say the worst [ __ ]

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.320
in the world about whoever was on stage

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.240
and only the audience saw it it was just

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.440
while they were performing while they

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.640
were trying to perform that's an

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.480
unbelievable you put up like gifts and

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.159
memes and all that [ __ ] it was really

00:22:04.159 --> 00:22:05.760
fun but

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.760
because it's anonymous the five comics

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:08.880
that are in the group text are saying

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.799
the worst [ __ ] possible

00:22:10.799 --> 00:22:12.480
like the worst [ __ ] possible yeah now i

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.280
would keep the panel diverse yeah

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.559
equal opportunity

00:22:16.559 --> 00:22:17.840
if a word came up that you weren't

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.039
supposed to say we could all be like it

00:22:19.039 --> 00:22:21.440
was that guy

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.880
but a journalist a journalist came to

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.640
watch the show which was cool

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.440
and

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.320
after the show the quote was like

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.280
because i was just talking about how

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.039
like you could see the audience cringe

00:22:33.039 --> 00:22:34.640
on certain things

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.720
like at the time police brutality was

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.360
like it was like 2015. it was popping it

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.559
was popping off

00:22:40.559 --> 00:22:41.679
it was popping

00:22:41.679 --> 00:22:44.080
and uh so any jokes about that like the

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.679
crowd will get very upset but other than

00:22:45.679 --> 00:22:46.960
that you can make fun of anything and

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.720
then in the in the interview i was like

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.640
and also like with race you can just

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.960
openly make fun of asians and white

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.799
people will laugh

00:22:54.799 --> 00:22:58.080
which is entirely hypocritical

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.000
it's crazy it's crazy i mean you know

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.280
what there's

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.880
a ton of them and they're you know

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.540
stereotypically smart ton of them

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.520
[Laughter]

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.440
tons of asians out there

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.000

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.200

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.440

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.760

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.120
and still not seeing any results because

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.559
i lived in philly that's how that works

00:25:52.559 --> 00:25:54.159
you got to leave the city to get good

00:25:54.159 --> 00:25:55.760
results but i would sit there and then

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.440
see other comics especially like new

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.880
york comics and la comics and i'd be

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.039
like well they're [ __ ] special suck

00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:02.400
the dick

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.400
and then like a week later i'd run into

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.559
them at like a club and be like hi how

00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:09.039
are you i love your [ __ ] such a fake

00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:10.400
[ __ ]

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.950
oh man that was a great special

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:14.000
[Laughter]

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.760
like i talked [ __ ] on hassan minaj for

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.320
like a year really i was furious

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.159
and then now one of my really good

00:26:22.159 --> 00:26:23.360
friends writes for him who's like hey do

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.640
you want to come to a taping and i was

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.640
like i can't i can't really i can't

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.320
that'd be too hard yeah that's true you

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.120
got it [ __ ] moved yeah did you had he

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.880
like ever acknowledged it or no no in

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.240
fact he probably didn't know until right

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.559
now your own personal yeah

00:26:36.559 --> 00:26:38.559
but yeah i'll be honest about it i was i

00:26:38.559 --> 00:26:41.279
was angry about his i don't know

00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:42.799
that's how it went it's also i don't

00:26:42.799 --> 00:26:44.960
even think it's [ __ ] to just it's like

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.679
just

00:26:45.679 --> 00:26:47.440
it's it makes sense to be angry when

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.679
you're not successful and then like when

00:26:49.679 --> 00:26:51.679
you do have success it's just like

00:26:51.679 --> 00:26:52.880
i don't think it's [ __ ] it's more like

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.400
i'm just going to be a normal human now

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.240
yeah but yeah i don't need to it would

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.240
be weird to like show up and see someone

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.679
like me like by the way i [ __ ] hated

00:26:59.679 --> 00:27:01.840
that

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.440
that would be awesome that would be

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.360
awesome if i was showing up right away

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.919
day one in new york [ __ ] you [ __ ] you

00:27:07.919 --> 00:27:09.919
you're cool

00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:13.200
anyway i have 10 minutes

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.720
no but he's right it's like you know of

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.840
course you want to you don't want to be

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.360
hypocritical but you also got i mean

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.720
that's normal you have your opinion you

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.080
don't have to like broadcast it every

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.760
time you see somebody but i yeah but i

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.080
did broadcast it i literally brought you

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.360
absolutely

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.360
i think it's you can literally broadcast

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.720
it you don't have to personally tell it

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.039
yeah this [ __ ] doesn't this is fake

00:27:31.039 --> 00:27:32.799
nobody's here nobody's gonna listen to

00:27:32.799 --> 00:27:35.120
this these aren't even on man true

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:38.240
that's how i always play it nice

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.360
so now uh just back to the to the comedy

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.600
circuit yeah man just no uh

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.919
you know snl type of

00:27:45.919 --> 00:27:49.039
job not right now not right now no and i

00:27:49.039 --> 00:27:50.559
uh my agents

00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:53.279
fired me they dropped really crazy oh

00:27:53.279 --> 00:27:55.360
that's see that's a little ridiculous

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.440
that's where they have they have

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.320
the same clients on like on the show and

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.720
like different clients that were like oh

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.000
you guys represent him we're going to

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.600
leave if you don't drop him [ __ ] like

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.960
that

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.360
okay like i guess i wasn't surprised i

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.279
was like i get it

00:28:11.279 --> 00:28:14.240
they kept jesse smolette

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.159
for real that agency kept just see

00:28:16.159 --> 00:28:18.000
that's where i i would probably i'd

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.760
probably be more of a bitter guy now

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.360
from [ __ ] like that that's but that's

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.600
just what the [ __ ] industry is yeah

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.039
that's what literally everybody tells

00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:26.640
you from day one is like the industry

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.320
sucks yeah and then

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.000
you know you're naive i got there i was

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.080
like no i these my agents are friendly

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.679

would like stand up for you but it's

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.399
like they can't lose their day job over

00:29:16.399 --> 00:29:18.240
there either they can't lose money over

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.320
following me on instagram i understand

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.600
yeah yeah that's the game but you're

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.799
also

00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:24.000
representing you could have just stopped

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.840
liking the pictures

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.080
just leave the following yeah

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.760
just don't double tap [ __ ] but i mean

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.760
she's representing clients that are

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.360
complaining that you're liking my

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.200
instagram that's the type of people that

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.320
are out there

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.320

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.120
well

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.640
i mean

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.559
you have said it wasn't a good thing but

00:29:42.559 --> 00:29:43.600
i do think

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.360
there's some good to be taken from it

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.520
for sure yeah there is definitely some

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.039
run with that right yeah man what like

00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:52.000
let's say uh like oh everything goes

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.520
perfectly for the future what would it

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.000
be like massive stand-up you get a show

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.919
what what what i don't know i don't know

00:29:57.919 --> 00:30:00.640
i didn't i didn't plan snl i just want

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.559
to be i i'm i just want to be a good

00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:05.120
stand-up so like the good the only thing

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:09.360
i'm focused on now is having a good hour

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.720
if i can do that

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.720
and put that up

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.159
and i think someone will buy it i don't

00:30:14.159 --> 00:30:15.440
think it'll have to be independent but

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.120
i'll do it independently if i have to

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.640
you soda and okay since you just take

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.880
over the world it's a good group i mean

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.399
the funniest [ __ ] guys in the world

00:30:22.399 --> 00:30:24.640
like and i mean there's a couple people

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.159
i feel like their

00:30:26.159 --> 00:30:28.159
fame money success or whatever isn't

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:29.600
quite on par with how funny they are

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.360

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.960
crew it's a good crew that's the crew

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.960
