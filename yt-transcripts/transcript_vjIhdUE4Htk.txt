00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:38.700
vacuum because Jesse Smollett is like I

possibilities are he faked it the

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:55.230
possibilities are that somehow it's

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:57.270
insane you know what I mean it's not

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.640

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.920
from each other and like it's just fuel

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.230

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.040
later they take Tucker down and it's

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.810
like it's supposed to create it so that

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:20.490

he did blow up the whole epstein thing

00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:59.770
and see only one they tried not to

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:07.059
prosecute him he got it was a guy who

00:27:07.059 --> 00:27:10.299
was doing what the [ __ ] was denied the

00:27:10.299 --> 00:27:11.770
leaders Express yeah that was that

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:13.990
travel log like new Clintons we're logs

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:15.850
on it Trump apparently was in it too but

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:17.020
you heard what Trump did when he got

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.690
there wait the [ __ ] came out that

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:22.299
Trump went to the island with Jeffrey

00:27:22.299 --> 00:27:24.370
Epstein do some deal obviously great

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:27.400
businessman so he goes there does not

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.530
like what's going on cuz he's pure

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:31.630
Americana any chills with everyone in

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:33.790
the [ __ ] like you mess up the story

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:38.160
[Laughter]

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:45.850
was never on the island he was on a

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:48.040
plane he hitched a ride home on the

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:49.419
plane because his boy was coming back

00:27:49.419 --> 00:27:51.750
and then when they when the

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:53.500
billionaire's came like you let me ride

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.030
in your plane the girl they had like a

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:57.490
dinner or some and so all the elites are

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:59.049
hanging out with each other and Trump

00:27:59.049 --> 00:28:01.540
just he's not one of them and he just

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:03.790
goes back and hits he just chills with

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:06.100
the waitstaff like the guys that made

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:10.270
the food and you just ate with them like

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:16.450
something else but the point of the

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:18.370
story is Trump daddy doesn't [ __ ] with

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:20.290
the elites he chose what the working the

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:23.380
working man right for sure no problems

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:27.490
then he's at more Lago right [ __ ]

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:31.419
Jerry Epstein's being a bad boy

00:28:31.419 --> 00:28:33.700
so he gets back to more lager purely

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.470
overage sniz reason I gotta get out of

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:37.240

00:28:40.779 --> 00:28:42.549
island of young snooze with Trump daddy

00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:48.700
was stuck on the island he would never

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.559
do this so he gets a layover he's in

00:28:50.559 --> 00:28:52.840

00:29:06.129 --> 00:29:09.460

back when he was sweet guys making

00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:29.289
probably crazy most his bet actually is

00:29:29.289 --> 00:29:30.190
just a honeypot

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:32.019
he's like a honeypot for all the five

00:29:32.019 --> 00:29:36.999
eyes intelligence corporations was

00:29:36.999 --> 00:29:40.029
allowed to be there yeah is because all

00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:41.320
those girls were trained to get

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.629
information out all these elites and he

00:29:43.629 --> 00:29:45.460
has the binos with the bodies are buried

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.190
his plea deal is number one a Clinton

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:50.350
Foundation that's that's how he got off

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:53.379
the hook right into though he doesn't

00:29:53.379 --> 00:29:55.419
read that's why he's free dude oh [ __ ]

00:29:55.419 --> 00:29:57.100
the Trump daddy doesn't snitch is that

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.049
what you mean anyway I'm kind of lost on

00:29:59.049 --> 00:30:01.450
this we gotta slow this whole so down

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:02.710
and break it down because I don't know

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:07.059
any of these juicy deets so Epstein

00:30:07.059 --> 00:30:10.299

00:30:10.299 --> 00:30:11.889
references so it's like all right we're

00:30:11.889 --> 00:30:13.840
vouching for this guy and basically in

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.480
so many words it says I think it would

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.340
be a lot easier on everybody if we just

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.840
kind of like give this dude what he

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.669
wants because it'll be embarrassed it

00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:22.840
will be less embarrassing for everybody

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.850
if he doesn't talk what's he want

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:26.889
he wanted to not go to jail for there so

00:30:26.889 --> 00:30:28.210

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:22.570
White House right now there's people

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:24.879
just banging on the drums yeah it's

00:34:24.879 --> 00:34:25.300
crazy

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.980
he has like Beatles mania level haters

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:32.710
yeah he goes everywhere what is it what

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:35.590
it's about you know I mean burn media

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:37.570
dude yeah like if you if you just look

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:40.120
at the facts dude what yeah he might not

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.679
have been the most qualified dude to

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:46.149
handle politics I mean I'm sure there's

00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:47.560
some bills that he saw in their deep

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.080
state and terrible but like the [ __ ] was

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.300
Hillary gonna do to us I think I think

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.710
we're hyper normalization out of the way

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.090
where it's like it doesn't I don't I

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:56.500
think

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.300
I don't know that I'd buy the Trump's

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.250
[ __ ] saving us but I also think like

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:05.230
he I think he's obviously I don't know

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:06.609
because I watch the news is just like a

00:35:06.609 --> 00:35:08.500
complete chaotic scramble I think you're

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.530
being completely propagandized here's

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:13.030
the thing though I don't think it but

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.829
even to be like he's not down with it

00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:16.540
there's no [ __ ] way that dude dude

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:18.430
came up ripping people off

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:22.390
but again yeah do that like that's the

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:24.579
thing that all normal people talk about

00:35:24.579 --> 00:35:27.640
is that is that business so you fail in

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.940
the business of being a giant real

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:33.640
estate construction type by tycoon by

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.470
paying people Wow they all Street I mean

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:36.579
dude how many times I've been screwed

00:35:36.579 --> 00:35:39.130
over is what you do you're a contractor

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:41.079
getting a little bit too big for your

00:35:41.079 --> 00:35:42.369
britches you're working for somebody

00:35:42.369 --> 00:35:44.680
that has way more leverage on you mm-hmm

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:45.880
dude if they don't feel like paying you

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:46.720
they don't feel like paying you that's

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:47.770
true you don't have you can't do

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:49.060
anything about that's true and they're

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:51.520
the they're the alpha dogs it's gonna be

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:54.640
us with the debt with China Oh saves in

00:35:54.640 --> 00:36:00.460
the white paper report but let me know

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.690
about the white papers yeah the white

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:03.550
papers so the guys have predicted 9/11

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:06.280
they said like we're gonna go into like

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.440
this was pre Trump you don't just glide

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:11.109
like skip that they predicted 9/11 yeah

00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:12.819
oh yeah they predicted 9/11 what'd they

00:36:12.819 --> 00:36:14.980
say I can't remember like what they said

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:16.359
but that's like their claim to fame is

00:36:16.359 --> 00:36:18.069
it like they predicted the events of

00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:19.540
9/11 like that there would be a

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:20.920
terrorist attack on the United States or

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.200
whatever and what it would do and then

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.170
the new thing is they said America is

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:27.730
gonna go down like an isolationist

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:28.869
period for ten years

00:36:28.869 --> 00:36:31.000
we're just gonna suck ourselves in and

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.099
be like all right everybody go was kind

00:36:33.099 --> 00:36:34.390
of what Trump's doing because like on

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:35.680
the last podcast you were talking about

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:39.310
the GDP or whatever like well you're not

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:42.160

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.480
everyone yeah for sure

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.849
I'm like if it's on a bar chart it's

00:36:45.849 --> 00:36:47.770
like here's off yeah here's the next

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:49.359
country that's China China has been

00:36:49.359 --> 00:36:51.310
slowly approaching has been approaching

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:54.579
but I watched a time lapse of GDP in the

00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:55.240
United States

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.270
stays at that bar everybody else kind of

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:00.250
Japan and China jump each other Germany

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:02.140
like [ __ ] like that but everybody stays

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:03.970

like two tons of gold to getting 1806

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.970
see tons of gold and lake they thought

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:13.650
this would go on notice so like places

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:15.720
like Artie picked it up and they were

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.610
like China's trying to break away from

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:19.800
the dollar and all the economists are

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.950

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:03.210
dude drill yeah I was just reading yeah

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:06.000
after World War two like we got in a

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.090
world war too late yeah and we ended up

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:10.110
building Europe

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:12.390
yes afterwards think about that kind of

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:13.770
debt like yo you guys are fighting a war

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:15.810
I'm just hanging back like you guys are

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:17.160
fighting I'm hanging back it's costing

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.260
you guys a fortune then at the end I get

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.270
punched I step in and I'm like alright

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:22.530
I'll fix this I'll build you guys

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:23.730
countries back up you guys owe me

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:26.280
forever true that's exponential that's

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.660
like [ __ ] that doesn't even like how'd

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:28.170
they do that

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:32.520
why did we build your a Soviet through

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:35.040
yeah yeah make sense so that's why I

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.900
like Berlin was like there was like an

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.790
arms race of basically like who's doing

00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:40.680
it better MA East Berlin and West Berlin

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.090
so we were putting up like [ __ ]

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:43.890
McDonald's and Coca Cola and all that

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:45.090
[ __ ] I mean not McDonald's at the time

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:46.860
but like [ __ ] like yeah yeah they Soviet

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.900
side nothing just like some that's why

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.310
people were State Building much as they

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:52.460
could

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:57.600
yeah man so what were you saying about

00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.070
the debt though as far as lows yeah we

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.900
bit we just basically go like 1 year

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:03.780
Vietnam oh yeah well the one year the

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:07.050
GDP is it's not that far behind not that

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:09.120
bad yeah and it's actually just all of

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.610
our welfare that we've ever had to put

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:14.190
it in like a to put it in like a context

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:16.680
for you yeah since the 60s all the

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.450
welfare that we ever had after the civil

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:21.120
rights thing is 22 trillion and that's

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.289
our national debt

00:39:22.289 --> 00:39:24.150
since the what since the 60s since the

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:28.229
Civil Rights thing so what so since the

00:39:28.229 --> 00:39:30.779
60s right yeah when they started welfare

00:39:30.779 --> 00:39:34.499
mm-hmm all right now their self welfare

00:39:34.499 --> 00:39:35.669
didn't start in the 60s

00:39:35.669 --> 00:39:37.529
what welfare was before it but the

00:39:37.529 --> 00:39:40.709
expansion of welfare the New Deal was

00:39:40.709 --> 00:39:42.539
when it really that was the beginning of

00:39:42.539 --> 00:39:44.279
it that was like Social Security and

00:39:44.279 --> 00:39:46.349
stuff in the jobs programs I mean dude

00:39:46.349 --> 00:39:52.229
I'm [ __ ] by the way I'll tell you

00:39:52.229 --> 00:39:57.299
what I know but like at lyndon b johnson

00:39:57.299 --> 00:39:59.849
was basically like yo we're gonna give

00:39:59.849 --> 00:40:03.569
all poor people like welfare because it

00:40:03.569 --> 00:40:05.549
was a threat to the well the first the

00:40:05.549 --> 00:40:06.689
first time was like after the Great

00:40:06.689 --> 00:40:07.859
Depression there was that big threat

00:40:07.859 --> 00:40:08.880
where they thought like we're they're

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.929
like alright we got to give people money

00:40:09.929 --> 00:40:13.140
yeah and they got more the civil rights

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:16.019
thing was like a bump up in whatever it

00:40:16.019 --> 00:40:19.380
is since then we that's twenty two

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:22.079
trillion we've given out and that is our

00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:23.789
debt so we're not really in debt because

00:40:23.789 --> 00:40:26.219
we're giving the point of that is we're

00:40:26.219 --> 00:40:28.829
giving that money to us to ourselves

00:40:28.829 --> 00:40:30.599
that's weird because according to all

00:40:30.599 --> 00:40:32.849
those economic theories they were like

00:40:32.849 --> 00:40:34.319
the pump money back to the citizens were

00:40:34.319 --> 00:40:36.449
supposed to like comeback times like 1.5

00:40:36.449 --> 00:40:39.029
not it's like I don't think if you have

00:40:39.029 --> 00:40:40.589
a bureaucracy over your head like the

00:40:40.589 --> 00:40:42.119
work fair you know I mean like your

00:40:42.119 --> 00:40:44.609
social worker yes that's true

00:40:44.609 --> 00:40:48.059
wait that costs a fortune yeah I mean I

00:40:48.059 --> 00:40:49.979
was watching the thing the other day how

00:40:49.979 --> 00:40:52.859
they did how it was just like the yang

00:40:52.859 --> 00:40:54.539
man says if everybody gets a G the

00:40:54.539 --> 00:40:56.359
economy is gonna go it's gonna skyrocket

00:40:56.359 --> 00:40:59.130
well dude so the I was I'm in

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:00.719
researching an economic theory dude I'm

00:41:00.719 --> 00:41:02.339
all about it and they're talking about

00:41:02.339 --> 00:41:03.659
Adam Smith and how like they were like

00:41:03.659 --> 00:41:05.640
all right we needed like the market is

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.409
just a self-correcting engine will be

00:41:07.409 --> 00:41:08.759
fine we just need like enough people

00:41:08.759 --> 00:41:09.959
were like if enough people grow out of

00:41:09.959 --> 00:41:11.789
employment you know it everything will

00:41:11.789 --> 00:41:13.739
level out suddenly dude Keynes came by

00:41:13.739 --> 00:41:14.939
and he's like dude you're a [ __ ] fool

00:41:14.939 --> 00:41:16.769
we got to inject a bunch of money in the

00:41:16.769 --> 00:41:18.029
country and that started to work to it

00:41:18.029 --> 00:41:20.369
was we had like 15 per you'd like it was

00:41:20.369 --> 00:41:22.319
like 13 million people are unemployed at

00:41:22.319 --> 00:41:24.179
one point like I think the 50s or 40s or

00:41:24.179 --> 00:41:25.949
something I think forties wherever so

00:41:25.949 --> 00:41:27.630
there's like 15 million unemployed so

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:28.919
they start pumping money back in and

00:41:28.919 --> 00:41:30.299
then the employee works out like people

00:41:30.299 --> 00:41:31.589
start going back to work and stuff and

00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:33.659
then we hit stagflation and like I think

00:41:33.659 --> 00:41:36.090
the 70s I think or 80s when it was like

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:38.150
high inflation was stagnant like

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:40.260
economic growth and then they like all

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.460
[ __ ] that's not the way to do it ever

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:42.810
since we've had like denier little

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:44.700
neoliberalism where it's like alright we

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:45.810
got to run everything like a business

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:47.130
[ __ ] this [ __ ] but yeah that's what

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:47.940
we've been on cents

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:49.920
yeah dude no time Freeman yeah he was

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.350
into you be uh was he really I mean dude

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:53.430
I was against it at the start because

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:54.870
I'm like weed I've been working so hard

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:55.980
my whole life and now everybody just

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.140
gets a G true that [ __ ] that but I mean

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:03.300
I also get this G so I'm like yeah dude

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:04.860
these guys like think like this is a

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:06.630
good thing like this smart account

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:09.030
economic dudes are like this is how you

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:10.860
do it cuz Freeman was like dead setting

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:15.000
it he was like the og like everybody a G

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.800
it's like giving everybody welfare but

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.840
it's uncontrolled if you build welfare

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.970
programs or it's like you have to have

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:22.740
these rules yeah now you're just

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.030
controlling a population and you get

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:25.380
sanctioned left and right and all that

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:26.970
stuff yeah you don't show up on this day

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:28.380
if you do this if you do that if you

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:29.790
don't it's like this stuff with the kids

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:30.990
and [ __ ] they did we're like kind of

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:32.400
discouraged like dads himself to be

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.230
around I better build that wall if we're

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:36.890
giving them a GD Bannen will add you

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:40.410
know it would be I mean for citizens

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:42.840
obviously I think they're doing a thing

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.460
to where like if you got arrested you

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:46.920
your G goes away you don't get your G

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:50.070
while you're a boy boy take your G

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:52.530
that's when Rogen was like I mean what a

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:54.300
thousand bucks a month really me be that

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:56.430
big of a deal it's like detach from the

00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:58.290
earth did yeah yeah that's a little

00:42:58.290 --> 00:43:00.900
while if you got a G like in like you

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:01.860
were like someone's coming through this

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.560

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.780
it I don't [ __ ] oh wow and you go away

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:07.920
and you don't make any money and you

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.660
just lose your G for like five years

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.840

00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:17.540

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:36.260
yeah if it doesn't that also help the

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:39.680
account like hiring the workers building

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:40.880
a bunch of giant [ __ ]

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.770
helps out economies well that's that's

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:44.600
like the Democratic idea in terms of

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:45.980
like you just put all your people to

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:47.420
work and build some [ __ ] eventually it

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:49.400
pays off in terms of like that [ __ ] when

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.680
they took El Chapo supposedly they took

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.090
our Chiapas money and he's gonna build

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:54.530
the wall with that that's hilarious

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:57.080
oh that's actually pretty [ __ ] funny

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.970
like he had 14 billion in some offshore

00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:02.270
account and really yeah and the try and

00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:04.370
Trump was like I have my hand I have my

00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:07.580
hands on 23 billion is he allowed to use

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:10.690
it he passed that bill whatever you want

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:13.670
sees people's asses and human

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:15.620
trafficking and [ __ ] all drug money goes

00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:05.540
looked at it into it they were like oh

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:07.310
yeah there's bad numbers there are some

00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:08.540

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:09.710
olds and turned them into killers dude

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:12.250
bad hombre

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:15.630
textbook vet over that's a bet

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:17.590
there's a dude in his twenties living in

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:19.060
solitary confinement for the rest of his

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:19.450
life

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:22.360
because when they let him out the cartel

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.640
is immediately try to assassinate him so

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.260
he's in prison he's still alive he

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:33.970
ratted he tattled and they have to keep

00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:35.710
him solitary because people last time

00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:37.330
they let him out someone knifed his neck

00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:40.000

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.290
control of a bunch of just murderers

00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:43.660
well we did it apparently on the Johann

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:45.040
Hari thing they were talking about how

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:48.400
we wanted to fight the cartels so we

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.740
took a bunch of Mexicans and we trained

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:53.730
him like SEAL Team six

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:02.170

00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:03.430
they just like okay thanks for the

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:05.200
weapons and technology we're gonna start

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.820
smuggling we trained an elite force

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:13.090
there they're like see them down they

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:14.350
constantly do this this is what bin

00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:16.810
Laden was given I'm saying exactly and

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:17.860
that you're saying is keep an eye on

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:19.330
they set them up and they're like

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:20.620
they're like all right let's go [ __ ]

00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:22.450
that you manually know do you they could

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:26.950
wipe those guys to keep the drugs coming

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:36.180
in the you know how's that black pill

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:40.330
it's so funny to see straight from the

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:46.150
source where Matt's getting our phone

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:48.090

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:52.770
less than this

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:02.570

young young Pope coming in and being a

00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:38.349
[ __ ] extreme conservative Pope coming

00:54:55.599 --> 00:54:58.599
treated or not rejected for um some

00:54:58.599 --> 00:55:03.730
people did but like especially because I

00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:05.140
don't wanna spoil it too much but the

00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:07.089
young Pope ended up clearly business I

00:55:07.089 --> 00:55:08.290
mean this is a spoiler if you haven't

00:55:08.290 --> 00:55:09.849
seen it yet you know but he was like a

00:55:09.849 --> 00:55:11.859
saint yeah yeah look at the end of it it

00:55:11.859 --> 00:55:15.010
turns out that he was he had God powers

00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:21.460
it was like [ __ ] wasn't a Catholic I

00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:23.230
know but it's like this no of course but

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:25.300
I'm that they can run with this is just

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:26.830
God like yeah this being like the

00:55:26.830 --> 00:55:28.510
Catholic Church has power if you have

00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:32.349
kids if I have kids I think the Catholic

00:55:32.349 --> 00:55:36.220
school I think so unless they're hot if

00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:41.770
I have a young boy now officially

00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:43.060
against child rape they just had a

00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:49.300
song's guys promise we're not gonna do

00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:51.790
it they just had a it's going on right

00:55:51.790 --> 00:56:04.900
now imagine the after party come at my

00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:08.170
church dude yeah this summer it was

00:56:08.170 --> 00:56:09.760
[ __ ] sick I'd say the words and one

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.710
day will be worthy for a boy [ __ ] again

00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:19.000
they will the church won't recover from

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.290
this or something that Matt doesn't

00:56:20.290 --> 00:56:21.910
think the Catholic Church's so I paint

00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:24.070
churches and we painted the Jesuit

00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:25.960
degrees we painted the Jesuit Church in

00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:26.920
Overbrook

00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:28.630
and I was talking to the guys what's

00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:30.160
that Jesuits are the probably the worst

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.440
in terms of world there's five dudes

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:34.420
living together in the rectory

00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:37.040
naca totally not gay

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:41.210
doing gay stuff and I asked the one dude

00:56:41.210 --> 00:56:43.610
I be gay right I'd be wrestling I'm just

00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:47.960
grabbing the other guys right away and

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.550
then after a while living together a

00:56:49.550 --> 00:57:13.640
joke stop and then you start kissing I

00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:16.430
was I was like yo Obama had just been

00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:17.780
elected and I was like yo you guys

00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:19.220
nervous like this is gonna mess your

00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:20.420
whole thing up like the pro-choice

00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:23.030
pro-life thing and he was like oh no

00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:25.250
he's like the church thinks in hundreds

00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:27.710
of years not like regular people like

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:30.200
this'll all blow over and like they've

00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:32.360
survived way weirder things in a like a

00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:33.980
child rape do you think at one point the

00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:35.240
church has been something like totally

00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:36.620
different they just erased all the

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:38.030
[ __ ] text books and come back right

00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:39.410
now we're always about that now we're

00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:45.410
getting in mud floods do what you just

00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:48.470
said yeah for sure yeah they just do it

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:50.440
I don't think it's as discrete I

00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:52.640
thinking of hundreds of years they just

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.050
changed the narrative so I think they

00:57:54.050 --> 00:58:00.050
teach school maps all changed once the

00:58:00.050 --> 00:58:01.700
Rockefellers bought Encyclopedia

00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:06.530
Britannica there's a reset in

00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:09.640
civilization in 1800s would supposedly

00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:12.410
1864 across the world across the world

00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:15.110
free black what have you ever heard of

00:58:15.110 --> 00:58:20.120
tartarean Rahzel oh my god yeah

00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:26.450
everybody knows I don't think they

00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:28.310
mudfoot I think like what's a mud foot I

00:58:28.310 --> 00:58:29.780
just think that the people that the

00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:31.490
powers-that-be run with narratives that

00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:33.200
benefit them like the Spanish

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:34.220
Inquisition what was that all about

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:36.080
maybe they were finding people that knew

00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.280
the truth and killing them

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:39.110
what was the Spanish Inquisition I have

00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:42.320
no idea I'm not historian I still don't

00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:46.550
really know it was like everybody else

00:58:46.550 --> 00:58:49.500
yeah I think it was well 1300s

00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:52.440
they were yeah this [ __ ] grabbing it

00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.270
but they were just like the church doing

00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:55.500
that yeah the church was going around

00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:58.140
and being like are you [ __ ] pure are

00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:00.750
you a pagan they're like yeah they

00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:04.140
basically be able to execute like any

00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:06.180
political they'd be able to kill anyone

00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:07.650
they want it yeah it's like if you were

00:59:07.650 --> 00:59:09.960
if you were a political opponent or anti

00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:11.850
Church or ant lucky whatever totally get

00:59:11.850 --> 00:59:13.620
away with it back then like hundreds or

00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:15.900
they could be like what I'm trying to

00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:18.030
say is not even back then they can still

00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:20.910
do this okay that's what changes yeah

00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:23.220
that's a shame saying like they'll think

00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:24.720
they think in hundreds of years dude

00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:27.380
it's like it's it's hard to fathom bro

00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:30.540
you can they can survive though they

00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:35.190
will survive this like what happened and

00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:36.780
they'll be like this is what happened so

00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:38.610
it's like oh yeah there was the Dark Age

00:59:38.610 --> 00:59:40.050
you think they're [ __ ] like editing

00:59:40.050 --> 00:59:41.490
textbooks real heavily like that

00:59:41.490 --> 00:59:51.200
well like there wasn't wasn't that bad

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:54.090
that's why Dan Cartman's thing is so

00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:56.070
popular because it's like he digs into

00:59:56.070 --> 00:59:58.020
like other people's histories other

00:59:58.020 --> 00:59:59.730
countries and like you're growing up I'm

00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:01.440
growing up learning about like the Lenni

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:05.250
Lenape I'm like oh cool I like draw a

01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:06.870
cornucopia if you asked me in fifth

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:08.100
grade I was like yeah we get the Indians

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:09.390
gave us fruit we all kind that's

01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:11.640
programming yeah you know in that

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.840
comment we went to Catholic school that

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:21.390
comes from the top yeah that's right

01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:22.920
thing I think is like the Inquisition

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:26.400
all that's Matt Matt's opinion was like

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.140
people are becoming more atheist and

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:30.300
like science is taking over religion but

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:32.490
yeah for sure I think there's been

01:00:32.490 --> 01:00:33.840
periods where the world was

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.550
significantly less religious so sure

01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:37.170
dude and it's just still the Catholic

01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:38.970
Church is still just been like all right

01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:41.850
yeah but I was all I was talking I do

01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:44.220
understand were society the Bible

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:46.830
Society it's not technically affiliated

01:00:46.830 --> 01:00:47.850
with the Catholic Church they're like a

01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:51.480
non looking nonprofit that just dude

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.620
it's the weirdest company they're just

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:54.900
kind of like we print the Bible and like

01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:56.250
old ladies just give us money because

01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:58.380
like we're all about the Bible yeah and

01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:00.300
my sarah base is being like he wrote it

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.490
pretty hard because it's just all old

01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:03.480
ladies and like no

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:04.980
young person's giving five bucks a month

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:06.990
for the Bible's true but and then

01:01:06.990 --> 01:01:08.640
there's a lot of money there's a lot of

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.890
like offshoots of Christianity that

01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:16.320
haven't survived all these like councils

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:18.869
of change that's the stuff they have to

01:01:18.869 --> 01:01:20.940
tell you about yeah when their plans

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:22.140
don't work they probably have to have a

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:23.550
council or sometimes do you think

01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:25.590
they're too big to fail I saw a list of

01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:27.270
the people that owned the most land and

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:31.920
the Queen owns like a ton but third damn

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.869
yeah and nothing's gonna touch the Pope

01:01:33.869 --> 01:01:36.450
dude [ __ ] the Vatican was one of the

01:01:36.450 --> 01:01:38.190
first countries are you doing you're

01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:40.170
talking about nations yeah that thing

01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:43.200
had walls like wait yeah yeah that was a

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.420
good Trump response what when the Pope

01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:47.460
was like we shouldn't build walls we

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:48.600
should build bridges and the Pope was

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:51.780
like are you all bro yeah the Vatican

01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:53.400

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.590
[ __ ] Pope then cuz so he is a freedom

01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:42.490
Rothschilds or someone like that did the

01:14:42.490 --> 01:14:44.350
maps and all that [ __ ] either that's

01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:46.870
real or that's propaganda from another

01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:50.530
source dude what they did I can't

01:14:50.530 --> 01:14:51.850
believe anything maybe that's what I'm

01:14:51.850 --> 01:14:53.770
saying that's what I'm saying here's the

01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:56.560
car yo dude the whole thing the world is

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.990
going up but also when I get back to the

01:14:58.990 --> 01:15:01.060
news thing how it's like two sides yeah

01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:03.220
I really don't think it's a conspiracy I

01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:04.300
think it's more just

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:08.380
ratings grabs and they're just people

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:10.120
like I don't think it's like a gin

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.880
Mockingbird ever heard of it come on man

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.620
yeah it's like I mean there's stuff

01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:17.850
there like that but like I don't know

01:15:17.850 --> 01:15:19.840
independent journalists running around

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.880
it's the whole point of it's not to like

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:24.160
I think the idea is that people think

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:25.120
they look controlling the narrative

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.040
they're just like thrown in there like

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.750
they are distorting it I think they're

01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:30.220
controlling and distorting the narrative

01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:32.650
but not some sinister purpose it's just

01:15:32.650 --> 01:15:35.560
to make money well if you're Jeff Bezos

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.300
and like Indian with him after he got

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:38.710
caught cheating he like the Washington

01:15:38.710 --> 01:15:40.690
Post ran like three pieces of like what

01:15:40.690 --> 01:15:42.340
did what was Trump's role and Jeff Bezos

01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:44.050
is that literally there's a story yes

01:15:44.050 --> 01:15:46.270
and it's like that's it's propaganda I

01:15:46.270 --> 01:15:47.590
think that's a guy who wants a jury but

01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:49.270
it's fully put a slant on it yes but

01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:51.190
again if it's at all no there's nothing

01:15:51.190 --> 01:15:52.180
coopted

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:53.740
population control I think it's just a

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:54.940
guy that's like oh [ __ ] I got caught

01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:56.350
cheating I better blame this on someone

01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:59.160
oh I control the news toss this [ __ ] up

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:03.790
control their media yeah we do that yeah

01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:06.700
of course the same way so it's like they

01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:08.410
have to keep you thinking that things

01:16:08.410 --> 01:16:10.360
are free like that you're a free person

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:13.150
you have freedom but you don't yeah you

01:16:13.150 --> 01:16:13.720
know what I mean

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:16.030
and like you gotta eat you can't have

01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:17.290
everybody team up against the government

01:16:17.290 --> 01:16:19.020
so they have to keep everyone

01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:21.400
that's the American classic divided [ __ ]

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.750
the Russians used to have make

01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:25.389
propaganda about black dudes to show

01:16:25.389 --> 01:16:27.520
Russians really it would be like look at

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:28.389
what they're doing in the blacks in

01:16:28.389 --> 01:16:30.489
America so late yeah like they they were

01:16:30.489 --> 01:16:31.330
big into this

01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:32.980
did you like look how these guys are

01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:34.239
[ __ ] they just want everyone

01:16:34.239 --> 01:16:36.850
split up all the time that's their deal

01:16:36.850 --> 01:16:38.350
that's the government's deal that's if

01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:39.850
you're the King you're like dude you're

01:16:39.850 --> 01:16:41.500
a peasants fighting with each other true

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:42.790
that's all it is I don't think it's

01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:44.889
anything more than yeah it's just sort

01:16:44.889 --> 01:16:46.360
of like they pay the guys are the big

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:49.060
bucks are like yeah that'll be good you

01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:51.219
know I mean that's all I think yeah I

01:16:51.219 --> 01:16:53.500
just I also think it's just like keeping

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.630
them keeping the population split up is

01:16:55.630 --> 01:16:58.120
kind of just like you get more money if

01:16:58.120 --> 01:16:59.080
they're divided and they're fighting

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.179
each other oh yeah and like I don't

01:17:01.179 --> 01:17:04.120
think the news in America or in anywhere

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.050
really I mean obviously there's

01:17:05.050 --> 01:17:08.860
government controlled media which ours a

01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:12.340
lot of times think like look at all

01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:13.960
those crazy countries and be like thank

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:16.030
god that's not us and it's like that's

01:17:16.030 --> 01:17:17.679
what I'm trying to say yeah I mean dude

01:17:17.679 --> 01:17:19.480
think about what our news would be like

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:22.239
if there was no internet like if you

01:17:22.239 --> 01:17:23.830
didn't if you had no other source of

01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:25.420
getting information just that was it

01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:26.710
like in Palestine they have four

01:17:26.710 --> 01:17:28.090
channels that the Israelis give them

01:17:28.090 --> 01:17:33.120
that's it and those guys had those guys

01:17:36.330 --> 01:17:38.830
internet the Palestinians they probably

01:17:38.830 --> 01:17:45.909
went nuts wait a second people didn't

01:17:45.909 --> 01:17:52.679
like the Jews before us not being liked

01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:56.230
this is disgusting dude the dog was

01:17:56.230 --> 01:17:58.179

01:17:58.179 --> 01:18:04.780

check out the movie hoax from like Serna

vicious Billy told me all that then good

01:18:16.810 --> 01:18:19.239
second why that's why you know it's a

01:18:19.239 --> 01:18:22.360
good episode I to density to think about

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:25.960
how like so now it's I would say the

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:27.850
overwhelming consensus in popular

01:18:27.850 --> 01:18:29.560
culture is if you like start like even

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:31.179
trying to guess around like yeah you

01:18:31.179 --> 01:18:32.510

like girls want to distance themselves

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:43.539
from that for the most part really not

people I just heard about it here's the

01:50:40.290 --> 01:50:42.719

suffering from depression killed him so

01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:46.060
I thought about this like it's a

01:50:46.060 --> 01:50:48.700
[Laughter]

01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:51.410
no dude I thought about it and it's like

01:50:51.410 --> 01:50:54.290
there are there is the still the society

01:50:54.290 --> 01:50:56.450
role of a comedian just a man who's out

01:50:56.450 --> 01:50:58.190
in the world and is literally comedian

01:50:58.190 --> 01:51:00.320
but it's also been the the Ventura being

01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:02.480
comedians been commercialized so sure

01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:05.210

both of we both are but it's like now

01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:12.590
it's like there's a whole other thing in

01:51:12.590 --> 01:51:13.970
comedy that's been like industrialized

01:51:13.970 --> 01:51:15.980
and it's like comedy doesn't go to the

01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:17.270
depths of the depths anymore

01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:21.200
why no just cuz the mone well why

01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:23.420
