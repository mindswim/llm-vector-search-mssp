i didn't have it back then

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.960

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:02.400
um

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.319
and we just you know we figured we would

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:05.440
make our own

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.160
our own thing you know not enough hold

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160
on i'm sorry my housekeeping's walking

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.720
one second

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.560
okay great

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.080
is that that nude housekeeping service

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.599
you were talking about last time yeah i

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:20.560
was gonna give it a shot

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.520
now uh

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.440
yeah i gotta check out this hotel but

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.280
yeah john and i

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.720
enough people they keep you know it's

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.560
tough it's tough in this thing so we

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.680
were like we're gonna we're gonna just

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.520
try to make it ourselves

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.840
and uh invest our own money

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.800
and uh just make it for free and

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.240
you know hopefully get enough traction

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.080
that we can keep doing this yeah you

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.680
think maybe uh hoping to get picked up

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.560
on uh

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.560
i don't know netflix uh comedy central

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.000
something yeah i mean that would be

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.919
great i think

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:52.000
i think it's i mean and we talked to

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.240
andrew schultz so schultz helped us out

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.720
a lot with this he he was the one who he

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.400
was like

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.479
he helped push us to do this and he's

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:01.840
created a model i don't know if you guys

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.080
are familiar with his

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.280
story

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.120
he kind of got told no

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.199
by the industry time and time again and

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:11.120
then he just sat down and made his own

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.360
thing and he kept making it and putting

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.759
it for free on youtube and instagram

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:18.160
and then by after one year of doing it

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.560
netflix gave him a deal amazon gave a

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.479
deal for his special

00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:24.160
so it's just kind of a you don't have to

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.720
go through the industry type mentality

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.479
the internet kind of

00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:30.560
equalizes everything with that

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.279
yeah no so the next one you did then i

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:35.760
think was uh uncle daycare

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.080
yeah yeah it's really good and all these

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.599
uncles they're looking you know they

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:41.519
have no place to go so they you know

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:42.719
this daycare shut down because they

00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:44.560
weren't doing anything with kids so they

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.279
invited these uncles hey uncle hank good

00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:49.360

like a monkey knuckle all right when

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:52.959
most people have an uncle they never

00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:54.399
think they'll spend all day with them

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:56.240
