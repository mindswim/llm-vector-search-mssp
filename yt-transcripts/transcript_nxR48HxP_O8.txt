WEBVTT

00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.360
been told now and saying like oh we

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.439
should get that going sometime but like

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:05.279
having having someone just say it out

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.799
loud was like yeah why shouldn't we do

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:07.759
that

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:09.840
and then behold it's been the most

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.120
fulfilling year of my life

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.519
so thank you yeah i'm on a big

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.040
potentiality kick right now

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.240
when like you know there's a person

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.440
there's like the stuff they have

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.720
currently going on but then there's

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.520
always

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.039
a bunch of stuff they could be doing and

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.480
it's like it's pretty crazy to think of

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.680
all the stuff you

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.680
haven't done just because of you know x

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.439
y and z typically usually it's like well

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:28.400
i don't want to get someone to like

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.240
break my balls or i don't want to suck

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.960
you know or this or that but it's like

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.160
you know it sucks because there you

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.280
could be doing a million different

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.399
things

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.399
dude the training wheels came off i

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.920
would say maybe about

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.360
by about three months in actually i

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.960
think it was the meeting at your house

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.719
wets which really

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.520
sent things in a whole [ __ ] you know

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.000
just

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.360
just pedal to the mellow just really

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.800
send us in a direction that we couldn't

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.920
come back from

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.280
and at that point it was just like [ __ ]

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.719
it well i'm just going to do everything

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.399
i want to do

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.879
and hell yeah man it's just itemizing

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.239
itemizing everything

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.559
and then having to to rethink everything

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.720
on the fly considering the restrictions

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.240
um which is one of the first things i

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.439
wanted to talk about with you guys i

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.479
wanted to ask you

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.520
how have your goals changed um

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.799
since the year has progressed

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.080
yeah matt before matt answers i want to

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.960
rudely uh

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.080
interrupt because i do feel like um

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.640
an enormous thank you i mean you guys

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.000
are lumping me in the in the category

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.680
with matt but i i don't deserve that

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.360
spot um i think

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.119
i'm just guessing that all three of us

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.880
the only reason that we're even on this

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.520
thing

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.439
and doing the things that we're doing is

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:36.960
solely because of matt

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.360
um so that's cool so thank you brother

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.640
yeah that rules

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.000
appreciate that guys yeah i don't know

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
you know i'm fluffy yeah yeah

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.799
he's going to say no no whatever yeah

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.399
yeah i'm not here to [ __ ]

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.119
meet yesterday every once in a while

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.240
dude

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.600
just take a look down and give give

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.439
yourself one i would say

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.280
i'm not being 100 serious right now at

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.119
least once every fortnight

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.640
you should make an earnest attempt to

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.799
suck your own meat true

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.960
just one pump you might never get there

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.079
but i mean like just get like

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.879
tear something tear something in your

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.400
abdomen trying to suck your own meat

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.599
fortnightly

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.520
true and just watch how it changes your

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.440
perspective

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.599
year two is all about if you're not

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.040
trying to suck your own meat

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.280
and failing you're off the wagon dude

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.319
you're off the trail

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.920
see you later i don't know if you guys

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.680
know this but at urgent care they will

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.720
remove up to two ribs

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.800
it's elective so your insurance might

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.239
not cover it but

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.920
i might just give myself a quick pump

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.080
just [ __ ]

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.000
uh someone's about to see this two pump

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.670
chubs

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.680
[Laughter]

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.120
yeah man dude i'm telling you dude it's

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.720
uh i mean it's funny because it sounds

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.360
like we're going

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.680
kind of round robin but it's like i was

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.000
more or less kind of just kicking around

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.080
uh space cowboy style and then like you

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.080
know wes same thing when he gave me the

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.760
like you know here's how i set goals

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.159
here's how i imagine and like a year

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.159
coming up in all these different domains

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.360
i did that and like dude

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.400
i say it all the time i'm like the the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.760
level of effect that had

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.560
for just like something like a million

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.920
crack brain schemes that just kind of

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.640
fall apart

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.239
no here's an actual thing that i've

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.599
shaped and i'm going to try to make that

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:16.720
happen it's like

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.239
dude it's simplified so many things in

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.920
my life it's unbelievable

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.959
yeah yeah well uh a quick recap if

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.640
i could imagine this not making sense to

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.000
one or two people listening

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.560
uh of the four or five people listening

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.799
uh

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.280
our magnum opus a four-hour episode

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.799
called the program

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.280
uh featured matt and uh wes it was

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.920
originally

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.080
only on our patreon which is uh

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.599
accessible for as little as a dollar a

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:42.480
month

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.319
and then we later on made it free and

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.319
it's four hours long and it might seem

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.319
i mean just looking at the run time it

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.920
might seem like a lot to get into but

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.640
recording it flew by it was the

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.360
breeziest conversation of my entire life

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.239
um and i say that as a cripplingly

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:58.959
autistic

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.200
you know uh semi incel and uh

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.879
the the whole the whole crux of it was

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.720
you know the the whole point behind all

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.920
of this is that

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.959
you know the fact that i am a

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.720
and i speak for all of us when i say i

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.440
am a fat gay [ __ ] that is no excuse

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.280
for just you know uh running in place

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.880
and treading water in life

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.919
and uh you know obviously

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.840
we we [ __ ] around more often than not

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.759
but uh

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.400
that there is there is a point to

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.520
everything i do now

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.360
and uh i don't feel like i'm wasting

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.960
time anymore so

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.840
um yeah it was just it was just it feels

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.400
great

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.000
to be here uh on the cusp of a new

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.720
year of doing this and uh to have you

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.360
guys back

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.639
um and and just to i i was very

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:49.840
interested in talking to you guys and

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.720
seeing how

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.199
so we we set up this entire process of

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.199
uh creating goals almost like

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.919
purposely finding something unimaginable

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:58.479
to us

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.120
that we that we want for ourselves or or

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.919
just like

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.639
breaking out of the the monotony of um

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:05.280
you know

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.479
a typical career path or you know

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.160
your raised schedule and just deciding

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.280
what you want

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.199
and i you know as [ __ ] gay as it all

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.880
sounds i'm very sorry but

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.960
the point is that we did it all and it

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.520
had a huge impact on me and i've just

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.880
i was i've been dying to talk to you

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.120
guys about how uh

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.600
2020 shaped up for the general public

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.039
and and what that did

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.720
to um the goals that you set and uh just

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.720
your your general process for um

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.440
making um progress for yourself

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.560
oh yeah well i'm going to to

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.720
uh consistently throughout this episode

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.720
um bow down to matt so

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.120
i think he should always go before me

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.639
and then i'll follow up

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.560
well no that's ridiculous because again

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.800
i it was really your

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.360
kind of framework that i adopted but the

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.720
i mean i i will say i

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.639
you know i i hate that because now i'm

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.000
like i like all right i'll jump in but

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.759
now i'm like yeah bow down so

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:07.280
i'll be struggling with that

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.479
yeah well this is the um so when i when

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.479
i first did that you know kind of like

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.479
envisioning you know what's the next

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:15.520
year going to bring and all these

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.880
different domains that you know you do

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.560
care about but you don't consciously

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.120
evaluate really ever you're like yeah

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.800
family is cool sounds good and it's like

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.160
what do you do for them

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.080
oh wait till they call me for somebody's

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.520
birthday and we like all stand there and

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.960
like ask each other about work and then

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.360
eat

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.960
a lot of sugar and go home you know it's

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.720
like so like trying to like bring more

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.960
of like a conscious uh

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.720
awareness to all these different domains

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.759
anything like some of the domains you

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:38.240
can go

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.520
you know like man i don't really care

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.720
about that one that much you know i'm

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.919
not gonna be like forced to or like

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:42.960
participate in it

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.680
but that's the thing i've been doing for

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.039
the thing i've been researching a lot

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:48.800
right now is how to kind of

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.360
not just shape goals that are like uh

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.120
societally programmed goals like you

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.400
know like when i was in college i was

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.520
like i need to make a hundred thousand

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.960
dollars a year just a number i heard i

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.039
was like that'll solve all my problems

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:01.759
and uh you know and i just i had jobs

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:03.120
and i started making money and i was

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.840
like

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.520
i don't know why i don't really care you

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.120
know this is cool i mean i wasn't making

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.560
a hundred thousand dollars but

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.400
i was just like what the hell like this

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.000
i don't i don't care about this i i got

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.360
tricked into caring about this you know

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.400
i don't know how

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.319
and so what i've been doing is trying to

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:18.479
do like deep kind of values work and

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:19.680
like look into the things that

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.240
what do i actually 100 value and then

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.599
how can you turn those into like

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:26.720
actionable doable items and uh dude

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.919
that's been like

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:29.280
i've been loving doing that to the point

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.960
where it's like you know

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.639
you go through all the domains and then

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:33.919
you come up with all the stuff that like

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:35.440
you know here's the things i value but i

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.720
you know i kind of wasn't

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.080
i didn't really do much stuff in terms

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.520
of like for my relationship and i should

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.800
do this x y and z

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.160
and you know you just come up with like

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.319
a really cool self-created to-do list

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:46.240
that you know just makes your days full

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.919
of stuff that you enjoy doing that are

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:49.759
deeply meaningful to you personally

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:51.599
rather than just being like another day

00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:53.440
another dollar [ __ ] everyone's

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.520
[ __ ] blah blah blah blah

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.599
matt i love that uh the typical like

00:07:57.599 --> 00:07:59.360
internet impression of you

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.639
is to just say a bunch of uh

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:04.960
almost made-up words pertaining to like

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.240
a pseudo-science

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.400
but when you really let matt mccusker

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.680
rip it's

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.039
as coherent and like focused as anybody

00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:14.720
you would ever talk to

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.240
well that was a struggle man that was

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.840
like you know

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.039
and it's funny too just i always tell

00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:20.240
people when they're like i want to do a

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.440
podcast but like you know

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.800
how do i get my numbers it's like just

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.800
make sure you're coherent i rocked like

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.440
six months

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.520
not being coherent at all so it's like

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.540
some of you know just

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.120
[Laughter]

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.640
it's like just try to be coherent you

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.080
know and like doing it listening back

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.760
yourself reading writing all that stuff

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.320
but yeah

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.080
no it is funny you know it's a comedy

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.440
podcast too if you like that you like to

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.399
get the people laughing

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:41.839
but yeah that's the i guess people said

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:42.880
to me like i know you're some guy who

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.159
just smokes weed in your basement all

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:44.640
day

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.839
but this you know they'll hit me with

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:48.240
stuff like all right bro oh matt you

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.440
couldn't be further

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.839
uh from the truth on this one all right

00:08:52.839 --> 00:08:54.160
well

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.320
but yeah dude i'm telling you man it

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.080
doesn't have to do with uh i think

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.440
there's a there's a thing with goal

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.080
setting where

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.120
it's kind of contrived as like

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.680
shallow and robotically business-ish and

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.440
i i was i kind of thought that way when

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.560
i was younger

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.160
but it's like it's like no man you're

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.720
giving yourself a self-directed

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.640
purpose and meaning in life you know and

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.560
it's i think it's something if you do

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.320
that it just cure a lot of that other

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.080
stuff your weird angst and existential

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.360
problems is kind of start to fall by the

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.080
wayside

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.279
well one of one of the things that i

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:25.680
found beneficial with goal setting and

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.440
it can feel limiting at first but i

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.920
think through setting your own structure

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.440
you create your own freedom

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.680
like for instance um wes you had

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.040
mentioned something today that instantly

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.240
made me think of something i experienced

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.200
this past week i

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.519
heard you say something on the um on the

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:41.360
crowd cast with matt on roma's um your

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.560
most recent one where you mentioned

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.480
taking micro steps toward action toward

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.080
uh goals

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.680
and the first thing i thought it was

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.120
like feeling overwhelmed for this one

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.560
thing that i had to do for school last

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.360
week

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.279
and then finally i sat down like last

00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:54.480
wednesday and said like all right i'm

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.240
setting a timer for two hours

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.839
and whatever just gets done at that time

00:09:57.839 --> 00:09:59.680
that's what i'm going to get done well

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.120
i got the whole [ __ ] thing done in an

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.880
hour and 40 minutes and then it's like

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.399
all right well i got 20 minutes left to

00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:05.760
do absolutely anything that i want

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.480
without feeling

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.320
any guilt like i could sit here and

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.560
watch youtube compilations of fat girls

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.079
arm wrestling and not feel

00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:14.800
any [ __ ] reservations about doing so

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.680
because i got down

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.040
exactly what i needed to [ __ ] get

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.959
done today yep

00:10:18.959 --> 00:10:21.200
a hundred percent man and to piggyback

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.680
off of me what matt was saying

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.399
um when you take ownership of all this

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:28.240
stuff it's all it is it's it's

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.240
taking ownership of of different areas

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.240
of life and it's that whole quote of

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.279
you know what do they say like nobody

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:37.200
ever washed a rental car

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.600
you know so you don't treat things that

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.040
you rent with the same

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.240
discipline and care and attentiveness

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.680
and intention that you do with the

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.600
things that you own and that same

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.680
analogy from the rental car applies to

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.399
life

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:52.480
so start owning your family relationship

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.440
start owning

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.720
your relationship with money start

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.000
owning your relationship with your wife

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.440
start owning your relationship

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.600
with whatever else your calendar right

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.120
just take [ __ ] ownership of it and

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.000
then from there

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.680
you take micro steps little micro

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.760
commitments and i think that's a that's

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.279
a big thing that happens with goal

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:09.279
setting is you set the vision it's like

00:11:09.279 --> 00:11:10.480
yeah that vision is going to take a long

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.440
time to get

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.720
right but but the the i think false

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.279
belief

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:16.720
is that you have to get it in a certain

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.240
period of time did i set deadlines all

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.440
the time and i missed them

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.360
dude i don't think i've been on time one

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.240
time for matt and i's podcast

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.120
twice twice yes twice and i feel so

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.800
terrible for that and matt's like a

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.079
phenomenal partner because he doesn't

00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:30.959
want to crucify me

00:11:30.959 --> 00:11:33.600
each time i do it um and it took it took

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.000
me

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.720
six months to even get up real most with

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.160
matt and thank god he helped me with it

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.240
because it would have taken another year

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.480
so um but i think the prerequisite of

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.399
ambition and then ownership of over all

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:45.360
those things and then

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.120
knowing that the path is going to be

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.560
extremely messy

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.160
extremely messy yeah man yeah the path

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.440
itself and the mess

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.320
upon it is almost like a detriment that

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.920
you can't foresee you can't

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.279
like when you identify something that

00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:01.680
you want or a goal that you want

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.639
um but first of all like seeing the goal

00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:05.839
for the first time is almost like

00:12:05.839 --> 00:12:07.200
looking at it's like too bright you

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.040
can't you can't look directly at it

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.480
and you're terrified of it and then you

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.000
accept that like all right well i could

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.959
i could

00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:15.040
feel like a [ __ ] loser for the rest

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.480
of my life or i could just start taking

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.040
actions

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.279
and then when you start doing it you

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:20.720
immediately you come up with a list of

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.440
reasons why

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.040
number one either you shouldn't or it's

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.959
going to be hard or you can't

00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:27.040
and then once you get past all that

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.880
there are new problems that you couldn't

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.160
have

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.120
imagined when you started and some of

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.560
them were good problems and some of them

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.160
are time wasters um but

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.160
i think getting to them as quickly as

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.480
possible so that you can

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.079
maximize the time that you can spend to

00:12:44.079 --> 00:12:46.160
figure them out is uh

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.440
it's one of the valuable skills i've

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.760
learned uh this year

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.200
um and the only thing that stopped me

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.480
was you know just that that blind

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.000
hesitation

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.800
yeah dude the the thing that uh so i've

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.320
been reading viktor frankl

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.360
uh the guy who didn't search man for

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:01.920
that now

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.279
yeah he was the guy who was in a

00:13:03.279 --> 00:13:05.440
concentration camp and he like he was a

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.160
psychiatrist

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.160
and he got rounded up thrown into camp

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.399
um and then he was like trying to write

00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:11.839
a manuscript while he was in a

00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:13.120
concentration camp and they took his

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.720
manuscript and like threw it away

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.240
so he ended up getting out and actually

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.760
writing his manuscript and publishing

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.959
man's search for meaning and then he

00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:20.959
also started a whole like

00:13:20.959 --> 00:13:22.800
a a different approach to therapy which

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.639
is called logotherapy which

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:27.120
focuses on meaning as like a problem so

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:27.839
there's like

00:13:27.839 --> 00:13:29.600
classic psychoanalysis as like the sex

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.160
drive and then i think adler had like

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.480
um not the sex drive more of like your

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.399
social position drive like inferiority

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:37.839
complex and all that stuff and frankel

00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:39.120
was like no there's also

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.040
and young do this too but frankel was

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.480
like there is this

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.639
drive for inherent meaning and purpose

00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:46.240
like you know you can get a guy who

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.320
grows up in poverty and goes i just want

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.519
to be rich and then they get rich and

00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:50.160
they go like

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.600
there's still something missing and you

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.720
know it's supposed to make that

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.920
intangible like

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.839
is there a satisfying why behind what

00:13:55.839 --> 00:13:57.120
you're doing you know that's like your

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:57.600
meaning

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.440
yeah um you know he said and it differs

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.800
for everybody there's no one strike

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.480
thing you know that's right or wrong

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.600
but the thing that i've been thinking

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.199
about a lot is like what are and i think

00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:06.480
this has to do with

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.240
why some people are maybe more resilient

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.600
than others is like

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.079
what is your relationship to stuff that

00:14:12.079 --> 00:14:13.440
doesn't exist

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.600
like can you dream stuff up and then

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.440
like you know can you see a thing in

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.079
your head

00:14:18.079 --> 00:14:19.839
that doesn't exist and have that sustain

00:14:19.839 --> 00:14:21.120
you through like you were talking about

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.399
the messy period when you're like but

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:23.760
everything sucks and nothing's working

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.160
out

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.600
but like you know and i think that's a

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.440
huge factor for people who can like

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.199
hold an actual vision in their head and

00:14:29.199 --> 00:14:31.040
have it feel so real that it'll sustain

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.399
them through that period of like getting

00:14:32.399 --> 00:14:34.639
to something even like resembling that

00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:35.920
matt matt two things i wanted to mention

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.920
real quick um i apologize i'm actually

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.040
uh listening to wigar frankel's book

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.600
and uh that wiger franco's book is my

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.470
man's search for me

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:48.959
[Laughter]

00:14:48.959 --> 00:14:52.160
chapter one my one boy

00:14:56.079 --> 00:14:58.100
just for the heavy heart

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:04.880
[Laughter]

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.399
i never knew how much i enjoyed not

00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:10.000
being in a concentration camp but

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.079
i'm sorry mike um

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:17.600
oh dude uh what one of uh one of my

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.760
biggest goals for the year was to

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.040
provide value

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.320
in in in my actions and i feel like one

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.440
i've been able to do that through so

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.480
many things that i'm doing

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.639
but in doing so like i'm able to find

00:15:28.639 --> 00:15:29.920
value

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.600
um doing that has basically surrounded

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.000
me

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.040
with activities with people and

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.680
things that provide value for me in

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.079
exchange

00:15:40.079 --> 00:15:42.320
for that and it was something like i

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.440
wasn't looking for that [ __ ] and it's

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:43.920
just like

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.920
a byproduct of what inevitably ended up

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.079
happening and it was it was a [ __ ]

00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:49.360
cool thing and it goes to what tim was

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:49.920
saying like

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.360
you get problems associated with the

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.959
[ __ ] that you set but also

00:15:52.959 --> 00:15:55.040
there's going to be unexpected um

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.240
bonuses to

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.839
to the [ __ ] that you set out after as

00:15:57.839 --> 00:15:59.920
well not me i expected every bonus that

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.360
came my way everything that came away i

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.920
was like it's about time

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.959
what the [ __ ] took so long yeah how were

00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:08.800
your guys's years can you guys recap

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.240
like a difference between because we all

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.600
kind of did it you know i guess the

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.040
three of us wes has been on this page

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.079
for a while

00:16:14.079 --> 00:16:17.279
um but the three of us kind of

00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:19.440
organized stuff in a way this year like

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.120
you know and i i know i did it

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.199
i just started doing it pretty much the

00:16:23.199 --> 00:16:24.720
biggest thing i had was like

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.399
just doing stuff that i had kicking

00:16:26.399 --> 00:16:27.600
around in the back of my head and i was

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.000
like

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.120
i don't want to do that that might be

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.880
weird i just did pretty much almost

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.480
everything that i had wanted to do and

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.399
then got to judge like the experience of

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:36.000
that rather than just like

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.079
my own preconception of like no that'll

00:16:38.079 --> 00:16:39.759
suck blah blah blah

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:42.880
well i this was the first year okay so i

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.720
i there's a couple of levels to the way

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.639
i i thought about this

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:49.040
um number one this was the first year

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.880
that i feel like i wasn't just

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.079
going into you know like 26th grade

00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:57.199
like i i feel like uh i was kind of on a

00:16:57.199 --> 00:16:58.959
track where all i could think about was

00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:00.800
like okay if i do a good enough job

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.440
at whatever company i work for this year

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.039
at the end of the year i get my report

00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:06.400
card and if it's a good enough report

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.839
card they'll give me a raise and if i

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.360
just get a couple of good report cards

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.079
in a row

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.400
my family's gonna be set and then i

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.439
found that just like

00:17:13.439 --> 00:17:15.919
every year through just just trying to

00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:18.240
like play it as straight as possible

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.600
it was the dumbest thing i could have

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.520
done like

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.959
uh obviously like wages have been

00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:27.039
stagnant and falling compared to

00:17:27.039 --> 00:17:28.559
productivity like

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:31.600
nationwide that's not a tim problem um

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.840
and it was just like i was i was on like

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.039
uh

00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:38.000
the most like secure track to just like

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.600
mediocre failure

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.200
and this was the first year even

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.320
including the years where it looked like

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.520
we were gonna have like a tv show and

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.559
[ __ ] like that which i don't even need

00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:45.520
to talk about anymore

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.919
it's gone this was the first year where

00:17:47.919 --> 00:17:50.160
i actually thought

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.640
like i was actually operating in any

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.559
kind of capacity

00:17:54.559 --> 00:17:57.840
toward escaping that and uh

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.480
i can't i can't believe how how much you

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.120
constantly

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.200
feel like you could look down and and

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.520
just get like vertigo like it's that

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.120
kind of feeling where you're like oh man

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:07.840
this could all

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.760
this could all go away if i stop trying

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.200
to make it better like

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.120
i feel like if i ever stagnate in

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.559
anything creatively

00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:17.440
it's that's a failure so constantly

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.480
striving to

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.400
this is i don't know maybe maybe you

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.760
guys have felt this before but

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.960
this is the first year i ever felt like

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.559
i operated outside of like a nine to

00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:25.039
five

00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:28.320
uh mindset so with that in mind

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.600
i was really resentful of how the spring

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.000
kind of shook out because i i was like

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.039
dude i had like a

00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:36.640
printed out goals for the air i was like

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.559
dude i'm going to do things

00:18:38.559 --> 00:18:40.080
and it's going to be yeah i'm going to

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.919
be able to quantify them and they're

00:18:41.919 --> 00:18:43.520
meaningful to be i've already

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.280
established meaning i've shared it with

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.280
people everything about it felt new

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.440
you know the vulnerability to it the the

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.960
honesty with myself

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.200
you know being on mushrooms a lot it was

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.360
all very much for me to take in and

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.480
maintain

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.160
and then when uh when everything shut

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.600
down i

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.919
i kind of got stubborn about it at first

00:19:01.919 --> 00:19:02.880
where i was like well

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.400
my goals are still my goals dude i'm not

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.160
gonna be a [ __ ] [ __ ] i'm not gonna

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.400
hide in my house and that actually

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.200
slowed me down

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.120
i had to adapt i had to change some

reggaeton capital east coast

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.039
but it was getting very spicy and the

00:21:17.039 --> 00:21:18.799

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.280

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.000
well i also i think that is adorable i

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.360
also think too like tim like you were

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.159
saying man you were

00:22:30.159 --> 00:22:33.200
you were on the uh you know what

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.799
would you call like the grist mill of

00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:37.120
kind of like structured

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.960
careerism of just being like i was on

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.120
the path of the noble loser

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.120
yeah or just i mean you can win that's

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.640
the thing like you can

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.320
it's almost like a lottery system where

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.360
it's like you know everyone's always

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.880
disgruntled like that guy got the rip

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.919
motion

00:22:49.919 --> 00:22:51.120
on everyone's kind of disgruntled

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.720
waiting for their little like bingo card

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.520
to be pulled

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.280
but i do think like you know you went

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.799
off the reservation and like started

00:22:56.799 --> 00:22:57.440
like

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.200
doing your own thing and i swear to god

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.880
it's like it's something that like

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.720
there's people who just won't do that

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.919
you know or they just don't you know

00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:05.440
have it in their have it in them to do

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.039
that and it's like dude there's a

00:23:07.039 --> 00:23:08.400
definitely a thing like you know if you

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.600
don't like your situation you can kind

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.960
of go outside your comfort zone it's

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.240
like you know i mean correct me if i'm

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.679
wrong but like was that the thing that

00:23:13.679 --> 00:23:15.280
allowed you to kind of bust that move

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:15.679
like

00:23:15.679 --> 00:23:17.200
i'm getting the [ __ ] out of here you

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.640
mean like already being outside of my

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:19.679
comfort zone

00:23:19.679 --> 00:23:21.840
yeah yeah absolutely dude i realized

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.600
right before i moved that i was actually

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.799
geographically stuck

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:26.880
as well as emotionally stuck i was

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.480
terrified of leaving

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.720
a place where i was like the smartest

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.320
and and

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.360

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.159
terrible place because when it came time

uh the way things went in 2020. i i'm

00:24:24.799 --> 00:24:25.679
only

00:24:25.679 --> 00:24:28.880
uh offering um you know my my time and

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.240
resources to people that

don't want to uh be dominated by

00:24:34.159 --> 00:24:37.760
anything other than what's actually um

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.120
affecting them in their life you know

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.559
what i mean like yeah they'll not let

00:24:40.559 --> 00:24:42.000
the hysteria get to me

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.640
thank goodness my uh my family after all

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.559
of us surviving covid we've been

00:24:46.559 --> 00:24:49.840
healthy since and uh you know

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.320
thankfully i didn't get laid off so i

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.320
even even people in my position where

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.000
you know no one died in their family and

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.520
they all kept their jobs they

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.520
they cracked up and mike you're a big

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.360
reason uh that i didn't

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.840
so thank you well you're welcome and

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:04.480
also too

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.400
just know the feeling's mutual because

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.159
one of the one of the biggest

00:25:08.159 --> 00:25:11.279
um one of the biggest ways that i think

00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:14.159
stay on track with with any goal is to

00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:15.039
have somebody

00:25:15.039 --> 00:25:16.480
that you could bounce successes and

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.720
failures or just even thoughts off of

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.520
so i mean with what we're doing with

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.000
dadmy

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.440
you know it's it's cool to be able to

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.360
talk about that with you two but also

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.600
just literally anything that pops up i

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.039
know that i could text you or call you

00:25:29.039 --> 00:25:30.559
and i'll get a response

00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:33.039
and having that kind of [ __ ] safety

00:25:33.039 --> 00:25:34.240
net

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.320
is is really enough to keep me a lot of

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.840
times from going off the rails and going

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.120
off into my own [ __ ] and getting

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.880
lost in my own thoughts

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.679
so with that said 2020 could not have

00:25:43.679 --> 00:25:45.200
worked out any better like after we set

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.320
our initial goals

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.279
it was like all right i'm going to get

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:50.640
this [ __ ] i remember one specific moment

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.320
where i was having an issue with one of

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.039
my kids

00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:56.960
and i was like it got to the point where

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.159
like it was an issue with somebody

00:25:58.159 --> 00:25:59.840
outside of our family affecting our

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.400
family

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.600
and i was ready to honestly i was ready

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.600
to kill this [ __ ] so

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.440
and i remember saying saying to my

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.799
daughter i was like look just so you

00:26:06.799 --> 00:26:08.640
know like this is the effect that

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.640
that your behavior is having and i'm

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.240
very close to killing this [ __ ]

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.000
and i went i got my goals that we had

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.039
set for the year

00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:16.799
and i was reading off my goals i was

00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:18.559
like look do you think i can accomplish

00:26:18.559 --> 00:26:20.159
this and as i'm reading off of my goals

00:26:20.159 --> 00:26:21.039
i'm like [ __ ] i probably could

00:26:21.039 --> 00:26:22.960
accomplish all these goals from prison

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.080
think all right well let me get this

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.080
away

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.720
but what i'm getting to is that like i

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.279
really

00:26:29.279 --> 00:26:31.520
to accomplish these goals i didn't need

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.360
prison what i really needed was time and

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.640
lo and behold

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.279
i've got pretty much the last [ __ ]

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:38.799
eight months

00:26:38.799 --> 00:26:41.520
to just work just hours upon hours upon

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.159
hours

00:26:42.159 --> 00:26:44.000
to just work on the [ __ ] that i had set

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.760
for the year

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.840
so i have a very flexible work schedule

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.360
i've been very fortunate with that

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.279
health-wise i've been very healthy so i

00:26:51.279 --> 00:26:52.640
mean i've been

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.080
you know the luckiest out of the lucky

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.000
through this whole thing so

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.200
the way that this year [ __ ] unfolded

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.880
for me personally could not have worked

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.159
out any better um

00:27:04.159 --> 00:27:05.600
so i took advantage of it a lot of

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.279
respects but also too like here hearing

00:27:07.279 --> 00:27:08.000
you guys

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
wes and matt hearing you guys um talk on

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.760
romas on the most recent episode

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.960
it made me realize like [ __ ] like

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.400
there's always room for tightening this

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.039
[ __ ] up

00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:16.799
because i still do spend a lot of time

00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:18.960
complaining that i don't have time

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.640
but if i actually took into account set

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.080
a timer and say like the second i

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:22.960
started complaining

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.679
hit a [ __ ] stopwatch in a given day i

00:27:25.679 --> 00:27:27.520
could probably squeeze out like another

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.279
[ __ ] hour or two

00:27:29.279 --> 00:27:30.640
right to dedicate towards [ __ ] i

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.600
actually want to get done instead of

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.080
being a [ __ ] baby about [ __ ] so

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.520
there's always room to tighten [ __ ] up

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.240
and i think

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.159
that made me go back and go over my

00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:39.600
goals and think like all right [ __ ] i

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.720
really need to work on this and it's

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.320
just about discipline making time for

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.360
this [ __ ]

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.320
so external circumstances can can

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.600
[ __ ] eat my ass

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.520
because everything aside from health

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.760
health and job wise shook out correctly

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.880
the best possible way

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.480
best possible way it could have knife

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.640
wise knifewise we're getting people

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.240
mailing knives to us now

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.000
which is you know all i want out of a

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.240
person and all i want to put into a

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.279
person

00:28:05.279 --> 00:28:09.919
um dude it really is the [ __ ]

00:28:09.919 --> 00:28:11.840
best of situations right now and i mean

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.320
given whatever problems i have like

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.039
it's just a matter of just regaining uh

00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:18.399
context for what's going on and it's

00:28:18.399 --> 00:28:18.880
just i

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.559
really [ __ ] you know i feel like the

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:22.480
luckiest guy in the world

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.159
well to your point mike i mean i think

00:28:24.159 --> 00:28:25.760
you're spot on

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.240
play out this scenario where we had to

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.080
we had to have restrictions on going out

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.520
there play out that scenario 20 years

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.559
ago

00:28:32.559 --> 00:28:34.480
i mean the internet had the internet

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.320
alone right just gave us

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.399
so much more landscape and blank canvas

00:28:38.399 --> 00:28:39.919
to draw on regardless of whether or not

00:28:39.919 --> 00:28:42.000
we can go out to our local restaurant

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.440
um and it allowed even more time and

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.000
space

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.440
for people like you who wanted to take

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.520
advantage of it um so man i

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.440
i give you credit i think that's exactly

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.799
what you should have been doing and by

00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:53.440
the way still

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.760
now as we as we look potentially into

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.520
taking a double dip to a certain degree

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.000
back into

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.679
this thing it's like if you guys haven't

00:28:59.679 --> 00:29:01.360
done that if anybody listen hasn't done

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.080
that

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.640
um do it now or there's still there's

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:08.080
still time and space that might not be

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.520
similar in the future because everything

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.960
will be fully back up and up again but

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.600
it's like

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.520
you've got this you've got this uh court

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.039
that you can play on nobody's on it so

00:29:15.039 --> 00:29:16.640
so go full out

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.960
well it's also too many the uh because i

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.480
i struggle with like you know because we

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.919
we we'll talk to dudes and they're just

00:29:21.919 --> 00:29:22.480
like

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.679
you know i'm like you know we'll talk

00:29:23.679 --> 00:29:24.480
about like you know they're like i'm

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.679
real sleep deprived when we go through

00:29:25.679 --> 00:29:27.120
their schedule and it's it's like

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.720
you know maxed out like you know i'm

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.399
working night shift my wife works during

00:29:30.399 --> 00:29:31.200
the day

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.960
you know there's really there's really

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.039
like you're almost like damn dude like

00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:36.480
i don't have any i can't even think of

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.559
anything you know but

00:29:38.559 --> 00:29:39.840
another thing i've been reading about in

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.159
terms of just like one's values

00:29:42.159 --> 00:29:43.840
are just their attitudinal values so

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.279
it's like how do you okay you say you

00:29:45.279 --> 00:29:46.960
can't change a thing at all

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.000
you can always gauge and kind of

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.679
customize the way you face it and that

00:29:51.679 --> 00:29:53.440
makes a humongous difference man

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.880
of like people like you don't understand

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.559
like you know i got fired i got this i

00:29:56.559 --> 00:29:58.399
got that i got this you know no no like

00:29:58.399 --> 00:30:00.080
10 minute conversation is going to solve

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.240
anything but what people can always do

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.240
is just face thing either you can let it

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.760
destroy you or you can just buck up

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.320
through it

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.399
and face it and it's like people would

00:30:08.399 --> 00:30:10.480
be surprised how much of a changing

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.399
effect that has on almost everything

00:30:12.399 --> 00:30:14.240
because then once you know once points

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.840
you know dissipates

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.520
uh you know it's like you have a whole

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.039
different mindset you know and it just

00:30:19.039 --> 00:30:19.679
like

00:30:19.679 --> 00:30:21.679
dude a lot of that stuff again i'm

00:30:21.679 --> 00:30:22.799
always going back to all the jobs i've

00:30:22.799 --> 00:30:23.279
been out

00:30:23.279 --> 00:30:25.200
it sucks i should be promoted i should

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.480
be promoted blah blah blah and it's like

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.480
well maybe you act like a dick kind of

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.760
all the time you know like that has an

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:30.960
effect when you're walking around being

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.640
like [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] this guy i

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.000
should blah blah blah blah it's like

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.880
people pick up on that man it sucks so

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.480
oh man i that's one thing i never want

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.919
to be again is the guy at work that's

00:30:39.919 --> 00:30:41.039
like

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:42.240
management has no idea what they're

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.720
doing man if they let me run this place

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.240
i've probably been that guy i never want

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.180
to be that again

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.320
[Music]

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.919
everyone does dude i mean everyone i've

00:30:49.919 --> 00:30:51.440
i've sucked into it of being at be like

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.880
like yeah i'd be in a house that was

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.640
being built and i could like barely

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.600
staple the

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.360
wires to like a two by four and be like

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.559
these guys don't even know what they're

00:30:58.559 --> 00:30:59.760
doing

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.519
i would just like smash the staple every

00:31:01.519 --> 00:31:04.000
time your flannels like your flannel's

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.030
also stapled to the tube

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.519
[Laughter]

00:31:07.519 --> 00:31:09.039
yeah it's kind of unavoidable man it's

00:31:09.039 --> 00:31:10.960
like dude did you see the thing about

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.519
uh con or yeah kim kardashian had a

00:31:13.519 --> 00:31:14.559
hologram of her

00:31:14.559 --> 00:31:17.519
dad at her like 40th birthday yeah i saw

00:31:17.519 --> 00:31:18.399
that that rules

00:31:18.399 --> 00:31:20.720
kanye west gave her a hologram of her

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.960
late father to be like you know like hey

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.799
kimberly like we missed you you know

00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:26.559
like i you know blah blah blah

00:31:26.559 --> 00:31:28.320
and you know i thought i thought it was

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.679
a pretty sick gift or whatever

00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:30.880
it was a strange it was definitely

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.880
strange but like i was looking at the

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.799
you know supposed fallout of that event

00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:36.799
and there was people who would go like

00:31:36.799 --> 00:31:38.559
i'm a librarian and i only make eight

00:31:38.559 --> 00:31:41.200
four eight dollars and 48 cents an hour

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.360
and you get to look at a hologram that's

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.799
what's wrong with this conversation

00:31:44.799 --> 00:31:47.120
nice well it's just just the narcissism

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.039
of being like i'm i'm a librarian and

00:31:49.039 --> 00:31:51.360
i'm somehow related to this lady's

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.799
40th birthday part it's like that has

00:31:52.799 --> 00:31:54.080
nothing it just doesn't have anything to

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.120
do with you i understand like the

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.480
connection you're trying to make here

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.919
but it's like

00:31:57.919 --> 00:32:00.159
like that kind of like you know i my

00:32:00.159 --> 00:32:01.919
hate my circumstances you know i'm gonna

00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:03.760
sit here and wallow in it and wait till

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:04.640
i hear

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.480
somebody doing a thing that sounds kind

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.919
of cool and being like you shouldn't do

00:32:07.919 --> 00:32:09.200
that it's like

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.279
i don't know man i i really really

00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:12.960
dislike that kind of mindset yeah i

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.480
think that that's like a pretty uh

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.919
prevalent mindset on the internet i

00:32:15.919 --> 00:32:17.200
think people are just very

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.440
very eager to start an internet post

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.240
with

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.880
uh azza so you'd be like uh as a

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:26.159
librarian who only makes eight dollars

00:32:26.159 --> 00:32:27.679
and that's all they want to do and

00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:29.519
really they just want someone to to know

00:32:29.519 --> 00:32:30.960
something about them that's all it is

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:31.360
dude

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.440
yeah i think i guess you're right i

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.799
could see that it just like

00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:36.640
i just think it's just a bad mindset

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.399
it's like dude you again like

00:32:38.399 --> 00:32:40.559
you do essentially almost have i

00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:42.159
wouldn't say a totally blank canvas in

00:32:42.159 --> 00:32:43.840
front of you but it's a lot blanker than

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.440
people think and a lot of the stuff on

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.640
it is just

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.640
typically a lot of your own stuff and

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.080
then again people like well you know

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.360
people have different circumstances of

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.880
course of course of course you know but

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.640
again that is your circumstance you're

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.760
you're not going to be able to transcend

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.000
that other than giving it a full honest

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.440
look and just going

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.120
full bore on your own personal

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.200
circumstances rather than being like

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.640
kim kardashian had a hologram on her

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.080
birthday i got a couple thoughts about

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.360
that it's like don't think about that

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.360
it has nothing to do with not real

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.960
that's nothing it was a hologram they

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.760
didn't bring your dad back

00:33:13.919 --> 00:33:15.600
kanye should be a real [ __ ] and send

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.440
like a thousand holograms

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.919
to that to the librarians library and

00:33:19.919 --> 00:33:24.399
just talk at max volume i don't want to

00:33:24.399 --> 00:33:25.840
be like a dick about like you know and i

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.120
understand like people are hurting it

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.240
sucks when you know when you're jammed

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:28.799
up like that

00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:32.320
does suck but it's like dude i'm like

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.159
especially like when i went to social

00:33:34.159 --> 00:33:36.000
work school there was a

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.360
all this stuff you know there's this big

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.799
thing and i i think it is a good thing

00:33:38.799 --> 00:33:40.080
but they're like you got to meet people

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.279
where they're at you got to meet people

00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:42.559
where they're at and it's like you know

00:33:42.559 --> 00:33:44.240
okay yeah totally like you can't see

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.360
somebody who

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.279
you know maybe they just got out of jail

00:33:47.279 --> 00:33:48.480
have never had a job in their life and

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.600
be like all right dude here's a suit and

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.000
a tie

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.279
you know you do have to meet people

00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:53.120
where they're at but it's also like

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.960
at the same time again with that thing

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.240
of like you can meet somebody where

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.679
they're at while also

00:33:57.679 --> 00:33:59.600
trying to assess and tap into like their

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.360
unrealized potential and it's like you

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.159
know you can't

00:34:02.159 --> 00:34:03.519
whenever people just commiserate and

00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:04.799
they're like yeah anyone who has

00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:05.679
anything more than us

00:34:05.679 --> 00:34:07.519
sucks it's like you're totally cutting

00:34:07.519 --> 00:34:08.879
off your own foot like you you could

00:34:08.879 --> 00:34:10.240
have more stuff or could have a better

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.079
setup but it's you know just

00:34:12.079 --> 00:34:13.440
it's risky and it takes a lot of

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.879
personal risk and you know it's like

00:34:14.879 --> 00:34:16.320
it's just easier to kind of sit in your

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.919
little rabbit hole and be like

00:34:17.919 --> 00:34:20.960
everyone sucks but me it's like i guess

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.480
i agree with having to meet people where

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.320
they're at because uh i mean

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.240
sometimes i think like what what would

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.359
it be like if someone started like a

00:34:27.359 --> 00:34:29.040
podcast where like uh

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.639
i don't know what if it was like really

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:33.520
funny and like the the type of humor was

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.520
often like you know kind of rude and

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:35.919
like

00:34:35.919 --> 00:34:37.839
you know very uh very like you're not

00:34:37.839 --> 00:34:39.440
stuff you're not supposed to say

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.760
but then also like hidden in that humor

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.440
was like a message of like getting out

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.960
and getting things done for yourself i

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.839
just think that would be like a really

00:34:45.839 --> 00:34:48.320
cool podcast

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.240
it is true it is true but they do it in

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.839
like in the help they call it the

00:34:55.839 --> 00:34:57.280
helping or i think that's like nursing

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.640
and stuff but in like counseling there's

00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.760
this big thing where you're always

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.359
supposed to like never

00:35:01.359 --> 00:35:03.119
show any part of yourself or like you

00:35:03.119 --> 00:35:04.720
know you're not supposed to be like

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.720
judgmental but it's also like almost

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.079
like you should never push people you

00:35:08.079 --> 00:35:09.599
should always be like yeah that's gotta

00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:11.760
be hard

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.200
tell me about that where you know

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.119
sometimes people need a little like dude

00:35:15.119 --> 00:35:16.880
like i worked with kids in high school

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.640
and the guy was doing like uh

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.640
not identity theft but like trying to do

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.000
like cyber crime

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.440
and i was like him and his buddies or

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.119
like high school you know like juniors

00:35:25.119 --> 00:35:26.320
or whatever and i'm looking at them like

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.680
dude don't do that like just don't do

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.160
that

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.760
you can't pull that off there's

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.280
companies spending millions of dollars

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.400
to combat you

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.920
and you barely know how to work venmo

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.280
it's like stop dude what kind of crimes

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.320
are they trying to do

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.640
just do like that stuff where you like

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:39.440
somehow

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:41.200
set up you like you buy credit card

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.040

bad price tag dude

as before yeah exactly it's like you

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.119
know mcafee maybe you could pull it off

00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:04.880
you just talk to people and they would

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.079
have you believe that you're supposed to

00:36:06.079 --> 00:36:07.040
be like

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.119
um yeah well tell me more about that

don't do that like you're i think you

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.800
know you should be able to do stuff like

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:13.920
that does it matter to me in prison

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:14.880
right now i'm sorry

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.720
i mean i think he did no he did

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.079
something funny is going on like

00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:20.160
i saw him popping off about something as

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.079
recently as last week well he wore

00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:23.119
panties on his face

00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:24.240
instead of a mask and then he got

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.240
arrested for that

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.960
uh which sick move i honestly i you know

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.240
i'm not stealing credit but i did talk

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.359
about doing that before you got trouble

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.599
but yeah well i gotta give you guys

00:36:37.599 --> 00:36:39.760
credit because number one matt i totally

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.119
agree with what you're saying

00:36:41.119 --> 00:36:44.960
i cannot stand the the neutral blank

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:45.440
stare

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.119
looking back at the face of somebody

00:36:47.119 --> 00:36:48.640
who's asking for your advice and you

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.960
just give some sort of clinical answer

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.560
but you don't tell them what you would

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.200
do in their position at the same time

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.400
making sure that you say hey like

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.160
there's under there's nuances to your

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.200
situation that i'm never going to

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.320
understand because i don't live in your

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.440
shoes but

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.720
my best guess is this and i find that

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.520
if you go into it and your true

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.000
intention

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.320
is to help that person then even if it's

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.800
tough love it's not taken as criticism

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.480
it's like hey i'm fighting for you and

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.160
for your better self so therefore i'm

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.359
going to tell you with a certain

00:37:17.359 --> 00:37:19.760
force of emotion that what you should do

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.200
or at least what i think

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.440
you should do if i were in your shoes um

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.400
so uh

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.480
so man i think you know guys like you

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.920
that for the dad meet podcast

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.680
i i really have to give you a huge

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.119
compliment because what you guys have

00:37:31.119 --> 00:37:31.760
done

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:35.119
incredibly well at is almost the way

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:36.800
that i envision kind of like our

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.359
our warrior ancestors like you go out

00:37:39.359 --> 00:37:40.960
and you fight a battle with everything

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:41.680
you have

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.680
during the day and then you come back at

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.720
night and you want to meet with your

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.440
tribe

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.440
and talk about successes talk about

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.720
losses whatever it was

she doesn't have any kind of like

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.480
inferiority complex about it but she

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.760
she does like she was very receptive to

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.119
to the idea of like finding some

00:38:57.119 --> 00:38:58.400
direction for yourself

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.640

uh a cue from you and i i can't tell you

00:39:11.359 --> 00:39:12.800

my perception of you

00:39:17.119 --> 00:39:19.119
and for you to you know my perception of

00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:21.440
myself for you to bridge that gap

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.920

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:24.880
like catch up in the

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.800
in the slightest you know what i mean

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.240
like it was a helping hand reached

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.040
behind you

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.640
and i thought that was really great so

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.640
cool man i was so eager to uh i mean the

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.760
first thought i had was like i have to

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.040
share this with my wife

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.359
and uh this is this is tremendously gay

00:39:37.359 --> 00:39:39.520
i'm very i'm very sorry anybody but

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.000
um i came home we set some goals she she

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:42.640
had been

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.560
uh doing jiu jitsu for a couple of

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.240
months at the time or

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.640
she was probably coming up on a year and

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.680
she

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.280
her biggest goal was that she wanted to

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:54.000
get her blue belt in jiu jitsu this year

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.599
yeah and we're at a place where that's

00:39:55.599 --> 00:39:57.119
kind of difficult to do

00:39:57.119 --> 00:39:59.599
it's it's way more than just showing up

00:39:59.599 --> 00:40:00.240
um

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.280
and then everything shut down

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.240
and i mean gym's shut down but like we

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.599
were we were locked out of training for

00:40:07.599 --> 00:40:08.960
at least three months

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.160
and the all she could think about

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.440
was that this was something that she

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.960
wanted for herself outside of just

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.560
providing for a family

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.839
and she uh she was she forced me to

00:40:19.839 --> 00:40:20.880
train with her at home

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.800
like it was constant she had this drive

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.960
that i've never seen in her before

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.839
and uh by the time you know jim's like

00:40:27.839 --> 00:40:29.119
half opened back up

00:40:29.119 --> 00:40:32.640
uh in the summer like in like in august

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:34.400
we got back and it was like people were

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.000
like holy [ __ ] like people

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.839
could not believe the way that she had

00:40:37.839 --> 00:40:39.520
progressed while not being allowed

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.359
inside of his jiu jitsu gym

00:40:41.359 --> 00:40:44.400
um and then uh last week she got her

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.760
blue belt

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.839
oh dude that's awesome man so she did

00:40:47.839 --> 00:40:49.200
well she said what felt like a lofty

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:49.680
goal

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.359
and then it became an impossible goal

00:40:51.359 --> 00:40:53.040
and then she still did it and the entire

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.640
time she was driven by

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.240
uh this process that you kind of kicked

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.079
off for us and she wanted me to thank

00:40:58.079 --> 00:40:59.680

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:43.760
question like there's very simple

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.200
questions in life where it just

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.960
it's a show-stopping question it's so

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.720

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.079

accomplish what are you passionate about

00:41:54.319 --> 00:41:55.920
and you can say that to anybody and then

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:56.960
they kind of look at you like you're

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:57.599

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.720
and then all of a sudden dude i've asked

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.800
that question to people and they tear up

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.920
because they haven't been asked that

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.079
[ __ ] question in 20 years

00:42:12.079 --> 00:42:13.280

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:17.680
like i'm always like

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.839
weary for somebody in the shadows being

00:44:19.839 --> 00:44:21.599
like you're [ __ ] gay

00:44:21.599 --> 00:44:23.520
like that's that is in my head but it's

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.720
like so i always construct counter

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.079
arguments when people go oh

00:44:26.079 --> 00:44:28.400
yeah that's so stupid like you wouldn't

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.400
want to say cool yeah i get it but like

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.160
dude like you don't really know

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.599
you know i think what's the alternative

00:44:33.599 --> 00:44:35.440
to not having like a self like a

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:38.079
meaningful self-directed purpose to life

00:44:38.079 --> 00:44:38.800
is you know

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:41.280
is like the alternative to that is just

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.480
you know what i had

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.680
pretty much my whole life before that

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:44.880
for the most part like here and there

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.720
i'd get little glimpses of it

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:48.480
of not living like that but it was just

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.640
that like existential

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.720
floating just like what am i doing with

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.720
my time or like you know i do like a

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:55.920
little bit of work

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.520
but then like kind of like like rain you

00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:58.720
were saying like you got a thing done

00:44:58.720 --> 00:44:59.520
you wanted to do

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.800
so the next 20 minutes you could just

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.480
[ __ ] off my problem was like i wanted to

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.440
do all this stuff but i wasn't

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.880
disciplined or structured at all

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:06.480
so i'd be like haunted by all these

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.640
projects and i would like kind of tinker

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:09.119
with them

00:45:09.119 --> 00:45:11.760
never show anybody and then kind of like

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.680
go chill and kind of like waste time

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:14.960
procrastinate and then

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.400
i just always felt horrible like i

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:17.680
wasn't getting anything done even when i

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:19.359
went to relax it when i was relaxing i

00:45:19.359 --> 00:45:20.480
think about the work that i should be

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.680
doing and when i'm doing the like the

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.040
kind of the work i'd be like i should

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:23.760
just chill

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.040
so i was always in this kind of like you

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.640
know nether realm of like kind of half

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:27.760
doing stuff

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.040
and then once you like once i put

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.119
structure on that it's like like wes was

00:45:31.119 --> 00:45:32.880
saying before like you know

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.480
athletes have four quarters so i give

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.319
myself that time like five o'clock comes

00:45:36.319 --> 00:45:38.000
i'm done i don't care what happened i'm

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.520
done i shut down i go hang out with my

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.240
family

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.599
um you know and every now and again

00:45:41.599 --> 00:45:42.880
they'll take a little circumstance we'll

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.240
go like an hour later but for the most

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.040
part it's like

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:47.040
i have my on time and i have my off time

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.079
dude it's like

00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:49.440
and maybe it's just for like working for

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.560
yourself you need it because you know

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:51.760
when you're at a job it's very clear

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.560
when you're done

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:53.839
but for me like i don't know what you

00:45:53.839 --> 00:45:54.960
know i don't really know when i'm done

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.400
when i added the structure to that it

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.680
took away from that just kind of like

00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.119
floating what's the point of life

00:45:59.119 --> 00:46:00.480
feeling and then i

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.680
i feel like you know when you see like

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:03.599
pictures of the saints with like the

00:46:03.599 --> 00:46:04.880
yellow thing around their head i just

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.240
like walk around all day like i have

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:06.800
purpose i

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.880
you know i did you know it just feels

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.400
nice man

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:13.760
so oh yeah it really does um and that

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:14.640
matt that visuals

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:19.040
is nice as well but uh uh yeah i think

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.160
like you're saying walking around with

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.079
purpose it's a game changer man i i

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:23.040
think and

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:26.319
and i say this as as somebody who

00:46:26.319 --> 00:46:29.280
the neighborhood i grew up in um for me

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.400
and you guys grew up in very similar

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:31.680
neighborhoods

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.520
that i can tell you that the study of

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.119
life is what saved my life

00:46:35.119 --> 00:46:37.359
like there's there's no doubt about it

00:46:37.359 --> 00:46:38.480
that

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.560
learning at an early age oh if i want

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.640
this all i have to do is

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.960
read about it read a book about it or go

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:46.640
and talk to somebody who's done it

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.000
and you become increasingly and

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.640
instantaneously

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.960
understanding that you very much can

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:54.400
change direction of things

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.880
very easily and the feedback loop to

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:57.680
reward

00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.440
is actually very quick now it might not

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:01.200
be the north star vision

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.839
reward right but i guarantee you it's

00:47:03.839 --> 00:47:04.880
like if you've been trying to lose

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:05.839
weight

00:47:05.839 --> 00:47:06.960
you know for the last five years

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.880
whatever it is you step into a gym you

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.160
do one bicep curl

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:13.359
one one your arm looks different

00:47:13.359 --> 00:47:15.440
immediately right so it's not that you

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.520
have to lose 100 pounds by tomorrow it's

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:19.440
like go and do one bicep curl look at

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.119
yourself in the mirror like oh [ __ ] i

00:47:21.119 --> 00:47:22.559
can actually do this and it actually

00:47:22.559 --> 00:47:24.480
does create a change so it's actually

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.240
pretty simple stuff man

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.599
i'm going to create a measurement device

00:47:27.599 --> 00:47:29.359
that lets you know how close to your own

00:47:29.359 --> 00:47:31.119
dick you can get your mouth

00:47:31.119 --> 00:47:34.160
and then what it'd be cool to iterate it

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.520
so that like i get a little bit closer

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.559
next week you know what i mean and

00:47:36.559 --> 00:47:37.839
you're just you're just cutting down the

00:47:37.839 --> 00:47:39.920
distance between yourself suck attempt

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.359
and your own

00:47:41.359 --> 00:47:44.160
wiener and uh i don't know i feel like

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:45.359
that would be helpful for people

00:47:45.359 --> 00:47:47.520
i'd be doing people service dude i think

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:48.720
that's what bridges yeah that's what

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:49.520
bridges are for

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:50.800
do you ever do like the bridge where you

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:53.119
kind of like hips to the sky

00:47:53.119 --> 00:47:56.319
that muscle one simple trick that might

00:47:56.319 --> 00:47:57.599
help get you there is

00:47:57.599 --> 00:47:59.520
i'll put one end of a twizzler in my

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:03.119
mouth and the other end of my dick hole

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:06.240
that's good and then what mike what's

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:07.440
next after that

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:10.720
uh you keep eating until you're full

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:12.160
well you can measure you can count the

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.440
little lines in the twizzler and that

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:14.880
tells you the progress you're making i

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:18.000
don't know those are vulnerable lines

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.319
yeah the distance between your dick and

00:48:20.319 --> 00:48:21.119
your own mouth

00:48:21.119 --> 00:48:22.800
is called twizzes they're not inches or

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.119
centimeters

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.640
but yeah man but dude i'm telling you i

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:36.079
sound like a broken record but it's like

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.319
it's just just giving your just again

00:48:38.319 --> 00:48:40.000
snatching your awareness is a big thing

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.599
too like having your

00:48:41.599 --> 00:48:43.280
conscious commanding your own conscious

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.480
awareness because we really almost give

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:45.680
it away it's like i don't want it i

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:46.880
don't want to pay full attention to

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.160
what's going on it's too much you know

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.359
it's too much to think about

00:48:49.359 --> 00:48:51.040
but so you start snatching that back in

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.400
little five minute increments and then

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:52.880
like

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:55.119
handle one situation totally conscious

00:48:55.119 --> 00:48:56.640
of it like dude i'll handle

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.400
like you know a heated discussion or you

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.160
know argument with my wife i was

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:01.680
basically vacant from my mom i would

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:04.240
just sit there and just be like

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:05.440
start fighting like i've been able to

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:07.839
like hear a thing while i'm angry be

00:49:07.839 --> 00:49:08.160
like

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.559
man i'm kind of pissed oh this is

00:49:10.559 --> 00:49:12.160
annoying and then you know

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.839
get out my part of it and it's like dude

00:49:13.839 --> 00:49:15.760
you start reclaiming those like areas of

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.280
your life that for me were just mostly

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:17.760
like

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:20.240
unconscious spazz mode it's like dude it

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.680
makes it's like the littlest

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.440
freest things that make like these

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.960
humongous changes in your life and dude

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:25.520
it's it's been

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:28.720
pretty tight yeah i think the

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:31.040
way matt put it last time uh for our

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:32.800
podcast was

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.240
one of his goals is just to touch the

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.839
habit you know just go and

00:49:35.839 --> 00:49:37.520
do whatever the smallest unit is and all

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:38.880
of a sudden that could be

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.160
that could be the catalyst that all of a

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.440
sudden like you know mike you were

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:42.079
saying

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:43.359
it's like i couldn't get this done i was

00:49:43.359 --> 00:49:44.720
going to try to do it and then i set a

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:46.000
time block and you know

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.440
boom i got all this done but it's like

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.800
just touch it sometimes you can only

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:50.559
touch it for a minute but other times

00:49:50.559 --> 00:49:51.920
you know you might you may get a full

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.440
hour and i know there's there's a

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:54.319
competition there

seeing that yeah

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:02.559
sorry yeah i was that's hard it's hard

00:50:02.559 --> 00:50:03.520

just only tough this dude this is i got

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.599
this from wes to be honest

00:50:07.599 --> 00:50:10.160
this is my daily habit actually wes made

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:11.599
it like an actual functioning like

00:50:11.599 --> 00:50:12.000
program

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.920
daily habit scorecard but it's like for

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.200
my purposes i just write
