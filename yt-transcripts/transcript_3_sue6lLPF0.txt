good job buddy thank you very much i

hope you can win here's what i was

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.399
thinking that we should do those because

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:24.000
we did have the internal olympics over a

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
year ago for these guys now right yeah

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.320
and we've lost omar to death look how

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.320
far they've come along though i mean

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.399
alex look at her every week not paying

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:34.000
attention and drawing a silly picture

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.920
yeah just sitting there on the floor

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.480
twiddling her thumbs yeah

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.000
becky finding a way in photographs to

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.680
make me always look 30 pounds heavier

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.399
than i still am

00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:46.560
that's an accurate photograph no it

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.600
doesn't it's not i don't know what they

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.519
say the camera adds 10 pounds yeah those

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:50.959
other 20s are just you eating a lot

00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:53.920
rebecca has very heavy cameras yeah

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.480
luke's beanie hat game tight and then

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.920
all right look mike harrington was so

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.279
unlikable that we just told him to stop

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:01.600
coming so we are sort of down a couple

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.120
steps like carrington isn't so much an

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.360
intern as he is the fourth mike

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.360
of the show i mean he's an integral part

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.200
of the only mike on the show he's the

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.600
voice of legion some would say

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.959
so uh

00:11:12.959 --> 00:11:15.279
what we should do i think we should hold

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:16.399
an intern

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:18.800

00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:00.079
deal with like if he wants to come into

00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:01.199
the show i mean if he has the balls

00:17:01.199 --> 00:17:03.040
coming to the show and you know

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.720
we'll hang we'll talk i would love to

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.720
see how much better i could do this time

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.240
grappling on the floor of this dirty bar

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.839
with mickey i would be willing to bet

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:11.600
after all your hard work zero percent

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.679
better

00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:15.760
not one iota of difference from last

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.520
time i'll be honest i think you've

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.360
gotten worse yeah

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.760
i think he'll do better because he's

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.240
also gotten better but in real life

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.240
no but i think i would do better i i at

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.319
the very least if i got mouth if he gave

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:30.720
me mount now i think i could hold on to

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.480
it for a little bit longer totally he

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.480
bucked me off dude before i even [ __ ]

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.919
really got mount i was already on my

00:17:35.919 --> 00:17:37.440
back tapping it was crazy he wouldn't

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.039
understand you know and of course and

00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:40.240
it's a roller coaster promotion because

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.360
he's so handsome you're like i kind of

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.720
like this you're probably thinking to

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.720
yourself well hey ryan o'neill who i

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.200
beat pretty handily also bucked me off

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.200
maybe this pro will do it again you keep

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.640
on taking these shots because you've

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.240
mentioned him bucking me off like 80

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.640
times that's all you ever say

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.000
all right in jay's defense it was the

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
most significant moment of the fight it

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.760
was his it was ryan's

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.039
moment of the fight you immediately

00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:02.400
turned it around i feel like you keep on

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.600
bringing trying to bring me down a peg

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.480
but you're not going to hurt my family

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.919
what do i always say to you after that

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:07.440
that switch of positions what is the

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.720
next thing i always say you're very

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.320
impressed that i even went for the

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.840
triangle i thought you did it actually

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.280
really good no i didn't

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.640
said it was ridiculous

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.000
yeah it was bad

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.840
but to me i was like i was like look how

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.160
technical lewis is trying to save their

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.840
lives

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.919
he's doing a thing he's doing a thing

00:18:23.919 --> 00:18:26.880
he's thinking in a fight

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.240
i would be trying to bite the guy on top

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.080
of his head i've cried in every fight

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.840
i've ever been in i would cry the whole

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.280
time i would have been in the hole i

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.960
turned red and squeezed him and i'm like

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.200
why would you [ __ ] do that to me oh

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.480
[ __ ] why do you make me do this

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.320
i cry during every fight the whole time

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.520
it's funny

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.880

the best outcome possible that's the

00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:19.919
[ __ ] real un unintended consequence

00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:21.120
of this whole thing is that you're

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.880

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.799

[ __ ] [ __ ] i'd love to have your

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.560

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.480
know it's like i like him we get along

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.040
great but he's very uncharitable when he

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:15.040
goes into a dunkin donuts i mean i don't

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.880
watch him just walk away from all those

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.640
donated dollars anytime i leave a rite

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.680
aid you know how they have a little

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.040
thing when you leave that says were you

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.560
happy with this experience and then it's

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.839
a happy face

00:40:23.839 --> 00:40:25.760
like uh a frowny face

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:26.960
sometimes it'll be like an extra three

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.319
choices but it's like just it's nice and

00:40:28.319 --> 00:40:29.839
simple you just smack the button as you

00:40:29.839 --> 00:40:31.119
leave were you happy to experience they

00:40:31.119 --> 00:40:33.680
don't have a frowny face that's frowny

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.599
enough for my experience in rite aid

00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:37.359
it's on the corner of my block oh that

00:40:37.359 --> 00:40:39.440
right it's [ __ ] up i hate it i used to

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.200
live around the corner from you i would

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.040
avoid that right egg like the plague

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.480
it's awful

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.800
what's wrong with it it's uh there's a

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.640
line wrapped around the store always

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:49.920
because no one knows what they're doing

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:52.079
in the front it's awful it's so it's run

00:40:52.079 --> 00:40:53.839
so shitty it's notorious but you know

00:40:53.839 --> 00:40:55.760
what i do at any rate that i go to or

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.599
anything that has the option to slap

00:40:57.599 --> 00:40:59.520
like a happy face service or a bad

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:02.240
service here bad service every time yeah

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:06.280
no matter how cool

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:17.359
[Laughter]

00:41:17.359 --> 00:41:20.000
and she was up for a raise to make 7.50

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.359

00:41:21.359 --> 00:41:23.359
15 an hour starting in january in new

00:41:23.359 --> 00:41:25.200
york city yeah and guess what it's the

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.440
negative review the best part of that is

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.520

when the minimum wage goes up to 15 an

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.119
hour to see how many of them have lost

00:41:41.119 --> 00:41:43.520
their job and are replaced by a [ __ ]

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.680
kiosk because that would look good

00:41:47.359 --> 00:41:49.440

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:02.240
cannot judge who won a hip-hop uh listen

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:03.440

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:06.079
yeah eminem was so much [ __ ] better

00:50:06.079 --> 00:50:07.599

00:50:35.119 --> 00:50:37.359
machine gun kelly what seemed so cool

00:50:37.359 --> 00:50:38.720

that was in in his rap he

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.880
compliments eminem

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:44.160

even taking part in the beef like tupac

00:52:32.079 --> 00:52:33.280
got shot and then he came out with a

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.800
song called who shot and he was like no

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.319

who shot biggie didn't know how to rap

00:52:47.359 --> 00:52:48.400
that was that's the only reason why he

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.079
didn't find out who did that it's it's

00:52:50.079 --> 00:52:51.680

there needs to be like in like an

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:10.800
inherent threat of violence this is what

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.400
happens when you have two white guys

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.400
beefing and one of them's over 40.

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.400

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:18.000

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.680
do with it you can't put those in the

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:22.240
top beef songs

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:26.079
tupac and biggie were like 24 year old

00:53:26.079 --> 00:53:28.640
black dudes who were both at least at

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:31.040

gang members that wanted to be

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:41.920
affiliated with them that was more than

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.839
they sold the image of being gang

00:53:43.839 --> 00:53:45.680
affiliated and then so some people

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:47.599

hip hop in general isn't made for 40

00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:19.280

00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:21.280
just a thing that's kind of weird you're

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:24.559

00:59:24.559 --> 00:59:25.839

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:10.079
we're gonna

01:06:10.079 --> 01:06:11.839
kind of can i mediate this because i

01:06:11.839 --> 01:06:13.200

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.960
you guys are both i already know i

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:17.359
already know what the actual truth is he

01:06:17.359 --> 01:06:19.599
saw ihop because for a little while no

01:06:19.599 --> 01:06:20.559
no he's saying that no no no no no no no

01:06:20.559 --> 01:06:20.559
no no no no no no no no no no no no no

01:06:20.559 --> 01:06:22.799
no he said that it wasn't me

01:06:22.799 --> 01:06:24.079
hold on everyone stopped i don't think i

01:06:24.079 --> 01:06:27.280
permanently renamed that i don't yeah

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.640
what was jay saying they actually

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.480
changed the name of the place to ihop

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:31.920
for like a month or a couple months or

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.960
whatever no no i don't think they

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.160
changed the name i think it was it was a

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.280
marketing thing they were saying they

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:36.799
were changing their name to ihop to get

01:06:36.799 --> 01:06:38.160
people to talk about it but all the

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.680
signage of the store said no i don't

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.799
agree with that no i think it was just

01:06:40.799 --> 01:06:42.880
on the commercials

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:46.960
now we got a bet so you're saying that

01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:55.520
[Laughter]

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:58.000
minus 150 right now for sure i'll bet

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.440
there was no [ __ ] signage i'll bet

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:00.640
you because you had a single [ __ ]

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:03.280
story out now this is out of sight

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.520
snatch defeat from the jaws of victory

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.640
right now when he's gonna say there

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:09.599
wasn't a single store that changes the

01:07:09.599 --> 01:07:10.640
signage

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.799
thousands of dollars thousands and

01:07:12.799 --> 01:07:15.039
thousands of dollars are real fun it's

01:07:15.039 --> 01:07:17.920
five bucks and a crown jay said have you

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.240

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:23.359
[ __ ] store that said ihob yeah no

01:07:23.359 --> 01:07:25.039
i wonder how hard it would be to unscrew

01:07:25.039 --> 01:07:27.039
the p and just flip it i think that's

01:07:27.039 --> 01:07:28.880
the whole idea yeah lewis went a little

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:30.000
bit higher

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.680
than thousands of dollars you said like

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.119
the signage on the [ __ ] building like

01:07:33.119 --> 01:07:34.480
the actual sign they changed the

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:37.039
building now james is jason

those are they are that's real they're

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:10.800
photoshopped they're not photoshopped

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:12.320
they didn't i know it's a marketing

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:13.920
point look the blues off look off the

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.679
blowers but they actually changed it do

01:21:15.679 --> 01:21:17.440
you understand the thousands and

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.360
thousands of dollars

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:21.760
i know i thought it was crazy that they

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:22.960
changed the signage looks like you know

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.400
how often they change their so off the

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:25.760
blue is on the be because they want you

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:29.440
to focus on us the burger thing

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:32.480
lewis why is it that you think that a a

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:34.800
multi-million dollar ad marketing

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:37.600
campaign is something they'd do

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:40.719
but just flipping the p up to a b is

01:21:40.719 --> 01:21:42.480
something that would cause ah they don't

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.639
even need to [ __ ] get a b they just

01:21:44.639 --> 01:21:46.639
got to turn it over we said that an hour

01:21:46.639 --> 01:21:49.360
ago yeah lewis all you have to do is

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:51.199
wear a shirt that says you're awesome in

01:21:51.199 --> 01:21:53.920

[Laughter]

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:53.199
this guy this guy at the end is this guy

01:22:53.199 --> 01:22:55.120
at the end is the ultimate piece of [ __ ]

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:58.400
like he's wrong in every possible way

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:00.320
this is him after getting beat up yeah

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:01.679

actually anthony's

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:06.960
brother and i'm gonna say because it has

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:09.199
to be said you're a [ __ ] you're [ __ ]

01:23:09.199 --> 01:23:11.120
you're going for family you're a [ __ ]

you're a [ __ ]

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:17.440
you think videotaping people oh this guy

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:18.400

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:20.000
yeah

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.199
so whatever it keeps the same thing

01:23:21.199 --> 01:23:22.639
that's just there's gonna they loop it

01:23:22.639 --> 01:23:24.800
but like uh wait that's i didn't want to

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:25.840
show his first that's what he did yeah

01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:27.920
but he go up to a guy at a bar but all

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.880
this [ __ ] afterwards he talks about

01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:31.679
like

01:23:31.679 --> 01:23:35.040
all i did was go tell my

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.719
on you he's got good punches though so

01:23:48.719 --> 01:23:51.280

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.280
here's the thing he's taking a few more

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:07.360
times but he doesn't actually i might

01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:09.600
just uh as a strategy here i don't know

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.199
if this is the best way to encourage a

01:24:11.199 --> 01:24:12.880
machine gun kelly to get in the octagon

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:14.239
right you want to show that you're kind

01:24:14.239 --> 01:24:17.920
of lame and exactly i got i i what i did

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:19.920
i balanced that out with this i'm about

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.280
to show you thanks courtesy of nine

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:22.560
rounds

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:24.800
look what i got

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.480
these are pink pink gloves i don't get

01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:28.080
it they're pink hand wraps

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:28.960
so

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:31.920
it's like uh big gay oakerson

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:34.320

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.480

i [ __ ] a man

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:41.199
then i wrapped my hand in pink gloves

01:24:41.199 --> 01:24:42.800
it almost feels like this has turned

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:45.360
into a sport for you

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:46.560
well

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:48.480
i guess my thing is almost the tmz is

01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:49.920
talking to them giving us the respect of

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:52.239
like hearing his side who is this guy

01:24:52.239 --> 01:24:54.480
he's a guy at a bar

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:56.639
who films himself going

01:24:56.639 --> 01:24:58.320
on an instagram live like i gotta do it

01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:59.920

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:01.280
kelly he's just

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.520
does he do this regularly who is he

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:05.040
because he's got a name like they're

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:06.560
acting like he's somebody they're making

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:08.800

guy at a bar i'm just saying no but i

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:24.719
follow the story of what's going on

01:25:24.719 --> 01:25:26.480
i think it's just a [ __ ] guy that

01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:28.000
talks [ __ ]

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.280

01:25:30.639 --> 01:25:32.000
said how do they know that

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.760
but that's already after the he's made

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:35.120
himself a thing

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:36.560
i'm saying after he did whatever did the

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:37.920
machine gun kelly which was not

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:39.920
publicized first the first thing that

01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:41.760
came out was this guy in his car which

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:43.679
we haven't uh found that one yet where

01:25:43.679 --> 01:25:44.639
he's just talking about what just

01:25:44.639 --> 01:25:45.760
happened to him i just got beat up by

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:47.840
machine gun kelly's crew they're [ __ ]

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:49.760
[ __ ] if he wants to see me one-on-one

01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:52.159
all this [ __ ] and then the tmz thing

01:25:52.159 --> 01:25:53.760
came out was showing him kicking and

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:54.880
saying won't you fight me one-on-one

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:56.880
machine gun kelly and then they go back

01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:58.639
and show you the video of this guy why

01:25:58.639 --> 01:26:00.400
machine gun kelly's crew got mad at him

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:01.920
because he's at a bar

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:03.760
and he goes uh we saw that video that's

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:05.520
the one we saw himself but he starts

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:06.800
that whole thing by going he goes gotta

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:09.040
do it man gotta do it yo machine gun

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:11.120
kill your [ __ ] [ __ ] dude and he keep

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:13.520
and he's arguing with tmz like what god

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:15.520
can't give his opinion anymore i think

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:17.120
he was a [ __ ] in what he said about

01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:18.480
eminem's kids or whatever he's like

01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:20.239
you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] it's like oh yeah

01:26:20.239 --> 01:26:21.840
dude if you call daddy here if you call

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:23.920
a dude a [ __ ] i mean you should sort of

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:26.000
expect him to course yeah you know look

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.040
i'm not saying that it's right that you

01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:28.080
should hit somebody for calling you a

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:29.520
[ __ ] i'm just saying you should expect

01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:31.520
it it's par for the course and to be

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:32.960
honest with you machine on kelly seems

01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:34.719
like sort of a [ __ ] so he's probably

01:26:34.719 --> 01:26:36.400
got a bunch of [ __ ] tough guys that

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:38.159
are with him and yeah they just [ __ ]

01:26:38.159 --> 01:26:40.159
jumped him or whatever um i don't know

01:26:40.159 --> 01:26:41.679
he pushed he shoves the guy that's a big

01:26:41.679 --> 01:26:43.040
dude and he shoves him as soon as he

01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:45.199
says [ __ ] to him yeah he goes at him

01:26:45.199 --> 01:26:46.239
right away

01:26:46.239 --> 01:26:48.159
yeah if you have [ __ ] 15 dudes there

01:26:48.159 --> 01:26:49.760
with you it's pretty

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:51.679
dudes i mean i'm sure they did beat them

01:26:51.679 --> 01:26:53.600
up i mean the end of this is yeah i mean

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:54.960
the other guys that fought us fight for

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.639
him it might have been security of the

01:26:56.639 --> 01:26:58.960
players it's very easy [ __ ] for you

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:00.480

does

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:36.639
oh yeah in the video i remember that

01:31:36.639 --> 01:31:39.040
it's a weird tattoo to have

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.960
that'd be a big help part of the reason

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:42.000
they're saying that they're saying that

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.600
you guys have the same producer on both

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:45.199
of your records yeah because i went to

01:31:45.199 --> 01:31:47.040
equal playing i went i took it to equal

01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:48.239
playing grounds

01:31:48.239 --> 01:31:50.320
what i mean let's let's also say it like

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:53.120
it is you took two weeks i took two days

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:54.719
you used the ronnie j track i used the

01:31:54.719 --> 01:31:55.679
ronnie j

01:31:55.679 --> 01:31:57.280
you used a million dollar studio i use

01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:59.440
the dress room before soundcheck

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:01.040
oh well i think he was contemplating his

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:02.719
his thought process was i don't want to

01:32:02.719 --> 01:32:05.679
make you any bigger is what he said

01:32:05.679 --> 01:32:07.040
i mean that's another funny narrative

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:08.800
that i hear i've sold over 20 million

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:12.239

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.960

20 million records i'm just i think it's

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.760
like i think it's like it's like singles

01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:50.159
tracks

01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:54.320
okay yeah that makes ca i just i mean i

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:56.480
not that i would even know i'm that out

01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:58.400
of it but i feel like if you sold 20

01:32:58.400 --> 01:32:59.920
million records i would just kind of

01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:01.920
know who you were before this

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:03.280
i've heard maybe i'm i've heard i've

01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:04.400
heard i've heard of him for years i

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:05.440
don't i don't know what he's music but i

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:06.960

never heard of him until this eminem

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:13.440
beef i'm very out of the loop but that's

01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:14.719
kind of eminem's point which is kind of

01:33:14.719 --> 01:33:16.080
like you know there's a lot of people

01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:17.040
haven't heard of you until you started

01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:19.760
talking [ __ ] and then yeah that's to me

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.679
that what i heard of him doing well he

01:33:21.679 --> 01:33:23.440
goes on to say that he hasn't changed

01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:24.960
he's got another song that he could

01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:26.560
release but he's not going to because

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:27.679
like [ __ ] it like i don't need to

01:33:27.679 --> 01:33:29.199

because i literally break up with my

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:53.920

my ring video [ __ ]

01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:22.639
it's still got 45 minutes before it goes

01:37:22.639 --> 01:37:24.239
down you ever have a thing where it's

01:37:24.239 --> 01:37:26.000
like it doesn't actually turn you on

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.760
it's almost like it has to get to the

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:29.280
dick right like let's say like let's say

01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:30.880
it's like a thing on the carnival you

01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:31.760
know where you hit the thing there's

01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:33.760
being you know with the hammer

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.280
this is gonna be not a good idea yeah

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:37.760
you got time it's done so you know it's

01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:39.520
on its way there you like when a woman

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:40.800
hits you in the foot with a hammer and

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:42.140
you get a boner

01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:45.259
[Music]

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.320
what i'm saying is when you're turned on

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:50.320
you go straight into your boner right

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:52.080
but you're not really turned on it just

01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:53.600
shoots up and sometimes hits your butt

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:55.440
hole in the puckers a little bit no

01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:57.440
and then there's just like a like a sad

01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:00.239
little eight-year-old in front of you

01:38:00.239 --> 01:38:02.400
i thought i

01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:03.760
are you like superman like where you

01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:05.280
know when he flies like it breaks the

01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:06.800
ground below him when he takes off is

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:07.840
that what it is like you pull your

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:10.080
energy of your boner from the earth kind

01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:11.679
of it comes up your legs and then it

01:38:11.679 --> 01:38:13.280
goes in but sometimes it gets stuck at

01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:16.960
your butthole no my boner's stuck

01:38:24.159 --> 01:38:27.600
all my boners start weirdly in my boner

01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:28.960
i don't generate some other parts of my

01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:30.960

there's just another gay dude here

01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:39.119

01:38:39.119 --> 01:38:40.560

tasteful

01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:24.159
so again i knew batman was coming back

01:41:24.159 --> 01:41:24.960
we're going to be able to see if we

01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:26.159
receive a little bit so you might want

01:41:26.159 --> 01:41:28.239
to fluff up a little he's fluffed up

01:41:28.239 --> 01:41:29.840
he's that's a semi right there batman

01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:31.040
definitely fluffed up that's not

01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:33.920
completely [ __ ] soft

01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:35.760
but it's censored is that the censorship

01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:36.880
one

01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:38.480
that's the uncensored that's that's not

01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:40.639
censored dude that's a [ __ ] [ __ ] no i

01:41:40.639 --> 01:41:41.520
know but i thought maybe they were

01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:43.520
trying to subtly censor with that

01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:45.280
no but you know the integrity of the

01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:46.719
artist but maybe now but here's where

01:41:46.719 --> 01:41:48.159
they kept the integrity is that they

01:41:48.159 --> 01:41:49.920
didn't just have the shadow of a dick

01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:52.320
there's a dick head yeah and a dick in

01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:54.239
there so that's where the guy was like

01:41:54.239 --> 01:41:55.760
i'm really i'm gonna give you here's the

01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:57.119
thing here's how beautiful they did a

01:41:57.119 --> 01:41:58.960
job with this because you only see a

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:00.400
very slight outline but you can still

01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:02.480
see exactly how nice this [ __ ] is yeah

01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:03.600
well also what's with that div in the

01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:05.119
middle is that that weird div in the

01:42:05.119 --> 01:42:06.239
middle it looks like a top of like a

01:42:06.239 --> 01:42:08.239
hoagie it's a herpes scarf jay you'll

01:42:08.239 --> 01:42:10.480
find a flaw in anything

01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:12.560
well you know look at his [ __ ] muscle

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:14.639
tone and his legs oh his dick's there

01:42:14.639 --> 01:42:17.520
too i didn't see it flopping over there

01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:20.400
look at that hammer wow

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:22.800
wow oh man he really is oh i thought

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:24.719
that was something in his utility belt

01:42:24.719 --> 01:42:29.280

01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:31.600
yeah i mean decorating

01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:32.719

01:42:32.719 --> 01:42:34.320
young gay boys that want to see batman's

01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:36.480

01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:38.480
tingling when this came out

01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:40.080

01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.040
and see if there's any correlation

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:42.159
between the butthole thing language

01:42:42.159 --> 01:42:43.119

sistine chapel god's finger mix that's

01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:22.159

01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:25.440
horny kings

01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:28.400
that was uh yeah

01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:30.159
good drawing well what happened

01:43:30.159 --> 01:43:33.360
what happened with bert and uh and ernie

01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:35.199
they're gay

01:43:35.199 --> 01:43:36.560
the writer said they were gay was that

01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:38.400
at former sesame street writer says burt

01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:39.760
and ernie are gay

01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:41.280
let's see this luke this luke's family

01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:42.719
video yeah there's a it's a big

01:43:42.719 --> 01:43:45.360
controversy yeah i mean so did my dad

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:46.159
though

01:43:46.159 --> 01:43:47.760
yeah everyone's sort of when i was

01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:49.280
watching him i was like wait what are

01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:51.360
you gay i think it was kind of a gag

01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:53.040
though like you know that's what they

01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:55.679
would do on each other every night

01:43:55.679 --> 01:43:58.400
i think the guy meant it seriously and

01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:00.000
then a lot of other writers for the show

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.080
were like hey man like this one guy came

01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:03.920
out and he was like no i created burton

01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:07.119
rna and they are not gay but like it was

01:44:07.119 --> 01:44:08.800
it was weird though so the guy who had

01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:10.400
such a strong opinion so the guy who

01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:12.159
wrote for bernie said they were gay one

01:44:12.159 --> 01:44:13.679
of the guys who was a writer said they

01:44:13.679 --> 01:44:15.600
were gay and then the guy who created it

01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:18.800
was like look i know best i created

01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:20.560
these guys and they're not gay and it

01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:22.239
was just very strange that any of them

01:44:22.239 --> 01:44:24.159
had an opinion because no one from

01:44:24.159 --> 01:44:26.960
sesame street should have any sexuality

01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.400
at all like

01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:29.760
if you're ticklish

01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:31.600
puppets yeah if you're gonna say burton

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:33.440
ernie or gay what's the next like

01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:35.440
logical question you're like is elmo

01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:37.199
getting his dick sucked after the show

01:44:37.199 --> 01:44:38.800
or something like i think elmo was that

01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:40.719
sounds like a champion

01:44:40.719 --> 01:44:43.040
song elmo getting a dick elmo actually

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:45.280
wrong

01:44:45.679 --> 01:44:47.600
i'm gonna reel that back in elmo was

01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:49.040
definitely getting this deck sucked yeah

01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:51.520
but non-stop it was a very strange

01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:53.199
argument to have and i guess there were

01:44:53.199 --> 01:44:55.199
like different writers and creators that

01:44:55.199 --> 01:44:58.159
were on opposite sides of it okay so

01:44:58.159 --> 01:44:59.760
it's become a whole thing well i mean

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:01.040
look you know in the you know

01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:03.360
dumbledore's gay there's a gay superhero

01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:05.679
right i i guess it was a gay green

01:45:05.679 --> 01:45:08.239
lantern abraham lincoln was gay

01:45:08.239 --> 01:45:09.040
yeah

01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:10.560
no that's true once we're gonna start

01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:11.920
playing this whole thing out from the

01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:13.440
beginning sure but i think it's sick

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:14.719
that there was a dude that was like nah

01:45:14.719 --> 01:45:16.400

01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:17.840

01:45:33.679 --> 01:45:36.080

for the time it was good it really does

01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:16.180
look like kurt metzger

01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:20.199
[Music]

01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:32.880
fish

01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:34.480

01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:36.159
how do you do that yeah yeah well just

01:47:36.159 --> 01:47:38.560
like this

01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:42.400
fishy fishy fishy oh [ __ ]

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:44.159
bert's starting to feel the tingling of

01:47:44.159 --> 01:47:47.199
being turned on in his [ __ ] right now

01:47:47.199 --> 01:47:48.480
oh wait no

01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:52.080
that's a puppeteer's hand he's like oh

01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:54.000
damn i can't believe bernie ernie you're

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.040
doing something to me gay [ __ ] guys

01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:00.800
turns out yeah gay tardis

01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:02.400
yeah i mean look i would dave i don't

01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:03.520
remember saying like they shouldn't have

01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:07.600
sexuality um no i was like

01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:08.800
yeah i mean look technically they you

01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:10.480
know they could call them

01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:12.000
but i think the idea would be that being

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.679
gay isn't just sex like you know at this

01:48:13.679 --> 01:48:15.600
point you know being gay

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:18.800
is uh it's not just an abomination or

01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:19.920
um

01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:23.520
you know just it's not just that yeah

01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:25.679
it's not just gross and something it's

01:48:25.679 --> 01:48:27.040
not just

01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:28.960
when it hit people and disowned family

01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:32.400
members it's not just that

01:48:36.159 --> 01:48:37.679
it's my it's my girlfriend's birthday

wow remember that hole

01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:40.880

01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:42.480
extend the show where you're like you're

01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:43.599

01:50:43.599 --> 01:50:45.360
do a [ __ ] give her a cake

01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:46.560

01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:50.880
yeah yeah

01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:52.960
i guess we could have just uh so bert

01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:54.639
and ernie

01:50:54.639 --> 01:50:56.080
we could have just given her the cake

01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:57.599
you know with all the people here no i'm

01:50:57.599 --> 01:50:59.040

i'm sorry i thought we were hitting the

01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:10.560
old uh so

01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:12.400
by the way i do remember at the

01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:13.360
beginning that they said we were going

01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:15.599
to give kim a cake but i i just didn't

01:51:15.599 --> 01:51:18.080
realize that it had to be live on air

01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:20.000
that way i felt like you could just the

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.440
same way you could just go surprise her

01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:23.520
in florida with having to tweet about it

01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:25.360
you know i figured like we could just no

01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:26.400
i don't know if somebody did the thing

01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:27.920
like uh when should we bring the cake in

01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:29.440
