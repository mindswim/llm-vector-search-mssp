00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.949
I love it I think I think it's sick I

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.470
think it's my future you know it's the

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.359
future going lives away the future it's

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:07.319
the only thing you can commoditize

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.970
anymore it's the direct experience

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.519
recordings all get sent to the cloud you

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:12.750
know I mean we are approaching the

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.099
singularity the only thing people can

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.480
have is your direct experience that's

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.699
the only thing left to sell your direct

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.859
experience in real time hell yeah

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.410
yeah that's why that's why stand-ups not

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.840
going anywhere dude true true a lot of

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.670
people - a lot of talk that's a lot of

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.130
talk saying stand-ups dead

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.689
nothing nothing beats being in the room

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.199
dude

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.090
well the only thing that's seen a lot of

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.340
shitty comics seem really funny by being

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.290
in the room

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.730
true but the only thing that sucks is

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.649
like you're special your people's hopes

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.020
of like working on a special can be

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.059
dashed by one dude with a camera phone

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.309
it records like 20 minutes of your set

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.280
true but you know I don't know that I

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.590
listen to most of Louise special before

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.809
it came out trail when it came out I was

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:55.649
still like hell yeah

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.940
sure oh and if you're a lie if you saw a

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.920
live and be kind of swell yeah yeah

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.539
that's that's the only that's the only

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.449
argue I think stand-up will evolve to

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.530
people doing 20-minute specials like

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.320
once or twice a year I think so hot 20

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.840
45 45 to an hour's a little long a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.790
little long dude a little laborious it's

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.100
like just rip a hot 20 chuck it out and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.479
keep everything on the web and just keep

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.250
ripping that's that's just me that's

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.619
just me Matt McCusker futurist writer

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.659

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.639
of getting out like you know weaponized

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.440

coded thing on an Apple and it came up

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.049

throw it back in without being as

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.599
obvious did it know that it was exactly

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.130
what the story of my little brother told

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.780

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.260
it's it's tensions are high true so I

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.690
came down the steps oh I was called to

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.460
hold her kid while she was getting the

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:24.090
bowl cut I was in the middle of the orcs

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.460
where the green skins were attacking my

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.350
Dracula's yeah this one your dad

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.520
approached you when the green skins were

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.440
attacking your Dracula's no I was yelled

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.720
I was summoned by far McGuire to come

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.810
downstairs during her bowl cut while the

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:38.550
green skins were impeding onto my

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:39.960
[ __ ] sacred land

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.570
can you pause you could but I was in the

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.370
middle of battle the computer was

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.020
running hot when he's in a battle that's

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.000
real so I had to finish the battle and

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.650
it took long because for some reason the

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.690
fast Ward button wasn't working so I

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.040
just had to play it so it took like

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.180
maybe 20 minutes

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.410
watch the kids while you were battling

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.570
the I just made far McGuire I had to

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.870
tend to her own so pretend I'm not here

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:03.420
and then I came downstairs and I could I

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.250
you know I couldn't divulge that it was

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.570
because the green skins were attacking

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.640
my vampires sure your that was a secret

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.410
of visions like I was working on

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.750
something but that started there was a

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.220
lot of tension and then Phil came in

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.770
from working outside and hit me with the

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.399

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:35.210
big victory this week on the Internet

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:38.720
what because sexual pest was brought to

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.220

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:43.430
yeah that was uh yeah it's tough it's

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.930
tough to I felt dirty

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.820
I thought it feels bad even weaponizing

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:50.720
that [ __ ] but it's again it's yeah

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.370
it is it's against my chill ass vibe

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.770
that guy deserved it 100% true I mean it

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.600
was it was sweet it would there was

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.830
something there was some sort of like

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:58.940
you know it was the only person that

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.310
ever deserved it I was like laughing the

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:02.450
entire day true

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:03.860
and then well probably for like an hour

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.160
to and then I started to realize like

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.600
it's not great I just don't know how

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.310
people Rock like that like I was like

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:12.860
[ __ ] like laughing [ __ ] around and

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.840
still I was like this feels gross dude

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.910
yeah that's the water people swim in

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:20.570
being like what are we doing we're just

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:22.400
making an accusation we found on Twitter

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.720
and we're gonna try to really ruin this

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.180
guy's life yeah get him yeah I was

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.210
really I was reading a lot about the

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:30.770
psychology groups and apparently it's

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:33.230
like you can just find a leader who will

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.420
just not second-guess themselves at all

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.670
people kind of get off on that if people

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.770
just go like straight anybody know if

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.330
some guys microphone is going like you

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.940
and then people cuz you know when you're

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.650
a kid you get this you get to feel this

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:47.960
power of like being with your mom or dad

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.550
and like you're like I'm a child this

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.110
person totally was taking care of me

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:52.370
yeah this is how they say hypnotism

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.320
works because like it's not like a

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.970
hypnotist does anything anyone they just

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:57.740
tap into the person's desire to kind of

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.810
regress back to that like childlike

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:01.430
state was looking completely abandoned

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.920
like there she is going on so if someone

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.180
is loud enough and sure enough of

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.130
themselves like clockwork people will

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:08.870
just fall into it just to like feel

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:10.880
protected and then they're the acts that

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.470
you do while under that kind of like

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.540
behind that leader you're kind of like

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:15.800
this how they explain the Nazis it's

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.600
like you know you have Hitler going hard

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.760
then it's just like [ __ ] it he's doing

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.020
it and you start doing it you don't feel

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.850
like the same amount of guilt because

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:25.670
you're like yeah whatever so this was us

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.190
basically getting Hitler yeah we kind of

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:29.930
took him we got him so Hayley really all

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.330

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.650
yeah I didn't that thing out of months

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:55.760
but again there was you know there was

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.320
like here's also the seedy underbelly

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.530
that gave birth to Shane it was just an

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.110
article about Legion of skanks yeah he

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:04.460
tried he tried to do Back to the Future

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.410
then he tried to do back to the future -

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.480
we tried [ __ ] when you work for

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.980
websites do they do tell you like keep

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.180
just come on let's keep it going yeah

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.840
moving so you know this is this is the

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.920
problem with going live though I think

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.480
this is where we would hit the old reset

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:25.070
on a regular episode but there's still

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.730
hitting buttons

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.480
are you know can you secure him a

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.399
microphone just pull this table near him

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:39.610
and crank the boom arm we got we have

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:43.029
some questions for lemare this is what

00:15:43.029 --> 00:15:46.720
did you hear about the guy who pulled a

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.430
gun on the dude and he's like a Philly

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.740
bar owner no pulled a gun on someone

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:56.080
no so I think it was like the places I

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.490
think is like a hookah lounge it was the

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.020
place was called like elixir or

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.339
something it's like right on Second

00:16:00.339 --> 00:16:07.180
Street infusion yeah oh nice so a Philly

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:10.360
comedy club the one with the the hookah

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.029
lounge upstairs so now we performed

00:16:13.029 --> 00:16:15.160
there yeah now it's owned by a patriot

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.730
oh man a second so the guy was sitting

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.980
there you know the owner looks exactly

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.330
what you would expect the guy who owns

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.760
it just like a big dude like big-ass

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.350
[ __ ] head beard and all that [ __ ]

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.390

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.579
has to be him of course that's him he

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:38.200
has to be he was the only gun-toting

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.970
dude there's no way there's another dude

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:41.680

the guy goes Trump 2020 and according to

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.770
the video the video discussing of a guy

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:19.330

the dude claims that he started reached

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.480
he saw him reaching for a shiny metal

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.300
object and it was a bike lock so the

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.010
girl who video this thing and you know

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:32.140

being like this is how people get you

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.710
whatever she was saying yeah it's just a

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:40.420
bike lock just adding chaos which is

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.530
what women do whenever there's an

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:44.290
incident they're just yelling she won't

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.970
do nothing but having chaos even though

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:47.020
it does sound like she was saying the

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.660
right thing well this is the part where

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.400
I'm again like you know nobody was there

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.950
the guy claims that the guy was like he

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:55.360
was like Trump 2020 he saw the guy

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.830
reaching to grab something which again a

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.090
lot of times people on bikes will grab

00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:59.470
bike locks and try to like weaponize

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:02.290
them and swing them around so he claims

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.150
the dude grab bike lock he sees a black

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.730
shiny metal object he's equipped pulls

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.710
it out neutralizes the situation he's

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.780
like dude chill the [ __ ] out and then

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.460
everyone freaks that apparently they're

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.380
like they claim that people form like a

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.880
shield around this man I saw the video

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.290

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:23.350
like get the [ __ ] out of here

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:26.020
but she was yelling it's he just has a

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:29.170
bike lock so I don't know if he pulled

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:30.460

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.510
though it's like a bicycle messenger but

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.070
it had to be a black door yeah there's a

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.360
regular bike dude it's not gonna be like

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.950
you guys are not socially distant

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:43.870
exactly this is this is what it sounds

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:45.670
like a black dork it's its bicycle

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:48.430
messengers so bicycle messenger is like

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:50.920
a very physical black door and they they

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.540
make white bicycle messengers who are

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.610
also an equal level of like politically

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:55.420
annoying

was it was did they do heroin just doing

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:19.850
heroin make you become a bike messenger

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:21.800
a little chicken and the egg type thing

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.780
trail do you have to become like a

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:27.860

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.530
GrubHub it's like the Anna it's like the

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:32.480
choice profession of anarchist to like

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.860
ride a bicycle a day and just like

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.320

Justine just be the an absolute cog just

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.700
like and then like if you're like a

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.050
[ __ ] obviously if you come across a

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:46.820
fascist you're like less you off you

got cut off by several fascists in North

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:53.600
Philly on the way down here did you

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.460

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.040
I realize how many fashions lift up in

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.740
North Philly you see that fascists that

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.090
hit those two ladies at the black lives

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:05.390
matter protest Oh right-wing fascism

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.150
yeah well this is this is the whole

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:09.680
point of the [ __ ] oh sorry

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.390
no it's the same thing a patriot that

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:14.060
held its ground again fastest bike

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.730
messenger well the problem is it's like

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.710
so you go onto Twitter there's a video

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:19.880
of a guy just holding and going out of

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.500
black dude get the [ __ ] out of here

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.210
none of the stuff so like you the

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:25.730
decisive moment is who did someone draw

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:27.320
a bike lock first or the guy draw a

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.840
weapon first if because there's two

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.610
completely possible scenarios where the

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:33.440
guy was like mega privilege and the guy

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.540
just goes from 2020 in an absolutely

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.880
ridiculous response and then so there's

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.620
two scenarios where a guy went Trump

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:41.540
2020 and just pulled a gun out as he

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.910
said it was like what or the guy want

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:46.010
Trump 2020 in the dude the bike

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:47.210
messenger was like [ __ ] you and grabbed

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:49.340
his bike lock or maybe he was just lucky

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.990
I don't know you know I have no idea but

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:52.010
everyone there was like dude get the

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:53.450
[ __ ] out of here you're bothering us and

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:55.640
then it's like did the guy pulled a gun

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.990
but the whole point is everyone has

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:58.730
watches a 10-second video and they're

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:00.470
like oh there's a video the guy had a

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:01.820
gun pointing at a guy he's like this is

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.010
obviously this yeah it's like you know

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:06.950
that was all we stand with the our

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:09.270

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.920

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.960
man about today it's like you know it's

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.560
all fake

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.660
yeah or again you just get hit with so

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.120
many maybe they got all wise maybe the

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.340
guy snapped so maybe he did Trump 20/20

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.450
but there's been enough of these lives

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:29.310
from 20/20 just [ __ ] the same time

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:34.560
[ __ ] dude what do you think 2024 forever

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.760
trump forever so it was like did he say

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.830
it which is really funny scenario of a

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.660
guy that's being like Trump 2020 and

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.270
pulling out a gun when someone you know

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:46.500
whenever you ever those Trump

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.100
commemorative guns black it was a black

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:51.770
lock standard issue

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:54.180
this guy's not flashy he trains police

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.130
officers he claimed he Fox was the only

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.380
one who interviews no no it's like I'm

00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.760
the victim here it wasn't it was like

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.260
local Fox you like when they do like the

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.990
high school homeroom show Fox like what

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:05.490
happened he was like I'm the victim here

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:09.540
oh good point his lawyer dude came on

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.800
was just like he neutralized the

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.420
situation everything went away he's a

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:13.920
licensed gun owner I don't see the

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.440
problem with this so yeah the gunner or

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.940
the lawyer basically had the daliyah

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.580
argument pretty was like maybe you think

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.370
it's crazy but it's legal so [ __ ] let

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:24.060
him do his thing

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.400
well this is a problem again with I'm

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.160
sound like a broken record with the news

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.420
there's a guy who's minding his business

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.910
about his day he sees people sitting at

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.250
a thing and it's like you guys aren't

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:38.070
social distancing it's like dude if

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:39.150
you're worried about the spread of

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:41.550
disease get the [ __ ] out of there now

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:43.830
granted he did get a gun pulled on but

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.770
mm-hmm just hypothetical yeah say you

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:49.830
saw a couple African Americans yeah in

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:52.520
North Philly maybe hanging out whatever

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.720
just hanging out now let's but say

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.880
they're fascists from let's say these

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.530
particular fascists are in North Philly

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:00.600
sure and you approach them and we're

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.160
like you guys are not socially

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.680
distancing yeah how do you think they

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:08.190
perhaps now that this matters sure but

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:09.330
how do you think they might handle it

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:10.680
well here's the here's the million

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.780
dollar question who would care if there

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.070
if that happened is somebody pulled a

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:15.330

people who had been cancelled and lemare

00:25:38.899 --> 00:25:40.519

a black dude you literally have to

00:25:58.909 --> 00:26:05.179

look I'm not trying to be you know on

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.639
the bandwagon I've never [ __ ] with a

00:26:16.639 --> 00:26:19.309
Cosby Show I always thought it I was

00:26:19.309 --> 00:26:21.470
Arkell over Cosby all day every day true

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.029
herckel [ __ ] ruled Cosby

00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:24.710
people did rule I was too young for The

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:26.310
Cosby Show I never really gave

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:28.200
and then I thought is I never I've

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.940
literally have still never seen him do

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.100
stand-up ever it's just him being like

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.800
that's a good take I've never watched

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.630
Cosby to stand-up I watching like

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:40.050
Eclipse and I'm like you see the thing

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:42.000
yeah he does like I've seen uh-oh yeah

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.470
he did one where he just sat in a chair

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:46.500
I saw that yeah so I like that must have

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.060
been his most recent one but he's just

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.850
in like a living room on stage really

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:58.680
yeah house arrest Brady was watching The

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.300
Cosby Show and I got she buddy's is so

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.070
funny I watched him like [ __ ] socks

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:11.520
man and it was like these guys are

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.910
sexual predators he really you know

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:22.800
Larry do you still defend Cosby they

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.780
gotta release it do you still defend

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:32.610
Cosby what do you mean well we don't

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:34.200
have the Conn silences murder lemare

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.680
yeah silence is consent silence which is

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:42.510
also Cosby's motto that's that was easy

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:45.810
that's a hack one mmm nobody's [ __ ]

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.670
even said one thing about how sick my

i met did you notice the subtle

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.550
differences i noticed there's a line

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:57.930
right here there's just a little line

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:00.660
under this is this is the 2020

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.570

years old yeah it's good these are from

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.450
2012 usually around 2000 I think that

was the last time I had money it was

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:24.630

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:28.290
I'm breaking out new polos Amazon

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.680
was on out and buy anything he literally

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.600
didn't buy anything it's it's gamer

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.230
chairs

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.179
I still get hit with gaming chairs one

00:28:36.179 --> 00:28:38.760

gamer chairs which must confuse him a

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.370
little what do you mean not a lot of

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:53.830
gamer chair users are fans of college

is where I'm at as a man I'm playing

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.060
green skins very oculus and then I'm

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:56.130
sneaking into other rooms to steal steal

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:59.520

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:05.220
many you do like five per room I took

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.770
five tissues out of

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:08.660
at different rooms tissue boxes when I

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.240
realized I was the only one home and

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:13.400
stuck one in the top of my tissue box I

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.260
was like can't can't use the tissues

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.870
anymore oh that's where we're at

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:19.820

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.110
they have one with like two tissues in

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:22.490
another room then just take the whole

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:24.230
other box but maybe there's a different

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:26.270
pattern there is a pattern so then I was

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:28.820
thinking if I did that I was like

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.440
nobody's ever gonna remember the pattern

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.190
on this box but in the off chance sure

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.820
my mommy

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:36.830
remembers the pattern of the box she

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:38.740
knows that her son is now not only

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:45.050
ploughing through tissues but by that's

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:47.750
worse the conspiring part after plowing

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:50.060
through the tissues is worse sure yeah I

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:51.530
can't get caught doing but if your mom

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:54.760
Christ I feel like I might have a

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:56.410
[ __ ] heart I think I think you're

00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:58.060
self diagnosing - come on the heart

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.220
attack thing on the heart palpitations

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.560
it happens during whenever I did no FAP

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.180

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.470
work out I was dude like ten push-ups

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:07.990
and Jesus like I feel I have too much

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:10.120
energy I need to get it out I think it's

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.400
like with breast feeding the more and

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.840
like as much as you're taking out your

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.670
body sending signals like oh this is how

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:17.080
much milk we're putting out so we need

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.580
to make this much milk I think come

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.290
works the same way if you're coming a

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:21.340
lot your body's like we need to make a

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:22.510
lot of calm and your body starts making

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:24.190
a ton yeah so I probably have come

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:25.960
that's coming out of me from like mm

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:29.650

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:32.040
like you're seeing come that it was from

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.750
time you see it by the time it reaches

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:39.700

fully left my male body and was in habit

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.900

yeah man which I love my favorite thing

00:48:56.810 --> 00:48:58.810
about the DeSean Jackson quote is like

00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:01.670
white Americans are gonna be beside

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:03.020
themselves when they find out they've

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:05.840
been lynching and hurting the true

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.760
children of Israel true it's like do you

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:09.710
think the people committing lynchings

00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:12.020
are gonna be like holy [ __ ] these guys

00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:18.590

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:20.480
like holy [ __ ] this is great

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:23.390
true yeah that's uh I saw that that was

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:25.940
a clip I think the rest of the book was

00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:27.470
scribbled out too and it was just

00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:29.030
highlighted yeah it's a classic one

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:31.340
where someone someone there's like a

00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:33.890
quote saying like we were gonna use up

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:37.130
America spit it out and then you know oh

00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:39.620
by the way O'Connor was quick to point

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:41.990
out that was exactly what the cook in

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:45.350
st. Louis was saying about Hitler while

00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:46.310
I was onstage

00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:49.100
he was quoting the Hitler was right

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:52.340
about the Jews in America basically the

00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:55.460
black Israelite version of that yeah

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:58.400
being like the Jews or I forgot the [ __ ]

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:01.280
it is but that's no good basically yeah

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.720
he was saying the Jews who drops no good

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:05.680
and the real Jews or the DeSean Jackson

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:08.330
is he really a black Israelite I think

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:10.010
he's just he's tossing [ __ ] like that

00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:10.370
right

00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:13.730
yeah he's davon Farrakhan does not like

00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:20.530
Jewish who the term oats country's out

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:23.330
because Jews termites where that's also

00:50:23.330 --> 00:50:25.040
funny for a guy like Farrakhan is be

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.660
going and doing his thing researching

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:27.950
and like someone shows him YouTube and

00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:31.030
he's like behold troves of information

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:33.880
the Anunnaki

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:37.190
the library of Baghdad is here it is a

00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:38.020
bonus

00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:41.470
what is this YouTube

00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:44.780
quick give me a microphone jouza

00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:49.280
termites my brother DeSean Jackson's

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:50.810
just running a [ __ ] yeah ever watch

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:53.510
like he'll don't give talks for you what

00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:54.859
you got to sees a fantastic speaker

00:50:54.859 --> 00:50:58.400
you've told me very well you've been as

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.190
staying a fair watch fan Farrakhan on

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:03.170
Donahue in the 90s was one it's one of

00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:04.520
the funniest it's on YouTube it's one of

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:05.960
the funniest moments of TV he gets back

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:07.940
then looks like white people felt

00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:09.619
perfectly comfortable being like go back

00:51:09.619 --> 00:51:14.540
to Africa you like this country go back

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:16.790
like just yes in the crowd and like it's

00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:18.230
just Farrakhan and all of his acolytes

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:19.490
and like the [ __ ] and the bean pies

00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:21.230
make us out they stand up and there's

00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:24.079
like relax they don't know what yeah

00:51:24.079 --> 00:51:27.109
dude but he [ __ ] he slams the lady at

00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:29.810
the end of it he he slams doesn't even

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:31.430
it's not even that bad but he crushes

00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:32.839
this Jewish this lady's like I'm Jewish

00:51:32.839 --> 00:51:34.760
and you see him he's he's sitting

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:36.140
cross-legged up in the stage he's like

00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:42.020
I'm glad you brought that up this was

00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:45.079
before YouTube - this is before it yeah

00:51:45.079 --> 00:51:47.480
Hanging Gardens Babylon but he was also

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:51.140
he was reeling to uh you know Islam - so

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:53.630
you get some og black Islam you know

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:55.369
probably ramped it up the Jay talk

00:51:55.369 --> 00:51:56.540
pretty hard I'm pretty sure they're not

00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:57.920
in there be like the whites this they're

00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:00.940
doing this and they're like Jews a chill

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:03.950
no Jews are the frauds dude

00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:06.859
according to did they're the Lost Tribe

00:52:06.859 --> 00:52:08.839
although actually shouldn't that make

00:52:08.839 --> 00:52:11.450
them like the other Jews they just I

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:12.500
thought the black Israelites just

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.750
thought that they were a Lost Tribe of

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:18.050
Israel so those were also other the

00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:20.329
white Jews are just other tribes

00:52:20.329 --> 00:52:24.890
I think non-descendants of Noah this

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:26.270
gets like when you talk about you know

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:27.800
Japheth and all those dudes you're like

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:30.470
yeah half the Ark it's off we need to

00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:32.599
really get into black Israelites we

00:52:32.599 --> 00:52:34.880
should we should get one on I believe

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.550
we've discussed this yeah a while ago

00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:40.400
yeah we'd still like to show my kids

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.660
what it would be the best one for a

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:42.740
while we were trying to get that one

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:45.500
preacher you know one white [ __ ] the

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:48.050
God hates [ __ ] guy alright then we

00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:49.099
realize that probably wasn't the best

00:52:49.099 --> 00:52:50.540
look they're probably to fall pretty

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:51.050
quickly

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:53.260
yeah

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:55.590
like actually that's a pretty sweet idea

00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:58.890
dude true I do think you should sit down

00:52:58.890 --> 00:53:00.359
with your parents is jumping back but I

00:53:00.359 --> 00:53:02.849
think you should have we should start

00:53:02.849 --> 00:53:03.750
doing a thing in families

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:06.090

like you know bringing see dreams some

00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:46.250
battering rams to the [ __ ] dwarf

armies I got crushed by the dwarves did

00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:51.290

and skeleton warriors doesn't that [ __ ]

00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:57.710
you up when you're sitting there playing

00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:59.360
against like just a complete nonentity

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:01.970
that's just yeah when I was a kid I

00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:04.130
could handle that yeah very easily and

00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:06.500
just be like used my imagination be like

00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:07.700
oh cool like even when I'm playing like

00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:10.880
if I play like nco boy by myself I play

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:12.560
a football game by myself against the

00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:15.320
computer it's a little like I'm just

00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:17.240
figuring out the algorithm to beat it

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:19.940
yeah it's not like you know I get I get

00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:21.050
it like that was what happened to me I

00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:22.340
would go down in the morning when we

00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:23.810
lived on Mount Vernon Street objects I'm

00:56:23.810 --> 00:56:25.070
gonna practice Matt and I play against

00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:27.500
the computer I'd lose I'd be sad that I

00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:29.270
lost and then it'd be doubly sad that I

00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:31.100
lost to like it's just a machine that

00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:33.770
was on a desk yeah exactly a server

00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:35.750
somewhere responded to all my moves

00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:38.180
you know what the [ __ ] I felt like a you

00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:39.410
see when you they could watch a cat like

00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:41.180
with a laser pointer yeah it feels like

00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:42.590
I feel like it's like extremely

00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:43.790
pointless and I play against the

00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:45.760
computer yeah it's weird

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.530
till it's been till it's been acting up

00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:49.280
dude really

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:52.460
yeah he's he's he's been killing birds

00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:55.040
often too often he goes outside and then

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.540
there's there were NASA's under the deck

00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:58.400
there's a bunch of nasty who keeps

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.380
getting birds they scratched the

00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:02.510
neighbor the lady came out to pet him

00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:04.370
and he scratched her any rain Wow he's

00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:07.520
an outdoor he's good last night fell to

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:10.070
put flea medicine arm that was pretty

00:57:10.070 --> 00:57:12.050
fun we're just having fun at the Gillis

00:57:12.050 --> 00:57:13.790
house then timber was running from him

00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:15.650
and he felt bad you tell Phil felt bad

00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:18.540
come here tips come here he like

00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:20.460
he pretends he doesn't sure but when he

00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:23.400
did him wrong last night he put flea

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:25.050
medicine I guess it burns to old skin or

00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:26.520
something really which is funny to watch

00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:28.079
a cat like if you ever see a cat like

00:57:28.079 --> 00:57:28.710
get hurt

00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:31.530
it's very they're very weird like

00:57:31.530 --> 00:57:32.790
especially cuz you put it on the back of

00:57:32.790 --> 00:57:40.290
his neck where you can like it fall

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:42.210
sometimes anyway well you got these your

00:57:42.210 --> 00:57:42.599
notes

00:57:42.599 --> 00:57:44.520
yeah there's making me laugh earlier Joe

00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:52.619
Biden weed I'm sorry sorry - [ __ ] yeah

00:57:52.619 --> 00:57:54.720
it's just in case we ever hit a snag

00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:56.579
which is what we just did here talk

00:57:56.579 --> 00:57:58.800
about putting flea medicine I had to

00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:00.470
look around I was a guy Joe Biden we'd

00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:05.310
go ahead pass the ball well I read it I

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:08.700
was reading an article about basically

00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:09.810
someone they were kind of pressing Joe

00:58:09.810 --> 00:58:12.030
Biden on where he stands on legalizing

00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:14.190
marijuana yeah and there everyone's like

00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:15.180
dude what are you doing it's the

00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:16.800
political slam dunk the whole country

00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.210
there's even Republicans a big [ __ ] yet

00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:19.589
yeah so for some reason there's this

00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:22.680
move that if you run the polls will play

00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:24.119
out well no matter who does it for like

00:58:24.119 --> 00:58:26.310
you know [ __ ] it total legalization and

00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:29.550
these geezers won't do it and Biden came

00:58:29.550 --> 00:58:31.950
out was like he's like I need the

00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:34.170
medical research to state that it's safe

00:58:34.170 --> 00:58:36.119
but there's tons of fun research

00:58:36.119 --> 00:58:37.349
sometimes the [ __ ] research that you

00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:38.970
know comes out and says it's fine and it

00:58:38.970 --> 00:58:40.770
since it's scheduled one it's hard to

00:58:40.770 --> 00:58:42.300
even research it properly you know what

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:43.680
I mean but again they're setting that up

00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:46.170
now and all that stuff but so to me it's

00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:48.270
it's a it's just being like it's just a

00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:49.650
racket it's like if you and all your

00:58:49.650 --> 00:58:51.300
boys could only sell weed do two

00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:52.950
licenses in this [ __ ] you're not [ __ ]

00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:54.810
legalizing it because in Pennsylvania

00:58:54.810 --> 00:58:59.160
you need $250,000 just to apply to get a

00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:00.720
permit to grow and sell weed to a

00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:02.339
dispensary really you need a quarter

00:59:02.339 --> 00:59:03.720
million dollars and then you need to be

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:05.490
able on top of like a quarter million of

00:59:05.490 --> 00:59:06.900
that you have to be able to you know

00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:08.339
obviously buy a greenhouse you can't you

00:59:08.339 --> 00:59:11.069
can't look is it because it's it's it's

00:59:11.069 --> 00:59:13.260
a car it's like a an income cartel where

00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:14.609
it's like this is how instead of all

00:59:14.609 --> 00:59:16.380
right we'll stop locking people up for

00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:18.569
it now we'll just own it and dominate it

00:59:18.569 --> 00:59:21.599
being like you you being we having weeds

00:59:21.599 --> 00:59:23.339
illegal but if you're rich you're

00:59:23.339 --> 00:59:25.440
allowed to grow it and make millions of

00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:27.240
dollars off of it but if you're not rich

00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.760
you're a criminal and it's like yeah and

00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:31.079
the other thing too is you can only grow

00:59:31.079 --> 00:59:31.800
it in green

00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:34.350
skin green skin you can't grow it's a

00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:36.030
[ __ ] so and this is dude I'm

00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:37.650
surprised nobody [ __ ] in harps on

00:59:37.650 --> 00:59:38.880
this with all like that marks this [ __ ]

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:41.070
it's like it's an order to legally grow

00:59:41.070 --> 00:59:42.720
weed you if you're if you have enough

00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:44.010
money you can legally grow weed and not

00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:45.300
only not get in trouble for it but make

00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:46.530
millions of dollars off of it like so

00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:48.200
much money

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:50.250
spud painted for one of these dudes who

00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:51.570
was like how to dispensary and said it

00:59:51.570 --> 00:59:53.250
was actually a burden the amount of cash

00:59:53.250 --> 00:59:55.050
cuz they're not a lot of put in banks so

00:59:55.050 --> 00:59:56.460
there there's all day long driving

00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:58.020
Brinks trucks and trying to dump cash

00:59:58.020 --> 00:59:59.280
places and figure out where to put it

00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.680
Bob a lot to him so much money so

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:03.360
instead of having like in Philly

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.250
dispensaries were out of weed like for a

01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:07.680
while during this like you know last

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.320
season so instead of doing that you

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.330
could just have it has to all be grown

01:00:12.330 --> 01:00:13.730
indoors too so you need this big

01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:16.170
decision all this energy but in reality

01:00:16.170 --> 01:00:17.490
you can just [ __ ] grow weed outside

01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:19.380
so you can plant it in the [ __ ]

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:21.600
ground so my proposal it would be the

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.770
people that you let people do micro

01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:24.930
permits we're like individuals can apply

01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:26.640
for like a 20 plant plot where it's like

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.110
the dispensaries now have like you know

01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:29.610
hundreds of brands you just kind of you

01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:31.260
have your little plot that way now like

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.910
everyone can grow the weed everyone can

01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:34.890
buy weed grow weed sell it to dispensary

01:00:34.890 --> 01:00:36.270
everyone gets that money rather than one

01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:37.950
company who grows weed in a [ __ ]

01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:39.210
warehouse and just use it all that

01:00:39.210 --> 01:00:41.340
energy but Biden's a [ __ ] [ __ ] dude

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:42.930
everyone there's hildog did the same

01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:45.300
thing what said no to legalizing weed

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:47.070
saying they're saying I need to see the

01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:48.630
medical research it's like dude are you

01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:50.010
but they're like what about alcohol and

01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:52.230
you know tobacco they're like well

01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:53.400
alcohol has been a part of our country

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.000
yeah dude it's 400 years but that's a

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.680
thing man with the by dog I mean again

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.810
if he but he said he's going to knock it

01:01:00.810 --> 01:01:02.940
down from schedule one yeah take it down

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:05.310
so it's like this is the [ __ ] that

01:01:05.310 --> 01:01:06.750
I'm telling you watch this and you just

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:08.970
can't win they live the Democrats

01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:11.670
literally cannot win yeah they they it

01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:14.640
is it is impossible for them to win what

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.320
you think this election well I mean just

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:18.870
they should win yeah and then it's

01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:20.460
almost like they're trying not to [ __ ]

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.320
it up yeah and they're gonna you know

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:25.320
why the [ __ ] Biden's like I need to see

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.520
their medical read it's like dude you

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:27.720
can hardly talk dude you're talking

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:28.950
you're telling you you want to look down

01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:31.530
anyway take a look at some [ __ ]

01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:35.340
graphs yo speaking of graphs what I've

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:37.350
been I've been struggling with this new

01:01:37.350 --> 01:01:39.690
kovin outbreak what are you thinking

01:01:39.690 --> 01:01:39.930
about

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:43.050
I don't well cuz I have shows coming up

01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:45.780
in Ohio and California and I know I'm

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:47.339
gonna get [ __ ] for it if I do this shows

01:01:47.339 --> 01:01:49.109
yeah and chances are I'll probably get

01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:50.820
kovat miss Pat's doing and then look

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:53.579
like a dumbass yeah if you were like a

01:01:53.579 --> 01:01:55.170
podcaster that said it wasn't that real

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:58.770
and they got challenged you think they

01:01:58.770 --> 01:02:01.079
claimed Kovac they were coming under

01:02:01.079 --> 01:02:02.460
heat they might have been like Ovid

01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:06.210
timeout go vid true you think they're

01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:08.400
faking I think that I think they I think

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.349
they cried and they're like [ __ ]

01:02:10.349 --> 01:02:12.180
they're like kovat if you're like [ __ ]

01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:17.670
like Fox both we're like I don't let's

01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:19.950
say yeah I have nothing to say about

01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:21.750
this it's like okay so I think they just

01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:23.579
were like all right phase two co vid

01:02:23.579 --> 01:02:26.640
yeah we have kovat you [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.349
um I don't know I am worried about

01:02:28.349 --> 01:02:29.940
getting covet after definitely there's

01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:31.890
got to be a hundred clips of me being

01:02:31.890 --> 01:02:34.140
like I it's fake the Democrats made it

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:37.650
up yeah so I hope I don't get if I get

01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:39.720
it I'm just not gonna tell anyone if I

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:42.630
get it on you'll see if like in August

01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:45.420
I'm just off for a week mm-hmm or two

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:47.190
weeks it's kim jeong-hoon this I'm

01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:48.630
absolutely gonna be like no I was

01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:52.859
actually in a temple with 30 who's that

01:02:52.859 --> 01:02:55.470
guy from like Laos Vietnam or something

01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:57.000
Thailand I think you should just fake

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.829
Cove it and is like control the York

01:02:58.829 --> 01:03:03.060
Center and help me if I I was younger I

01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:05.550
would fantasize about getting sick so

01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:07.140
that's all I can do is play what do you

01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:08.700
mean what do I do when I get dumped on

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:10.740
the exact same stuff there's no

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:12.510
adjustment I just feel bad while I'm

01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:18.300
playing with the orcs so what do you

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.250
thing about the grass numbers Wow well

01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:22.079
also what's what's interesting about is

01:03:22.079 --> 01:03:23.400
it's really hard to find the amount of

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.010
tests we're doing yeah daily like a

01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:27.839
graph of that cuz the everybody's very

01:03:27.839 --> 01:03:29.670
eager to show you the graphs of new

01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:32.280
cases yeah not new deaths I'll never

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:33.660
show you the current deaths cuz that's

01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:36.030
just straight down yeah drop it drops

01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:38.130
but it's like that on the way down yeah

01:03:38.130 --> 01:03:40.619
new cases is [ __ ] straight up right

01:03:40.619 --> 01:03:43.050
now and it's really hard to find number

01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:45.210
of tests not really hard but there's no

01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:47.460
snow graph yeah it's not hard it took

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:49.589
like [ __ ] three minutes to find an

01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:52.349
actual listing of per day tests that the

01:03:52.349 --> 01:03:55.760
United States is reporting and in April

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.260
we were at like you know the height of

01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:01.070
this thing for the most part the we were

01:04:01.070 --> 01:04:03.230
testing like at most two hundred

01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:06.500
thousand a day at most now pretty much

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.270
every single day we're at least it's six

01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:11.240
hundred thousand tests okay so obviously

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:14.560
the new cases are gonna go up right and

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:17.270
obviously and now the deaths are

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:18.800
dropping like crazy I mean the mortality

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.560
rate of it is nothing now yeah because

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:23.390
now it's just 21-year olds that are

01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:25.400
getting it yeah like in Florida the

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:26.870
average age of the person getting it is

01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:28.490
twenty one that's what they started

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:29.840
saying like it's infecting young people

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.670
well they're infecting it yeah they're

01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:33.290
getting it but nothing's happening to

01:04:33.290 --> 01:04:35.510
them yeah my cousin had anyway my cousin

01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:38.300
had it was like but the I mean obviously

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:40.730
it's real sure obviously the geezers got

01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:44.120
[ __ ] they got rampaged by it dude

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.530
[ __ ] up that Cova just got the geezers

01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:49.580
but there should be you're like you were

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:50.510
saying though if you do want to

01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:53.540
eradicate racism yeah release the kovat

01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:55.940
they should have had a graph of racism

01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:57.770
in the United States yeah you would just

01:04:57.770 --> 01:05:03.950
see in April would just be like everyone

01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:05.030
was protesting and that you know

01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:06.650
falchion all those guys like more racism

01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:07.940
is a serious public health concern it's

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:11.740
alright dude I'm gonna take the math

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:15.800
yeah yeah true you see Trump signs just

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:24.140
fade from well it California home signs

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:27.560
dude what I was over at the house at the

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.540
compound on this week heavy with Trump

01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:32.240
science dude we'll save that for the

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.950
page I will save compound talk for the

01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:34.340
page

01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:36.250
well do the California just like

01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:39.590
actually yeah I'll say I'm the Kovach

01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:41.090
thing this is actually kind of funny

01:05:41.090 --> 01:05:43.040
they were like California's at record

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.780
highs California had what did they say

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:46.790
it was like 14,000 new cases this day

01:05:46.790 --> 01:05:49.150
and like California this state was like

01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:51.620
nobody don't that that's an error you

01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:53.450
guys are just like we had those are we

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:54.740
had those tests and like you guys didn't

01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:56.060
count them then you just like a lump two

01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:58.430
days worth together so that's wrong and

01:05:58.430 --> 01:06:00.500
the newspaper just like whatever [ __ ]

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:01.100
you guys

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:03.080
yeah dude it's [ __ ] crazy the state

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.150
of California was actually newspaper

01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:06.500
yeah don't say that as the state of

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:07.910
California we're saying that's not the

01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:09.619
case but now it's also like dude

01:06:09.619 --> 01:06:10.970
Oh think about you know the president

01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:13.999
now the election is all going to be

01:06:13.999 --> 01:06:15.559
determined about this Kovich it however

01:06:15.559 --> 01:06:17.779
plays out you know hover people can make

01:06:17.779 --> 01:06:19.490
it seem like they stopped it or whatever

01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:21.289
it's [ __ ] [ __ ] think about all

01:06:21.289 --> 01:06:22.579
the government like the gubernatorial

01:06:22.579 --> 01:06:24.890
races and all those things all the local

01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:25.970
elections now we're gonna come like if

01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:27.109
you're like a state that got [ __ ] by

01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:28.549
it now you look like a [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:31.579
and it's just a bunch of [ __ ] people

01:06:31.579 --> 01:06:33.380
who are basically student council people

01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:34.970
just walking around jerking themselves

01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:36.710
off them yeah

01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:37.880
how who can we blame this on okay

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.410
perfect yes none of them are [ __ ]

01:06:39.410 --> 01:06:40.940
experts in anything other than just like

01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:42.799
going to people's door then hi mr.

01:06:42.799 --> 01:06:44.089
Williamson let me tell you what my plan

01:06:44.089 --> 01:06:44.839
about Lulu

01:06:44.839 --> 01:06:46.999
yeah the none of my experts on [ __ ] and

01:06:46.999 --> 01:06:49.640
they're literally basing their science

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:52.190
on a party-line exactly it's like

01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:54.740
obviously these people are not they all

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:57.319
of them agree and if your right wing

01:06:57.319 --> 01:06:58.339
you're like well the masks

01:06:58.339 --> 01:06:59.839
scientifically have been proven don't do

01:06:59.839 --> 01:07:04.849
anything it's like [ __ ] you just wear

01:07:04.849 --> 01:07:07.519
them I mean I don't worry

01:07:07.519 --> 01:07:10.940
I don't worry I do feel like a yeah I

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:12.829
wear them every single time if I if I'm

01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:14.569
if I'm going into like a gas it yeah you

01:07:14.569 --> 01:07:15.890
gotta wear the mask Oh as you look like

01:07:15.890 --> 01:07:18.170
an idiot yeah that's the thing I I was

01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:19.880
holding it down tough for a while and

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:22.239
then they've mandated it and I was like

01:07:22.239 --> 01:07:24.769
yeah that was also in the shoot the food

01:07:24.769 --> 01:07:26.329
got weird man I was going in the food

01:07:26.329 --> 01:07:27.829
store and like I'd have to order food

01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:29.539
online and it was like you'd have to

01:07:29.539 --> 01:07:31.190
order like two weeks out you guys had

01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:32.720
such a different experience than me oh

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.819
my god the city living during Kovan must

01:07:34.819 --> 01:07:37.910
have been pretty gay it was like yeah so

01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:39.980
I'd have to like just start a cart two

01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:41.029
weeks out because that would the only

01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:42.829
available food thing would be two weeks

01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:44.059
so I would just start a carton for like

01:07:44.059 --> 01:07:45.559
two days and just wait and then as it

01:07:45.559 --> 01:07:48.049

accused by multiple women yeah of being

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:10.259
a sex pest and then one of the guys who

01:09:10.259 --> 01:09:12.630
like tried to defend him was like yes

01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:15.420
Seth gets the pest gets a little handsy

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:18.239
when he's drinking he's no Chris D'Elia

01:09:18.239 --> 01:09:20.730
though is what literally one of his like

01:09:20.730 --> 01:09:23.940
improv people rapists a sex pest yeah

01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:25.799
he's a sex pest well I think a lot of

01:09:25.799 --> 01:09:27.630
people are more rapists but that's what

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:29.790
happens and it's funny to read his like

01:09:29.790 --> 01:09:32.400
his statement or Apollo his his

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:34.500
victim-blaming for paragraph

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:36.120
victim-blaming that he put out which is

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:40.100
outrageous by his standards by mine sick

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:43.529
nice love a good love a good non-apology

01:09:43.529 --> 01:09:47.279
good job for sure I think he has like

01:09:47.279 --> 01:09:49.380
canceled ematic immunity where it's like

01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:50.759
if you're just if you are on the right

01:09:50.759 --> 01:09:53.130
side of politics people like these girls

01:09:53.130 --> 01:09:54.390
say you're doing this it's the same

01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:55.290
thing happened with Clinton Clinton

01:09:55.290 --> 01:09:56.580
Clinton we had like hard rape

01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:58.290
allegations and they were like look

01:09:58.290 --> 01:10:04.560
politics get dirty sometimes yeah

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:07.199
blogging sometimes you gotta yeah but he

01:10:07.199 --> 01:10:09.570
he just said that he's like the [ __ ]

01:10:09.570 --> 01:10:11.489
line I'm gonna go back to writing about

01:10:11.489 --> 01:10:15.630
other dudes comedy yeah also nobody

01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:17.219
there's nothing to cancel it's like

01:10:17.219 --> 01:10:19.080
there's nothing canceled there's he's

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:22.230
he's [ __ ] irrelevant but and I would

01:10:22.230 --> 01:10:24.300
never do that to anybody else like point

01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:26.219
that out and be like oh you're in

01:10:26.219 --> 01:10:27.929
trouble well there's a couple of those

01:10:27.929 --> 01:10:30.090
[ __ ] that used it it's funny to use

01:10:30.090 --> 01:10:31.180
it against them

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:34.060
obviously the thing is is like looking

01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:35.800
at it seeing an accusation like that

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.130
which I don't know I assume I have no

01:10:39.130 --> 01:10:41.620
idea if what she's even saying who she

01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.780
is I don't know is it like someone who's

01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:45.520
like yo come on can we please fall can

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:46.330
we please talk

01:10:46.330 --> 01:10:48.310
yes that's like what it is little mama I

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:50.830
think the sex past was definitely like

01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:53.020
what it is and they're like it ain't and

01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:54.850
he was like you sure it ain't sure you

01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:56.590
might and he just kept being like are

01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:58.120
you sure it ain't the problem that's

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:01.120
problem is he's he's 5'4 and kind of a

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:03.250
little [ __ ] yeah so him being called a

01:11:03.250 --> 01:11:05.050
sex fest it's probably just anybody else

01:11:05.050 --> 01:11:07.480
flirting yeah but if you're that ugly

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.850
and short and big of a [ __ ] if you like

01:11:09.850 --> 01:11:13.930
hit on a girl they're like you yeah yeah

01:11:13.930 --> 01:11:16.600
yeah so maybe he's just a lovefool we

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.340
also probably could have been getting

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:20.400
like drunk and it's been like definitely

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.990
singing weird [ __ ] to them yeah you'd

01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:26.640
get drunk that I actually love you

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:30.070
to sleep with you one night would be

01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:32.860
glorious yeah listeners but I've heard

01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:34.840
so much poems that are like if you

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:37.270
laughed at one joke of mine if you saw

01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:40.180
me the way I see you like [ __ ] like that

01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:44.110
sounds like hero if you laugh so yeah he

01:11:44.110 --> 01:11:46.270
got caught pest and anybody else I'd say

01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:48.550
they're innocent by his standards that

01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:50.050
he holds other people to he's guilty

01:11:50.050 --> 01:11:51.940
yeah pretty much that's that's all it is

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:54.190
by anybody else's standards I doubt he's

01:11:54.190 --> 01:11:56.020
done anything illegal by his standards

01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:58.810
he's committed a terrible offense hold

01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:00.280
him to his standards dude it also goes

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:01.810
to show you I mean maybe this is because

01:12:01.810 --> 01:12:03.160
like the reach of certain things but

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:05.230
it's like you know if that had been I

01:12:05.230 --> 01:12:07.060
don't know say well Johnny Depp's in

01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:08.470
court right now he's suing somebody but

01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:12.070
say that was like Vince Vaughn he's a

01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:16.960
[ __ ] spaz but yeah the they try to

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.910
get one of the Affleck's I think the

01:12:18.910 --> 01:12:20.920
Affleck was like basically suck my dick

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.320
