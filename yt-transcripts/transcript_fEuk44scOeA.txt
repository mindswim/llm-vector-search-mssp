he was a [ __ ] man i talked to his uh

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.640
some i forget who it is i don't know if

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.080
it's like a sister or cousin

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.360
she was saying he's been battling the

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.920
ppa for a while so he came out and was

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.720
like

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.840
he's like where's the money going

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.200

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.760
he was like

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.080
he got them audited and there he turns

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.440
out they weren't giving like any money

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.720
to the school and there's 80 million

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.159
dollars missing

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.400
and they were just like uh okay yeah our

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.159
bad we clearly have some issues here

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:59.120
what the philadelphia parking park

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.200
authority's trying to do now is add

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.519
a 50 cent per ride on rideshare they're

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.200
getting paid off by ride shares to exist

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.560
because the

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.799
uh they own all the taxi medallions in

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.040
philly and like the tax medallions tanks

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.560
rideshare is the future so the parking

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.959
authority just the [ __ ] bureaucratic

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.440
slug that it is is kind of like

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.000

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.600
against our lawyers and lost

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.040
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.280
to add a 50 cent tax to every single

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.639
ride in the city limits

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.720
and that'll go to us which we'll pay to

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.080
the school that's all right just

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.199

and you're hoping it gets sucked but it

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:14.160
might just get yanked well i'm sure what

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.280
i'm calling for is an open source

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.080
investigation

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:16.960
that's the way that you're getting a

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.360
[ __ ] glory hole hand job yeah it'd be

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.039
awesome that'd be a real letdown no way

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:23.759
glory hole hand job that would suck how

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:24.880
you're like you stick your dick in a

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.599
hole like yes

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:26.960
and someone jerks it off someone's gonna

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.039
suck my dick i'm gonna [ __ ] a lady

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:30.560
oh something nice there's gonna be

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.080
something nice on the other end

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.720
said you get some hand job yeah i guess

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.160
okay i see what you're saying so i guess

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.039
if you're in a glory hole

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:39.280
i think you start banging it like hey

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.319
that means you're gonna nut

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:41.759
don't jerk my dog you knock when you're

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:43.360
gonna nut

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.199
yeah you could always pull it out and

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:46.800
say hey

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.240
when's the shift change so i don't want

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.520
to get someone else i don't think you

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.800
got a lot of hand jobs going

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.800
also though i mean i'm saying if you

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.919
stick your dick in the glory hole you're

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:55.120
not going to get a disappointing hand

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.080
job

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.599
true the person on the other or they

00:07:57.599 --> 00:07:58.639
could be half accident because there

00:07:58.639 --> 00:07:59.680
could be another hole that they're

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.479
focused on

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:02.000
that could be the hand job that could be

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.919
the [ __ ] [ __ ] you would see a dude

00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:05.120
right next to you this dick against the

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.440
wall

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.240
no it's a cube you could be on the other

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:08.639
side

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:09.919
so you got to secure the perimeter of a

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:11.280
glory hole you have to secure the

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.960
perimeter because otherwise that person

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.400
could be getting [ __ ]

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.879
oh there's maybe you could be or he well

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:18.720
obviously obviously most likely he

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.319
but if they said like hey i'm giving you

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:21.520
a shitty hand job because i'm getting

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.639
[ __ ] on the other side

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:24.160
i'd get into it there's no words in a

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.000
glory hole cheer you to speak stick your

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.800
fingers through

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.400
put your dick hole through you put your

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.680
dick through you stick your fingers

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.560
through to check it

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.840
and then someone sucks your fingers your

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.039
guy said all right there's a mouth over

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.320

just like

00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:38.839
excuse me ma'am you gotta shave your

00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:41.039
mustache yeah yeah that you gotta

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:42.080
definitely secure the perimeter of a

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:42.719
glory hole

00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:43.919
i should have announced that i'm sorry

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.000
yeah because that's like you're right

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.680
if someone's double timing although if

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.040
someone's like hey excuse the shitty

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.240
hand job

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.959
i'm getting [ __ ] currently i might be

00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:54.720
like okay

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.480
that's welcome there's no talking news

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.480
there's no talking that's welcome news

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.320
communicating in ways that you cannot

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.839
truly glory the whole world

true in a active [ __ ] protest yeah

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.760
but then you gotta slide it back in and

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.440

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.320
exhilarating and just the guaranteed

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.839
aids or whatever you're getting out of

00:09:55.839 --> 00:09:57.440

taiwan has some good ones too but they

00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:04.240
have there's like a bunch of things like

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:04.800
it

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.959
taiwanese people playing video games if

00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:08.800
you just yell like china's number one

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.720
they go nuts really yeah you can find if

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.320
you could type in china's number one on

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.000
youtube with like

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.240
three china taiwan number one yeah what

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.279

00:13:21.279 --> 00:13:23.680
china like it wasn't no was it taiwan

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.760
that was like a slave colony for china

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.440
one of them was i forget hong kong was

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.720
that was imperial i was british the

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.800
whole hubbub there is yeah

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.279
so in 18 like during the 1850s

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:39.600
i think the 1850s was the opium wars

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.680
yeah and uh

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.880
we broke them off england controls hong

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.920
kong and they had a

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.160
they had a century so england dropped

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.519
treaty they dropped kratom

00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:51.440
on china and hong kong hong kong got

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.120
some kratom and they're like oh kratom

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:53.360
is

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.920
[ __ ]

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.519
and uh so yeah england controlled hong

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:00.079
kong

00:14:00.079 --> 00:14:02.800
until 1997 that's when the treaty ended

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.279
okay

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:06.480
in 1997 old thatch dog went over there

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.040
thatcher

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.320
yup talked to the chinese they chatted

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.360
and they agreed that to go from

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.079
british control straight to chinese

00:14:16.079 --> 00:14:17.279
would be tough because that

00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:19.279
you lose all your rights yeah so like

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:21.440
hong kong hong kong has rights

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.519
sure they have like human rights freedom

00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:25.360
of speech things like that that allow us

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.480
such gems thank god exactly

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.680
has the constitution ever been more

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.120
important how many people do you think

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.800
have been shot from the china communist

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.760
party for saying

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.120
there's probably something like trying

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.480
to issue someone comes and snatches

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.839
no no no there's so many people

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:43.839
just some dude in a bar just like i have

00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:45.839
something to tell you

00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:50.560
we have a resistance china is hope

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.560
immediately a spotlight whole family

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.480
wiped off the map dude a lot of people

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.360
have died for china's

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.040
cry [ __ ] that's yeah dude that's

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.639
modern day william wallace yeah he is

00:15:00.639 --> 00:15:02.000
dude he's on a horse there's two

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.760
there's two chinese it's two hong kong

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.120
dudes like

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.199
the chinese are too many we must go home

00:15:07.199 --> 00:15:10.399
he's like china is

00:15:10.839 --> 00:15:13.839
[ __ ]

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.800
so then uh then they signed a treaty

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.560
after

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.560
1997 where

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.560
hong kong is has

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.839
autonomy until 2047. what the [ __ ] is

00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:28.720
that it was like

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.759
so they get to why the countdown

00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:34.720
to trying to ease them into dictatorship

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.920
oh yeah yeah

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.040
so they've been slowly taking their

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.160
rights yeah just like and so now they

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.199
are

00:15:41.199 --> 00:15:43.600
they they have their own elections but

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.680
beijing gets to

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.519
select like the committee yeah i heard

00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:49.360
him vote total farce so it's literally

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.800
just whoever beijing wants in

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.959
yeah and now they're saying this is a

00:15:52.959 --> 00:15:54.079
china's [ __ ]

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:55.040
yeah because they tried it what does it

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.399
mean where they can actually now they

00:15:56.399 --> 00:15:58.079
can actually extradite people and it's

00:15:58.079 --> 00:16:00.000
their government base so they just

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.600
so it's fake they're living in a fake

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.120
democracy

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.199
sort of more extreme version of our fake

00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:06.639
democracy

00:16:06.639 --> 00:16:09.440
yeah it's like so much really yeah yeah

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.880
exactly i can get on a microphone and

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.759
say

00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:13.440
china somebody should shoot donald trump

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.360
in the head and everybody's like

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.839
if you go to chinese and say well that's

00:16:17.839 --> 00:16:19.440
because the president doesn't matter if

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.639
you're like if you found the dude in

00:16:20.639 --> 00:16:21.759
control and you're like someone's got to

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:23.440
take this person out they'd be like you

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.279
you would be dead

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:27.920
but yeah true it's much less it's much

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:28.399
less

00:16:28.399 --> 00:16:31.199
it's very much less like dude my uh so i

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:33.120
was talking to my friend's brother

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.040
active troop he's actually like a troop

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.880
lawyer now so he's like a lawyer for the

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.480
marines and he does like rules of

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.720
engagement kind of law like which is

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.399
so crazy now because he was what he was

00:16:42.399 --> 00:16:44.240
explaining to me was like the weaponry

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.839
is so advanced that like so if you're

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:47.279
flying in formation

00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:49.120
you can be locked on but it used to be

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.320
like the rule was if like

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.680
you know when people were flying by like

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.759
with a scarf and [ __ ] and they would

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:55.759
open fire you could fire back but now

00:16:55.759 --> 00:16:57.600
like you can die in a second so like if

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.320
you

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.560
know there's anti-aircraft stuff on the

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.480
ground it's like technically that could

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.839
be engagement because

00:17:03.839 --> 00:17:05.039
you have to wait till the guy in front

00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:06.640
of you blows up so you can engage so

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.760
like he's like talking about all that

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.160
but

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.760
he was saying he went to china because

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.439
he was in japan he was like

00:17:11.439 --> 00:17:13.199
it's very well known that you don't

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:14.640
bring your cell phone over there

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.319
because the government takes as soon as

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:17.600
you enter china they take your cell

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.280
phone and strip all your data off

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.640
and then they take all your personal

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.400
information because they want to know if

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.199
like cia

00:17:23.199 --> 00:17:25.120
three letter agency guys are there so

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.480
like if you don't match up to like all

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.760
this that they

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.679
breached our intelligence systems took

00:17:29.679 --> 00:17:31.760
like 80 million americans information

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.039
because they're building a

00:17:33.039 --> 00:17:36.000
dossier to know if a foreign spy is in

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:36.880
their thing

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.080
and that's that's what they're using

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.360
their internet to do so he's like you

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.640
bring a burner phone

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.880
you don't bring anything it has any of

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.240
your digital record because the first

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.679
thing they do is steal all of your data

00:17:45.679 --> 00:17:46.799
as soon as you go in

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:49.200
and he was saying the so the silicon

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.160
valley

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.840
like so they get courted by the military

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.600
a lot the military will come shopping

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.720
like here's what we're looking for

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.160
product wise so

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.600
you know like but the way it works is

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.200
before you get funding you got to show

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.160
us how it works

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.919
and then you know the mil amer american

00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:03.200
military and good faith will be

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.880
cool knock yourself out we have to make

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.320
sure it works so you're getting chinese

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.080
investors coming here and being like

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.600
show us the goods and they're just like

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.039
thanks and they leave and they steal the

00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:12.320
plans and reverse engineer and they're

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.120
like

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.840
[ __ ] [ __ ] dude everyone's like

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.200
they're such [ __ ] [ __ ] because

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:17.840
like

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.240
they're manipulating currency [ __ ]

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.360
and then they're coming over here to

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.799
like with you know with money

00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:25.120
and then being like uh thanks to thanks

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.480
yeah they just steal the thing and go

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.440
home and there's like

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.360
in america in the court of like common

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.559
law you could sue them

00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:32.160
they just go back to the communist party

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.160

[ __ ] outstanding yeah so it's like

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.559
there's not the reason that none of the

00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:44.240
they're like uh when people are like

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.320
well they use china as like an example

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.840
of like communism working

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.000
it's like yeah but they just completely

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:50.880
disregard

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.240
all the rules of uh international law

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.840
all that stuff where it's like they they

fix their currency they drop their

00:18:57.039 --> 00:18:57.840
currency

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.400
they steal [ __ ] intellectual property

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.679
constantly which is funny

00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:03.760
you get some like 24 year old like

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.280
graphic designer be like you know it

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.720

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.320
they steal the hope before like oh [ __ ]

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.440
[ __ ] goddammit yeah

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.880
so it's like they're just like they're

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.280
going pure uh they're just like us over

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:13.679
them

00:19:13.679 --> 00:19:16.080
[ __ ] the world they're they can plan for

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.600
a hundred years at a time

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.640
because the way they this is what the

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.720
guy was telling me the way they move

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.120
they have hundred year plans so they're

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.039
just like whatever they don't they

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:25.679
they're just

00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:27.679
moving dude like it doesn't matter this

00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:29.679
whole like quarterly business [ __ ]

00:19:29.679 --> 00:19:30.640
they're like okay

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.000
yeah you guys keep doing you we're gonna

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
keep i'm reading a book right now

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.120
it's all about like uh cyber warfare and

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.960
how we kind of started it [ __ ] with

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.440
iran

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.520
by like trying to like disengage their

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.960
nuclear stuff we were trying to like

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.320
blow their stuff up like hack their

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.760
stuff and have a meltdown

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.360
and how like everyone's in on it now

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.960
like rushes in on it china's in on it

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.840
and this is like

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.840
and the way it works is no government

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.760
wants like they set it up so it's kind

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.960
of untraceable

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.240
but it's kind of obvious where it comes

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.840
from so like no one admits it everyone

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.440
does it in secret and there's like crazy

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.440
cyber warfare going on right now yeah

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.120
and it's like nobody really can talk

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.559
about it because it's all classified

00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:06.640

keeping the chinese in check

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.840
and by keeping them in check i mean

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.280
invading and raping them constantly

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.280
true but once we killed all the chinese

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.400
weren't reading for refinement back then

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.400
they were reading to be like i have

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.080
nothing to do here's a story about a

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:44.480
whale

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.159
false false false way false yeah dude

00:24:48.159 --> 00:24:51.039
when abraham lincoln gave the when his

00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:52.480
address the gettysburg address that was

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.240
at like an 11th grade reading level

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.400
when george bush spoke it was at like a

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.679
seventh grade reading level

00:24:57.679 --> 00:24:59.360
so people were refining themselves to

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.039
reading and there was like there was an

00:25:01.039 --> 00:25:02.400
advancement of knowledge that was like

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:02.960
it was sick

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.640
the literacy rates are significantly

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.799
higher now yeah but the national like

00:25:06.799 --> 00:25:08.400
the way people present issues was at

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.000
like a higher level so people who could

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.279
read were keeping themselves like a

00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:12.159
higher standard

00:25:12.159 --> 00:25:14.000
well maybe they kept it at a higher

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.080
level so that the population didn't know

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:16.880
what the [ __ ] they were talking

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.480
literally rates are declining too i mean

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.279
yeah they're not sincere

00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:22.240
1860s but they spiked in the early 1900s

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.279
and now they're starting to decline

00:25:23.279 --> 00:25:24.400
they're declining like

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.440
precipitously in the early 1900s

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.080
literacy rates spiked no in the right

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.120
after slavery

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.880
i mean literacy rates spiked among black

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.159
people right after slavery like

00:25:34.159 --> 00:25:36.159
among black people yeah unbelievably i

00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:36.799
thought you're talking about the

00:25:36.799 --> 00:25:37.520
population

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.039
no more people are literate but it's

00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:41.200
like it's bad the

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.360
literacy is dropping from i don't know

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.120
the exact time but it's literal and even

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.720
if the fact that like

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.159
i guess there's more and more people now

00:25:48.159 --> 00:25:49.600
i don't know but they're saying that

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.640
there's like

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.640
a good third of people can't really read

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.159
it all and the

00:25:54.159 --> 00:25:56.400
the majority of things it's been things

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.840
the public discourse has been dumbed

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.919
down from an 11th grade level

00:25:59.919 --> 00:26:03.039
in abraham lincoln's time to

00:26:03.039 --> 00:26:05.200
yeah for eighth graders and i'm saying

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.039
maybe they used to talk like that

00:26:07.039 --> 00:26:08.640
to make sure that it was only the people

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.159
that were able to get education were

00:26:10.159 --> 00:26:11.039
making

00:26:11.039 --> 00:26:12.400
choices and listening to things like

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.880
that yeah i don't know i would go with

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.400
that but all the [ __ ] i hear like

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.080
any politician talk about is just

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.600
[ __ ] so it's like if they were

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.039
breaking down important concepts like

00:26:21.039 --> 00:26:22.159
you guys got to understand this but

00:26:22.159 --> 00:26:23.120
they're just like look

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.600
you're about to be raped by mexicans got

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.679
be be weary be on guard so it's not like

00:26:27.679 --> 00:26:28.400
they're like

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.760
because i like when authors do that when

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.279
they write books for the masses like all

00:26:31.279 --> 00:26:32.559
right my shit's too [ __ ]

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:34.240
esoteric i'm gonna write a book that

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.520
like everyone can get behind but it's

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.039
like

00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:38.320
and again this chris hedges is the

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.480
ultimate like we're dead we're doom and

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.200
gloom bob

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.640
dude he was talking about the show the

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.200
swan remember that the reality show on

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:45.600
fox

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.880
do you know what that was yeah is that

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.240
where the guy pretended not to be a

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:48.799
millionaire

00:26:48.799 --> 00:26:51.840
no dude no no no the swan is i know

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.440
you're talking about the swan

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.640
is in the early i think 2004 they had

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.840
remember this

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.360
sort of i remember vaguely when i read

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.799
what it was i was like whoa i forgot all

00:27:00.799 --> 00:27:01.520
about that

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.760
so like you would so if you were a bae

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.039
you'd be like i'm not pretty my husband

00:27:05.039 --> 00:27:06.080
doesn't have sex with me and they're

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:06.720
like all right

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.320
they would arrange a team of plastic

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.400
surgeons and give you surgery

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.559
personal trainers psychiatrists and they

00:27:12.559 --> 00:27:14.240
would give you like a 90 day makeover

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.400
and you would just come as like a new

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.200
like complete new draw breast implants

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.480
everything done wardrobe

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.080
if they like unveil you in front of your

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.840
husband unvalue you in front of you

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.120
in front of a live audience yeah in

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.640
front and then but then it's you versus

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.559
another person whoever's prettier wins

00:27:28.559 --> 00:27:30.080
and the one who's not pretty

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.240
is like you know they get like like uh

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.840
their family they remove your tits the

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.279
families of the family they give you a

00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:37.440
double mastectomy the family's there

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.440
and it's like oh like they'd still be

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.720
like oh here well your family's all here

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.440
but yeah you

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.799
lost you don't get to go to the beauty

00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:44.880
pageant so you have these people who are

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.559
like crippling body images

00:27:46.559 --> 00:27:48.320
body image issues and then you give them

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.600
plastic surgery and then you make them

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.120
compete for who's prettier so you have

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.159
someone who has like

00:27:52.159 --> 00:27:53.919
still totally rocks from a lifetime of

00:27:53.919 --> 00:27:55.520
just not really liking themselves

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.679
in a new body and then they're like you

00:27:57.679 --> 00:27:59.039
lose

00:27:59.039 --> 00:28:00.880
lasted two seasons and they [ __ ] they

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.279
trashed that was 2004. dude there was a

00:28:03.279 --> 00:28:04.000
show

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.240
uh [ __ ] we watched it on the bonfire it

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.440
was like uh

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.200
you get hooked up to a lie detector

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.480
before the show and they ask you

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.360
questions

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.760
and if you tell the truth you advance

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.440
and the questions were like

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.279
did you cheat on your husband remember

00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:18.960
that and they'd be like

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.760
yes like that that's true yeah and then

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.360
like the husband would be sitting on a

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.480
couch right there

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.559
and he'd have like a button so you could

00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:28.240
skip a question

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.799
like left for meaning for americans how

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:36.640
like it's like celebrity culture

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.240
television how like he was showing these

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.520
shows how people would just like

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.240
literally incinerate their families for

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.120
like a second

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.640
in that spotlight and how all those

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.720
reality shows are pumping out like

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.720
[ __ ] everybody getting ahead's the only

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.919
thing that matters he's like that's

00:30:49.919 --> 00:30:50.799
that's our like

00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:53.200
it's our literal like religion right now

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.399
so you know i hate when people people

00:30:54.399 --> 00:30:55.679
always try like this is a new religion

00:30:55.679 --> 00:30:56.960
but he was like that's kind of our

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.240
substitute for religious values and

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.840
we're in like a total downslide this

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.279
guy's a real downer

00:31:01.279 --> 00:31:02.960
hedge has spent his whole time he's also

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.720
he's a fellow investigative journalist

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.120
he spent his entire like i think he

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.279
spent like 25 years in active war zones

00:31:09.279 --> 00:31:10.080
where

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.679
countries were like or regimes were

00:31:11.679 --> 00:31:13.200
being toppled i think he was in like

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.880
bulgaria somewhere he like watched like

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.320
an eastern european government fall he

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.279
went to another place

00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:19.120
another government got overthrown so he

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.880
spent years over there

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.679
watching society's collapse and then he

00:31:23.679 --> 00:31:25.200
came to america and he was like

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.840
yeah this is all eerily familiar so he

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.919
was like we're in debt we're in [ __ ]

00:31:29.919 --> 00:31:31.760
we're in decline we're sliding down i

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.919
don't like it studied this for 25 years

00:31:33.919 --> 00:31:35.360
this is what happened over there when

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.679
they're about dude hedges stuff he's he

00:31:37.679 --> 00:31:38.480
is he's the

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.799
ultimate he's a black pill pez dispenser

00:31:40.799 --> 00:31:41.840
dude yeah

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.279
i'm reading his book i'm just going oh

00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:45.360
oh jesus oh my god yeah sitting around

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.000
and being like

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.279
because the literacy thing is not true

00:31:49.279 --> 00:31:50.960
i could also be mischaracterizing it but

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.039
he's saying that basically we're

00:31:53.039 --> 00:31:54.720
being dumped the discourse is dumbed

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.480
down the discourse

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.000
all right the discourse is the education

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.440
is dumbed down the discourse is dumbed

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.120
down for a pretty obvious reason

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.679
which is because now it's entertainment

00:32:03.679 --> 00:32:04.799
and now it's

00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:06.720
meant to reach everybody yeah but even

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.399
the education protocol is dumbed up you

00:32:08.399 --> 00:32:09.840
do people used to learn like all the

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.440
classical language if you went to school

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.559
you went to school if you didn't go to

00:32:12.559 --> 00:32:14.000
school you just worked but now it's like

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.039
everyone kind of goes to school but

00:32:15.039 --> 00:32:16.960
everyone's a [ __ ] education before

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.720
you would like learn the classics

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.880
learn mythology learn history learn

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.159
philosophy now they're like state

00:32:22.159 --> 00:32:24.000
capitals arithmetic

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.840
you know you're [ __ ] out so we're

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.360
getting a

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.840
[ __ ] education you think education's

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:30.480
[ __ ]

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.200
education [ __ ] dude i didn't learn

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:33.840
[ __ ]

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.720
then yeah but there's there's pros to

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:37.919
all of these

00:32:37.919 --> 00:32:39.840
there's pros to all of these huge

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.760
problems you were forced to learn

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.919
cursive and the [ __ ] iliad

00:32:43.919 --> 00:32:46.640
who gives a [ __ ] that's the problem okay

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.600
so back then yeah

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.559
you did get to know the classics now uh

00:32:50.559 --> 00:32:52.960
become a computer programmer

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.200
yeah so there are there's room for both

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.080
that's the thing i didn't even learn

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.279
about [ __ ] computers

00:32:57.279 --> 00:32:58.320
so like they could have taught me about

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.000
computers i could have learned like the

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.360
books i'm reading right now

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.640
and this even goes for my school now

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.399
like i'm learning more off audible than

00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:05.760
i am in my [ __ ] school

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.960
where it's like you could i could have

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.480
learned like that book all the shining

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.440
things is like

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.440
the progression of western thought

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.200
encapsulated in a quick book where now i

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:13.760
go

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.760
okay cool that's a useful piece to be

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.039
able to be like where did our thinking

00:33:17.039 --> 00:33:18.399
come from how are certain lines of

00:33:18.399 --> 00:33:20.080
thinking revolutionized where are we at

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:20.880
now

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.000
you don't learn any of that it's just

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.360
kind of like how to be basically an

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.240
effective

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.200
like factory worker which is fine it's

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.000
whatever

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.039
yeah dude it's we don't need more

00:33:31.039 --> 00:33:32.480
philosophers we need more factory

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.200
workers

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.559
no they're they're done we need more

00:33:34.559 --> 00:33:36.480
philosophers now we need we need more

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.760
philosophers that can make killer

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.960
content

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.000
well yeah that's what we are i heard

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:42.640
that

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.080
no that i mean that's true i was

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.720
literally a factory worker

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:50.159
so yeah you're eight mile dude

00:33:50.159 --> 00:33:51.919
factory work yeah eight mile on the ice

00:33:51.919 --> 00:33:54.480
cream factory

00:33:54.559 --> 00:33:57.440
uh yeah that's i don't know anytime

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.320
somebody writes

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.559
books like that are like said [ __ ] like

00:34:00.559 --> 00:34:02.080
that where it's like this is it this is

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:02.480
the

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.679
you know this is the end this is like

00:34:03.679 --> 00:34:05.519
the end of the roman empire they've been

00:34:05.519 --> 00:34:06.640
saying that forever

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.760
it's the same people that are saying

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:08.960
this is the end of the world well we've

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.079
been saying that forever is a couple

00:34:10.079 --> 00:34:11.200
hundred years and it took the roman

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.119
empire a couple of years to fall so i i

00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:14.079
think we are

00:34:14.079 --> 00:34:16.079
not saying that that about like a couple

00:34:16.079 --> 00:34:17.040
they haven't been saying that a couple

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.359
hundred years about the united

00:34:19.359 --> 00:34:21.119
the [ __ ] the united states is a couple

00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:22.800
hundred years old okay yeah

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.879
so they when they start saying it like

00:34:24.879 --> 00:34:26.000
the everybody always

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.359
dude they're literally always saying

00:34:27.359 --> 00:34:29.359
like that the end is nigh

00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:31.040
forever well one of these times they're

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.200
gonna be right but check this out no no

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.320
it's not it's not like

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.000
so he's like you could get we can pull

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.520
out of it but he was like

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.399
we're so enmeshed in basically all the

00:34:40.399 --> 00:34:41.919
[ __ ] and there was like dude there's

00:34:41.919 --> 00:34:43.280
this other thing i started watching this

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.159
was really

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:47.119
really good it's a mark blythe it's

00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:49.119
global trumpism the future of the global

00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:49.839
economy

00:34:49.839 --> 00:34:53.119
he was saying how every 30 years

00:34:53.119 --> 00:34:55.679
basically in any capitalistic system

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:57.280
it like so you there's like he calls

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.480
like the hardware and the software so

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.320
like in the 70s it was like

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.880
labor's labor was a strong force like i

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:03.760
think the labor

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.720
pool owned like 75 of the wealth you

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:07.920
know and like it was

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.359
everything was worked out to where like

00:35:09.359 --> 00:35:10.560
you know that worked it reduced

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.640
unemployment but then inflation rose

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.160
so then like he's like every 30 years a

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.599
bug will present itself and has to be

00:35:15.599 --> 00:35:16.800
fixed then we went to like the

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.320
neoliberal approach where it's like all

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.480
right we're going to just like

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.320
stop keeping money in a country and then

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.760
start putting it everywhere and that way

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.320
like

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.920
something like production skyrocketed

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.359
but the

00:35:27.359 --> 00:35:28.800
price of labor is supposed to increase

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.960
with production that stopped so labor

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.800
stagnated and the production skyrocketed

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.320
so all the wealth has been concentrated

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:34.960
in like

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.800
the hands of very few that's that is our

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.560
literal situation right now yeah we have

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.079
a problem with

00:35:40.079 --> 00:35:43.440
too many not enough there's too many

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.240
[ __ ] like

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.359
billionaires and that's ridiculous

00:35:47.359 --> 00:35:48.960
yeah i mean it's also would be cool they

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.880
could save them one percent of the one

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.440
percent

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.359
that's the problem now and that's that's

00:35:53.359 --> 00:35:55.440
like what we're facing there's trump's

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.680
trump-like figures popping up around the

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:58.960
world because this

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.640
happened kind of india has some great

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.400
ones do they really india has some

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.560
[ __ ] hilarity they have indian trumps

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.800
dude every billionaire so all these

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.119
third world countries are all new money

00:36:09.119 --> 00:36:11.280
so they are not handling it great like

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.560
in in america and like

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.599
england and [ __ ] when you're a

00:36:13.599 --> 00:36:16.079
billionaire it's like i'm a vanderbilt

00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:17.200
i've been

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.160
like there's a certain level of prestige

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.520
dude these indians get money they're

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.000
like

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.240
i burn a million dollars a day on

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.040
instagram

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.200
it's like yes they go wild yeah they're

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.880

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.800
golden ferraris like suck our [ __ ]

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.400
dicks dude

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.839
but you that he was saying i didn't

00:36:35.839 --> 00:36:37.119
watch the whole entire thing it's really

00:36:37.119 --> 00:36:38.560
good so far the guy i

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.320
think was used to be a comedian he was

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.839
saying now how there's so many

00:36:41.839 --> 00:36:44.320
sucks he's sick dude this guy's he used

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.839
to be a comedian he stinks

00:36:45.839 --> 00:36:47.640
boss dude this guy's boss

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.560
[Laughter]

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.920
i was like why is he defending that so

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.760
much oh yeah

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.760
dude he's a boss dude i'm telling you

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.960
this guy's great

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.960
yeah he uh he goes and basically gives

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.720
like a presentation on

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.640
the econo the history of you know like a

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.480
short history of capitalism how now like

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.000
every 30 years or so

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.160
you if you watch like the graphs it bugs

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.599
out and hits a hard dip he's like that's

00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:10.720
because

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.400
uh there's too many new factors entered

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.000
into an old system and the system needs

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.599
to be continually changed so right now

00:37:15.599 --> 00:37:17.280
he's like our problem is

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.680
they're like the the wages have just

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.800
stagnated

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.359
and all the production or the people the

00:37:23.359 --> 00:37:24.960
people at the top with who are like the

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.240
the capitalists basically are like

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.400
lending out money like the uh finance

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.599
class

00:37:29.599 --> 00:37:31.359
they're they got all they're getting all

00:37:31.359 --> 00:37:32.720
the gain from all the production and the

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:33.520
wages are just

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.960
flat rated and he was like people are

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.480
just not having it so when when they're

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.160
saying like trump is coming just because

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.839
of racism it's like

00:37:39.839 --> 00:37:42.960
sorry bro and think about who stands to

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:43.359
gain

00:37:43.359 --> 00:37:44.640
from being like yeah don't listen to

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.079
donald trump's economic stuff it's just

00:37:46.079 --> 00:37:46.720
racism

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.400
not even like he's gonna save us all

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.760
he's just tapping into all this

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.440
discontent he's like oh i can definitely

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.400
just run a pocket

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.320
i can just run a populist [ __ ] thing

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.240
yeah he's a piece of [ __ ] but

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.920
but when people try to reduce him when

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.200
all the major news think about why all

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.960
these newspapers are so against him he's

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.560
running he's gonna he's trying to smash

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.000
this economic system

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.240
that's basically you know the people who

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.680
own the new york times jeff bezos

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:08.640
washington post

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.240
stand together off so much because the

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.480
labor people who were just like the

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.760
labor pool used to have

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.000
so much of the money and now they have a

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.440
lot less i think it was like 63

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:19.520
now it's 57 so yeah they lost like a

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.800
significant portion but

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.240
it doesn't seem like a big deal but when

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.520
production rose that much they didn't

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.480
get any of that

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.400
yeah so it's like it's a it's a big deal

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.160
and it's basically worldwide

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.240
so you're having all these wild men pop

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.920
up and it's just like people like it's

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.680
just racism it's like dude it's just not

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:33.920
yeah

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.760
that's one effective tool obviously but

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.599
it's like it's a lot deeper than that

00:38:37.599 --> 00:38:38.800
people just want to be like

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.839
yeah there's a go there's just like a

00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:41.040
bunch of there's like literally a

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.800
narrative that there's a bunch of like

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.280
dormant kkk people who are just like

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.720
loaded and chilling who are like

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.880
finally it's time to come out yeah it's

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.720
like yeah dude sorry no it's not the

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:51.839
[ __ ] case

00:38:51.839 --> 00:38:53.839
so that was that guy's thing that guy's

00:38:53.839 --> 00:38:55.040
presentation is awesome

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.359

look i know short term might not be good

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.480
but we got to do this

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.520
long term i mean dude it's going to be

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.720
i don't know how we're even going to do

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.960
it yeah i don't know anything did you

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:24.960
new york for a wedding i was in brooklyn

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.320
i saw a uh

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.240
i saw a thing on like you know brooklyn

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.320
has like woke advertisements just like

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.760
[ __ ] posted up everywhere

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.680
yeah there was a thing that was like

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.119
dear america

00:39:35.119 --> 00:39:38.720
walls aren't the answer signed germany

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.839
it's like uh you guys think walls

00:39:41.839 --> 00:39:43.760
are what people were giving you guys

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.520
first off who knocked down that wall you

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.880
ungrateful [ __ ] krauts who knocked it

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:49.200
down

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.359
you dirty krauts dude and they're like

00:39:51.359 --> 00:39:53.119
oh yeah like we tried walls it's like

00:39:53.119 --> 00:39:54.560
yeah that's not what you guys are really

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.880
known for guys don't be all humanitarian

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.240
you guys still got to sit on the

00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:58.800
sidelines

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.320
it's like oh you mean the wall that the

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.960
communists built in your country

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.960
yeah yeah yeah that one i wish i had the

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.240
historical context dude all i could

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.599
think about was the [ __ ] uh

00:40:07.599 --> 00:40:09.200
so you guys were the [ __ ] you guys

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.880
genocide yes it's like you guys are more

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.240
known you're gonna get morally righteous

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:15.760
it's kind of like fences and barbed wire

00:40:16.319 --> 00:40:18.000
but so the communist party built that

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.760
wall yeah it was the east berlin bus

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.480
building

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.240
so absolutely funny after world war ii

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.520
we split berlin

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.760
the soviets got east berlin we got west

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.680
berlin the allies got west berlin yeah

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:28.240
so then

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.280
everybody was trying to get to the

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.880
[ __ ] west so you didn't live under

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:31.520
the [ __ ]

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.040
so you didn't live under stalin pretty

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.240
much people don't want to live under

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.560
communist rule for the most part never

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.560
they don't try to escape it so communism

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:39.680
pops up people are like

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.359
yes and then they get walled in they're

00:40:41.359 --> 00:40:43.040
like no

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.119
[ __ ] and then the other side has like

00:40:45.119 --> 00:40:46.640
cool ads

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:47.839
because there's like buildings so you

00:40:47.839 --> 00:40:49.599
see like oh [ __ ] they got coca-cola what

00:40:49.599 --> 00:40:50.720
the [ __ ] is that

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.640
yeah we're stuck here with gruel well

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:54.079
it's really like they have creative

00:40:54.079 --> 00:40:56.160
expression and we don't

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.240
yeah it's lit it's the literal it dude

00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.680
it's a big [ __ ] deal

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.560
yeah man did not have like even like i

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.079
said even if the whole thing goes and

00:41:04.079 --> 00:41:05.440
again if it's going to get into

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.560
if you're a communist it's going to

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.880
become a totalitarian

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.200
nightmare if you go full capitalist a

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.400
bunch of people are going to get rich

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.160
most people are going to kind of suck is

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.839
what it is but it's like pick your

00:41:15.839 --> 00:41:17.119
[ __ ] poison dude

00:41:17.119 --> 00:41:18.480
again if i was in control i think i

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.000
could come up with a third way actually

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.200
they'll probably kill me like they did

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.400
gaddafi but

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.920
i think i can figure it out a different

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:24.200
way

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.520
[Laughter]

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.680
oh no isn't that funny though it's like

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.119
dear america

00:41:29.119 --> 00:41:31.680
walls aren't the answer love germany

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.560
that's like

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.160
okay you guys are you guys known for

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.920
your work it hasn't even been a century

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.040
you guys did the most

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:40.079
recent genocide in europe also

00:41:40.079 --> 00:41:41.359
no they didn't but yeah who's the most

00:41:41.359 --> 00:41:43.280
recent genocide uh the army one of the

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.720
armenians get genocide

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.400
the armenians they got g-dot paul i got

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.319
got hard but that was world war one

00:41:48.319 --> 00:41:51.520
okay so but the genocides like uh bosnia

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.599
we went over there to help the muslims

00:41:53.599 --> 00:41:55.040
the muslims are getting muslims against

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.960
genocide that's why the bosnians

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.880
yeah all of these yeah eastern europe

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.560
was not none too pleased with the

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.359
muzzies

00:42:01.359 --> 00:42:03.119
really so they started killing them and

00:42:03.119 --> 00:42:05.119
we came over and protected the muzz

00:42:05.119 --> 00:42:07.040
really yeah bro like hey back off dude

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.640
yeah really only we can bully them

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.680
just like our little brothers dude

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.440
you're like hey man yeah yeah yeah we

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:12.560
[ __ ] with them but only yes

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:13.599
that was clear i'm trying to think the

00:42:13.599 --> 00:42:15.599
last european genocide

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:18.079
uh damn bosnia did it yeah it was like

00:42:18.079 --> 00:42:20.319
the 90s early 90s

00:42:20.319 --> 00:42:22.079
[ __ ] yeah i mean they definitely yeah

00:42:22.079 --> 00:42:24.480
again that wasn't that wasn't western

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.000
white people got you got you that's what

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.760
the big thing about the

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.800
holocaust was yeah you know it was it

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.599
was

00:42:31.599 --> 00:42:33.359
pretty much white on white it was like

00:42:33.359 --> 00:42:34.960
they look exactly like us and act

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.040
exactly like us the germans and the jews

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.400
yeah so it's weird to see them kill it

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.640
like rwanda it's like yeah all right who

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.880

00:42:43.359 --> 00:42:44.960
yes there but that's i can't relate to

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.319
that at all that's ongoing that's

00:42:46.319 --> 00:42:47.520
ongoing genocide as well

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.200

and then yeah there's a bunch of

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.760
genocides going on right now but it's in

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.040

uh kumail non gianni or whatever

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.480
dude from silicon valley does he use

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.920
pakistan have you ever done like a

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.920
dance number type thing i i don't know

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.760
if he has

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.119
they i'm just trying to learn i'm not

00:44:11.119 --> 00:44:12.160
i'm trying to learn about the culture

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.920
dude pakistan has some excuse me

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.079
pakistan has decent ballers i worked

00:44:16.079 --> 00:44:17.920
with the pakistani he was the man

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.520
i'm not saying i hate pakistanis no i

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.040
don't think you do but culturally or

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.720
i feel like pakistan is way more serious

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.400
so that was that was excuse me i'm

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:24.960
trying

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.800
to cultivate that was another genocide

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.079
who uh

00:44:28.079 --> 00:44:30.880
india and pakistan who who so they cheat

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:31.520
each other

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:32.720
so i guess that's not a genocide it's a

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.640
war killing people

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:35.839
it was just people on people it wasn't

00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:37.839
even military yeah genocide is like like

00:44:37.839 --> 00:44:40.480
the germans

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.480
they had again both claimed genocide on

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.560
this though india and pakistan

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:45.839
because they were just atrocities you

00:44:45.839 --> 00:44:47.200
think anyone was like you genocided us

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.839
first

00:44:48.839 --> 00:44:51.200
yeah that's exactly what they're doing

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.640
i didn't [ __ ] change pakistan wasn't

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:55.119
a country yeah that there were muslims

00:44:55.119 --> 00:44:55.599
and

00:44:55.599 --> 00:44:57.760
hindus in india how many people do you

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.280
need for a g

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.440
for a genocide yeah is it a thousand is

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.040
that we're saying i have a geek

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.200
i don't know what the abs the number is

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.400
what is it though i guess if you have to

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:06.960
be like

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.480
i guess if you call yourself if you babe

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.720
ruth it like i'm killing these people

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.160
and then you kill a couple from the

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.920
government it has to be like a

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:16.160
systematic

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.640
you know yeah you know i i bet it can be

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:19.680
like but if it's your

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:22.480
government targeting a race or dude

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.000
ethnicity or religion you know what's

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:24.720
funny too

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.720
in terms of the holocaust that was in

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:27.760
secret at first right

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.520
yeah so there was guy there was german

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.200
conspiracy theorists were like we are

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.720

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:34.880
come on dude they were jews

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.240

[ __ ]

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.800
isn't that wild think about the

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.240
conspiracy theories back then be like

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.599
dude i don't know it seems like

00:45:49.599 --> 00:45:51.119

00:45:51.119 --> 00:45:52.560
they're around like come on dude yeah

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:53.520

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.760
the book tonight the book night opens up

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.440
you gave me that the guy who like came

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:57.760
back

00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:59.599
escaped and got to the next town and was

00:45:59.599 --> 00:46:01.760
like they just put us all in a ditch and

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.280
shot us and everyone was like you're

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.960
drunk

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:06.480
and then they woke up in a ditch like

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.640
god damn it

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.440
yeah that's all they could do is be like

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.319
no

00:46:12.319 --> 00:46:15.440
yeah that's true you know if you have

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:16.800
someone told me like they're coming down

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.079
again actually i'd probably be like

00:46:18.079 --> 00:46:18.720
let's go

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.480

philly they're coming to west philly

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.400

i would love shut the [ __ ] up i would

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.280
listen to him

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:38.480
yeah i know you would if someone came in

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.520
and was like hey

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.440
i just came from the other town they're

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.760
murdering us i'd be like

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.440
okay all right but you don't live in

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.280
like 1930s poland

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:50.079
there's some real dumb true it's roaming

00:46:50.079 --> 00:46:50.720
the hills

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.880
true so this is a dude and in the book

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:54.480
they're like we thought he was an idiot

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.800
he was an idiot by 1930s poland

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:57.760
standards

00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.200
that's the dumbest guy how did he get

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.440
out he was so dumb dude he was crafty

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:04.480
so he's so dumb he just i think he

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.920
i forget in the book if he said he

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:07.680
played dead

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:11.200
played possum on him damn uh

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.040
but yeah yeah there's you got some you

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.720
got some good there's some good

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.280
wild chicken amazon's burning do you see

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.520
that oh the amazon's on fire yeah amazon

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.440
bolsonaro is calling uh

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:22.960
he's saying it's eco-terror he's just

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:24.559
like these are just like environmental

00:47:24.559 --> 00:47:26.240
groups lighting it on fire on purpose

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.599
which is like really that's a that's a

00:47:27.599 --> 00:47:28.800
bold move he's calling

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.400
he's calling it environmental false

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.920
flags he's getting his own conspiracies

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:32.319
going

00:47:32.319 --> 00:47:33.520
yeah he's getting him rolling dude

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.359
that's a good way to fight also it's

00:47:35.359 --> 00:47:37.520
funny to think about a [ __ ] uh

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:39.280
a conservationist being like let's burn

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.240
down a quarter of the rainforest

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.319
finally some attention get the [ __ ] out

00:47:44.319 --> 00:47:45.680
of here um

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:48.319
yeah it's just deforestation why does

00:47:48.319 --> 00:47:49.359
that even need a

00:47:49.359 --> 00:47:50.319
why does it sound like all right we'll

00:47:50.319 --> 00:47:52.559
dump some water on it be like this is

00:47:52.559 --> 00:47:54.240
[ __ ] obviously my political enemies

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:56.079
lighting the rainforest on fire i know i

00:47:56.079 --> 00:47:56.480
know

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:58.000
dude no one would have blamed that on

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.599
you yeah we gotta fight this well it is

00:47:59.599 --> 00:48:00.400
his fault

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.440
why because he sold all the [ __ ] land

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:05.920
and they're so the reason it's burning

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.680
is because of the deforestation [ __ ]

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.680
this is all them like dude i think

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.800
mcdonald's has a [ __ ] like

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.760
like several states worth of land in the

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:16.800
amazon of just

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.280
cows and like they just clear it out and

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.119
then fires start

00:48:21.119 --> 00:48:22.720
oh okay that makes sense so it's all

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.319
deforestation it's his fault

00:48:24.319 --> 00:48:26.960
it literally is that guy's fault his

did you help it did you see that video

00:49:04.559 --> 00:49:05.119
of

00:49:05.119 --> 00:49:08.319
sao paulo no it was dark at 2 p.m

00:49:08.319 --> 00:49:09.920
because of the smoke

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:12.480
it was night time in a major city damn

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.480
that's how big this fire is

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:17.520
it's like scary to look at what at 2 p.m

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.200
in sao paulo the i think it's like their

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.040
most populous city yeah i've been there

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:24.640
yeah it was pitch black what yeah bro

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:26.240
and he's like clearly the work of my

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.319
political very spooky times i mean it

00:49:28.319 --> 00:49:30.400
could have been a video from night

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.400
that someone was just like this was 2

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:34.480
p.m but i think it was real

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:35.839
probably it probably was seemed pretty

00:49:35.839 --> 00:49:38.079
real i would say yeah especially dude

00:49:38.079 --> 00:49:40.079
that guy's response killed me dude it's

00:49:40.079 --> 00:49:41.520
like claiming eco-terrorists

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:45.839
i mean it's a false flag

00:49:47.599 --> 00:49:49.680
so the pesky environmentalists are like

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.599
well we'll burn down a bunch of the rain

00:49:51.599 --> 00:49:52.079
forest

00:49:52.079 --> 00:49:54.160
yeah and then we'll get them to that one

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:57.200
the one thing we're trying to protect

00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.200
we're going to bring you down yeah man

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.400
well dude i'm telling you this is why

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.000
these kind of people are rising up

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:02.319
though

00:50:02.319 --> 00:50:05.520
it's just like again you know me and

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:06.880
chris hedges officer on the cutting edge

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.079

00:50:08.079 --> 00:50:10.240
edu people are being dumbed down people

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.200
are being [ __ ]

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:13.280

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.319
too late idiocracy

00:50:20.319 --> 00:50:23.280
it's happening that movie like it is not

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.520
but there is different forms of literacy

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:28.000

to fight on the show too

01:02:27.839 --> 01:02:29.520

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.520
like taunting each other and laughing

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.559
the entire flight

01:02:32.559 --> 01:02:35.119
[ __ ] uh and then cormier versus uh

01:02:35.119 --> 01:02:36.400
miocic was [ __ ]

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:39.280
so that was good yeah yeah dude in the

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.720
end of the fight cormier

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.400
cormier was winning the whole time and

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.920
then all of a sudden miocic like figured

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.920
out he could just throw a body hook

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:47.440
it's like when you're playing ufc like

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:48.559
when you're playing a video game and the

01:02:48.559 --> 01:02:49.680
other guy doesn't know how to like block

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.160
the leg

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.599
yeah and you just keep throwing it and

01:02:51.599 --> 01:02:53.359
it's like stop dude stop stop

01:02:53.359 --> 01:02:54.640
all of a sudden the ocean was just like

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.400
oh i can just hook him in the belly

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.319
yeah and he was just throwing like

01:02:58.319 --> 01:03:00.480
haymakers to this dude's belly oh

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:01.839
and after the third one it was like all

01:03:01.839 --> 01:03:03.520
right he's going to be dead now he hit

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.280
him with like the sub-zero slide kick

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.200
he hit him with the slide kick like five

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.319
different times dick

01:03:08.319 --> 01:03:09.839
yeah and then so they had to call the

01:03:09.839 --> 01:03:10.799
fight because he was getting punched in

01:03:10.799 --> 01:03:11.839
the stomach he was getting punched in

01:03:11.839 --> 01:03:13.680
his belly and then he was dead so then

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:16.559
you know just [ __ ] it was it was ugly

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:18.400
at the end what this is the same

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.079
[ __ ] cormier was holding him in the

01:03:20.079 --> 01:03:22.000
air in the beginning of the fight

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.119
cormier was literally like

01:03:23.119 --> 01:03:24.160
holding him in the air and everyone was

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.480
like ah he's gonna kill him

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:31.390
then miocic punched him in the belly

01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:35.760
[Laughter]

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.119
there's an exact punch of a guy like

01:03:37.119 --> 01:03:38.559
sitting against the lockers like get

01:03:38.559 --> 01:03:40.400
away from me

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.799

01:03:42.799 --> 01:03:45.359
guy and diaz swapped pettis which diaz

01:03:45.359 --> 01:03:47.920

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:48.880
really yeah

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:51.520
did you get it finished yeah it did go

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.119
to decision but it was just

01:03:53.119 --> 01:03:55.119
three nothing three rounds to none

01:03:55.119 --> 01:03:57.119
that's awesome yeah diaz is the best

01:03:57.119 --> 01:03:58.880
yes diaz is a new thing where he's just

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:01.039
like i only fight whoever whoever's

01:04:01.039 --> 01:04:02.559

01:04:02.559 --> 01:04:03.039
fight

01:04:03.039 --> 01:04:04.480
he's like the reason i fought perez was

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.799
because he's actually doing cool [ __ ]

01:04:06.799 --> 01:04:09.280
the reason i want to fight mazavidal is

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.480
because he's doing cool [ __ ]

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.480
so he's like when people are blowing up

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.160
he just goes they have their faces

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.240
they have to fight diaz and smart diaz

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.359
is also like

01:04:17.359 --> 01:04:19.200
he's like the reason i was i took off

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.799
for three years is because everybody

01:04:20.799 --> 01:04:22.240
here is a [ __ ]

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.319
so i didn't want to fight anybody like

01:04:24.319 --> 01:04:26.480
that was his speech and he's like most

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.000
of it all he's doing cool [ __ ] i'll

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.200
[ __ ] i'll fight him

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.359

01:04:31.359 --> 01:04:33.119
reign yeah he took the wind out of his

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:33.839
sails hard

01:04:33.839 --> 01:04:37.119

did you see mcgregor punched an old dude

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.680

whiskey oh he's he's like

01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:50.960

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.720
just trying to give whiskey to

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.520

01:04:56.079 --> 01:04:58.000
old dude sitting at the bar must have

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.520
been said something he's right and then

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.960
the shit's up mcgregor just [ __ ]

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.000

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:18.640
like

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.720
no way he had anything to do with any of

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.240
that he wasn't walking around with guys

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.359

that that was a gang rape

01:09:27.679 --> 01:09:29.920
are like there's an ideology behind a

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:30.400
gang

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:32.640
there's a taliban there's white

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.239
supremacists who shoot people

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:37.679
them don't wanna get killed but

01:09:37.679 --> 01:09:39.359
gangs i don't name a specific one and

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:41.440
get [ __ ] jumped on by a set but

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.400
there's like

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.159
there are do you think if you said the

01:09:44.159 --> 01:09:46.480

not an ideology it's like dude

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.400
it's the same framework as isis

01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:59.440
basically

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.280
yeah it's just different motives

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.880
different set of beliefs

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.640
it's like very similar organization very

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:06.159
similar to the aryan brotherhood

01:10:06.159 --> 01:10:07.520
if aryan brotherhood went in and shot

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:09.120
someone that would be an ideologically

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:10.159
driven hate crime

01:10:10.159 --> 01:10:12.000
if a [ __ ] goes in and shoots five people

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.400
it's like like you said they're like

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.159
it's black they're different people

01:10:16.159 --> 01:10:17.440
they're poor they're black people doing

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.080
black things

uh everybody dude did you see the whole

01:10:36.159 --> 01:10:38.320
fallout from that people like oh my god

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.920

supposed to be for is like

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:49.840
not like late night monologue but like

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.440
you should write like 20-minute specials

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:52.880

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:54.880
six-month time hit it forget it

people's

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.520
ideological lenses so they need they if

they have that crack if you have like

01:18:47.679 --> 01:18:49.199
like the cop show if you're doing open
