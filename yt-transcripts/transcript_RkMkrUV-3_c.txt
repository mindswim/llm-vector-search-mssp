hillary supporter dude you made out with

out with the dude on the beach

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.919
potentially potentially made out with a

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:22.080
[ __ ] with an am trans am dude

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.599

[ __ ] made out with a [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:36.639

[ __ ] dude what uh time was that that

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:18.479
you oh

00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:19.919
it's probably four in the morning you're

00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:23.440

what do you think honestly the

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.080
likelihood is that that was a man

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.920
percentage i'm going 50 50 dude you

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.519
think that was there's a 50 chance that

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:55.760
it was about 60 40 t to f

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.880

now the posse is ruining my brand dude

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.720

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.040
700 listeners dude i'm out of here no

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:27.400
way

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.880
[Laughter]

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.440
we're not splitting separate casts like

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.680
shane's a [ __ ] [ __ ] dude

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.440
if we open anthony

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.959
we split up my whole cast is like

00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:38.399
sharing [ __ ] cheats of video games

00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:41.040
he's a [ __ ]

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.959
that little maddie just got his first

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:44.800
win in a long time he's feeling good it

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.320
didn't count he let me win

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.399
i started getting i let you get one or

00:12:48.399 --> 00:12:50.800
two i started losing an mlb the big show

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.639
and getting a watery eye dude he threw

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:54.800
me a couple meatballs down the middle

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.720
so that's that's a that's a real thing

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.200
though what do you know rats play

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.040
and if the so the bigger rat always

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.320
beats a little rat but it lets the

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.399
little rat win 25 of the time because if

00:13:04.399 --> 00:13:06.160
the little rat doesn't win 25 percent of

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.839
the time it doesn't play

00:13:07.839 --> 00:13:09.040
so you got to give me twenty five

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.160
percent you're talking about that's a

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.399
real study rats play they're social

01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:30.559
think he dresses up yeah when i was

01:03:30.559 --> 01:03:32.319
little i think i i think my sister used

01:03:32.319 --> 01:03:34.400
to dress this up really my brothers no

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.559

01:03:36.559 --> 01:03:38.240
it is very good but jimmy i didn't wear

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.520
the underwear

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.280
what huh i didn't wear the underwear

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.760
though so you wear boxers and a dress uh

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:44.960
well at that point in my life it was

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.480
tidy wedges was really it might have

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:47.680
been under roots no that's that's pretty

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:49.280
hot the fact that you go tight you wait

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.400
until you come the fact that you're

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.760
saying

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:52.720
the fact that your sister was

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:55.680
cross-dressing you file that under hot

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.079
i got a hot new theory

01:03:58.079 --> 01:04:00.240
i got a real hot there let's have it you

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:03.200
wear tighty whities until you come yeah

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:06.079
and then the second you can't come you

01:04:06.079 --> 01:04:07.760
start wearing tidy whiters again that's

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:08.940
a good theory

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:10.640
[Music]

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:12.079
that's a good theory you don't think

01:04:12.079 --> 01:04:14.000
those geezies are [ __ ] ripping not

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.079
hard not at all actually that thing

01:04:16.079 --> 01:04:18.160
started that [ __ ] well starts to dry

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.599
up yeah

01:04:19.599 --> 01:04:22.240
that's leaking out dude you're right

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:23.920
that's a hot theory that's a good that's

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:25.359
a [ __ ] action i actually think that i

01:04:25.359 --> 01:04:27.119
would be willing to uh that's a

01:04:27.119 --> 01:04:29.039
scientifically sound theory yeah the

01:04:29.039 --> 01:04:30.559
second you come

01:04:30.559 --> 01:04:32.000
pop moves yeah

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.319
showing boxers yeah yeah yeah boxers

01:04:34.319 --> 01:04:36.000
early in the summer you graduate you

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.280
usually graduate to boxer briefs

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.119
nowadays graduate in a box of briefs and

01:04:39.119 --> 01:04:41.200
then the second you start coming you go

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:42.079
back

01:04:42.079 --> 01:04:45.039
very infrequently yeah toss on the

01:04:45.039 --> 01:04:46.400
whities that's something sad i think

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:47.920
about a lot like the our dicks are going

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.520

dude that's really good tonight

01:04:52.319 --> 01:04:54.079
this is a bit you should probably take

01:04:54.079 --> 01:04:55.760
out because it's so [ __ ] sad what is

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.760

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:47.159
and i'm gonna miss everybody

01:23:47.490 --> 01:23:53.380
[Music]

01:23:56.880 --> 01:24:00.330
living in a hateful world

01:24:00.330 --> 01:24:30.239
[Music]

01:24:30.239 --> 01:24:33.720
i don't want to die

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:58.639
[Music]

01:24:58.639 --> 01:25:01.639
me

01:25:03.630 --> 01:25:07.600
