00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.060
whole thing where people uh it's called

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.189
like birth trauma therapy where they try

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.229
to get people into like a some people

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.299
use LSD but they try to get you to

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.040
remember and relive your birth and you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.259
rebirth yourself and like you access the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.890
memories so that's [ __ ] no no no no

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.360
one can remember that you never

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.670
literally your brain is not capable of

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.740
remembering that do you never know

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.290
I dunno really yes so there's no way I

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.180
know the neuroscience behind it when do

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.590
people start to remember whenever I

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.360
started which was when I was about like

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.640
three so that's when you lose your first

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.079
memory I

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.069
I remember building when my parents were

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.330
building the house and the piles of dirt

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.310
that I would play on you like their pile

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.800
of dirt piles

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.270
I have photos of me with like a

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.000
fisher-price construction helmet

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.840
controlling the dirt piles in the

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.970
backyard and I was devastated when the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.460
house finally got finished yes and the

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.450
dirt piles were gone

your pile never left the compound do

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.620

definitely not Muslims white

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:15.849
nationalists and they're like the roots

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:17.769
of anti-semitism come from Europe and in

00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:20.559
my head I'm like what you guys are gonna

00:07:20.559 --> 00:07:21.610
talk about like there's like

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.259
pre-christian anti-semitism you're gonna

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:24.999
start and that all I brought up I was

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:27.369
like so we watched the whole thing it's

00:07:27.369 --> 00:07:29.349
just people on there who are like the

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:31.709
word globalist is a slur for Jews and

00:07:31.709 --> 00:07:33.939
I'm like watching this and I'm like what

00:07:33.939 --> 00:07:34.689
the [ __ ]

00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:36.549
so like they're like how does everyone

00:07:36.549 --> 00:07:38.049
there's one there you know someone was

00:07:38.049 --> 00:07:40.259
in there who was Jewish and they're like

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:42.759
you could tell it's Jewish day dude I

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:44.199
think they were excited what the Jew is

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:46.629
hyped I mean dude it's like everyone

00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:48.999
telling everyone things aren't going

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:54.069
well for us well you know it was like

00:07:54.069 --> 00:07:55.809
you know the shining moment and I should

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:58.029
have maybe again this is the critique I

00:07:58.029 --> 00:08:00.489
received maybe it was the wrong time to

00:08:00.489 --> 00:08:02.379
like talk about being shown what I

00:08:02.379 --> 00:08:05.709
believe was propaganda I was like dude

00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:08.289
my problem and I'm like it's not with

00:08:08.289 --> 00:08:10.029
the content of the video although it's

00:08:10.029 --> 00:08:13.449
strange they started the history in like

00:08:13.449 --> 00:08:15.489
Europe 100 years ago but whatever aside

00:08:15.489 --> 00:08:17.049
from that it's a weird place to start

00:08:17.049 --> 00:08:20.049
the ball but it was like why are we

00:08:20.049 --> 00:08:22.839
being shown these like very specific and

00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:24.879
politically driven clips on these topics

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.469
like why does it have to be like that

00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:27.969
it's really bizarre to me to have to

00:08:27.969 --> 00:08:29.919
view this whole thing through a very

00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:31.599
narrow political lens and people were

00:08:31.599 --> 00:08:34.689
like oh what narrow political ends like

00:08:34.689 --> 00:08:35.949
what are you talking about I was like

00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:38.110
neo Marxism like it was on the syllabus

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.370
that we were discovered we're going

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:40.209
through these topics through a

00:08:40.209 --> 00:08:42.669
neo-marxist let it says it on there I'm

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:45.100
like that's a really weirdly constricted

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.509
political view and there's no reason at

00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:49.029
like strictly go through that view for

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:50.559
these things damn dude you are a [ __ ]

00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:53.020
new-age JP bro it's insane

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.660
it's bloody insane it's like dude and

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.010
neo-marxists are taking over the

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:58.930
classroom dude they are so there are

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.670

first of all I can't wear this around

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:51.100
white people and Baba why I did it was

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.770
like this [ __ ] was super aggressive to

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:54.820
the point where he literally said he

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.320

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.320
it's exactly you won't get definitely

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.000
made fun of by every person on their

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.880
porch in our neighborhood well that's

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.490
you have to suspend that completely like

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.560
that hole and in this in this world that

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.450
they're trying to get together any

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.820
misdeeds done by anyone who's not white

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.589
doesn't exist and it's wrong to bring up

00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:22.779
and not even in a way of like trying to

00:10:22.779 --> 00:10:24.130
slam a hole people there's a whole

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:25.360
problem with people trying to slam a

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.860
hole people being like black people

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.089
murder each other without going through

00:10:28.089 --> 00:10:30.310
the whole context of what but it's like

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.370
they're doing that in terms of like to

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.110
say Trump's pores whatever so like I'm

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:39.010

isn't his space dude it was so crazy it

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.930
it got to the point where eventually

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.760
people were like I don't know what to do

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.770
I'm just numb and like you're numbness

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:26.120
is a privilege like I don't know what to

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.260
say it's like your silence is a

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.880
privilege and they're like why aren't

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.860
you crying they dude cries on demand as

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.250
soon as they say that the guys like

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.810
we're watching this and we had a watches

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:37.460
via Skype because our school had shut

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.670
down because [ __ ] power wanna help so

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.380
watching this via Skype mobilis shut it

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.210
down oh no the globalist I turn it

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:45.500
cranking up the juice dude who do you

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.030
think so down I bet it was a patriot

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:50.210
dude hey you probably shut the panel you

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.740
probably saw what was going on he was

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.080
probably I don't none of this know so it

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.370
was like an ending and then it just

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.380
ended with like people it was just end

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.700
it with like people being told they

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.230
couldn't rationally think about these

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.850
concepts it was like they weren't

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:03.320
allowed to talk about them they weren't

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.550
allowed to not talk about him they

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.920
weren't allowed to use rational logic on

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.480
trying to explain their positions

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.890
because that was just you them using

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:10.880
their privilege and trying to like

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.890
dismiss other people's experience so

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:14.420
that's like the the thing we watch and

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.640
then afterwards the teachers like it

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.170
just ends with everyone crying or trying

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.930
to cry and being like just like but

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.460
better they would babble stuff because

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.570
they weren't trying to use like the

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:25.670
logic part logical part of their brains

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.320
yes that was like you know the defensive

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.780
I guess so just people being like better

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.750
better like white people rocking back

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.100
and forth layers like I say with the

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.650
whole video I hate what Holy spirt so

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:38.120
then it was like it just ended with like

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.430
everybody crying and people pissed off

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:42.350
and the woman versus black dude in there

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.780
who was rocking a shirt called it was a

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.910
money monster shirt and he was wearing a

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:48.710
[ __ ] untied do-rag a money monster

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:50.480

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.210

and like quiet issue it's something I've

00:14:49.529 --> 00:14:50.970
been thinking about for a long time the

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:52.290
people who don't speak up in this class

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:53.759
they're just exercising their white

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:55.339
privilege to not speak on these things

00:14:55.339 --> 00:14:58.679
so carrying a neck so they never then we

00:14:58.679 --> 00:15:00.179
have a peaceful class what

00:15:00.179 --> 00:15:05.339
maybe we forge a document yeah and I try

00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:07.920
to become a speaker in your class what

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.049

00:15:44.209 --> 00:15:46.649

rest of the people are quiet they're

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.660
obviously exercising their privilege to

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:52.950
be silent because they're white because

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:54.060
if you're white you can be silent on

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.190

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.019

00:15:58.019 --> 00:15:59.490
talk and chair might like yesterday I

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:00.959
just was like dude I don't know why we

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:01.980
have to learn through political

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.660
propaganda like it why we can't do these

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.730
one-to-one an individual basis a girl

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.529
got up and left the room the one lady

00:16:07.529 --> 00:16:10.050
was like so what attacked my family it's

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:11.610
white people doing this to Jewish people

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:13.050
I'm like yeah I sorry I just know a lot

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:14.010
I happen to know a lot of people who

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:15.420
aren't white who also aren't big fans of

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.610
Jews and it's like it's like this shit's

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.410
like a worldwide thing it across the

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.360
board so you guys keep trying to paint

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.250
racism and evil as a strictly white

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.200
phenomenon it's like dude sorry this is

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.790
not the [ __ ] case yeah I don't

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:28.470
understand why this has to be explored

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.180
through that lens actually we can still

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.100
explore racism yes that's all I'm saying

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.480
it just doesn't need to be like hey

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.130
everyone here's the scapegoat I mean you

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.480
can anytime you get the group thing

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.730
together and be like hey we know that we

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:41.300
know the problem of this issue that is

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:46.410
universal yes a very it's the problem

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:48.060
you guys squeeze the bar soap out of

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.320
your hands and you're like oh here it is

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.910
and it's like it's the same [ __ ]

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:52.769
thing and I'm like how do you got dude

00:16:52.769 --> 00:16:54.990
regardless so I'm in there and so it's

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:57.000
like so if I offer my instead I was like

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.500
dude I just thought like there's a class

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.540
'title multiculturalism that there would

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.329
be just like an a an iota of

00:17:03.329 --> 00:17:05.520
open-mindedness for me to actually share

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.740
how I feel about things the lady goes oh

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.089
that's really just your privilege

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:10.589
assuming that there'd be a space for you

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:12.059
in this class so I'm like all right so

00:17:12.059 --> 00:17:13.230
if you don't talk that's privileged if

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:14.819
you talk that's privileged what does

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:17.220
that leave - it was privileged to assume

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.199

allowed to be quiet so you're not

00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:47.059
allowed to just withhold your opinion

00:19:47.059 --> 00:19:48.440
you're not allowed to offer your opinion

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.659
outside of what the accepted views of

00:19:50.659 --> 00:19:51.389
the group

00:19:51.389 --> 00:19:54.059
it only leaves mindless conformity as an

00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:56.999
option in class what it is it no wait

00:19:56.999 --> 00:19:58.799
literally and it's like if you point it

00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:00.299

00:20:12.329 --> 00:20:14.669
paints white people as a ubiquitous

00:20:14.669 --> 00:20:16.559
negative force in the world that's a bad

00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:18.119

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:51.630
hype yeah so yeah and another thing

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.280
about that video it's the same thing

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.900

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.150
someone cry like that's that's like you

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:58.740
see the same thing when people catch the

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.360
holy spirit in like some weird Church

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.210

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:05.610
everyone's like yeah man and it's the

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:06.690
same thing

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:08.550
well John McWhorter that's the dude I

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.140
watch he's on the Glenn show a lot yeah

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.970
Kirby's likes him a lot he talks about

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.100
this whole thing like anti racism as a

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.680
religion and it's like it is yeah it's

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.210
like as soon as you bring up things it's

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:19.530
like talking my mom about anything and

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:21.240
that's the young stuff they talk about

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.920
how once religion kind of fades away

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.810
that same energy Center pours into

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:25.950
somewhere else and right now these

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:28.680
people are like religious zealots with

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.060
this weird political stuff and they only

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.890
get that my whole point yesterday was

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:33.780
like your guys news or your guys

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.730
information comes strictly through the

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.070
media like you guys are being holy

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.740
propagandized like you don't you don't

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.110
read like dole critique like theorists

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:45.330
and every [ __ ] it's so funny every

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:46.950
critique is all like Freud or anyone

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:49.470
will just Erickson they're like well I

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:51.000
mean I don't know I just think it's like

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.120
a very like Western kind of view that's

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.490
it's like they haven't read any of the

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:57.990
person's work whatsoever you know and

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:00.330
it's like dude if I was in China right

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:01.650
now and I was like yeah I hear you guys

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:03.180
are saying it's kind of an Eastern take

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.680
they'd be like yet [ __ ] we're in

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.180
[ __ ] day I mean I'd be like all right

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.600
come outside we're gonna hit you a stick

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.490

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:13.110
back in and just shut the [ __ ] yeah I

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:14.460
see what you guys are saying and with

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:16.800
like your whole like 27 books you wrote

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.180
and you kind of speak like seven

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:18.690
different lang

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.369
I've never read any of your stuff but

00:24:20.369 --> 00:24:21.899
I'm gonna say like it's kind of Western

00:24:21.899 --> 00:24:23.599
yeah it's probably pretty well kind of

00:24:23.599 --> 00:24:25.379
individualistic and a little bit

00:24:25.379 --> 00:24:27.269
problematic on that very individualistic

00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:29.759
of you but meanwhile here's my pronouns

00:24:29.759 --> 00:24:31.169

[ __ ] cry very individualistic I'm

00:24:33.989 --> 00:24:35.789

00:26:20.639 --> 00:26:22.739
it is funny because it's dude he's a

00:26:22.739 --> 00:26:24.450
linguist he because they're like trying

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:25.889
to fit and if you watch the Glenn show

00:26:25.889 --> 00:26:27.749
it's not blogging heads TV they're

00:26:27.749 --> 00:26:31.049
trying to figure out where they're

00:26:31.049 --> 00:26:32.340
somebody's like you're a professor

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.169
humanity's like actually I'm like in the

00:26:34.169 --> 00:26:35.730
Slavic Studies department this guy is

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:37.799
like a boss [ __ ] the Slavs he's a

00:26:37.799 --> 00:26:40.289
boss linguist he's writing a book on the

00:26:40.289 --> 00:26:42.210
origin of the English language dude wait

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:44.070
a second so this is a professor of brown

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.289
studying slop I don't know the professor

00:26:46.289 --> 00:26:47.850
he's a professor at Columbia John

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:49.919
McWhorter his professor he's a white guy

00:26:49.919 --> 00:26:52.340
black dude a black dude studying Slavs

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.590
yeah so it seems like a seat of

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:57.270
privilege to be looking down upon the

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:59.610
Slavic people from an Ivy League

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:01.260
university and studying them that's a

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.940
very privileged McWhorter would not

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.289
disagree well McWhorter would just call

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:05.880
you gave her being a say no I privilege

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.350
it he doesn't from him and Lao it done

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.880
me and the Slavs would [ __ ] rise up

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.649
and behead him no but he's the only part

00:27:10.649 --> 00:27:13.080
he knows he loves a slob his his take on

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.210
his language stuff is so obscure he's he

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:17.279
was basically saying like I can say

00:27:17.279 --> 00:27:18.870
whatever I want because like no one else

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.580
knows the origins of like Slavic

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.830
language so I'm so needed in

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:24.690
universities that like what the [ __ ] are

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:26.730
people gonna say so he wrote a book on

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:29.760
me like etymology of basically like

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.909
proof like like bad words and like how

00:27:32.909 --> 00:27:34.860
like are curse words basically are just

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.899
a reflection of our deepest fears yeah

00:27:36.899 --> 00:27:38.850
like Voldemort basically so whenever

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:40.980
we're super like damn like he'll was the

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.510
scariest [ __ ] at one point so damn

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:44.700
people like oh don't say that yeah [ __ ]

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.980
like the weird sex thing so now he said

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.570
the obviously racial slurs are like the

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:50.789
big slurs now but he wrote he wrote a

00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:53.100
book about like how where they came from

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.320
how they originated and ice cream

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.669
grabbed him talking about it through the

00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:59.669
podcast love he loves using he uses the

00:27:59.669 --> 00:28:02.789
terms and it sounds so [ __ ] harsh

00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:04.140
when he says him but he's a black dude

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.539
he's just like I did it so [ __ ] funny

00:28:06.539 --> 00:28:09.390
slob was slave right what did they think

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:23.399
I think Slav like came from that whoa

00:28:23.399 --> 00:28:25.529
how he's rocking is that the new Louie's

00:28:25.529 --> 00:28:27.539
special no dude that's and then it was

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:29.309
like Glenn Lowry you're being like well

00:28:29.309 --> 00:28:31.740
I could see how you kind of take like

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.779
pride like you'd like to rid people by

00:28:33.779 --> 00:28:36.059
saying these words the B word [ __ ] the

00:28:36.059 --> 00:28:37.289
effort and he'll just say all of them

00:28:37.289 --> 00:28:39.029
himself so just two guys using all the

00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:40.380
slurs like an hour and just being like

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.700
well you know we're using it in a strict

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.679
scientific sense and they're black dudes

00:28:43.679 --> 00:28:45.120
dude I'm stuck on the slob

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.600
right now what's such a [ __ ]

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.610
historically they just got [ __ ] butt

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:53.190
[ __ ] for forever yeah I could be wrong

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:55.650
but I think I read somewhere that Slovak

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:57.450
like came from literally just slaves

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:00.180
yeah because the Roman Empire and then

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.830
the Russians and that like throughout

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:03.210
history they've just literally been a

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:06.270
land of people that were used by every

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:08.160
Empire around them probably like forever

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.010
yeah the Middle East will rise up grab

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:12.360
them they don't talk about that bruh oh

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.530
of course not when you talk about

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:15.480
empires there's one Empire bro they

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.910
don't bring out if you bring out reasons

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:18.870
not even though they only talk about the

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:20.700
Romans bro they talk about just colonial

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.530
forces in America if you bring up like

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.090
that when the Middle East was wiling out

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:26.040
people are just kind of like come on

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.380
dude you feel what that [ __ ] it was just

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.540
bizarre it's so [ __ ] they win how

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:33.990
about today yeah I know so I was like I

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.300
mean do tonight I hate you bring up the

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.030
slave workers in Qatar building the New

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:42.450
World Cup stadiums dr. Foley obviously

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:45.150
thousands of people dying anted yeah

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:48.210
and dude oh Jesus Christ so the the

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:51.660
thing we were watching was on al-jazeera

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.840
so it's sponsored by Qatar you felt like

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.179
we're watching our our scholarly sources

00:29:57.179 --> 00:30:01.980
are propaganda from Qatar and they're

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.780
I'm like this is weird we're basing our

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.840
things off of viral videos edited very

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.790
specifically from a certain narrative

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.620
that's not a very scholarly thing to do

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:12.929
and people are like you by thinking of

00:30:12.929 --> 00:30:15.720
these things in like like logical terms

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.340
is just offensive because you're denying

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:19.350
my experience so it's like okay

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:22.290
but even if everyone you know feels a

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:24.300
certain I can't even [ __ ] begin to

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.610
it's insane this bothers me dude and

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:27.750
then it but my thing is like you know

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.690
like well like someone from in this

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:33.570
setting I'm in your race carries power

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:35.850
in terms of what you're what you say how

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:38.580
much it matters so like if a if a black

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.230
lady is like get mad and tell her

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:42.330
feelings and like just freak out of me

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:44.070
it's taking us like well this has

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:45.360
happened to my family and everyone's

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.490
like well see and it's like okay if I

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.770
had come from like a Kentucky coal

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:51.090
mining town and I was like this is how

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:52.620
everyone I know thinks and believes that

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:54.120
doesn't make me right you know I mean

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.220
it's like so in these courses gun food

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:56.580
and

00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:00.600
when I said everyone I grew up with or

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.399
like where I'm from is Trump like

00:31:02.399 --> 00:31:04.380
everybody I know votes for Trump

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.899
oh yeah food did you know and I was like

00:31:06.899 --> 00:31:09.029
oh doing where someone's from that

00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:10.320
sounds like something a trump supporter

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:14.309
might do in your eyes I was like anyway

00:31:14.309 --> 00:31:18.029
you guys are being [ __ ] gay also

00:31:18.029 --> 00:31:19.529
Trump getting shot would be hilarious

00:31:19.529 --> 00:31:23.190
whoo yeah yeah man I'm telling you it's

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:25.169
like if you they're telling you so in

00:31:25.169 --> 00:31:26.760
this class you're not allowed to use you

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.350
have to suspend your logical faculties

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:30.960
you can't disagree faculties oh yeah

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:34.230
dude you can't be quiet you can't

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:36.029
disagree and you can't think about

00:31:36.029 --> 00:31:37.380
things logically because that's

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:40.289
offensive its literal political

00:31:40.289 --> 00:31:41.850
indoctrination like into a tea

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:44.460
indoctrination and imagine if you're 23

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.289
you're whole it's like you're social

00:31:46.289 --> 00:31:47.700
world I told the two of people my class

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.169
I'm like I don't really give a [ __ ] if

00:31:49.169 --> 00:31:50.580
anyone likes me like they're actually

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.139

I came here and like my girlfriend

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:03.240

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.570

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:08.460
everything dude the social pressures to

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.549
put a [ __ ] 18 year old in this is

00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:13.230

dude I'm at it I'm at odds where I'm

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:18.360
quiet that's privilege if I expect to be

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.700
able to do to speak honestly to speak

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:22.890
honestly or something is a privilege I

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:24.150
know you're not allowed to ever say it

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:26.610
about being Irish but you're people come

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:29.100
from a long line of I mean dude you know

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.350
rebelling dudes different there was

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:33.660

he was like someone threatened my mother

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.720
because she was Jewish and he was a

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.310
white guy so I don't understand why

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:48.300
you're trying to say that anti-semitism

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.370
isn't really a white problem and I was

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:52.470
like isn't strictly a white problem dude

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:54.270
I'm like do you want to see you guys

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:56.040
want to start listing times people of

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.690
certain colors did bad things to each

00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:58.950
other do you guys want to go down that

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:00.650
rabbit hole dude they're all just like

we're bad to us or is that a good I

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:13.320
[ __ ] idea as a Jewish person it's

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.830
like why don't you go live in a Muslim

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:19.020
country and pay an extra tax because of

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.390
your religion probably get [ __ ]

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:23.370
attacked whenever the new regime takes

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:26.070
over yeah or finally your [ __ ] head

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:27.450
cut off or to be like this [ __ ]

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:29.280
conservative white Christian forces like

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.840
dude go through the GOP and see how many

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.090
high ranking GOP members have dual

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:35.070
citizenship to Israel in the United

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.960
States there's a lot of Jewish Jews in

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:37.410
the Geo

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:39.540

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:58.350
dude go check the [ __ ] geo go look at

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.420

play both sides of the coin

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:27.390
stop presser and victim yeah which is

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:29.160
insane that whole way of looking at the

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.810
world is a [ __ ] yeah once the victim

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:34.530
became currency who do you think jumped

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:37.080
all over that yeah man I'm not saying

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:40.410
you you do the math it's they'd to why

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:42.150
again I'm watching it this whole thing

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:45.060
it sucks cuz you it's like it just sucks

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.200
having to deal with this stuff because

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.970
it's like it's so easily picked apart

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:49.410
like oh my god you think and it's like

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:51.750
dude I hear you there's a ton of idiots

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:53.250
on the other side of this I know this

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:54.900
but they're also not in control of

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:56.880
[ __ ] institutions right now like if I

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.830
were to have this a college where I just

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:00.960
like blasted Fox News all day and I'm

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.370
like you know check out Tucker on this

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:04.530
issue they would shut it down for Blake

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:06.210
this is insane what are you doing that's

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:08.430
my school just on the other side it's

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:10.560
like crazy bro something yeah I got it

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.260
I'm on time no it's [ __ ] crazy yeah

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.970
yo there [ __ ] I'm telling you they're

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:16.470
[ __ ] people up man people are getting

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:17.970
brainwashed and people now are

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:20.310
practicing it on businesses doing not of

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:22.530
our neighborhoods this Clark parks the

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:24.270
front lines of gentrification and it's

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:27.060
like no first of all no it's not second

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.290
that's a whole weird concept in and of

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:30.000
itself it's like if I'm vocation if a

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.400
white guy goes the whole thing the white

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.690
flight logic is like if a black person

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:35.370
moves in my neighborhood real estate

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:38.130
drops that's like the racist ideology

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:40.200
behind that but then on the reverse to

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.700
be like if white people move in real

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.530
estate rises you're kind of affirming

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:46.710
the racial the negative racist take that

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:48.300
like black people do values no no they

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:50.260
don't white people increase value

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:51.490
what the [ __ ] are you guys talking about

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:55.119
it's crazy dude I mean I'm looking it's

00:39:55.119 --> 00:39:56.170
just a weird thing to think of it that

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:56.500
way

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.720
who controls real estate predominantly

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:04.330
real tests I was a real test but no it's

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:06.550
dude it's like you know whatever the

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:07.690
only thing that makes sense is the

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:09.100
individual level and it's like if you

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:11.800
say that now that's us that's a you're

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.660
accused of colorblind racism and you're

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:14.980
like perpetuating white supremacy it's

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:17.020
like Jesus I can't dude they're [ __ ]

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:18.730
tying me down and every [ __ ] move

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:19.420
it's crazy

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.910
means how they do it are you talking

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:25.480
about the leftist yeah they control you

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.010
by just being like they have it they

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:28.480
have a card for everything you say yeah

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.550
you can hit him with it like you've said

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:31.900
like you can hit him with logic and

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:33.280
they'll just be like well you're racist

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.770
yeah that's it logic you're using logic

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:36.910
in a racial manner where you're

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:38.619
dismissing people the fact or even

00:40:38.619 --> 00:40:39.820
thinking about this logically is the

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:41.260
fact that you're cut off and cold and

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:44.440
numb and therefore perpetuated it's it's

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.450
crazy bro it's [ __ ] nuts anyway

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:47.830
that's not what I came to talk about did

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:49.420

if you shine the light no I did the same

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.410

hangover is not there which is pretty

00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:13.050
insane crazy about it yeah like the time

just like oh I'm the best I can't

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:28.170

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:31.110
yeah with a [ __ ] plastic container of

00:50:31.110 --> 00:50:33.330
Bute decks to my bed it's pretty insane

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:35.010
to think about it like you could work

00:50:35.010 --> 00:50:37.320
your whole entire life and like you know

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:39.090
get your house your necessities or just

00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:40.140
have like a bunch of people would be

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:43.620
like your brains only made to take so

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:45.150
much like you can only get so much like

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:47.340
serotonin happy feeling in your brain at

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:49.260
once you know what I mean yeah so it's

00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:50.790
like whether you're doing like that or

00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:52.320
like it's the same level it's the same

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.780
thing I talked to you about that uh that

00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:55.810
one bad thing

00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:58.120
in my life and then it felt the same as

00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.830
when I missed a homework assignment yeah

00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:01.630
exactly like it was the same level of

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:04.720
like dread and despair it was the same

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:06.640
thing yeah exactly that was of awfulness

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.290
or the same old I think well if you get

00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:10.540
like super like people get geeked out

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:11.920
about like I'm gonna get like super rich

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.420
and like I'll be happy it just gives you

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:15.820
access to novelty so then you can like

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:18.130
you can seek novel things and keep that

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:19.750
buzz going but then once it flatlines

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:21.670
you're just like I really like I'm

00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:22.900
waking up with three chicks on my bed it

00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:24.280
just becomes like that's your everyday

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:26.560
thing yes it just you averaged out real

00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:28.480
quick again yeah well I was not waking

pleasing three women at once and being

00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:57.310
like oh man they're pretty good for you

00:51:57.310 --> 00:52:00.340

00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:10.090
like when you get done you're with three

00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:13.110
women all looking at your flaccid dick

00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:15.700
yeah gotta be a real psycho to be like

again like a lot of Tina's pride they

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:24.930
should have a Tina's pride parade I

00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:28.510
thought that they do I think they do

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:30.250
have a smallest dick contest someone saw

00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:33.010
that I really bugged me now yeah I would

00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:35.560
not want to I don't understand what's

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:37.300
the price has to be a hundred thousand

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:39.310
dollars the price should be a million

00:52:39.310 --> 00:52:41.770
dollars smallest penis and Brooklyn or

00:52:41.770 --> 00:52:43.270
whatever it was you should be like

00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:48.310
alright give that guy you know but uh no

00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:49.660
the whole thing was sick it was awesome

00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:50.260
ya just

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:53.590
it was winning when it was winning it

00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:54.760
was awesome

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:57.400
yeah and then uh yeah man there's

00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:58.840
there's nothing really to report on that

00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:01.990
nothing bad nothing bad other than

00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:04.720
saying [ __ ] once well that'll be an

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.190
interesting thing to watch that play out

00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:08.780
in terms of like the

00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:10.610
the people I'm describing who I'm

00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:12.320
watching it kind of like indoctrinated

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:15.020
and there's like like how that's gonna

00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:16.640
affect on a consumer level because

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:17.930
they're gonna have this weird buying

00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:19.730
power or they're gonna in my appeal

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:21.290
seeing it already we're seeing it

00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:23.150
already but dude give another couple

00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:25.400
like give it a whole generation of

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.630
college people coming through that but I

00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:28.700
think like do don't want to run into

00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:32.600
this in the sixties of what of like

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:34.490
universities dropping [ __ ] hard

00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:36.080
Marxism oh yeah for sure

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.480
I mean haven't they always well they did

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:40.790
that but now the it's scaled at a point

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:43.310
where it's like the majority of do now

00:53:43.310 --> 00:53:44.750
it was like they were doing it in the

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:46.130
60s and people were like oh my god this

00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:48.620
is crazy now that's the core curricula

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:50.780
at least in like humanities and you know

00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:52.040
I can only speak for social well yeah

00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:54.380
that time more curricula the kids that

00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:56.540
were hippies in college back then yeah

00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:59.240
are now the professors yes and now

00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:00.950
there's their control professors Dean's

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:03.290
and now they're shaping the the whole

00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:04.940
institution around these wild political

00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:06.650
theories which is like dude this stuff's

00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:07.970
cooler you can read all this stuff it's

00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:09.590
cool to learn but you don't have to get

00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:11.210
all [ __ ] gung-ho on this as like this

00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:13.580
is my only [ __ ] it's [ __ ] crazy yeah

00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:15.050
it's also crazy too like I look up these

00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:17.960
professors dude they're the one teachers

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:19.460
writing about how they were [ __ ] the

00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:21.170
Communists and Marxist NYU professor

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:23.270
simple Google surgeon makes two hundred

00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:24.500
forty thousand dollars a year I'm like

00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:25.970
okay so you're a communist

00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:27.830
professor making two hundred forty

00:54:27.830 --> 00:54:29.870
thousand dollars a year doesn't sound

00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:31.430
like you're a communist professor and

00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:33.380
then the lady who wrote the knapsack of

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:36.140
white privilege I can't think of her

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:38.180
name some like old lady with a an Irish

00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:39.740
name I can't think of it definitely I

00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:41.930
said the n-word I googled her may she

00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:43.430
might have I googled her what the [ __ ]

00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:46.370
her peggy mcintosh i google it was real

00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:47.960
quick I'm like it was like one of the

00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:50.180
tenants of it was like it was like it

00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:52.370
was like 40 or you know like 20 things

00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:55.340
of like I can be sure to arrange to be

00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:56.780
in the company of people my own race if

00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:58.190
I want most of the time for most of the

00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:59.750
day like you know if you're black I

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:01.250
can't do it whatever one of the tenants

00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:04.070
was like if I want a publisher for this

00:55:04.070 --> 00:55:05.540
piece on white privilege I'm pretty sure

00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:06.920
I can find a publisher and get it

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.890
published I'm like like that's that's

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:11.330
and not everyone has access so Paul

00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:12.590
that's a weird thing that be like well

00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:13.880
after white you get anything you want

00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:15.140
published which is like that insane

00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:17.360
thing to think Google real quick comes

00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:20.060
from a town in New Jersey one of the

00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:21.740
hundreds of hundred reaches places in

00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:22.309
America

00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:25.609
of her grade school now costs six six to

00:55:25.609 --> 00:55:29.329
12th grade cost $42,000 a year this is

00:55:29.329 --> 00:55:31.130
an elite dude yeah and these elite

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:33.949
people are forming these like what's the

00:55:33.949 --> 00:55:36.079
like core curricula for like what it is

00:55:36.079 --> 00:55:37.069
to be white and it's like no you're

00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:39.039
Harvard educated elite from like a

00:55:39.039 --> 00:55:41.299
unbelievably rich town and you're like

00:55:41.299 --> 00:55:42.859
well it's easy to be white and it's like

00:55:42.859 --> 00:55:45.499
yeah if you're [ __ ] that loaded it's

00:55:45.499 --> 00:55:47.390
easier but I think to the the picture

00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:48.680
they paint of it it's just what it's

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:51.140
like to be a generational wealth and

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:52.759
it's like again you pointed this out in

00:55:52.759 --> 00:55:56.180

00:56:02.059 --> 00:56:03.229
and start showing how they're basically

00:56:03.229 --> 00:56:05.239
elites the that's one like the people in

00:56:05.239 --> 00:56:06.769

I don't I don't want people to act like

00:56:21.019 --> 00:56:22.459

people need to have like we need like

00:56:34.579 --> 00:56:36.979
creative solutions not just like [ __ ]

00:56:36.979 --> 00:56:39.380
people parroting propaganda that doesn't

00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:41.029
do anything I came up with the house

00:56:41.029 --> 00:56:42.199
need I tell you what my housing program

00:56:42.199 --> 00:56:44.380
I came up with no bro it's it's like

00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:47.749
absolutely it's I can't I sorry I'm like

00:56:47.749 --> 00:56:49.819
[ __ ] coming thinking about it so you

00:56:49.819 --> 00:56:50.809
know I used to work for the program

00:56:50.809 --> 00:56:53.059
where I help people get housing yeah and

00:56:53.059 --> 00:56:54.529
it was like you know we would give him

00:56:54.529 --> 00:56:55.729
the first six months of rent and then

00:56:55.729 --> 00:56:57.589
hook him up with a landlord who would

00:56:57.589 --> 00:57:00.079
just like total you a lot of times not

00:57:00.079 --> 00:57:01.309
all the landlords one of them was really

00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:02.719
cool a lot of emergencies like scummy

00:57:02.719 --> 00:57:04.729
type dudes who are like slumlord types

00:57:04.729 --> 00:57:07.130
so my idea was that happened that you

00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:08.749
know so and then every time a person

00:57:08.749 --> 00:57:10.969
would walk in the organization will get

00:57:10.969 --> 00:57:12.709
$200 no matter what occurred if they got

00:57:12.709 --> 00:57:14.029
housing or not and then they just hook

00:57:14.029 --> 00:57:15.349
you up with something like sketched out

00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:16.729
landlord who's gonna put you in a shitty

00:57:16.729 --> 00:57:19.699
place in like a high heroin area so high

00:57:19.699 --> 00:57:21.619
heroin a that's very Western thinking of

00:57:21.619 --> 00:57:23.449
you excuse me sorry if you saw Stern

00:57:23.449 --> 00:57:25.279
that's just just another this is another

00:57:25.279 --> 00:57:27.829
debuted unless I had maybe the England

00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:29.929
ends are very Eastern and they're good

00:57:29.929 --> 00:57:32.299
well the English the English may have

00:57:32.299 --> 00:57:36.500
came in a they supplied but boy took off

00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:39.890
they enjoy it they enjoyed it it [ __ ]

00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:41.780
worked yeah so then some I think will be

00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:44.540
an organization that buys housing that's

00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:45.920
you definitely like a big grant you buy

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:48.080
housing so say a house is $40,000 like a

00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:50.300
shell buy it fix it up at 3040 into it

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.700
naive a house for $80,000 you totally

00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:54.770
disregard the market I lost my stop to

00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:56.270
listen you understand I'm saying I

00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:57.650
didn't unless I wasn't listening the

00:57:57.650 --> 00:58:00.590
$40,000 house 40,000 and repairs the

00:58:00.590 --> 00:58:02.359
organization now who is finding people

00:58:02.359 --> 00:58:04.970
housing doesn't go to landlords they

00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:07.580
just build structures and price them as

00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:09.650
the physical thing that they are so like

00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:11.590
if I build a house it's physically worth

00:58:11.590 --> 00:58:15.140
$80,000 the comparables might be like a

00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:17.090
hundred thousand you totally get outside

00:58:17.090 --> 00:58:19.310
of the market you just you rent someone

00:58:19.310 --> 00:58:20.869
a house that you built they pay you rent

00:58:20.869 --> 00:58:22.400
for two years and if they actually are

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:23.690
able to pay the rent and they're like

00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:25.250
cool with it two years you hit them with

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:26.930
the title and you hold the organization

00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:28.310
holds the mortgage and these people have

00:58:28.310 --> 00:58:30.740
access to homeownership and then they

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:32.119
can go and sell their house and you know

00:58:32.119 --> 00:58:33.349
they'd have access so well thing would

00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:35.090
be a nonprofit that would be sustainable

00:58:35.090 --> 00:58:36.349
but you don't you would tack on

00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:38.869
technical profit utaite you understand

00:58:38.869 --> 00:58:40.430
I'm saying this makes no no no I just

00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:40.880
don't

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:43.369
what is this is it would be its it so

00:58:43.369 --> 00:58:44.960
this is in class when I tell people I'm

00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:47.270
like you guys have like no solutions to

00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:48.589
any of these probably talk about housing

00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:50.150
and security the wealth well at the

00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:52.609
racial wealth gap it's like here's an

00:58:52.609 --> 00:58:54.410
idea that we can actually work is a

00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:56.660
concrete idea that doesn't rely on these

00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:59.330
weirdo neo-marxist properties that can

00:58:59.330 --> 00:59:01.910
operate within a capitalistic framework

00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:05.540
and undercut and just totally disregard

00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:06.920
the market this is like next-level [ __ ]

00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:08.510
dude yeah I don't think you understand

00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:12.710
it's like I'm telling you I don't know

00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:13.970
you lost me at the beginning when I

00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:16.099
wasn't listening why I don't know I

00:59:16.099 --> 00:59:17.869
wasn't for school I'm not too cool for

00:59:17.869 --> 00:59:18.200
school

00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.700
what's in your head right now nothing

00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:21.050
what I'm gonna dive in no I'm doing a

00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:22.760
deep dive I live what's in your head

00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:24.560
nothing's in my what's going on nothing

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:27.589
I know something Tony I wasn't early on

00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:29.119
in the probably thinking explaining this

00:59:29.119 --> 00:59:32.900
what were you thinking I was I looked at

00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:40.369
a text it down down hang up and drive

00:59:40.369 --> 00:59:44.540
dude so you have this plan and I get it

00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:45.770
I understood the plan okay

00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:49.490
the plan you get it yes guard the house

00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:50.330
the spec you

00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:52.400
nature of the housing market I wasn't

00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.440
regarding it tomorrow anyway it's

00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.270
naturally it's how you build a house and

00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:58.640
it's like it cost me this much for some

00:59:58.640 --> 00:59:59.870
reason since they built these weird

00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:01.490
space-age looking structures now this

01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:02.650
whole place is technically worth

01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:05.060
$300,000 sure so when people talk about

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.290
the problem of gentrification is

01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:08.060
basically poor people are placeholders

01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:10.160
for people with money to come in and be

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.930
like oh there's [ __ ] there's a shitty

01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:12.920
neighborhood there and there's one

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.810
that's not that shitty so I can destroy

01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:16.220
that whole neighborhood and then build

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:17.750
nicer stuff but the neighborhood's

01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:19.220
really plagued with like real crime so

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:20.180
it's like you know it's not like there's

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:22.040
as evil as people say they are yeah so

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.320
it's like you would actually fix up

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.540
housing without completely just like

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:28.460
displacing people totally and then let

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:30.140
people get access to their own source of

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:31.730
wealth and homeownership and that would

01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:33.230
probably help people take pride in like

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:34.820
a [ __ ] up shitty neighborhood since

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:36.260
they actually now own the places and

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:37.340
everything's kind of getting fixed up

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:40.220
yes and so nobody loses money it's just

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.630
an organization that and this is the

01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:43.930
whole idea basically where it's like

01:00:43.930 --> 01:00:47.450
there would be like a slight so the

01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:49.880
house was like 40 40 baht 40 to fix up

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:51.710
$80,000 you sell it for 90 the

01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:53.510
organization gets $10,000 to keep the

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:56.240
organization going and it's like rather

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.440
than trying to kill it on like an

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.880
investor level it's just like how can I

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.620
get a job where I'm just chilling I

01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:01.730
don't want to like kill myself in a

01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:03.740
cubicle so that's good I think gonna be

01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:05.150
the switch from people and like the just

01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:06.470
like there's no reason for people to sit

01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:08.480
in boxes anymore all day we're like you

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:09.620
can start programs and do other

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:11.570
businesses that like if you rather get

01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:13.040
out of the mentality of like I'm gonna

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.690
make as much money as humanly possible

01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:16.970
it like a total like zero-sum game or

01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:18.980
like I win you lose if they people can

01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:20.690
figure out nonzero-sum games and play

01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:22.820
them then you know it's like you just

01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:24.410
don't go for a ton of money you just go

01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:25.430
for it you know just enough to pay your

01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:27.260
bills and go on vacation and [ __ ] yeah

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:30.050
and everyone wins dude it's like what

01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:31.910
the [ __ ] I I'm like I'm this is a grant

01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:33.080
dude you could write and do this as a

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.430
program and you know get a million

01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:36.350
dollar grants you should do it I'm going

01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:38.450
to no I'm fully going to do this program

01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:40.010
once I get done school it's oh looks

01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:41.300
like in spud hit me with a good idea to

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:43.370
build like basically start out with

01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:44.600
condos so you know people aren't in

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.680
charge of like the repairs and

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.300
everything it's like you buy condos 200

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:47.660
grand

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:49.780
you're in your mortgage on that is like

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:52.670
800 bucks versus paying like 1500 from

01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:54.980
like a [ __ ] [ __ ] landlord yeah and

01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:55.970
it's like and then it's like if you

01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:57.500
don't [ __ ] up if you [ __ ] up you're out

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.000
so this isn't babying anyone if you [ __ ]

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.430
up by foreclose gone new person goes in

01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:03.150
but if people can do it

01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:05.430
you have a crib you paid it off now when

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:08.310
someone [ __ ] up it's just a good Morgan

01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:10.710
who owns the property then so it's just

01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:12.660
like a bank if you if I'm in the house

01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:14.940
now I have a mortgage on if I slack then

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:17.460
yeah but is your is your company or your

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:19.350
it would be the bank it would also offer

01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:21.570
the mortgages okay so would you say it's

01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:22.920
possible for like a corrupt shitty

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.350
person to be like hey you [ __ ] up yes

01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:27.540
in towards the end of year to being like

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:29.430
oh you [ __ ] up now it's mine yeah but

01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:30.720
that's why I'd have to do it in this

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.280
program but you're the one of us this

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.680
program would have to be wholly

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:36.450
transparent because dude the possibility

01:02:36.450 --> 01:02:38.610
for corruption is so insane when you

01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:40.170
step outside of the market and now your

01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:41.970
dick you're like being like forget about

01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:44.220
all that extra money the pasta I mean do

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:45.660
the schemes that could come out of that

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:50.460
or just unreal isn't that why like

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:53.490
communism and socialism tend to fail a

01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:55.050
little but this isn't this isn't

01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:57.090
communism it's like a suspension of

01:02:57.090 --> 01:02:59.190
capitalistic properties in like almost a

01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:01.740
vacuum and then you just step back if

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:02.940
that may give it when the corruption

01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:05.670
takes place but it would be hard to it

01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:07.710
would be hard to rupture is gonna take

01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:08.160
place

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.810
yeah but how though it's like it would

01:03:09.810 --> 01:03:11.460
be hard to corrupt these things cuz it's

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:12.810
like you have someone now who's there

01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:14.160
just instead of paying rent they're

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.200
paying you and then rather paying you're

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.240
just acting as like a landlord kind of

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:18.630
bank

01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:20.220
we're like you're not just taking the

01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:21.930

taking the one you're living there but

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:26.460
then it's like boom it comes back to you

01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:27.720
in the form of home ownership and equity

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.000
and then you would get a salary you know

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.500
they did a lot of the corruption from

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.670
that comes from people getting like two

01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:34.080
hundred thousand dollar salaries we're

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.060

my heart happy and you're in a [ __ ]

01:05:20.339 --> 01:05:22.469
monotonous life which most people are

01:05:22.469 --> 01:05:25.380

we've had this conversation a bunch

01:05:31.859 --> 01:05:34.140

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:36.089

so like working hard at it was easy

01:05:39.479 --> 01:05:41.190
because if I worked hard at something

01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:42.959

01:05:42.959 --> 01:05:45.539

you got a double buckle down and no that

01:05:58.799 --> 01:06:00.779

they're talking about people who there's

01:06:21.839 --> 01:06:24.180
like a 20 or 30% of people grow up and

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:25.979
for some reason from like the the way

01:06:25.979 --> 01:06:28.410
they're brought up

01:06:28.410 --> 01:06:30.000

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.650
that like if they are anything less than

01:06:31.650 --> 01:06:33.060
spectacular they're like worthless

01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:35.790

01:09:55.949 --> 01:09:58.409
listening I closed my eyes and it like

01:09:58.409 --> 01:10:00.980
was like a colorful like kaleidoscope

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:05.219
that was going with the music screen

01:10:05.219 --> 01:10:08.400
saver it was not stood what you was wild

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.650
and I put on today I was like just like

01:10:10.650 --> 01:10:13.980
to do a soundtrack and I was like I

01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:15.570
started laughing so follows like this

01:10:15.570 --> 01:10:17.550
dude funniest thing to seek out and

01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:18.719
listen to while you're tripping the

01:10:18.719 --> 01:10:20.400
highest funny headphones could go

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:26.159
listening to that like you're by

01:10:26.159 --> 01:10:27.989
yourself like this is so nice

01:10:27.989 --> 01:10:30.030
well it was nice but I was also hitting

01:10:30.030 --> 01:10:32.940
levels of like I was I remember I was

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:35.460
staring at we're also in kind of a good

01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:38.340
place to like even a trout mushrooms now

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:40.440
it's like this wide open world you're

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:42.449
like oh my god it was yeah I mean coming

01:10:42.449 --> 01:10:44.520
off like I would say the best week of my

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:44.790
life

01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:46.980
yeah and I was laying in bed and I was

01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:48.670
just staring into the corner

01:10:48.670 --> 01:10:51.400
it was like complete blackness and I was

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:55.690
just like darkness consumes light like

01:10:55.690 --> 01:10:58.630
darkness is death the blackness but it's

01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:01.300
not malicious death and evil isn't

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:05.550
malicious we just call it evil

01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:09.790
I think dying isn't bad very Eastern it

01:11:09.790 --> 01:11:12.730
was dude it was oh my but then I switch

01:11:12.730 --> 01:11:14.320
to Western so I was going to Eastern I

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.670
was like dying is not bad the the

01:11:15.670 --> 01:11:17.980
darkness consuming the light because the

01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:19.480
darkness and death isn't malicious

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.550
surely there's no agenda sure it just

01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:25.480
kills ya and consumes and I was like but

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:29.920
then that is evil it is my Christian by

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:32.980
nature the darkness is evil because it's

01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:34.239
consuming the light even if it's

01:11:34.239 --> 01:11:36.940
malignant malicious in doing what it's

01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:43.510
doing it's still bad it was a real dude

01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:46.570
yes moments like where you're high and

01:11:46.570 --> 01:11:49.300
you fully grasp a concept yes like I

01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:50.770
knew that going into that the thing I

01:11:50.770 --> 01:11:52.630
just said wasn't a new revelation sure

01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:54.280
but I was high enough to fully grasp

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:57.219
exactly totally understanding yeah well

01:11:57.219 --> 01:11:59.110
that's the that was David Foster

01:11:59.110 --> 01:12:00.520
Wallace's big thing when he went to like

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:02.410
rehab and he was like listening to all

01:12:02.410 --> 01:12:03.730
these stupid like one-day-at-a-time

01:12:03.730 --> 01:12:05.890
things and he's like there's you know

01:12:05.890 --> 01:12:07.210
you can hear him that's stupid

01:12:07.210 --> 01:12:08.530
when you one light and that's I think

01:12:08.530 --> 01:12:09.850
would like those kind of things do it

01:12:09.850 --> 01:12:12.460
like you take the most mundane thing and

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:14.500
then you like feel it on this weird

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:17.080
level we're like oh my god yeah true

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:19.390
yeah it's weird it's a whole different

01:12:19.390 --> 01:12:20.710
thing I was thinking about love and how

01:12:20.710 --> 01:12:23.199
like not so nice loving people yeah I do

01:12:23.199 --> 01:12:26.070
love these people yeah yeah it was nice

01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:27.850
fantastically nice dude the fact that

01:12:27.850 --> 01:12:29.469
you broke away and went [ __ ] his

01:12:29.469 --> 01:12:32.170
roguish well - my dog [ __ ] funny are

01:12:32.170 --> 01:12:35.130
you'd cavern and explored the universe

01:12:35.130 --> 01:12:39.160
blasting the annihilation on a loop like

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:48.040
a 12-minute loop of disney an autistic

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:50.920
fish oh man that's fans Lyle what a good

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:52.840
[ __ ] week your best like I said

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:54.130
probably the best week of my life

01:12:54.130 --> 01:12:56.500
damn every day that's [ __ ] every day was

01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:57.760
a sick [ __ ] show

01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.739
that was the last night he flew out of

01:12:59.739 --> 01:13:02.500
there yeah drove the next more

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:05.350
you'll drive back from Old Montreal to

01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:06.940
New York nice seven hours

01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:09.430
oh you drove up there I flew up but I

01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:10.870
knew I had a feeling I was gonna get

01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:13.450
added to shows ah so after my last new

01:13:13.450 --> 01:13:14.980
faces would have been when my flight was

01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:16.930
yeah which would have been like a day or

01:13:16.930 --> 01:13:19.000
two earlier than when I left so any flew

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.800
so then I think he's like [ __ ] because

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.480
then I tried to buy a flight on Sunday

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:23.830
and it was like eight hundred dollars

01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:29.140
well we all do grab the back seat of a

01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:32.170
van with a lady and her mother well and

01:13:32.170 --> 01:13:34.270
they chatted the whole way no radio

01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:35.500

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:38.620

01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:45.490
and I took some sleeping pills not crazy

01:13:45.490 --> 01:13:46.870
ones sure it's like over-the-counter

01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:48.640
[ __ ] like tylenol PMS do you know

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.380
that knocked out the whole way listen to

01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:54.730
the [ __ ] stink tank dude listen to

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:56.590
the patreon I don't I don't know I

01:13:56.590 --> 01:13:58.510
should have done like a preamble at

01:13:58.510 --> 01:13:59.860
first I don't think people some people

01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:01.270
don't think realize that like how

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:02.980
[ __ ] high how [ __ ] high we all

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:04.540
were there's like multiple people about

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.370
an area one out multiple people were on

01:14:06.370 --> 01:14:09.940
mushrooms items by the way what's the

01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:12.010
holdup on mushrooms I dude what is the

01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:14.200
possible repercussion I don't understand

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.640
what is the downside of mushroom it's

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.500
like eat well when I was 19 I was like

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:18.610
trying to convince my friends let me

01:14:18.610 --> 01:14:21.280
climb a water tower but stuff like that

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.110
but you know if they had if they figured

01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:24.310
that out we're like here's where you go

01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:25.780
do them go do them here I think people

01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:27.760
dig all right this is cool so you get to

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:28.960
like that point where you're like I

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.760
should climb a water tower I was 19 and

01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:33.430
I like but it was I I couldn't when I

01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:35.650
was 10 when I was 19 I was like the

01:14:35.650 --> 01:14:37.390
whole I was like damn so that's like a

01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:40.300
that's like a normal drunk idea yeah it

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:41.920
was an idea I would have now what have

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:43.480
long it was funny cuz they were like

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:44.770
you're gonna get in trouble and I was

01:14:44.770 --> 01:14:46.990
like trouble by who

01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:49.960
what do you mean by that trouble there

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.520
literally I was like I can't but like

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:53.560
someone's going to like hold me

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.330
somewhere he's gonna put you in a cave I

01:14:55.330 --> 01:14:58.120
was like what for climbing a water tower

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.670
dude it was it was like but honestly

01:15:00.670 --> 01:15:02.920
it's like that's like if you do that

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:04.600
might live the amount of people who will

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.130
try to like jump out of a window versus

01:15:06.130 --> 01:15:08.170
like drunk drivers it's very negligible

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.749
dude very negligent everything

01:15:09.749 --> 01:15:12.299
very necklace so yeah there that's come

01:15:12.299 --> 01:15:14.279
with her I think 20 20 20 I got some

01:15:14.279 --> 01:15:16.019
more with me right now do you really I

01:15:16.019 --> 01:15:17.489

kind of like a purposeful move to like

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:29.290
be like he's here something they said if

01:17:29.290 --> 01:17:30.640
you say they'll perceive it as race you

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:32.050
do that and then never gonna freak out

01:17:32.050 --> 01:17:33.430
and they'll make them won't be able to

01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:35.050
be like yeah you guys said it they

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:36.580
should start doing that I mean I think

01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:38.050
there's people trust me there are people

01:17:38.050 --> 01:17:39.610

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:44.590
of people like of like manipulation and

01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:46.150
[ __ ] like they're these are not dumb

01:17:46.150 --> 01:17:47.410

this Lana if Trump pandering or however

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:59.140
he does it lowers like [ __ ] time in

01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:01.360
prison for wheat charges if he like

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:04.000
starts releasing you know black guys

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.680
that have been in jail for 50 years for

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:06.640
weed yeah

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.500
regardless of why he's doing it it

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:10.630
doesn't matter yeah you can look at it

01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:11.860
be like how he's [ __ ] pandering with

01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:13.330
all these you know he's talking to Kanye

01:19:13.330 --> 01:19:15.160
West and Kim Kardashian about prison

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:17.650
Reformation it's like who gives a [ __ ]

01:19:17.650 --> 01:19:20.260
years of all three of them are [ __ ]

01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:23.620
retards which probably kind of are sure

01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:26.020
they're all I mean Kanye actually you

01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:27.790
gotta give Kim credit to kind of a

01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:28.810
[ __ ] savant

01:19:28.810 --> 01:19:31.600
just lots of on did absolute [ __ ]

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:34.239
horse along yeah that'll do even while

01:19:34.239 --> 01:19:35.409
she did the dinner

01:19:35.409 --> 01:19:38.170
or you know there's a loophole in a in

01:19:38.170 --> 01:19:41.920
law that if you you can skip law school

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:43.690
if you go I think it's I forget what it

01:19:43.690 --> 01:19:45.520
is it's Florida and Vermont to stay

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:46.719
there's two states where you can just

01:19:46.719 --> 01:19:48.730
study for the bar and take it and then

01:19:48.730 --> 01:19:50.469
apprenticed under a lawyer and skip law

01:19:50.469 --> 01:19:51.940
school altogether really you can become

01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:52.929
a lawyer that way this is Kim Kardashian

01:19:52.929 --> 01:19:53.710
a lawyer

01:19:53.710 --> 01:19:55.000
I think she's gonna try to become a

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.100
lawyer through that loophole which is a

01:19:57.100 --> 01:19:58.360
sick way to absolutely it's an

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.670
old-school way to go little [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:20:00.670 --> 01:20:03.280
she's apprenticea what did you hear I'll

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:04.960
sign yes sure your anything you want

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:05.770
here you go

01:20:05.770 --> 01:20:07.360
you win yeah man well that's a weird

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:10.030
thing to with I can't again as long as

01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:13.330
the result is exactly who cares dude

01:20:13.330 --> 01:20:14.679
people that get into personality

01:20:14.679 --> 01:20:17.260
politics are just smarter WWF fans if

01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:19.239
you were invested in a politician's

01:20:19.239 --> 01:20:22.510
personality you're dumb or you're just a

01:20:22.510 --> 01:20:25.360
message Trump daddy dude is the ultimate

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:26.860
sass it's the same Trump is just the

01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:29.170
Undertaker drew like [ __ ] you know if

01:20:29.170 --> 01:20:30.400
you're like a super level you can I

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:31.540
guess you like the Green Street posse

01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:33.550
whatever it is it's like or do you think

01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:35.020
the Liberals we're getting behind all

01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:35.949
these weird person everything

01:20:35.949 --> 01:20:38.080
corporation that'd be the McMahons dude

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:38.800
for sure

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.630
so our hold said it before I'll say it

01:20:40.630 --> 01:20:42.190
again dude if your revolution sponsored

01:20:42.190 --> 01:20:44.139
by major corporations you may be looking

01:20:44.139 --> 01:20:45.790
into a little bit but it's like Google

01:20:45.790 --> 01:20:47.350
yeah maybe Google that's kind of weird

01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:51.100
uh-oh Trump stone cold dude there's no

01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:51.880
doubt in my mind

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:55.150
Donald Trump politician cory booker's

01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:57.580
arguing for forty Booker is nation of

01:20:57.580 --> 01:21:00.159
domination like that [ __ ] real gay

01:21:00.159 --> 01:21:05.400
rock Cory Booker's are arguing for

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:08.199
Federation did oh say this is mankind

01:21:08.199 --> 01:21:10.840
for sure dude he's [ __ ] grumpy ass

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:12.670
keeps losing but it's everyone's like oh

01:21:12.670 --> 01:21:17.889
yeah yeah the Booker's coming he's offer

01:21:17.889 --> 01:21:19.449
ease arguing for full federal

01:21:19.449 --> 01:21:21.400
legalization and like wiping the slate

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:22.540
clean on weed altogether

01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:24.219
I think Trump's gonna do that - I think

01:21:24.219 --> 01:21:25.719
Trump's gonna pull out at the last

01:21:25.719 --> 01:21:28.210
minute a full I think 2020 I'm this is

01:21:28.210 --> 01:21:30.610
my prediction 2020 is gonna be federal

01:21:30.610 --> 01:21:32.380
legalization it's gonna drop because

01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:34.120
right now in California I don't even

01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:35.230
know if you're polite like how [ __ ] up

01:21:35.230 --> 01:21:36.969
the wheat market is right now California

01:21:36.969 --> 01:21:39.040
projected I think getting only drugs I

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:42.370
get are for free from fans handed to do

01:21:42.370 --> 01:21:45.130
that shows yeah you would I'm out of

01:21:45.130 --> 01:21:47.980
that California projected I see there

01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:49.330
500 million or a billion

01:21:49.330 --> 01:21:51.100
a big number yeah they ended up getting

01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:54.280
only like a hundred million dollars from

01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.350
their taxable legal weed so they were

01:21:56.350 --> 01:21:58.810
like [ __ ] this so now they're putting

01:21:58.810 --> 01:22:00.220
all this pressure on like the illegal

01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:02.290
weed farms in California so now

01:22:02.290 --> 01:22:03.580
apparently like they're it's just like

01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:05.200
hard to get weed for people now because

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:06.550
they're like setting up like there's

01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:07.960
roadblocks going they're putting like

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:09.610
they just like took a lot of that

01:22:09.610 --> 01:22:10.750
hundred million dollars and like

01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:13.060
militarized a presence over wheat

01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:14.770
growers to because they're about to go I

01:22:14.770 --> 01:22:16.240
think they're gonna go federal on it so

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:17.470
they're shutting down all the black

01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:19.270
market participants and then they're

01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:21.370
gonna go federal everything's taxed and

01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:22.900
you know blah blah blah blah which is

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:25.540
hilarious because at the end of the day

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:26.830
all you have to do to compete with the

01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:27.910
government is playing a seed in the

01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:29.920
ground in your house so it's like it is

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:32.260
a [ __ ] insane business model it's a

01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:33.940
business model based on pure domination

01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:35.980
when in reality it's like we could the

01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:39.490
price of it's strictly because someone

01:22:39.490 --> 01:22:40.750
will come [ __ ] you up if you grow it

01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:43.060
that's only reasoning so expensive yeah

01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:44.920
so it's like they're they're cracking

01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:46.330
down on all the counties of California

01:22:46.330 --> 01:22:47.800
wheat growers were just the ones

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:49.660
basically growing like 80% of the weed

01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:51.820
in the country because they were and

01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:53.230
you'd have like dude right now you have

01:22:53.230 --> 01:22:55.390
a solid net flix talks exactly you've

01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:57.310
watch dude you have Washington next to

01:22:57.310 --> 01:22:59.860
Idaho and Idaho it's illegal Washington

01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:01.660
it's fully legal that's that's like dude

01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:02.830
you couldn't set up a better black

01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:04.570
market transaction than that yeah you

01:23:04.570 --> 01:23:07.270
can just drive across into Idaho that's

01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:09.250
like driving to Delaware and with

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:11.320
leaving a state where Wiis legal yeah

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:12.490
you would just crush it you could just

01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:14.020
send it all out be like if Chipotle was

01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:16.540
illegal in Delaware exactly exactly

01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:19.060
right right here go down there sell it

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:20.590
to those [ __ ] [ __ ] it's it's the

01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:23.230
dumbest you want guac dude come on yeah

01:23:23.230 --> 01:23:25.480
that's like that's a little extra shiny

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:29.200
light the [ __ ] clock did walk but

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:30.760
yeah mance is like that's right I think

01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:32.320
2020 there are no full legalization

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.820
federal legalization to the drug

01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:37.210
sniffing dogs it's just fat dudes some

01:23:37.210 --> 01:23:39.370
cops like I hold on or just make the

01:23:39.370 --> 01:23:47.140
call it's just a smoke yes I think but

01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:48.520
Trump's whole thing is that like I have

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:49.750
no problem with marijuana

01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:50.800
decriminalization but it should be

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:52.540
handled at a state level so that's a

01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:55.300
politic II answer to be like we'll keep

01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:57.130
like rating people and doing all this

01:23:57.130 --> 01:23:59.410
weird federal [ __ ] but then like states

01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:01.000
can do it it's you know big states

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.740
rights guy

01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:05.320
yeah not hehe isn't I don't think he's

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:06.190
anything exactly

01:24:06.190 --> 01:24:08.860
he's obviously nothing what you said it

01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:10.990
comes to what he doesn't want other than

01:24:10.990 --> 01:24:12.790
just pure [ __ ] Dominic rushing him

01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:14.380
being the personal dominant not even

01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:17.170
[ __ ] you know he doesn't guarantee

01:24:17.170 --> 01:24:18.640
doesn't give a [ __ ] about how much power

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:20.680
the federal government has he only cares

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:22.720
about his [ __ ] power sure

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:28.330
pure sassy percent yeah but him if he if

01:24:28.330 --> 01:24:31.450
he goes [ __ ] it I'm federally legalizing

01:24:31.450 --> 01:24:35.080
weed bro it's gonna be like that's gonna

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.330
be uh that'll be a big deal for him I

01:24:37.330 --> 01:24:39.190
wonder is that how much that'll [ __ ] him

01:24:39.190 --> 01:24:41.950
though with his base he's polling man a

01:24:41.950 --> 01:24:43.390
lot of these people don't care about

01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:45.610
this anymore cuz you can spin it so easy

01:24:45.610 --> 01:24:47.230
on that Christian base and being like

01:24:47.230 --> 01:24:49.600
this is a plant from God it's about time

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:53.110
through the all you got to do is pay the

01:24:53.110 --> 01:24:55.660
preachers to push it to like and this is

01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:56.950
there's only got to do is they take out

01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:58.900
a four-year-old epileptic girl like and

01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:01.180
this plant that comes from God helps

01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:02.830
this girl I hear and these companies are

01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:04.960
trying to do they can brainwash those

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:06.820
people who are seeking really have to be

01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:09.010
quick though true it would have to be

01:25:09.010 --> 01:25:10.990
quick to get him to holy it would need

01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:13.210
you know this would take a long dude PSD

01:25:13.210 --> 01:25:13.960
vets

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:16.450
it's dude it's area I hear you I

01:25:16.450 --> 01:25:19.300
understand the benefits but the people

01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:21.940
that are very Pro weed aren't gonna vote

01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:23.520
for Trump because he's legalizing weed

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:25.600
maybe now they're thankful that Orion is

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:27.100
very surprised I wouldn't be that I

01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:28.300
wouldn't be that surprised I don't think

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:30.580
it would be that great a number people

01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:32.020
who are in his base I think he would

01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:33.910
lose more from his base than gain more

01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:36.010
from [ __ ] people that's those [ __ ]

01:25:36.010 --> 01:25:38.650
dope smokers nah dude I think the trade

01:25:38.650 --> 01:25:40.210
off wouldn't be worth it well I really

01:25:40.210 --> 01:25:41.830
pray for him it might not be because

01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:45.070
every single Liberal candidate is

01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:46.420
basically being illegal izing weed

01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:48.370

01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:57.620
Matt's going to like not be able to

01:31:57.620 --> 01:32:00.620
handle it it's like bro my whole what

01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:02.120
are you talking about and dude and by

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:03.740
and it's like to have a mic fair that's

01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:05.000
fair enough assumption then you watch

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.210
people be like say things like I

01:32:08.210 --> 01:32:10.070
wouldn't be able to personally take that

01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:11.690
I don't know how you would do that and

01:32:11.690 --> 01:32:13.250
so where are they saying this on the is

01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:15.230
the one come town subreddit and it's

01:32:15.230 --> 01:32:17.120
said that that again it doesn't that

01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:18.500
doesn't bother me I know this seems like

01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:20.900
they're you know whatever sour grape and

01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:22.850
whatever but it's like they don't my

01:32:22.850 --> 01:32:25.460
whole philosophy is based against that

01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:27.230
and then there's people like well if you

01:32:27.230 --> 01:32:29.360
do anything besides clout again it could

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:30.830
get lost in Tripp translators the thing

01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:32.330
here's the thing yeah and I will say

01:32:32.330 --> 01:32:35.600
this if this was reversed I wouldn't be

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:38.390
doing great with that you from day one

01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:41.390
have never been a jealous [ __ ] ever and

01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:42.530
there's nothing I'm doing right now that

01:32:42.530 --> 01:32:45.080
you're jealous of first off I'm I just

01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:46.460
understand why you but you've never ever

01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:49.100
been I've never met somebody more and

01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:50.720
I've said this several times on this I'm

01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:54.440
jealous of the way you or you can get

01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:55.230
stoked for other

01:32:55.230 --> 01:32:59.250
you have that level of like good I don't

01:32:59.250 --> 01:33:00.570
have that for the most part

01:33:00.570 --> 01:33:02.310
well eat some more mushroom that's true

01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:04.530
that's true like with Sodor does well

01:33:04.530 --> 01:33:06.120
I'm like [ __ ] yeah when you do well I'm

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:07.710
like [ __ ] you once you get wants you to

01:33:07.710 --> 01:33:09.420
see the bees or fly I love so you know

01:33:09.420 --> 01:33:12.960
Connor fail happier than watching a

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:14.880
Connor [ __ ] spire and this is the

01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:16.920
problem with this is my like thing I'm

01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:18.180
trying to drive home to pretty much

01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:20.670
everyone it's like once you again

01:33:20.670 --> 01:33:22.170
totally stealing some the video I watch

01:33:22.170 --> 01:33:24.120
once you sail past the meridians of your

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:25.950
hopes and dreams and you're like alright

01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:27.840
I'm this in my life and like this is all

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:29.610
it is and you're like this is actually

01:33:29.610 --> 01:33:32.010
kind of sick it becomes so nice you

01:33:32.010 --> 01:33:33.360
watch people are doing like oh that's

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.190
[ __ ] sick I'm doing this this is

01:33:35.190 --> 01:33:39.030
[ __ ] fun and the idea that I think

01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:41.880
the like since people don't have

01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:43.860
religion anymore all that stuff Fame is

01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:45.690
one of those last transformative

01:33:45.690 --> 01:33:47.700
experiences people can tap into and

01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:50.340
fully ride their meaning of life upon

01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:52.170
and watch as if people used to watch

01:33:52.170 --> 01:33:53.580
like the Pope like oh my god you have

01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:55.110
access to god what's that like yeah

01:33:55.110 --> 01:33:57.000
that's one of the last ones left where

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:00.120
you can like transform I've seen famous

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.739
I've hung out with famous people and

01:34:01.739 --> 01:34:04.350
it's not something I want exactly what

01:34:04.350 --> 01:34:05.700
happened to me will you [ __ ] hung out

01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:07.680
with when me and soda went and hung out

01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:09.750
with Pete Davidson we're just in the

01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:11.489
[ __ ] green room it's Saturday Night

01:34:11.489 --> 01:34:13.880
Live place is empty it's just us three

01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:16.080
smoking joints hanging out watching

01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:17.520
[ __ ] Game of Thrones and Pete's

01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:19.590
second it was [ __ ] sick yeah but then

01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:21.239
we're talking about it and Pete was like

01:34:21.239 --> 01:34:23.760
yeah I can't go outside anymore - I was

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:27.060
like I was high and I was like whoa whoa

01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:29.130
whoa I don't want anything to do with

01:34:29.130 --> 01:34:30.840
that isn't that then there's levels of

01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:33.060
like all these shitty people that are so

01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:35.489
[ __ ] nice to you yeah all of a sudden

01:34:35.489 --> 01:34:37.380
and then it's like oh they're great

01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:38.730
they're great you don't even know people

01:34:38.730 --> 01:34:41.400
suck and you become wild right you get

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:42.570
to a position where you become a

01:34:42.570 --> 01:34:44.940
commodity for other people to make money

01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:47.550
off of you and have you basically be a

01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:49.590
weird thing that they can profit off of

01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:52.260
me well not your rights are stripped

01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:54.600
away but kind of are like you're put

01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:56.130
into this strange weird paranoid

01:34:56.130 --> 01:34:57.300
existence or you don't know who likes

01:34:57.300 --> 01:34:58.830
you and who doesn't like you and people

01:34:58.830 --> 01:35:00.930
have [ __ ] weird yeah man yeah I don't

01:35:00.930 --> 01:35:02.850
know it again it's not like a totally

01:35:02.850 --> 01:35:05.160
bad thing it's like it's not a bad thing

01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:06.750
in and of itself when people are reading

01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:08.130
the people's like the way they're

01:35:08.130 --> 01:35:08.760
viewing this

01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:11.070
situation and I'm like Dan that's your

01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:12.810
guys's view of reality that sucks yeah

01:35:12.810 --> 01:35:15.120
like if you if you've I mean again but

01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:16.380
it does help from doing stand-up and you

01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:17.850
meet people who are like super

01:35:17.850 --> 01:35:19.710
successful and like just miserable and

01:35:19.710 --> 01:35:20.790
shitty and you're like okay well

01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:22.530
obviously there's something missing here

01:35:22.530 --> 01:35:24.180
yeah they need to kind of do first and

01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:25.350
then you can kind of go off and you know

01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:26.880
you can still do your thing I just I

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:29.040
want what I want out of this is to be

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:31.110
good at stand-up I want to put something

01:35:31.110 --> 01:35:33.090
out that's [ __ ] good that's it I'm

01:35:33.090 --> 01:35:35.640
dude the the fame weird stuff is weird

01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:38.190
and I feel embarrassed talking about

01:35:38.190 --> 01:35:40.380
this now I just did new faces yeah like

01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:42.570
I'm not I'm not no but it's not these

01:35:42.570 --> 01:35:44.460
are good but yeah I don't want anyone to

01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:46.320
think I'm out here being like well now

01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:48.180
that I made it no I don't want anyone to

01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:49.020
think anything like that

01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:50.910
but if you're doing stand-up that's a

01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:52.800
very when you hear people get something

01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:54.510
and that when they connect to industry

01:35:54.510 --> 01:35:56.900
that's like there's just like a whole

01:35:56.900 --> 01:35:59.670
Dante's Inferno level of other comedians

01:35:59.670 --> 01:36:02.370
just like who were like we'll never

01:36:02.370 --> 01:36:04.530
connect to any so that in itself is a

01:36:04.530 --> 01:36:06.330
big like yeah a big point but yeah I

01:36:06.330 --> 01:36:07.260
know what you're saying it's not like

01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:08.850
you're claiming you're like [ __ ] K

01:36:08.850 --> 01:36:10.590
hard but it's like still I put and

01:36:10.590 --> 01:36:12.900
haven't recognized you randomly it feels

01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:15.750
good I used to I used to bring yeah I

01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:19.950
used to bring I would bring people on

01:36:19.950 --> 01:36:21.480
dates to this like one or two diners

01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:22.620
where I knew there's two dudes who like

01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:24.120
loved the podcast and they'd come up

01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:25.590
like oh my god I'm like holiday dog

01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:28.230
thanks yeah yeah move total [ __ ] mind

01:36:28.230 --> 01:36:30.960
[ __ ] you know but it's one of those

01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:34.110
things that I think the average person

01:36:34.110 --> 01:36:35.730
doesn't have a really good grasp on and

01:36:35.730 --> 01:36:37.200
they just look at it they it's a good

01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:38.820
stuff I talked about they project this

01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:40.620
pure fantasy onto it it's like yeah

01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:42.900
sorry bro the only way the podcast fails

01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:45.980
is I get worried about what we're saying

01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:50.070
and yeah but we can just become black

01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:51.960
conservatives and going blogging exactly

01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:53.970
and the only way that happens is yeah

01:36:53.970 --> 01:36:56.070
I'm not I'm not worried about that but I

01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:58.110
am wondering what's gonna happen with

01:36:58.110 --> 01:37:01.410
the whole thing of like the I was just

01:37:01.410 --> 01:37:02.850
talking about this I forgot of like

01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:05.220
people wanting to consume content they

01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:06.690
thinks authentic and people just like

01:37:06.690 --> 01:37:08.370
being themselves and honest versus like

01:37:08.370 --> 01:37:10.470
this weird force of like stop like the

01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:12.960
to think about honestly it's weird to

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:16.960
think now the the forces of a

01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:19.390
what the [ __ ] is it okay I can't think

01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:20.969
of this [ __ ] word where you're like

01:37:20.969 --> 01:37:24.250
censorship or Maryland primarily

01:37:24.250 --> 01:37:26.410
right-wing Christian ideals like don't

01:37:26.410 --> 01:37:28.960
oh yes on now the censorship is now is

01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:30.219
left which is like it's [ __ ] weird

01:37:30.219 --> 01:37:32.560
yeah we totally the O'Connor hit that

01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:35.590
home early right used to be like mom's

01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:37.570
going to Walmart and being like mmm

01:37:37.570 --> 01:37:39.219
needs to have a [ __ ] parental

01:37:39.219 --> 01:37:41.170
advisory sticker yeah how it's a little

01:37:41.170 --> 01:37:43.180
kid like young kids going to Walmart

01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:45.280
being like this needs parental advisory

01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:48.969
it's [ __ ] races like with all with

01:37:48.969 --> 01:37:51.280
our pocket like yeah I don't want to

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:54.100
[ __ ] this is too gay I mean I feel

01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:55.870
gay talking about it fair not be honest

01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:58.780
fair enough I'm curious to see how the

01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:00.489
industry is going to adapt amongst those

01:38:00.489 --> 01:38:05.730
weird well the industry is first off I

01:38:05.730 --> 01:38:07.630
know what you're saying guarding to

01:38:07.630 --> 01:38:09.520
adapt a little bit obviously if they're

01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:12.460
letting me be on things true like that's

01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:16.510
a good sign yeah and like we we're doing

01:38:16.510 --> 01:38:18.880
tires I think is gonna get picked up by

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:20.380
something I have no I don't be [ __ ]

01:38:20.380 --> 01:38:23.230
gay everybody yeah but like if people

01:38:23.230 --> 01:38:24.580
are interested in it and it's like

01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:27.460
things are you know yeah if you're if

01:38:27.460 --> 01:38:29.950
you make something good in the market

01:38:29.950 --> 01:38:32.620
will justify it sure so and then look at

01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:34.750
[ __ ] what Schultz is doing like he's

01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:37.180
he's making his own thing putting it

01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:38.980
online yeah look what Louie did with

01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:40.810
Louie can Louie could make it special

01:38:40.810 --> 01:38:42.370
today and put it online people will buy

01:38:42.370 --> 01:38:46.320
it and I'm [ __ ] buy it yeah so I mean

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:49.570
the industry does face possibly being

01:38:49.570 --> 01:38:52.150
obsolete if it doesn't adjust yeah she's

01:38:52.150 --> 01:38:53.800
kind of nice I think about that all the

01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:55.300
time I'm like dude yeah I'm gonna be

01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:56.770
sitting somewhere one day and someone's

01:38:56.770 --> 01:39:03.430
gonna be like play yeah dude I'm so like

01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:06.580
everything we've the the two years where
