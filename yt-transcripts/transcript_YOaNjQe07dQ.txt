00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.519
two o'clock

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:50.560
sorry i'm thinking of all the people

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.839
like the mechanics who listen to oral

00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:53.360
presentations like what the [ __ ] about

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.000
that

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.040
what not my sweetheart

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.240
he wouldn't do anything like what's up

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:04.640
new jersey trying to [ __ ] guys

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.399
uh you guys planned it for two o'clock

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:08.000
so you were both i would imagine got

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.120
there at 2 30.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.200
no i i'm i'm prompt you are pumped i'm

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.800
i'm punctual a wood is not

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.560
what is showed up late but we couldn't

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.240
but we had to make a reservation for

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.600
truth like they wouldn't just let us sit

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.320
down they had to like timetable it

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.920
so we did that he's like let's do a

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.120
round of harbor freight let's look at

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:23.839
the knives

00:10:23.839 --> 00:10:25.600
so we went and looked at the knives all

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.640
right so now i was going to kill you i

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.760
thought that's right

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.360
it was it was it was a real i think he's

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.399
a nice guy but it was a conversation

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:35.519
again you can't let him dictate the the

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:37.120
activities because you'll end up walking

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.920
around a harbor looking at knives

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.760
you'll do things that sound funny on

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.680
paper until you're

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.240
walking outside like and he wouldn't let

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.440
me pay for my food

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.800
really yeah he wouldn't let me pay for

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.320
it because the whole thing he's like

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.680
he's like i'm gonna i'm an older comic

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.880
this is what i have to do to you

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.880
i was like it was [ __ ] weird dude oh

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.399
you can't report him on saying corny

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:58.079
stuff oh i'm sorry i'm str

00:10:58.079 --> 00:10:59.680
all right you're right no he's holy [ __ ]

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.760
he literally told me not to say that

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.640
i bet oh [ __ ] he's probably like don't

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.959
tell anyone i just said that oh my god

00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:10.160
he said he was an older cat you've been

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.720
doing it longer than him significantly

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.399
but he's older than me he's like he's

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:15.760
33. that's true

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.279
[ __ ] this was a weird date you're right

00:11:17.279 --> 00:11:18.560
this was absolutely some like chicken

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.279
hawk like

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:22.480
this is weird yeah what groom did he did

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.200
he gripped it

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.440
i'm fine with it dude he's a cool guy so

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.880

being like a wishy-washy yeah being like

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.280
a protestant

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.039
what is it called like an episcopalian

00:19:27.039 --> 00:19:28.480
protestant

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.120
episcopalian no what's an episcopalian

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:31.679
protestant

00:19:31.679 --> 00:19:32.880
yeah they're like protestants were they

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.559
they just like basically every

00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:35.840
christianity that's not catholics

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.039
process gotcha yeah

00:19:37.039 --> 00:19:39.200
even calvinists i guess they are i don't

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.240
know i'm into cyanetics right now

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.640
cyanetics is uh the study of how matter

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.000
responds to sound

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
so do you ever see like when they put

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.280
those things up

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.280
in like speakers yeah they put like a

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.559
sand on a paper and they hit it with

00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:53.600
like 428

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.080
hertz or like you know god forbid 520

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.919
you know can't even imagine 528

00:19:57.919 --> 00:20:00.320
it's crazy that's a god frequency so

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.840
they take on different shapes when you

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:02.720
do that

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.360
and what they some people say is that

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.480
our matter is a

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.400
response to sound and art we've arranged

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.760
in a certain pattern so

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.280
we're basically like the manifestation

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.679
of sound in the universe pretty tight

00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:15.039
it's the stuff i get into is the

00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:17.760
universe silent

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.799
go out of space dude yeah i mean you

00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:22.640
can't hear it doesn't mean there's no

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.559
sound bro

00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:25.679

really really low frequency really yeah

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.480
what's it sound like

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.679

from some of the guys but yeah if you

00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:24.240
could if you could fight them

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.880
so it's like it's like

00:25:27.279 --> 00:25:28.640
it's kind of like the phones in prison

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.960
the xbox it's like the phones in prison

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.320
you got to be like tough to like command

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.120
the phone yeah

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.679
that that's exactly right yeah damn um

00:25:35.679 --> 00:25:37.039
so you just get big brother you got to

00:25:37.039 --> 00:25:37.840

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.640
next

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.000
wait did you form up with anyone else

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.919
from like your race

00:25:45.919 --> 00:25:48.799
brotherhood in the hospital that would

00:25:48.799 --> 00:25:50.640
have been sick but no no i'm a lone wolf

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.240
every time nah but so what they did what

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.240
really sucked is they bought so

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.400
to measure the effect of i don't know

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.279
what the [ __ ] they were doing but they

00:25:59.279 --> 00:26:00.640
were doing something i could i promise

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.080
you they were doing something to me

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.279
and that would take this

00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:05.039
anti-schizophrenia medication which made

00:26:05.039 --> 00:26:06.320
me kind of schizophrenic i had some

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.520
weird hallucinations

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.200
really and then they were like um

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.360
measuring it in our spinal fluid which

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.000
was like

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.760
so like i would get a lumbar puncture

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.520
which is what like what pregnant ladies

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.159
get to like

00:26:16.159 --> 00:26:19.520
administer the epidural um

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.039
and the first one went fine and then

00:26:21.039 --> 00:26:22.720
they did another one at the end and that

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:23.200
one

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.279
[ __ ] up so they just like left a hole

00:26:25.279 --> 00:26:26.799
like in my

00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:28.640
spine that like so like your spinal

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.400
fluid circulates it's what keeps your

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.840
brain from hitting your skull

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.520
and when that happens it really [ __ ]

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.120
hurts it hurts a lot

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.360
and so uh all my spinal fluid was like

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.039
leaking out of my skull and just like

00:26:39.039 --> 00:26:40.480
into my like i don't know my legs and my

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.919
ass i guess i don't know

00:26:41.919 --> 00:26:44.720
nice and uh they couldn't get the hole

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.000
patched up so like for

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.760
yeah for a week after i was at a

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.120
hospital like the first episode we

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.640
recorded a coward hour

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.960
i was laying in barn dog's bed i didn't

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.720
even think about this

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.960
yeah we'll get to it sorry go ahead um

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.320
and we didn't release it yeah like for

00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.440
like a week and a half i just like

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.880
couldn't if i stood up my brain would

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:01.840
hit my skull and

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.919
oh yeah it really sucked dude but you

00:27:03.919 --> 00:27:05.200
know you got like a bunch of concussion

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.240
that's just a concussion

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.919
is that a con off a concussion is just

00:27:07.919 --> 00:27:09.600
your brain hitting your skull if i have

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.640
cte that explains

00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:14.720
yeah for real they also probably wanted

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.080
to see what happens if someone had no

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.600
spinal fluid you probably were part of a

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.039
deeper study

00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:20.320
oh yeah it's anti schizophrenia they

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.360
probably gave you some like weird

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.960
stimulant and then took all your spinal

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.919
fluid and we're like we'll see what

00:27:23.919 --> 00:27:26.159
happens

00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:28.960
i guess that's probably you seem alright

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.559
yeah i feel fine you seem sharp

00:27:30.559 --> 00:27:32.240
i think i'm better than i was when i met

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.320
life

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.839

just a hard coffee session

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:27.119
just jumanji and then a bomb

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:32.000
no hard bombing like a boston open mic

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.680
dude that's brain training for sure that

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.040
was brain training yeah so

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.480
what was like the deepest moment of

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.320
bugging out like watching horror movies

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:40.880
on acid

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.160
oh well i mean i literally thought that

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.000
i was uh dying like a couple times and

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.040
like you know if you think like if you

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.320
genuinely believe you're dying it was

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.599
like a death trip like you know i'm sure

00:36:47.599 --> 00:36:48.640
you know about death trips

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.079
i'm sure that you know you're about to

00:36:50.079 --> 00:36:51.599
let you feel like you're about to die i

00:36:51.599 --> 00:36:53.040
the one time i had something like that

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:53.599
was on

00:36:53.599 --> 00:36:55.599
like a quarter ounce of mushrooms and i

00:36:55.599 --> 00:36:56.400
couldn't tell the difference between

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.280
night or day

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.640
and i just got under the blankets and it

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.880
was just i remember vaguely like seeing

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.079
jesus and being like

00:37:02.079 --> 00:37:05.200
oh sweet yeah and you're like nice

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.680
i remember i'd taken i i don't know if

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:08.320
it was

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.760
pure acid or i think it was a research

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.200
chemical but i had taken so much like i

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.480
couldn't keep water down

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.760
so like every time so i'm like i'm

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:14.800
literally just downstairs like

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.839
discreetly throwing up

00:37:17.839 --> 00:37:20.480
just like drinking like immediately and

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.320
every time i would throw up like the the

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.480
fibers in the carpet downstairs like

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.920

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.599
little like i don't know like pyramids

00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:28.640

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.000
other just like bug out every time i

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.200
like heaved

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.760
and uh then i wound up like i just like

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.880

sorry is this too much oh absolutely

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.240
fantastic

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.800
all right so i laid down on the couch

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.760
and i like

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.280
real i was like i can't keep water down

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.880
and dehydrated my body's like

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.160
trying to like i'm trying to like throw

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.000
my own innards so i think i'm probably

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.440
dying and then i like panicked

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.720

00:37:59.839 --> 00:38:04.320
[ __ ] just turned into a pyramid

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.480

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.760
like everybody i knew like finding my

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.280
body and like realizing that i died

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.160

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.319
perfectly exactly how it looked from

00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:24.240
saint joe's saint joe's elementary

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.359

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.359
into that and then that kind of

00:48:59.359 --> 00:49:00.319

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.920
about having an extremely wet and not

00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:09.839
in a wetter vagina though i was thinking

day might have been song of the decade

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.680
yeah dude in the 90s hell yeah and i

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:18.960
have no idea that could have been wet

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.240
[ __ ] that could be spanish for

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:22.319
weddings macarena yeah

00:51:22.319 --> 00:51:24.079
if you go back to the dance yeah it's

00:51:24.079 --> 00:51:27.520
leading down to your whop dude

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:30.079
i don't know where i was going with that

00:51:30.079 --> 00:51:32.000
but no it is it's funny to see a tv show

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:32.800
that was like

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.440
hey look at this [ __ ] dumb [ __ ]

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:36.000
we're gonna film

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.920
her doing things that's fun is it is it

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:39.200
like a scripted show or is it like

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.319
reality i don't know it looks like it's

00:51:40.319 --> 00:51:41.440
a reality it looks like it's just gonna

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:43.280
be filming cardi b do things

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:44.480
which occasionally is just like

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.920
borderline racist when they do stuff

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.200
like that like they used to film

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:50.000
marshawn lynch he had a show and it was

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.680
just him the the point of the show was

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.280
watching a black guy go to like scotland

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.760
to be like man y'all [ __ ] crazy

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.119
that was the point of the show sounds

00:51:57.119 --> 00:51:59.760
like a sick show [ __ ] rules marshawn

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:00.880
lynch rules

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:04.960
but yeah yeah i mean dude the uh

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.559
i was thinking about that last night

00:52:06.559 --> 00:52:07.839
before i went to bed actually i was

00:52:07.839 --> 00:52:09.359
thinking about the people who got into

00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:10.000
like

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.359
like you were saying kind of injecting

00:52:11.359 --> 00:52:13.520
morality in a comedy and so you had like

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.839
the least funny people started all of a

00:52:15.839 --> 00:52:17.440
sudden policing comedy and then trying

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.200
to get people who actually made people

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:19.680
laugh

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:20.880
like you know did the thing that they

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:22.559
said they like to do who did it and

00:52:22.559 --> 00:52:23.839
actually make people laugh they're like

00:52:23.839 --> 00:52:25.440
they should stop doing that we should we

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.319

00:52:26.319 --> 00:52:28.400
yeah stop laughing authentically it's

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:29.839

[ __ ] law but yeah it's [ __ ]

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:23.839
if both people are drunk yeah that's

01:07:23.839 --> 01:07:24.799

tampa side splitters can anyone sell a

01:15:43.199 --> 01:15:44.719
vaccine if you say not approved by the

01:15:44.719 --> 01:15:47.840
fda could you sell a vaccine

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.360
because apparently if you sell vaccines

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:51.440
no one can sue you for the side effects

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.040
so if i do one of those things like yo

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.719
this hasn't been evaluated by the fda

01:15:54.719 --> 01:15:55.760
but also

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:56.880
this will definitely be again in the

01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:00.159

01:16:00.159 --> 01:16:02.800
herbal non because you can sell herbal

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:03.760
supplements all you want

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:06.800
