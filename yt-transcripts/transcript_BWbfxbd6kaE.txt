trying to like thanks to us that was

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.039

[ __ ] day

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.520

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.679
the so the two guys eventually leave the

00:26:11.679 --> 00:26:12.960

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.760
there's like six foot three black dudes

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.000
who were like easily 280. so i'd be up

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.919
there like do something these guys i'm

00:29:11.919 --> 00:29:13.120
like someone could pull a couple of

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.679
these [ __ ]

00:29:15.679 --> 00:29:17.840
uh but no the security security did

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:18.640
great

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.399
i'm thinking about some people trying to

00:29:20.399 --> 00:29:22.559
approach the stage they got some people

00:29:22.559 --> 00:29:23.919
they've got a couple people who do they

00:29:23.919 --> 00:29:24.720
get

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.039
they got britney yeah they got britney

00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:30.480
that's true that was a good simulation

00:29:30.559 --> 00:29:32.720
he almost got her they didn't tackle her

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.080
he should have [ __ ] speared her he

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.200
should have jumped in front of us and

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.520
took the [ __ ] bottle exactly i'm not

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.120
i'm not that happy with that [ __ ] the

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.880
way that went down yeah that happened

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.919
you should have took the bottle and

00:29:41.919 --> 00:29:43.360
cracked it over here you were doing the

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.279
[ __ ] thing again i know

00:29:45.279 --> 00:29:46.640
something yeah

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.240
i know she was just talking to his [ __ ]

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.760
i didn't know she was there and she

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.600
approached the stage with a bottle of

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.600
attack

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.279
wonderful stuff i spent the rest of time

00:29:55.279 --> 00:29:57.039
being like i love my babe i love my life

00:29:57.039 --> 00:29:58.720
together i love my girlfriend well it

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.240
sucks that we can't release this because

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.440
the guy

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.600
sent a message to helium helium

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.240
contacted us and was like

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.600
we know you

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.760
like the problem is

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.279
we didn't have it written down anywhere

00:30:11.279 --> 00:30:12.880
that it was recording

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.559
until i heard ben when i re-listened to

00:30:14.559 --> 00:30:16.480
it and heard him helium makes an

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.600
announcement in the beginning of this

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.600
podcast that's like this is a live

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.000
podcast no heckling yeah this is a live

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.360
recording

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.279
so i mean legally we're fine but nobody

00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:26.960
wants to deal with these [ __ ] old

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.120
idiots yeah i just don't like i said it

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.960
would suck for that guy to like you know

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.279
raise a big brouhaha club and then now

00:30:33.279 --> 00:30:34.960
like you're in a [ __ ] spot i look

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.880
like an [ __ ] no it's not worth a dude

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.919
it was

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:39.200
the moral of the stories is you got to

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.120
come to the live cast yeah

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.039
it was it was [ __ ] funny i mean it

00:30:43.039 --> 00:30:45.039
sucks they derailed it it was fun

00:30:45.039 --> 00:30:46.720
um but you can't you know you can't

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.919
really hear a lot of the stuff they're

00:30:47.919 --> 00:30:49.360

like the show was a failure but in

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.480

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.760
about like i have a tiny white pink dick

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.680
yeah and i was like dude you [ __ ]

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.839
suck at comedy

00:35:05.839 --> 00:35:07.200
where was the whole genesis of this

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.359
whole thing i don't know he was hammered

00:35:09.359 --> 00:35:11.680
we were both hammered but yeah he was

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.960
really i mean he was hammered enough to

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.160
try to fight me and you have you guys

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.160
talked i i called him that night making

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.599
fun of him you haven't made up sense

00:35:17.599 --> 00:35:19.040
though yeah we were fine oh you guys are

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.920
fine yeah totally but no rematch

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.440
i mean that would be a rough rematch for

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.160
him

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.200
if someone

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.800
beaser said this after it was funny he's

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.119
like dude if somebody's commenting

00:35:29.119 --> 00:35:30.720
doing commentary on the fight while

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.000
you're fighting them it's not a good

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.079
sign like he was trying to hit me and i

00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:35.280
was like oh [ __ ] is he trying to hit me

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:38.000
oh god that's it was it was crazy i

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.920
might do an investigative uh journalism

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.520
dude and get to the source

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.040
oh i'm gonna find out what happened dude

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.400
of the fight i'm investing i'm gonna

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.000
tell you exactly what happened i think

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.240
oh here's what happened i leaned like

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.480
he's a lot smaller than me too like a

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.960
[ __ ] close to a foot yeah shorter

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.280
definitely like 150 pounds short like

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.640
small like a hundred pounds yeah he's

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.280
yeah like this was

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.560
violence was a small difference she

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:01.920
would never have been on the agenda

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.000
unless yeah i mean a ring in a like a or

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.160
a sling in a rock he might have

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.400
that's what he needed but i i think he

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.320
was he and i had been talking [ __ ] back

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.880
and forth but like friendly as you do

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.560
yeah and then

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.400
i took it too far by saying he would

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.000
never be good at stand up and he sucks

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.280
that's when he said you have a pink dick

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.000
and no he said that first oh okay

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.520
but that was i mean i don't get offended

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.240
enough to fight ever or [ __ ] like that

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.680
if someone's trying to bother me with

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.359
words i'm like yeah i'm gonna fight him

00:36:29.359 --> 00:36:30.880
yeah i'll say something like you're

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.560
horrible at stand up and you should quit

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.160
yeah because i know that would hurt a

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:34.880
lot

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.280
that does hurt and then he bucked at me

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.520
like he faked through a fist and i was

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.440
so hammered that i didn't react and all

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.359
i did was laugh at him after he did it

00:36:43.359 --> 00:36:45.760
so like in the same motion of doing that

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.839
like he paused after i laughed at him

00:36:47.839 --> 00:36:50.079
and then he just like grabbed me

00:36:50.079 --> 00:36:51.599
with both like he was i don't know what

00:36:51.599 --> 00:36:52.880
the [ __ ] he was doing he was losing his

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.119

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.480

punch he was just he was latched onto me

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.000
it was almost like hockey punches like

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
he was holding on to my shirt so he was

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.520
like

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:24.079
going nuts damn it was wild and then he

with like some sort of cursed object

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.119
dude he might murder me but uh i did so

00:38:47.119 --> 00:38:48.880
i had the anxiety of it first off what a

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.960
[ __ ] douche would be like you suck at

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:52.640
comedy it's like dude i suck at comedy

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.119
that's a [ __ ] that's crazy yeah it's

00:38:55.119 --> 00:38:57.119
a shitty thing to say that makes me look

00:38:57.119 --> 00:38:59.760
like a [ __ ] dumb [ __ ] just so i

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.359
feel bad about that say that about

00:39:01.359 --> 00:39:02.560
anybody yeah

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.720
unless i actually didn't like them

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.320
because i have done that

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.320
i don't feel as bad

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.680
but uh

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.920
yeah so then that and then somebody from

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.000
the club contacted me the next day and

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.440
was like hey what do you guys want to do

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.359
about the podcast like because we're

00:39:17.359 --> 00:39:18.960
this guy's threatening to sue us if you

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.400
release it

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.640
so then i had that anxiety yeah and it

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.200
was just it was a nightmare

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.640
because i know you probably wanted to

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.960
release the thing yeah it'll be cool so

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.040
i was like so i gotta mediate between

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.119
the company yeah also yeah because you

00:39:33.119 --> 00:39:34.400
don't give a [ __ ] yeah you want to

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.560
release it and i'm like

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.000
yeah i want these guys to send me to

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.599
raleigh and buffalo it's true yeah it's

00:39:39.599 --> 00:39:41.440
like i'll do whatever you guys say

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.760
but i think this is a happy medium i

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.000
mean it's just it wasn't if it was one

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.320
of the cast i mean if it was like a 45

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.920
minutes of sheer brilliance i'd be like

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.000
dude strongly reconstructed but it's

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.320
like it's been crazy to release that

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.599
what i mean it was

00:39:55.599 --> 00:39:56.800
funny to be there if you were there you

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.839

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.119
listening to it i liked it it was it was

00:40:01.119 --> 00:40:03.040
cracking me up but i listened to like 40

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.240
minutes of it and i was like all right

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.920
this you know it just it just totally

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.480
fell off the last yeah

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.800

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.880

jay dukes dude squints was getting after

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.880
you saying that uh

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.960
in that episode i was the only one

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.880
fighting the feminist and that matt was

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.720
the feminist lap dog i brought up a

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.640
bunch of good points dude it's just so

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.079
funny to say that to you and get you

00:41:46.079 --> 00:41:47.359
like no

00:41:47.359 --> 00:41:49.680
no one's [ __ ] lap dog dude any

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.200
anytime you can make fun of somebody

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.200
with like a word like that like any

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.359
nickname yeah a lap dog or like a horse

00:41:55.359 --> 00:41:57.200
feeder or something that's clearly an

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.760
innocuous like just a [ __ ] shitty

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.240
thing that to make someone defend not be

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.800
a dog is so funny but dude i can defend

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.839
it all day

00:42:05.839 --> 00:42:07.680
don't defend it all the time

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.040
that killed me that we never addressed

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:11.040
was the thing about

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.440
how men have learned culturally like

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.040
through culture to stare at women that

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.280
was like the most insane well i i could

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.920
tell when she said that when she was

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.960
like

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.920
men gawking at women is a

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.520
socially learned

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.680
thing i just wanted to move past that

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.960
because otherwise we're going to be

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.640
that's the crux of that that whole issue

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.160
to be like the whole thing is that all

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.680
this stuff is socially learned none of

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.880
these like

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.359
like for the fact that like so a female

00:42:37.359 --> 00:42:39.200
comedian goes on stage and everything

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.480
was like people

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.720
are being like would i [ __ ] this person

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.440
yeah

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.920
it's like that's not culturally that's

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.440
just how that's a human and you know

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:49.119
what humans work men and women so if a

00:42:49.119 --> 00:42:51.119
guy goes up a woman's not being like not

00:42:51.119 --> 00:42:52.240
thinking about whether they'd [ __ ] him

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.400
or not you know what i mean yeah so that

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.680
was like that was like the whole crux of

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.359
that whole argument cause it was like

00:42:57.359 --> 00:42:59.040
that's not culturally learned that's

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.640
something that's embedded in us no i

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.800
agree and that's why i just didn't want

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.079
to take it there because that's a that's

00:43:04.079 --> 00:43:06.960
an hour of yeah but i wanted to discuss

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.599
why she think she thinks women have to

00:43:09.599 --> 00:43:11.440
work twice as hard in comedy that was

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.880
her whole reason that like there's this

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.880
weird cultural thing against her that

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:16.800
the thing that killed me it was like if

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.079
i see an attractive woman like it

00:43:18.079 --> 00:43:20.079
literally speeds my heart rate up okay

00:43:20.079 --> 00:43:21.520
like if you're at the gym you see like

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.599
everybody the gym girls have like

00:43:23.599 --> 00:43:26.160
full-on yoga pants just like just

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.280
there's some girls that look like just

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.560
like instagram models in real life and

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.079
you see them and your heart rate just

00:43:30.079 --> 00:43:32.079
like your heart pounds oh my god like it

00:43:32.079 --> 00:43:33.359
affects your central nervous system you

00:43:33.359 --> 00:43:35.040
love them you just love them dude you

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.240
love them there's a woman she's shaped

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:41.160
like a musical note dude sweeties dude

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.040
and then like you see this and like my

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.640
heart rate sped up i'm doing everything

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.160
in my power like don't stare they have

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.079
rules on construction sites on college

00:43:50.079 --> 00:43:51.440
campuses where you can only look for two

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.640
seconds

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.400
that's culturally

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.000
like conditioning

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.160
man's response to a woman yeah but to be

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.160
like everyone thinks it's cool to check

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.400
out butts so i i like

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.839
that killed me man that killed me for

00:44:03.839 --> 00:44:05.280
the next like three days of just being

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.480
like

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.920
that you just shouldn't have been a lap

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:10.079
dog and you should have fought it

00:44:10.079 --> 00:44:11.520
how you had to get your thing across

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.119
dude i [ __ ] already i brought up i

00:44:13.119 --> 00:44:14.640
brought up the clinton thing i brought

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.000
up the clinton thing that was good

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.240
absolute dude yeah that was good

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.119
absolute dead end dude yeah and then you

00:44:21.119 --> 00:44:23.359
know yeah i was like let me i'll let my

00:44:23.359 --> 00:44:24.640
let my boy shane

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.160
lasso are down i'm [ __ ] riding she

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.680
just [ __ ] took off

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.680
she's a slippery hog dude you know

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.160
you're wrestling a wet pig no uh

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.920
i i couldn't and that was another thing

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.920
i i couldn't articulate exactly how i

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.760
wanted to say that

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.599
because it is

00:44:39.599 --> 00:44:42.720
with a female guest like rachel who is

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.079
like

00:44:44.079 --> 00:44:46.319
you know she's woke and even though she

00:44:46.319 --> 00:44:48.720
said no that was toilet she's like she's

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:51.119
woke and she's into that [ __ ] so you

00:44:51.119 --> 00:44:52.079
don't you definitely don't want to say

00:44:52.079 --> 00:44:53.440
the wrong thing

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:56.480
and so when i was trying to

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.640
discuss the fact that it's ludicrous to

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.240
say women have to work twice as hard in

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.839
comedy yeah

00:45:01.839 --> 00:45:03.920
all i said was i don't think that's true

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.760
i didn't say it was ludicrous i didn't

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.599
say it was i got you it was just like i

00:45:07.599 --> 00:45:08.800
don't know if that's true i think it

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.720
might not be true you also don't want to

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:13.200
have like

00:45:13.359 --> 00:45:14.880
have a podcast where it's like you're

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.480
just two dudes and you invite a girl

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.000
down and you were sitting here like [ __ ]

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.640
you you're a fool yeah yeah yeah well

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.000
like i don't feel that way that's the

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.079
other thing i don't see rachel rachel

00:45:24.079 --> 00:45:26.160
i'm never looking at rachel like [ __ ]

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.240
[ __ ] dude yeah she's so [ __ ] it's

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.839
just like no no that's true she's got

00:45:29.839 --> 00:45:30.839
her

00:45:30.839 --> 00:45:32.400
she

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.760
she's smart

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.200
and

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.480
she's just wrong about comedy that's it

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.319
all the other stuff like the socially it

00:45:40.319 --> 00:45:43.119

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.079
i'll get back to no way that matters i

00:51:38.079 --> 00:51:40.000

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.240
dude i was like i could i was like my

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.359
whole my whole thing was like if i got

00:51:43.359 --> 00:51:44.640
into commercial made money off that it'd

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.000
be awesome and i went to acting school

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.280
because it was like a lot of the schools

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.280

they're the things called the miser

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.319
technique so i'd be like i'd have to say

00:52:02.319 --> 00:52:03.359
something about you and then you'd

00:52:03.359 --> 00:52:04.480
repeat it back with a different

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.839
reflection

00:52:05.839 --> 00:52:07.200
your shirt is gray and you'd be like my

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.640

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.400

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.400

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:17.040
i can't do it that sucks no way my shirt

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:18.800

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.559
just my shirts correct

00:52:20.559 --> 00:52:22.079
you literally dude we should meisner

00:52:22.079 --> 00:52:23.920
this whole we should start misery

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.200
and then you switch it up get all like

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.160
impromptu

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:28.640

the holocaust didn't happen the

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.559
holocaust didn't have it the holocaust

00:52:36.559 --> 00:52:39.040

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:42.319
happen the holocaust didn't happen

00:52:42.319 --> 00:52:45.280
holocaust didn't happen

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:53.440
i just read a book on it too really on

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:54.880
the holocaust yeah it did apparently it

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:57.440
did which book uh

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.359
modern man's search for a soul or

00:52:59.359 --> 00:53:01.839
something

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000
yeah i read it through [ __ ]

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.680
waves

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.280
it came through and i just deciphered it

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:09.280
you listened to this dude it's [ __ ]

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.720
that [ __ ] is

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:12.640
yeah we shouldn't i after all the

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.160
[ __ ] hitler jokes in the first half

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.440
of this we probably should as if clever

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:16.880
take on the meister technique you should

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:19.280
probably get out of there

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.480
that's a clever take on advisor

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.480
technique um

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:24.640
yeah also i guess i should uh that would

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:25.839
also be funny if you went to one of

00:53:25.839 --> 00:53:27.040
those you're supposed to be like your

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.640

00:53:30.079 --> 00:53:31.119
people in the room you're like the

00:53:31.119 --> 00:53:33.280
holocaust now yeah

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.440
the holocaust didn't happen

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:38.800
that is [ __ ] funny yeah that's uh

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.319
yeah i still have anxiety about the

00:53:40.319 --> 00:53:42.559
podcast why the live cast

00:53:42.559 --> 00:53:44.000
brittany didn't help man she called you

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:44.880

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:46.800
i mean people call me racist that's

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:47.920

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.559

00:56:26.319 --> 00:56:27.680
career

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:29.119

00:56:29.119 --> 00:56:30.480
negative that wouldn't hurt her career

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:32.000

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:45.760
doesn't give a [ __ ]

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:46.960
i'm just playing it up kind of [ __ ]

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.400
with you well it is [ __ ] with me i

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.599
don't want to hear my friend's

00:56:49.599 --> 00:56:51.599
girlfriend doesn't like me

00:56:51.599 --> 00:56:53.040
i don't want to hear that though she

00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.559
like that next day was laughing at [ __ ]

00:56:54.559 --> 00:56:56.480
you're saying to me good

00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:58.079
yeah well i was uh that was another

00:56:58.079 --> 00:57:01.040
thing there was on top of so

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:03.920
my friend tried to fight me or did fight

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.359
me technically

00:57:05.359 --> 00:57:06.640
then you might have blacked out and

00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:08.319
called him the m word though no that's

00:57:08.319 --> 00:57:11.119
that play that's

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.280
and that ridiculous

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:14.400
came [ __ ] running over and was like

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.839
what the [ __ ] happened did shane call

00:57:15.839 --> 00:57:17.040
him the n-word

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.799
get the [ __ ] out of here because then

00:57:18.799 --> 00:57:20.559
even though he was kidding

00:57:20.559 --> 00:57:22.240
and somebody overheard that was like i

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.319
think shane caught him the enemy dude

00:57:24.319 --> 00:57:25.760
that's not what i said he sucked to

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:27.599
comedy and he [ __ ] tried to fight me

00:57:27.599 --> 00:57:28.799
that's it

00:57:28.799 --> 00:57:31.280
oh yeah but uh so that i think that

00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:33.760
sucks like it sucks that that happened

00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:35.359
that like rumors started instantly

00:57:35.359 --> 00:57:38.720
people were like right down the road

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:41.040
people were

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:49.119
so then uh beside the anxiety from that

00:57:49.119 --> 00:57:51.200
then the anxiety from the old guys just

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.880
i wasn't happy with the fact that i was

00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:55.359
screaming you old [ __ ] at them

00:57:55.359 --> 00:57:56.640
i mean i could have handled it better it

00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.480
was hilarious but well that is it felt

00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:00.000
bad that is kind of weird though how

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.839
there is like a uh

00:58:01.839 --> 00:58:03.280
it's weird to think how little control

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.200
of yourself you are like anyone like

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.119

00:58:07.119 --> 00:58:08.160

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.599
sounding offensive but

01:00:13.599 --> 01:00:14.720

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.280
[ __ ] cry baby oh not being like i'm

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.200
i'm so good and nobody will listen

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.640
because you can get a room you can get a

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.160
room people room with people to laugh

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.920
really hard consistently so at some

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.799
can fix everyone's [ __ ] electrical

01:00:30.799 --> 01:00:32.319
and just no one calls you and you're

01:00:32.319 --> 01:00:33.359
like

01:00:33.359 --> 01:00:34.640

not like an uh that would be um

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.280
it's totally different because you need

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.400
like a

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.760
there's like an outside force and all

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.440
that like booking agencies and all that

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:56.480
yeah electrical is like

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:00.559

01:01:08.079 --> 01:01:09.599
plug in the outlet tell you cool works

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:11.280

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.640
depressing

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.240

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.880
out of me it sucks but i'll get back

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.119
it's just because i i did a shitty show

01:01:19.119 --> 01:01:21.040
on saturday i did a [ __ ] yeah yeah

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.520
packed vfw in south jersey that doesn't

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.920
help and they were [ __ ] animals the

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:28.319
whole time that's the opposite part of

01:01:28.319 --> 01:01:30.000
you know yeah but then i was leaving and

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.920
i did well for [ __ ] 40 minutes i

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.440
didn't even tell a joke i was just

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.000
talking just joke like [ __ ] around

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:36.799
which

01:01:36.799 --> 01:01:38.559
without sounding like a [ __ ] a lot of

01:01:38.559 --> 01:01:40.319
these people can't do a lot of other

01:01:40.319 --> 01:01:41.920
comics if they were in the situation i

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.000
was just in on saturday bob would have

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.440
died yeah

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.880
and i i turned it into at least

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.559
something yeah and then i was driving

01:01:48.559 --> 01:01:50.319
and i was by myself being a [ __ ]

01:01:50.319 --> 01:01:51.760
arrogant [ __ ] and i was like i'm the

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:52.960
best

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.640
no but not that i'm the best but it's

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.160
just like those people can't do that

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.240
they can't go to a vfw a club and a

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.640
black room and do well yeah

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.000
i don't know it's true though man it's

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.440
even like

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.440
and do well look and yeah i do just want

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.280
to make sure i'm not no it's dude

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.000
because that's another thing that's

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.839
going to bother me i don't sound like a

01:02:09.839 --> 01:02:11.760
[ __ ] loser here you don't sound like

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.440
a loser because it's like

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.280
you have to you'd have to have gone and

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:18.079
done a vfw or something like that yeah

01:02:18.079 --> 01:02:20.160
like i've gone to things before similar

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.920
where it's like long show i go up at the

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.000
end and i just [ __ ] eat a dick but

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.280
i'm up there just like

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.119
[ __ ] these guys i i hate this but it's

01:02:27.119 --> 01:02:28.960
really hard yeah it's also hard too

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.240
because it's much like about you going

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:32.319
into a bunch of like drunk 50 year olds

01:02:32.319 --> 01:02:34.640
and just entertaining them it's like

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.400
it's and they're strangers like you go

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.160
to a family party you don't just erase

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.440
your brain from everyone you know and

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.640
you're like all right i gotta make

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.400
everyone in my family laugh right now

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.480
while they're all together and united

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.920
and just have that weird friendliness

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:47.040
going it's like something you'll never

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:48.960
understand just going into a vfw like

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.319
that where it's a club it was like a

01:02:50.319 --> 01:02:53.040
sportsman club yeah and so it's just a

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.119
bunch of [ __ ] like dock workers in

01:02:55.119 --> 01:02:57.520
south jersey and their families yeah and

01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.440
it was like they all had inside jokes

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.960
they were all talking to each other it's

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:02.240
[ __ ] dude it's a bunch of like

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:04.240
blueberry murray and you just stand

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.160
there's no stage you just [ __ ] stand

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:07.680
at the end of the hall

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.440
at the edge of this big [ __ ] hall

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.960
this room i mean dude it's it's

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.880
literally it's nightmarish with a shitty

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.720
mic the mic the sound on the mic was

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.640
horrible never works dude it was crazy

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.079
it never works they literally think

01:03:18.079 --> 01:03:19.760
about that i mean it's and a lot of

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:20.880
people don't even want to public speak

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.319
at all but imagine it's like like i've

01:03:22.319 --> 01:03:24.480

ready for a show then it was just like

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.559
people were just like a bunch of grand

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:34.160
moms like shoveling cake in their mouths

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.520
it's like

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.200
it's hard to even express and it's tough

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.880
to explain to them like

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.480

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.440
times the ladies at the table they were

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:56.960

i've been playing this video game where

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.720
you have to like go out and hunt and

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.440
gather not hunt but just gather supplies

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:02.079
from other abandoned houses to survive

01:07:02.079 --> 01:07:04.640
and uh i realized that's all i do like i

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.640
was just at my parents house

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:08.000
i went over to my parents house and i

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.599
was like oh lucky charms yes i'm gonna

01:07:09.599 --> 01:07:11.039
take this the cabinet lights up the

01:07:11.039 --> 01:07:12.960
explanation i was in there i was like oh

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:15.520
nice [ __ ] cashews

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:17.520
what's that game canned goods nobody

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.880
will know it's called like this war of

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:19.680
mine

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.280
that's a sick [ __ ] title it's a real

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.520
[ __ ] badass game so

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:24.720
that sucks though because when you play

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.960
it and you steal people feel bad yeah

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.240
they feel bad because they stole it from

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:29.839
somebody else's house who's also

01:07:29.839 --> 01:07:32.319
starving

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:33.920
i don't know it's eastern europe it's

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:35.680
like it's like supposed to be russia

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:36.880
basically

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:39.599
that sucks yeah it's a great game though

01:07:39.599 --> 01:07:41.359
it does addicting as [ __ ] i'd play nuts

01:07:41.359 --> 01:07:42.640
yeah i was watching play and i was like

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.839
i don't know then i was like damn this

01:07:43.839 --> 01:07:45.520
is just the fact that like

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.960
the fact that the characters have like

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:49.039
different emotions is like a weird i've

01:07:49.039 --> 01:07:50.480
been playing i can't stop playing yeah

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.839
and you're like it's weird to think like

01:07:51.839 --> 01:07:53.680
i gotta make my [ __ ] video game lady

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:55.520
happy again

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.280
that's a weird need i i guess it takes

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.400
it all you know

01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.680
it takes you off your own happiness

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:00.960
you're like i gotta get the video game

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.280
ladies and gentlemen

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.960
it's funny to watch these guys like sulk

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.720
around the house like in the video game

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.400
house and i'm just like you're really

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.480

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:34.239
crash dude just like

01:08:34.239 --> 01:08:36.159
that is true i was feeling myself for a

01:08:36.159 --> 01:08:38.080
minute yeah i was happy and then the

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.400
last like week or two i just [ __ ] hit

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:42.480
well the week since the podcast yeah

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:45.199
just to hit a horrible wall i'm gonna

01:08:45.199 --> 01:08:46.719
yeah what happens to me is i'll like

01:08:46.719 --> 01:08:48.000
start like right now i have a new

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.239
activity so i'm like oh yoga yeah

01:08:50.239 --> 01:08:51.520
i can't wait to go wait hold on can i

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:53.920
ask you when is what time is hot yoga

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:55.040
tomorrow uh i'll have to look up the

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.480
schedule but it will probably go on like

01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:58.319
either the afternoon or evening or

01:08:58.319 --> 01:09:01.040
evening because i think my puppy bowl

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.239
dude

01:09:02.239 --> 01:09:03.679
if i get the puppy ball i promise to

01:09:03.679 --> 01:09:05.600
call one of the puppies in n word

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.279
dude

01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:09.279
if jesus christ god damn it i forgot i

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:11.279
was getting accused of being racist okay

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:13.520
should have said that joke too late

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.679
but i mean how funny would that be if

01:09:15.679 --> 01:09:18.239
you call a puppy the n-word on

01:09:18.239 --> 01:09:19.679
the puppy bowl which is like animal

01:09:19.679 --> 01:09:22.000
planets like you they would [ __ ] edit

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.759
you out of course but i would give it a

01:09:23.759 --> 01:09:26.560
shot if i snuck onto the live

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:29.359
live shot of the puppies

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:31.679
but no the um oh no

01:09:31.679 --> 01:09:33.600
what you would call it dude there's a

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:35.040
loop you have an n word loop in your

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:35.839
head

01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:37.440
yoga will help break the n-word loop out

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.480
of your head

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:40.239
you're obsessed with the n-word i have

01:09:40.239 --> 01:09:42.560
two scripts either cut coach ruff or

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.080
coach fluff

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.679
what are you gonna take

01:09:45.679 --> 01:09:47.120
who's more like you i think i'm more

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.880
fluff thinking more fluffy i think i'm

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:51.440
more of a player's coach that's good

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:53.440
i i hope this isn't me saying no one's

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.040
going to [ __ ] yoga is going to break

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:57.199
the loop so i have my auditions at 10 30

01:09:57.199 --> 01:09:59.280
