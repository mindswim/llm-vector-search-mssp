00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:06.949
if I tell the same feeling meet and

00:08:06.949 --> 00:08:09.320
Beezer I had hearing this voice cuz he

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:15.770
just came down a dark alley yeah yeah

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.320
what's up yeah and I just heard the

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.419
voice that was just the you know that

00:08:20.419 --> 00:08:22.490
[ __ ] [ __ ] pump Black & Decker [ __ ]

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.430
you're talking 20 wall to wall to wall

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.500
which would invoke the wall I was at

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.090
Lincoln tach learning [ __ ] cars

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.589
[Music]

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:35.990
y'okay percocet for that though I said

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.849
[ __ ] you

00:08:37.849 --> 00:08:40.279
Brett meaning when I said when he walked

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:42.709
away I said I was so starstruck by the

00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:45.050
voice said listen to that so many times

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:45.980
it makes me laugh

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.800
I play there's so many people and it

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.569
just [ __ ] the voices when I hear as

00:08:50.569 --> 00:08:52.069
to the same feeling I got when I came to

00:08:52.069 --> 00:08:53.980
the stand one night we watched Dan Mintz

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:59.089
doing stand-up and I was like here Tina

00:08:59.089 --> 00:09:00.889
Belcher his voice from Bob's Burgers

00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:02.990
because it's just his speaking voice and

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.720
so bizarre to hear the voice of Tina's

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.420
doing stuff and good like funny really

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.709
funny guys so it's like it was just

00:09:09.709 --> 00:09:13.970
interesting is it yeah this woman gave

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.459
me a palm readings and said I'm going to

00:09:16.459 --> 00:09:20.000
die but I don't believe in that stuff

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.649
even if she is a dermatologist I mean

00:09:24.649 --> 00:09:26.660
it's just so bizarre do you know the car

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:27.889
to natal you no one here watches

00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:29.689
cartoons just me and Christine [ __ ]

00:09:29.689 --> 00:09:30.579
stone already

00:09:30.579 --> 00:09:34.250
I don't it's so great now I watch sports

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:39.589
i watch sports and fox news you know

00:09:39.589 --> 00:09:46.699
it's maybe last night actually we went

00:09:46.699 --> 00:09:52.129
to Jacobs house for the NASCAR Super

00:09:52.129 --> 00:09:54.259
Bowl the championship the national

00:09:54.259 --> 00:09:57.800
championships that we call it dozen 18

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.350
Monster Energy Cup championship and his

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.089
dude that's when you know your sports

00:10:02.089 --> 00:10:07.959
legit Monster Energy Cup you know

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:22.339
overall it's probably a horrific sport

00:10:22.339 --> 00:10:24.620
but when it's like gambling on something

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.950
you can get behind anything you know

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.870
and that's how I felt going to Jacobs he

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:31.120
was so invested in Joey Logano winning

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.160
and then the fact that it seemed like it

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.540
was a possibility from the time we got

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.140
there

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:39.070
then by Jacobs explanation look in not

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:40.690
good form at all and I mean I'm not a

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:41.950
[ __ ] we could see that he was behind

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.320
another guy but it seemed like a little

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.070
out of reach

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:47.380
and then he came around and like [ __ ]

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.130
it's so rude

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.990
following one card giving a [ __ ] about

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:53.080
it yeah for any reason made it more

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:57.040
silent for sure yeah occasionally do

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:06.580
yeah just have something to drink to up

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:12.700
there with golf as far as just a nap but

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.120
golf is awful again that said me and

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.280
straw all had to commentate on golf one

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.910
time we did a live like a companion

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:26.320
thing to it I've totally forget some

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.710
website but we sat there and watch me

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.410
and Sherrod we actually had a blast but

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.520
we just you know I mean we smoked before

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.800
and just sat there and like well and it

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.720
came down like a guy lost like a nine

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.980
something we all recognize that's too

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.660
much nice a stroke now as nowhere as

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.920
much but I was like a lot it was like

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.080
three or four then the guy who was like

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.790
way in the lead just ate [ __ ] in the

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.730
sand and just george polarski I [ __ ] a

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:55.690
guy who just [ __ ] was in the mud man

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.580
it just kept swinging and [ __ ] up in

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.100
the same yes good laughs I think it what

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.050
I think it was a crazy like six stroke

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.930
lead and he just went like four over

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.350
partners eating [ __ ] this dude he could

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.670
not get out of that dude it was like a

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.410
pure choke goddamn and now I have his

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.960
bzees voice in my head dish these are

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.280
talking about God he's like there he is

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.270

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:22.150
Lane I'm ashamed that should happen like

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.560
there should be filly companion pieces

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.830
to anything like a real like just turn

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.600

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.290
talking about [ __ ] it at this point

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.740

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.200
black Lou

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.450
the Cowboys are shaping up though they

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.430
safe enough but I mean it's just gonna

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.510
waste our time this year they're not

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:47.370
gonna do anything in the place probably

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.279
anything significant traffic but the

00:12:50.279 --> 00:12:52.410
Eagles I don't even know what I mean

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.959
everyone's hurt but beyond that even I

00:12:54.959 --> 00:12:55.860
don't couldn't even guess what the

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.470
problem Carson Wentz I've never heard it

00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:59.430
read the game yesterday

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:04.160
I mean how they needed you out there I

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.290
mean I had the dream that I was gonna be

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:14.370
quarterbacking yeah but uh it's uh you

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.610
would have I wouldn't know went out like

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:21.449
that you just got to believe it I don't

00:13:21.449 --> 00:13:23.339
I wouldn't went out like that today I

00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:24.540
would just throw more screens man

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.149
non-stop screams I don't think you

00:13:27.149 --> 00:13:30.870
understood how hard a scream no [ __ ]

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.699
I'm six-three dude I'm good you drove

00:13:32.699 --> 00:13:36.660
that yeah a nice tight spiral right over

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.120
the helmet of the closest defender cuz

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.290
you know I gotta let him come in I

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:41.820
realize I'm taking a real chance here

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.190
getting it because the old lines let

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.570
them through he would take those hits

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.010
though but that dumped off

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:51.329
no no terrified of his but I know I'm

00:13:51.329 --> 00:13:52.769
gonna get touched a little bit if I'm

00:13:52.769 --> 00:13:54.630
gonna hit these screens but I'll just

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.880
non-stop screams and then when they're

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.279
like we're gonna read the screen audible

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:02.250
switch sides I'm gonna play like a like

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:06.120
a 12 year old plays mad straight spin

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.940
when it becomes time crazy long bombs

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.899

00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:16.050
and just hope that I have how far do you

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:17.790

00:17:36.769 --> 00:17:41.929
the NFL this is anybody who's listening

00:17:41.929 --> 00:17:44.320
anybody listening that thinks like

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:50.750
anybody that's like Jay now that's

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:52.909
that's a punter in the NFL and I think

00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:54.710
he's the closest to a normal human we

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.289
can find yeah Wow and in the Pro Bowl

00:17:57.289 --> 00:17:59.149
they tried to run a fake punt and John

00:17:59.149 --> 00:18:01.899
Daly said nah Jesus

00:18:01.899 --> 00:18:07.460
we just upright goddamn lbu dude now I'm

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:13.519
bigger than that Potter man that guy's

00:18:13.519 --> 00:18:14.059
alive

00:18:14.059 --> 00:18:19.580
that guy died I'm sure now he popped up

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.200
like a dork at the end of that play look

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.580
I'm gonna say my gonna take a shot I may

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.460
even go down I'm just saying I could

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.070
break a few in my mind you couldn't

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:32.389
break one you couldn't really yeah [ __ ]

00:18:32.389 --> 00:18:34.250

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.860

step kid who's this age I can't buy into

Martin Truex fan you're pissed off they

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:44.970
would all do the same thing isn't at the

00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:46.680
game that's the thing when it's an

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.900
individual sport you know it's there's

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:50.850
no there's no team it's just him against

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:53.400
39 other guys and now you said though

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:56.520
there are teams well they're their race

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.620
teams like he and there's two other guys

00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:00.270
on his team but when it comes to the

00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:03.390
ones here on the track every true true

00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:07.110
that his teammate is the one that blew

00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:08.880
out something essentially they had to

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:11.270
stop the race and reset everybody again

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:14.670

00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:32.100
before to do by some women especially

00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:33.900
like bachelorette parties and [ __ ] some

00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:36.450
pretty weird things sexually and I want

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:37.590
people to call it and tell us the

00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:39.330
weirdest thing that's been requested of

00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:41.430
them sexually if you want to call and

00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:42.390
say that weirdest thing you've asked for

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:44.580
by all means but I figure that's a

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:46.320
little harder sometimes you won't come

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:47.250
forward with that but what's the

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:48.990
weirdest thing you've ever been asked to

00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:55.320
do okay um mine was a girl asked me I've

00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:56.910
been a girl flat-out hit her before

00:54:56.910 --> 00:55:00.240
which I just couldn't do now I gave the

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:03.690
gentlest tap she said no for real I gave

00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:07.170
the same it was like same effort tap the

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:08.880
second time and she like tried to insult

00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:10.590
me and call me a [ __ ] to get me to do

00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:13.170
it yeah and then I called you a [ __ ] and

00:55:13.170 --> 00:55:19.050
you didn't hit her then I had two

00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:20.400
friends come in and clean up the mess

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:24.810
yeah but she's not my thing and she was

00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:26.880
fine with it she was literally trying to

00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:28.110
get that she was calling me [ __ ] like

00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:30.090
to try to get this fantasy she had gone

00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:31.590
but I'm like an animal I don't respond

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:33.510

00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:37.710
beating anyway but I can I can get

00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:39.180
choked a little doesn't bother me that

00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:42.150
much but not really into it and choking

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:44.099
I can do but I'm also getting very very

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:27.620
like I said I worry about like mr. Haig

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.630
I'm too big my think is always a too big

01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:31.520
and clunky and fat and whatever where's

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.800
like some people are worried like Justin

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.800
silver who's like handsome guy in shape

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.200
yeah I don't think Swart bothers him a

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.090
ton but then he's always what his hair

01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:43.370
is good you know but I think I don't

01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:44.720
think Justin is having any kind of hair

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.460
problem at all but you know you don't

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:48.440
see I get the person's own problems yeah

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.540
probably the facial tic keeps him away a

01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:51.950
little bit like he's got a pretty

01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:53.930
hardcore facial tic right like his eyes

01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:59.290

01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:39.650
machines and so it was cousin of open

01:13:39.650 --> 01:13:41.750
space where they had a couch and like a

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:43.730
like this huge thing I was hoping you

01:13:43.730 --> 01:13:44.960
brought up on one of those standing

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:50.150
desks but I will not be able to do that

01:13:50.150 --> 01:13:51.949
for my first time

01:13:51.949 --> 01:13:53.960
no what she does is you go you know

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:55.610
those desks come down normal desks and

01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:58.219
they raise up you go on it you get on

01:13:58.219 --> 01:14:00.590
all fours then have her crank the thing

01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:01.699
that raises you up and then your

01:14:01.699 --> 01:14:02.870
buttholes right in front of her mouth

01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:09.889
man mechanic style did you feel gay I

01:14:09.889 --> 01:14:11.780
had my ass eaten the first time like

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.460
five years ago and at first I was like

01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:15.020
it feels gay and then she did it more

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:16.520
and I was like this is just awesome if

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:17.900
he felt gay because the guy was chewing

01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:20.030

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.400

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:21.330
looking contest Hector the girl was she

01:15:21.330 --> 01:15:25.590
pretty at all yeah I mean because like

01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:26.969
you know some people living on she's

01:15:26.969 --> 01:15:40.380
[ __ ] ugly but she walks by so you

01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:44.790
think she was pretty but it's about the

01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:45.770
eye of the beholder

01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:50.120
[Laughter]

01:15:51.860 --> 01:16:02.250

01:16:03.449 --> 01:16:05.159
bad about their looks but I mean there

01:16:05.159 --> 01:16:06.840
is something the girl we're currently

01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:09.690
watching why I asked like an [ __ ] is

01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:12.719
smoking hot so it's not out of the realm

01:16:12.719 --> 01:16:14.670
of possibility that you found a really

01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:17.250
smokin hot girl to lick your [ __ ] but

01:16:17.250 --> 01:16:20.909
you understand also the the view of the

01:16:20.909 --> 01:16:23.010
world so when you ask if someone's like

01:16:23.010 --> 01:16:25.920
hot you out with you Jacob forget what

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:30.150
we're saying ultimately is this a larger

01:16:30.150 --> 01:16:31.710
woman is that if skinny woman's at a

01:16:31.710 --> 01:16:33.599
drugged-out looking chick just a normal

01:16:33.599 --> 01:16:38.429

like died err not necessarily big

01:16:44.250 --> 01:16:46.380
because baby she's like a girl in that

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:48.630
we you know suppose you find a girl a

01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:53.550

01:16:53.550 --> 01:16:55.560
