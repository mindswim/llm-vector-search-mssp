cast but me and him drove up to buffalo

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.000
this weekend he was [ __ ] flying the

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.360
whole time and he

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.680
he never saw a cop on the side of the

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.280
road like every cop that we

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.040
passed i'd have to be like cop there's a

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.479
cop up here

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.000
you know like the whole time i was like

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.440
how am i the only one spotting these

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.080
cops

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.040
he's like i'm fine he's like i'm not

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.560
speeding like don't even worry

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.840
instead of just being like oh yeah my

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.199
bad i can't yeah i'm not paying

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:04.880
attention to the side of the road

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.160
he's like no i'm not speeding like

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.600
that's why i'm not slowing down i'm like

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.759
dude you're going to 80 in a 65.

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:10.880
like they're going to get you he's a

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.400
connecticut boy he's he's telling you

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.840
he's going 8 i drive these roads

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.000
yeah he's going 80 in the 65 and he was

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.759
like so then i was like dude you're

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:18.720
definitely speeding

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.360
and he was like i think my speedometer

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.039
is off about 8 miles per hour

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.400
and i was like just admit your speed

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.120
this is crazy are you serious about that

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.520
he was

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.600
gonna go automotive on you did he lift

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.280
his hand off the steering wheel like i'm

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.199
off by about eight miles per hour

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:36.800
and it was also funny because he was

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.240
like like i leaned

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.160
to look at the speedometer and he was

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.400
like well you're at a bad angle

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.080
and then we both realized like they're

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.520
designed

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.880
you know how they they're elevated so

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.080
that it's actually elevated so the

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.520
passenger can see

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.000
yeah this what the exact speed is it's

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.280
at that angle so it was like

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.360
was that the bmw yeah okay so you guys

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.880
are having conversations about like the

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.600
mechanics

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.680
speedometer you're not you're just

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.039
speeding just say you're speeding like

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:01.919
don't just be like

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.080
no i'm not and then be like the

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.000
speedometer's off eight miles an hour

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.759
plus the angular plus the angle like

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:09.600
you're just missing this thing entirely

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.919
and then we get to cause you can feel

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:13.199
when you're going fast in a car

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.440
yeah i mean i could no we're also i'm

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.800
sitting next to him like i can see

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.199
there's

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:19.280
the angle isn't ridiculous like i can

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.199
see the speedometers

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:22.639

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:24.319
radio is broke so all we're doing we're

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:25.919
just fighting for six hours

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:29.919
that's every car ride uh and then

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.400
we pass a [ __ ] speed limit sign that

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.759
has a radar on it

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.360
you know it's like checking his

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.680
speedometer looking at the radar oh

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.600

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.520
kept denying oh

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.479

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.000
i checked his speed while he was

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.759

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.520
cross-country just so i can cheat like

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.799
an 80s bad guy

00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:25.200
yeah well the guy in the 1904 olympics

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.400
cheated he got in a car

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.320
second place dude he technically he gave

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.520
up

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.280
gave up dude he [ __ ] used i think he

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.640
was from new york he brought a

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.760
buddy down there and they had a hard

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.120
time finding st louis nobody knew where

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:35.840
the [ __ ] saying

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.760
it was supposed to be in chicago so like

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.440
he's running and like he gives up after

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.200
like nine miles he's like yo dude [ __ ]

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.640
it i'm getting the car

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.240
so they drive around and he like

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.080
apologizes and then they're at the

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.039
stadiums like all right well i guess

00:18:47.039 --> 00:18:48.000
i'll finish it up

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.600
but like nobody knows he got in a car so

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.120
he goes in the stadium people are like

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.240
oh [ __ ] dude first place

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.799
oh like they give him the gold medal and

00:18:56.799 --> 00:18:59.840
like only at the [ __ ] ceremony of the

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.120
like the president's daughter is going

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.880
to put a wreath on him on the olympic

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.320
podium and he leans in he's like

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.280
yeah i [ __ ] cheated i got in the car

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.440
so they gave him second biggest game

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.440
which that sucks i was listening to and

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.720
i was bummed out

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.240
because technically the cubans should

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.240
have got a medal dude

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.400
she should have got bronzed oh he should

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.679
have got that third point

00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:21.600
he could have gone back with a medal so

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.960
he taught us he he taught

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.000
he gets to go back and tell him like

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.840
yeah i had special running pants someone

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.600
from america they wore my dress pants

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.240
that's fine

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.320
and then the 1904 olympics also had a

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.360
horse

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.799
yeah that was my favorite that was my

00:19:40.799 --> 00:19:42.720
favorite that's episode two it was so

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.240
weird when i found it so the guy who put

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.200
on the olympics doesn't

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.559
[ __ ] know about sports he was just

00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:48.160
like a shitty booker so the first thing

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.679
he booked was this psychic horse that

00:19:49.679 --> 00:19:51.360
could speak english named jim key

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.880
because that dude was doing like arena

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.559
gigs in 1904

00:19:54.559 --> 00:19:56.400
so they booked him and then that's what

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.000
episode two is is like how the [ __ ]

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.360
because i judged it in episode one i was

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.320
like they're definitely just beating the

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.360
[ __ ] out of that thing it was like

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.159
animal abuse

00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:03.679
yeah then episode two i was like how

00:20:03.679 --> 00:20:05.200
they actually do that and

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.720
that that's the story in episode two

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.159
whereas this this black dude who made a

00:20:08.159 --> 00:20:09.679
bunch of money in the civil war

00:20:09.679 --> 00:20:11.679
[ __ ] he got caught for trees and just

00:20:11.679 --> 00:20:13.120
won a bunch of money off the guards in

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.400
the prison in the north so they didn't

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.760
kill him they liked him a lot yeah he

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.280
buys like a horse disneyland

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.200
breeds a [ __ ] horse and then just

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.720
hangs out with it for nine years until

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.440
it kind of like

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.440
learns just through trial and error how

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.799
to answer questions and he doesn't even

00:20:24.799 --> 00:20:26.000
know why it works

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.120
but eventually he's just like all right

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.720
i'm gonna go sell opium linament i'm

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.840
gonna bring this horse and so he just

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.760
does live gigs and as much as opium

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.799
makes it country you tricked like

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:36.320
harvard scientists basically yeah yeah

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.520
they brought in sixth graders at the

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.640
1904 olympics

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.320
he ties with sixth graders everybody

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.400
loses their mind everything for olympics

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.440
must have been so fun

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.440
also we forgot to mention it was seven

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.480
months yeah

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.000
that's how long the games were were they

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.600
really he was just shut up

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.640
he didn't know anything about the sport

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.679
he was like all right we're gonna do

00:20:51.679 --> 00:20:53.760
shows for seven months too nice he was

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.200
making up events they had like a tug of

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.000
war

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.320
also you referred to it as the fye

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.039
festival

00:20:59.039 --> 00:21:00.400
yeah there's gonna be some mistakes in

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.320
this podcast heads up now i want you to

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.760
know i gave you the benefit of the doubt

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.960
i didn't even know you were trying to

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.640
say fire festival

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.960
right he i thought i was like fye isn't

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.919
that like a

00:21:09.919 --> 00:21:12.720
electronics store because that he was

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.919
kind of having like a world fair with

00:21:13.919 --> 00:21:14.960
new inventions

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.960
so he was like this fye festival i was

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.960
like all right it makes sense

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.480
that is i think these are facts these

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.799
are the [ __ ] the captain got his

00:21:22.799 --> 00:21:25.200
revenge

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.960
beezer was like [ __ ] idiot doesn't

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.280
even know it's fire festival

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.960
captain behalf dude i found that right

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.320
right before it was going to go out i

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.159
found it i told him he was going to get

00:21:36.159 --> 00:21:37.010
a wooden tooth

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:40.960
[Laughter]

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.240
told me right beforehand i was like [ __ ]

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.919
it dude just let it run yeah it's great

00:21:43.919 --> 00:21:44.720
it's the best man

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.400
30 minutes you listen to it every single

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.919
time i'm quick to ditch a [ __ ]

00:21:47.919 --> 00:21:49.840
podcast where i'm just kind of like

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.440
all right um because i like to like

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.559
listen to it i don't even like our

00:21:52.559 --> 00:21:53.679
podcasts anymore i

00:21:53.679 --> 00:21:55.840
barely just yeah i honestly i listen to

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.679
four minutes love this podcast but

00:21:57.679 --> 00:22:00.000
uh like so when i do them like i that's

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:00.720
the thing is

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.320
if i was gonna make a [ __ ] podcast

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.400
like it's gotta be worth something

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.600
like it's gotta be there's gotta be

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.360
value to it so the way i i try to think

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.880
about it when i decide to do it is that

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.799
like i'm leaving a long voicemail for

00:22:10.799 --> 00:22:12.640
four specific people that are my friends

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.440
in my life

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.960
so if i was gonna leave them a voicemail

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.240
that's like 30 minutes long about some

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.039
weird [ __ ]

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:19.360
what would like entertain them and also

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.960
make them not make fun of me too much

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.280
but

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.120
seriously they would enjoy it yeah yeah

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.400
so it's like that you gotta watch out

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.080
for that guy that ended up getting us in

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:26.799
trouble

00:22:26.799 --> 00:22:28.080
because we were like hey it's just our

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.679
friends listening to this let's talk

00:22:29.679 --> 00:22:30.960
[ __ ] on everyone

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.360
true you balance you you toe the line

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.080

being the worst roommate i ever had oh

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.559

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.200
funny thing uh about

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.399
we were talking about gerbies about how

00:30:18.399 --> 00:30:20.399

is hard work and then like now that i

00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:26.880
think about it dude the [ __ ]

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.000
anxiety of knowing when i have a show

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.919
it's stupid like my whole weekend i'm

00:30:31.919 --> 00:30:33.039
just like [ __ ]

00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:36.080
[ __ ] to go somewhere wrap your day up by

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.279
three and be like all right i can just

00:30:37.279 --> 00:30:38.960
go do whatever i want

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.559
pretty [ __ ] nice yeah of course the

00:30:40.559 --> 00:30:42.240
you know the the wear on the

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.000
although the wear on the shell in terms

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.919
of like [ __ ] like using your body all

00:30:45.919 --> 00:30:46.320
day

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.399
stand up you're up late at night yeah

00:30:48.399 --> 00:30:50.240
it's also a party lifestyle

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.279
like you're not really recovering a

00:30:51.279 --> 00:30:52.720
whole lot true you know if you're still

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.440
going hard

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.520
yeah that's tough yeah i remember as i

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.120
got older i was like yeah this is

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.559
[ __ ] kind of hard and i was like this

00:30:58.559 --> 00:31:00.480
is like hard in a weird way that like

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.320
when you do a [ __ ] like a hard physical

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.080
day you get done you're kind of tired

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.760
you're like feels good tell us unless

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.200
you do it for 40 years and like your

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:07.760
whole body

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.760
shut down feels bad yeah i think stand

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.120
up dude a lot of 40

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.760
in the 40th year stand up you either get

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.559
like weird

00:31:14.559 --> 00:31:18.240
kind of gay healthy or like yeah or

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:21.360
you're just kind of just like hurting

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.799
yeah i mean that's why i'm making an

00:31:22.799 --> 00:31:24.159
extreme i'm making sure you know but

00:31:24.159 --> 00:31:25.120
stand-up's also

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.720
yeah i'm trying to get gay healthy

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.519
anytime you you put yourself out there

00:31:29.519 --> 00:31:32.080
versus just working there is definitely

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.159
a level of [ __ ] anxiety and stress

00:31:34.159 --> 00:31:35.120
that comes with

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:38.080
all of your [ __ ] depends on you yeah yes

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:38.799
that's hard

00:31:38.799 --> 00:31:40.080
yeah i'm not saying it's harder than

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.640
working but it is hard as far as

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.480
mentally i would say it's taxing

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.320
mentally it also looks easy if you're

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.200
good at it

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.480
it's like owning your own business it's

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.000
like owning your own business i'm sure

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:50.559
similar

00:31:50.559 --> 00:31:52.240
i bet owning your own business is just

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.600
hell it's hard

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.600
as far as stress yeah as a as an

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.799
entrepreneur i can tell you

00:31:56.799 --> 00:31:58.559
yeah it's [ __ ] i'm also worried like

00:31:58.559 --> 00:32:00.000
what's it do to your brain like

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.600
if we're just like animals like what's

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.120
it do to your brain that like you get on

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.640
stage every night for like eight nine

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.120
years

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.640
and you like your self-worth is

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.960
dependent upon that if you like

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.320
unless you really think about it like

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.480
you are having a very high stress thing

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.159
for a certain amount of time for a small

00:32:14.159 --> 00:32:15.039
window and then

00:32:15.039 --> 00:32:17.039
not and like that's a weird thing to do

00:32:17.039 --> 00:32:18.960
to a person for like nine years i think

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:19.679
what happens

00:32:19.679 --> 00:32:21.279
what happens at least what i'm

00:32:21.279 --> 00:32:23.039
experiencing for sure is the level of

00:32:23.039 --> 00:32:24.559
stress is dropped

00:32:24.559 --> 00:32:27.600
a lot as far as getting on stage like

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.640
i'm not like nervous

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.799
there's not like a level of i mean

00:32:30.799 --> 00:32:32.159
there's definitely a [ __ ]

00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:33.840
you get adrenaline from doing stand-up

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:34.960
but it's not like it used to be where

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.399
i'd be like oh [ __ ] i have a spot

00:32:36.399 --> 00:32:37.279
tonight like

00:32:37.279 --> 00:32:39.120
like i'm like nervous for a spot now

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.559
it's just like [ __ ] i gotta go do this

00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:41.039
spot

00:32:41.039 --> 00:32:43.679
yeah it is work now as far as going to

00:32:43.679 --> 00:32:44.399
do a show

00:32:44.399 --> 00:32:46.559
interesting doing multiple hour sets is

00:32:46.559 --> 00:32:47.600
that's physically doing

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.120
that's physically demanding that

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.880
literally is like now

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.279
now i just started headlining so like on

00:32:53.279 --> 00:32:54.080
weekends if i

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.080
when you have two shows that sucks dude

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.760
doing two back-to-back like

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.679
hour-long shows that legitimately tires

00:32:59.679 --> 00:33:02.320
you out yeah just on a like a

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.559
neurological level of all of your like

00:33:04.559 --> 00:33:05.600
weird science yeah

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.080
it tires you out dude when i was doing

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:08.880
stand-up when i was

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.720
like younger doing it like real hard for

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.080
a year and then i remember i stopped

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.440
when i got married

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.279
the first time the uh i'm saying that

00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:18.960
i remember at 8 p.m i would get an

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.799
adrenaline dump i'd be sitting there and

00:33:20.799 --> 00:33:21.279
be like

00:33:21.279 --> 00:33:22.799
whoa what the [ __ ] is that and it would

00:33:22.799 --> 00:33:24.159
my body was trained to release

00:33:24.159 --> 00:33:24.720
adrenaline

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.880
at that time then i remember like after

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.559
like three months it went away

00:33:28.559 --> 00:33:31.039
yeah it was weird so your body syncs up

00:33:31.039 --> 00:33:32.080
you're ready to roll

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.440
yeah i'm kind of concerned about it

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.279
because you know i'm not concerned in a

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:36.799
negative way just like in a curious way

00:33:36.799 --> 00:33:38.080
of like what the [ __ ] like

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.360
there's no way to judge what i'd be if i

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.960
never did stand up before but like what

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:41.760
has it done to me

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.080
well i mean especially with like all the

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.440
research for oral presentations

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.200
because i'm taking it seriously yeah i

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.360
like doing it but i also like

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.360
know that i'm shoving a bunch of [ __ ]

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.399
into my head

00:33:52.399 --> 00:33:54.320
and then trying to find like connections

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.000
to it and stuff and really look at it

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.279
and then the next week i don't think

00:33:57.279 --> 00:33:58.559
about it at all yeah it's just learning

00:33:58.559 --> 00:34:00.080
you're learning bro

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.559
i know it's been a while there's all

00:34:02.559 --> 00:34:04.320
this knowledge doing to my brain

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.000
yeah i'll be fine you'll be fine i'll

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.200
bring myself talking about princess

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.639
diana to some person

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:10.320
and then see myself from a third person

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.520
i'm like why are you talking about

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.879
prince diana in the real world right now

00:34:12.879 --> 00:34:14.079
no that's good i hear you're saying that

00:34:14.079 --> 00:34:15.359
you've got more [ __ ] in your brain

00:34:15.359 --> 00:34:17.280
no it's good dude your brain i think it

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.800
was stand up another weird thing that

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.520
happens when

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:20.960
and you notice it when you start and

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.639
then you just it's just becomes the way

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:23.839
you think you like think

00:34:23.839 --> 00:34:26.240
in bits oh god yes like where you start

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:28.159
thinking like how can i make this a bit

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:31.760
how is this a joke yeah and then

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.599
i don't know either you it just is there

00:34:33.599 --> 00:34:35.119
and you don't notice anymore or you grow

00:34:35.119 --> 00:34:36.240
out of it but

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.320
yeah i don't feel that way anymore but i

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.599
used to for sure like

00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:41.200
when you're just only obsessed with

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.480
stand up so you're just thinking about

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.919
it constantly i should try to turn my

00:34:43.919 --> 00:34:44.480
brain off

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.679
yeah i do the same thing like all right

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:47.119
no more dude turn your brain off don't

00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:48.079
analyze anything

00:34:48.079 --> 00:34:51.440
more bad bit ideas someone has just all

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.079
day just a

00:34:52.079 --> 00:34:54.639
bomb joke after bomb joke in your head

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:56.000
it's all yeah for me it was also like

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.520
who am i with like if i was with like a

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.640
girlfriend at the time whatever then

00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.839
like i'm sort of on

00:34:59.839 --> 00:35:01.839
like and even if i'm like really

00:35:01.839 --> 00:35:03.359
comfortable or whatever like that is

00:35:03.359 --> 00:35:05.040
happening which means i'm not present

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.480
which means i'm like not

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.560
yeah when somebody's [ __ ] up happens

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.839
and you're like

00:35:09.839 --> 00:35:11.520
yes it's kind of funny i think i could

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.800
warp this and it's just yeah i

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.920
definitely still have that

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.920
yeah yeah i got that but that's kind of

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.680
what got me into stand-up mm-hmm

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.119
like a [ __ ] up thing and then just

00:35:19.119 --> 00:35:21.040
being like how is this funny yeah

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.320
you've also talked about before where

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.240
like you see like when [ __ ] happens your

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.599
filters are like different

00:35:25.599 --> 00:35:27.440
sometimes to other people just like how

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.800
you look at things from like motiva i'm

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:29.200
not

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.480
like buddy or brett here or anything no

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.400
it's okay like you already were weird

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.839
yeah we are for sure but

00:35:35.839 --> 00:35:36.880
always says he's like you guys are

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.599
losers you know that right yeah exactly

00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:42.400
for sure yeah i yeah i was at my

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.920
grandma's funeral and was like trying

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:44.960
not to laugh

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.800
thinking about what was funny about it

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.000
yeah yeah

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.359
that's a weird thing i'm watching how

00:35:49.359 --> 00:35:51.040
other people digest it and then judging

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.160
that and then judging it

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.079
yeah yeah it is kind of strange just

00:35:54.079 --> 00:35:55.599
kind of bopping around too much

00:35:55.599 --> 00:35:56.960
yeah so what would you like to know

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.800
about princess diana

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.000
so you know why ponzi is uh ponzi's

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.040
great ponzi was

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.800
honestly one of my favorites too oh yeah

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.160
if we didn't clarify that the

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.520
the jokes if you listen to the ponzi

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.280
episode overall presentations i'm the

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.560
guy with the cups if you think yeah

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.160
why i could like laugh at ponzi so much

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.920
because like i understand being a piece

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:16.480
of [ __ ]

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.480
just like not blaming yourself and just

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.839
being like i don't know i'm in florida

00:36:19.839 --> 00:36:21.359
my speedometer is broke

00:36:21.359 --> 00:36:22.880
yeah exactly my favorite part of that

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.640
time is uh like you could just be such a

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:27.119
high level grifter and just move like 10

00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:28.960
minutes away and nobody knew who you

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:29.440
were

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.440
dude and you could just grift away so

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.920
much wild [ __ ] happens between like 1870

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.119
and 1930.

00:36:35.119 --> 00:36:36.560
yeah if you look at where everything

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.480
takes place like the 1904 olympics gymke

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.599
all that [ __ ] like that's

00:36:39.599 --> 00:36:42.240
a hub of like if you're a grifter dude

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.359
time to get rich man

00:36:43.359 --> 00:36:45.040
well here's here's the thing the reason

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.040
that history is like that with like from

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.960
1870 to 1830 is because that's when

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.560
people actually started documenting this

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.280
[ __ ]

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.599
so like it was literally on from the

00:36:53.599 --> 00:36:54.800
beginning of time

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.119
until 1930 that people were just like

00:36:57.119 --> 00:36:59.760
yeah i'd murdered someone in this state

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.240
i'm just going to move counties yeah it

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:02.960
would move like

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.359
30 minutes away and just set up shop if

00:37:05.359 --> 00:37:06.800
you didn't make them if you didn't like

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.000
forever i never thought about that

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.320
if you didn't make the bible like you

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.240
nothing existed of like what you did

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:12.720
yeah

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.119
someone drew like a [ __ ] bird on a

00:37:15.119 --> 00:37:16.320
cave of what you did

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:20.160
yeah no one saw it yeah

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.160
yeah it's not like that was i mean i

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.520
think there is definitely times in

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.280
history where people were wilding out

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.560
i think we're getting into that right

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.320
now so much there's a while out right

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:28.640
now

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.839
yeah um but yeah that's just as soon as

00:37:31.839 --> 00:37:33.359
it started getting documented

00:37:33.359 --> 00:37:36.000
it's like it's like uh it's like when

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.200
people think florida's like a

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.800
particularly crazy state

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.800
it's like no they just have a law that

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.640
says if you commit a crime we can write

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.599
about it

00:37:43.599 --> 00:37:44.880
i'll do that so that's why they're

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.480
always in the news is like a florida man

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.160
that commits this crime

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:49.520
it's because other states don't publish

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.760
it like that really yeah it's like the

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.760
sunshine law that's why that's why they

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.040
filmed cops there

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:58.560
uh yeah yeah but they filmed cops

00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.920
everywhere yeah but i think it started

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.280
in florida probably it's like a shame

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.720
based punishment the idea like if you

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.440
get a dui

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.960
some counties throw your [ __ ] picture

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.000
in the news yeah if you're caught with

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.280
hookers they put your picture in

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.040
yeah and they tell like what kind of car

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.119
it's always like a dodge stratus

00:38:11.119 --> 00:38:13.599
police have confiscated a dodge stratus

00:38:13.599 --> 00:38:14.640
yeah and it's

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.320
it is weird and everybody's like it's a

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.920
right to know law it's like you don't

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.040
have the [ __ ] you don't have the right

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:19.599
to know

00:38:19.599 --> 00:38:21.680
yeah you don't have the right to know

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.440
[ __ ] that i mean i guess you can

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.200
you can argue it's like well i need to

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.640
know if that person's a piece of [ __ ]

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.200
it's like well

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.480
what comes from back then when you're

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.400
grifting around and then they needed it

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.680
it's like you better publish these

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.040
crimes like if your neighbor gets a

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.160
hooker you don't need to know

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.599
yeah well i should know that it's like

00:38:35.599 --> 00:38:36.960
yeah it's also like who's reading the

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.320

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.240
funniest dude ever the brothers too like

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:48.000
the culture to him because nick started

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:48.640
doing it

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:50.319
before nate even started at all so like

00:52:50.319 --> 00:52:52.079
there's a whole bunch of old videos like

00:52:52.079 --> 00:52:53.920
playing nunchucks [ __ ] hitting a blog

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.200
before like anybody gave a [ __ ] about

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.400
the internet you know yeah what's up

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.520
beat his ass i don't know

00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:59.520
yeah was it him versus like anderson

00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:01.680
silva nick diaz was like yeah was that

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:03.119
the fight he was like really [ __ ]

00:53:03.119 --> 00:53:03.839
talking

00:53:03.839 --> 00:53:05.599
that was awesome that was awesome but if

00:53:05.599 --> 00:53:07.440
you look up like robbie lawler nick diaz

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:07.839
like

00:53:07.839 --> 00:53:09.119
way back in the day when people didn't

00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:10.640
know nick diaz at all people were like i

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:11.839
feel like a grappler guy he's gonna get

00:53:11.839 --> 00:53:13.520
his ass beat dude robbie lawrence

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.640
[ __ ] people up

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:16.480
and nick came in and he just mind-gamed

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:17.599
him and like robbie didn't even

00:53:17.599 --> 00:53:18.480
understand

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.400
like why this skinny guy's talking so

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.800
much what is he doing and he's standing

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:23.359
with me

00:53:23.359 --> 00:53:24.960
and he [ __ ] not he sparked him out

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.880
dude nick's marked him out with a left

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:28.559
uh check left hook just on a button

00:53:28.559 --> 00:53:30.240
robbie goes down on his [ __ ] face

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.079
which is a bad way to get knocked out

00:53:32.079 --> 00:53:33.760
if you if you fall directly on your face

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.200
that means you got all the way shut off

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:35.920
because your hands

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:38.559
like your hands aren't there anymore if

00:53:38.559 --> 00:53:39.839
you hit your face yeah that's like one

00:53:39.839 --> 00:53:41.520
of the worst types of knockouts

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:43.119
who do you got who do you got uh

00:53:43.119 --> 00:53:44.559
mcgregor cowboy

00:53:44.559 --> 00:53:45.839
who are you going with i don't know

00:53:45.839 --> 00:53:47.599
cowboy's jenny which is why they picked

00:53:47.599 --> 00:53:47.839
him

00:53:47.839 --> 00:53:49.680
not not to say i like cowboy a lot but

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.200
cowboy's able to get

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:52.400
i mean you can put him down he's been

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.960
put down before but he's big dude and i

00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.000
don't know what the [ __ ] mcgregor's

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.359
doing mcgregor's got that anchor punch

00:53:57.359 --> 00:53:57.599
it's

00:53:57.599 --> 00:53:59.520
he's got that left-handed alley punch

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:01.440
yeah but i don't know if his combination

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.960
punch is there and also cowboy's been

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:04.240
long enough to be able to humble himself

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:05.520
and [ __ ] wrestle him down for two

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.720
rounds so

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:10.000
yeah mcgregor hasn't won a ufc match

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.520
since 2016. really yeah he also i can't

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:14.720
decide whether he's

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:16.160
i think he is like a special talent

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:18.319
though i think he yeah i agree and

00:54:18.319 --> 00:54:20.000
and i've been watching a lot of his like

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.520
his interviews and stuff and he seems

00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:23.200
he's saying the right things right now

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:24.960
as far as how like focused he is

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:27.200
he's humble yeah yeah well i mean he's

00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:28.559
telling everybody he's humble so

00:54:28.559 --> 00:54:30.720
yeah how humble is he yeah yeah i'm

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:31.760
humbled now i mean

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.680
cowboys had like 50 fights though like i

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:35.359
remember watching the guitar guy

00:54:35.359 --> 00:54:37.200
yeah in the wec i remember watching

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.040
cowboy before the ufc even bought him

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:39.359
dude

00:54:39.359 --> 00:54:41.520
at like 145 he was [ __ ] people up

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:42.799
dude nobody kicks like that

00:54:42.799 --> 00:54:45.040
how old's he i don't know maybe a couple

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:46.559
years older than us

00:54:46.559 --> 00:54:48.960
but he he he lives rough though wild

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.400
[ __ ] do you know his bulls he

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.280
didn't give a [ __ ]

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:52.559
that's over for mcgregor dude if he

00:54:52.559 --> 00:54:54.720
loses the cowboy oh it is

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.480
that's it that's why he wins it's like

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:57.839
cowboy whatever that's yeah they gave

00:54:57.839 --> 00:54:59.680
him a setup fight so they could make one

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:00.000
more

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.160
at least make one more big payoff with

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.119
him but even

00:55:03.119 --> 00:55:04.640
even for a setup fight man he might not

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:06.720
get past it cowboy [ __ ] is active and

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:07.119
he's good

00:55:07.119 --> 00:55:08.480
like it might be done but i don't i

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:09.760
don't think so i think he beats cowboy

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.040
and then they give him nate

00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.319
i don't think they even could be again i

00:55:12.319 --> 00:55:13.520
think they go nate again i think what

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.599
about mas vidal

00:55:15.599 --> 00:55:17.839
i like him a lot but i think i mean

00:55:17.839 --> 00:55:18.640
ticket sales

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:21.920
i mean mcgregor would sell like

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:25.599
crazy yeah you're right maybe more nate

00:55:25.599 --> 00:55:26.480
but

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.880
i don't know i think i think yeah but i

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:29.760
mean i think i want

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.760
to try much more dangerous fight for

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:33.520
mcgregor for sure

00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:35.920
i mean nothing against nate but i mean

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.200
god damn dude

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.640

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:46.839

00:55:46.839 --> 00:55:47.359

it's not what's up uh yeah i guess i

00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:12.640
haven't done that since i was a child

00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:13.760
you were motoring when i was a little

00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:14.079
kid

00:58:14.079 --> 00:58:15.200
no yeah that's another thing you're not

00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:17.280
motoring around once you get over like i

00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:18.799
gotta ask this young 18 year old

00:58:18.799 --> 00:58:20.480
lifeguard girl for a [ __ ] kickboard

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:21.520

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:24.640
kickboarding you're not good you're not

00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:25.839
motoring around dude

00:58:25.839 --> 00:58:27.760
you you're [ __ ] up how's your splat

00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.440
were you splashing in other lanes

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.599
i don't splash and everybody you're like

00:58:31.599 --> 00:58:32.880
your head's out of water when you

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:34.799
kickboard too so i'm just looking

00:58:34.799 --> 00:58:36.720

this young girl

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:40.799

00:58:46.319 --> 00:58:48.000
pool and that makes a noise

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.280
so woods just like turns his head

00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:52.880

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:55.200
soon as you enter the room

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:57.200

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:18.079
quoted just kept talking he was a

01:04:18.079 --> 01:04:20.079
musician he was a musical comedian

01:04:20.079 --> 01:04:23.280
so he would be like say whatever shane's

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.400
one of his punch lines were he would

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.599
just start when he would start bombing

01:04:25.599 --> 01:04:26.000
he would start

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.520
singing shane's punch lines and people

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.440

01:04:40.319 --> 01:04:42.079
yeah when you see them start to falter

01:04:42.079 --> 01:04:44.160
