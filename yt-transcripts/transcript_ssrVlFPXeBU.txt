that stuff rules you get when you start

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.920

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.440
like charlie my aunt janet i just keep

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.640

like come on man yeah yeah obviously

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.879
what's going on please dude i'm trying

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.480
to figure out what the bull guy was just

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.959
from like an urban dictionary like a

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.120
dude did his own synopsis of what he

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.239
thought the uh

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.560
so far oh god isn't it

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.080
he's that guy in the neighborhood that

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.760
never took a foothold in traditional

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.599
working man's role and as a union

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.080
employee he's under the radar

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.400
introspective and clever but likes to

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.400
get wild occasionally probably comes

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.640
from a broken home with just some issues

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.879
likes just smoke a lot of pot when

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.879
pushed to the edge explodes with fury

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.879
but will still help an old lady cross

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.840
the street safely

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.000
is he some rich kid though

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.280
kid [ __ ] rock from the old

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.440
school yeah i think he didn't grow up in

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.319
a trailer i think that was insane

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.840
i don't think you'd say

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.840

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.680
something about that really i know it

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.200

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.599

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.840
i mean who knows cause cocky kind of

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.760
just speaks for itself

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.280
[ __ ] i mean that guy could be as rich as

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.560

bull like the horns

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.720
actual realm i was telling you today i'm

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.840

guy

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.160
this dude was saying that he starts

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.680
explaining the levels of consciousness

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.880
and first of all

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.560
anyone who's anyone knows consciousness

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.000
is just basically like gravity it's

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.120
another just element in the universe

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.960
yep it is what it is it's a separate

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.479
force obviously we interact with i don't

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:07.680
know why people can't get this they

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.120
can't get their heads around this what

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.280
do you mean i think they do

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.800
some people some people reject this

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.800
notion [ __ ] they think yeah i don't know

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.840
you're talking about grand unified

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.880
you're talking about like two penn

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.759
psychists so yeah true very true people

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:21.440
here in the next avenue like prove it

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.280
yeah you know that you know it's gravity

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.120
it doesn't could be electromagnetic [ __ ]

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.120
off true but it's also like dude if my

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.880
puny nervous system

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.039
can create this level of consciousness

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.039
my puny all those you know again you

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:34.240
talk to these [ __ ] filthy

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.160
materialists who are like it's all just

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.360
like

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.759
material that happens like waft off con

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.440
okay yeah fair enough if it's all

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.680
material and i have this little tiny

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.039
nervous system you're telling me that

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.520
like all of the energy and electricity

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.080
and the heat and like amongst stars

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.000
doesn't somehow give off some level of

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.560
consciousness we can't comprehend

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.560
i mean like yeah man i hate that i hate

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.680
when people try to act like that you

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.039
have no pushback here yeah there's a

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:00.720
zero sorry

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.039
oh you're going to get the cross

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:04.720
i've been so abused over these notions

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.130
but the guy

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.760
[Applause]

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.240
[Laughter]

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.560
he starts explaining the uh

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.160
the levels of consciousness and he was

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.000
like the way it works

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.280
is

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.360
the more all consciousness is is a

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.160
response to a stimuli

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.720
so it's like say i poke you yeah if you

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.720
automatically punch me back

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.800
that's like that would be a lower level

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.240
of consciousness if i poke you and you

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.919
kind of get like a pop-up menu of like i

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.199
could do this i could do that could you

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:34.479
know if like if you get like a bunch of

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:36.400
options of like i wonder why this guy

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.240
poked me well you know that's that's

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.160
that's it that's a higher level yeah or

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.759
that's that's a higher quality of

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.120
consciousness

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.560
so the guy was explaining that and how

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.840
like that's what it is to like kind of

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.680
ascend the levels of consciousness but

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.520
as a human you do cap out just because

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.360
you're a human and that's all it is but

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.960
what he was saying is like

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.639
there's the there's obviously the animal

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:56.960
level of consciousness human level and

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.039
there's the astral plane and the higher

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:01.680
levels tap down into the lower levels

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.160
yeah so we cannot help but interact with

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.319
we go to sleep and our psyche is still

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:08.720
just flowing and that's when we we get

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.720
tapped into by the astral level so we

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.479
have to they tap down on us but they

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:13.919
can't go all the way up obviously to the

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:16.960
creator yeah that's like you know to one

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.039
they can't go up to one well not one but

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:20.960
not two yeah they can't go all the way

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.880
up to one but it's pretty cool to think

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.400
cause we we metal around different

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.639
things and we have different [ __ ]

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:29.039
you know non-material beings

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:30.400
when you're creating and you're in a

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.560
flow state and you're getting these

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.880
different levels to resonate that's art

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.360
yeah for sure like if you if you don't

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.360
if you try to make stuff and it's just

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.160
here

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.160
it's nothing people look at it and go

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.560
huh yeah but like if you make something

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.199
good it's operating on other levels

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:48.400
yeah we get goosebumps that's what i

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.840
like about the kubrick movies are pretty

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.400
deep like the shining is on many levels

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.919
i gotta see there's so many [ __ ]

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:55.680
levels in that that it's like you can

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.840
watch that and get lost and i don't i

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.680
don't fault all these guys for

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.440
going balls deep in it because it's like

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.039
oh yeah i get it dude there's a lot

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:04.960
there like you can find all this meaning

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.520
in it really oh yeah dude it's not isn't

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.440
that the book or isn't that the movie

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.800
with the red book in it or is that

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.440
something else um leave her nervous

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.080
there's that he's a he's like a known um

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.240
freudian he's a freudian yeah yes he

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.840

movie that had it in it i forget what it

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.160
was i don't know but if you watch these

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.919
things it's like it's opera like there's

00:08:27.919 --> 00:08:30.240
many stories being told at once

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.080
it'll [ __ ] you up once you start to like

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.839
once you get like clued into this stuff

00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:35.919
and then you watch all of his movies a

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.839
lot of them are like this i gotta peep

00:08:37.839 --> 00:08:39.519

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.200
swag

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.959
it goes

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:48.639
maintaining eye contact with a chick if

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:50.560
you're at a bar you make i eye contact

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.839
with a chick for like 10 seconds you're

00:13:51.839 --> 00:13:54.720
hard definitely as you should be yeah i

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.320
mean i mean as you should be and i was

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.440
talking to my buddies and they were like

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.519
dude i can't jerk off at that point like

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:00.880
there's no way i would be able to jerk

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.240
off yeah that's a problem that's why i

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.600
told you you got to fix something about

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.279
yourself brother because if you can hit

00:14:05.279 --> 00:14:08.240
the great reset if you can that is like

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.760
i'm completely forgetting about the

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.440
whole like because last time when we did

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.480
it when we were all working together

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.160
remember that

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.720
that was like porn [ __ ] porn porn rewire

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.320
and there were so many mental aspects of

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.320
it that were just [ __ ] with my head

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.680
i don't know what the [ __ ] this is doing

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.040
to me because there's none of that it's

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.480
just like i'm just not coming for nine

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.639
days everything else i don't care about

00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:28.079
anything that leads to coming i'm just

00:14:28.079 --> 00:14:30.079
not doing yeah so i don't know what kind

00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:32.320
of rewiring this is happening like

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.760
i don't i don't know what the [ __ ]

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.880
gonna happen it's good it's definitely

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.880
not doing anything bad to you

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.720
yeah i think so people are trying to say

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.920
you're gonna get prostate cancer but

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.000
it's like dude [ __ ] off i doubt that

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.519
there's no way people are jerking it

00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:45.680
every [ __ ] day

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.000
yeah i doubt they were but although yeah

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.440
i mean that's that must've been such a

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.959
horny time though

00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:52.480
you probably could get it whenever you

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.399
want they were probably dripping dude

00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:58.680
that's probably probably dripping yeah

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.880
i'm [ __ ]

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.880
tarnished forever yeah you can still

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.079
dribble if you remember when i did like

00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:13.839
a eight day nofap i'd take a dump and

00:15:13.839 --> 00:15:16.240

covet we cannot talk about past wolves

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.040
you're saying path towards yeah we know

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.079
what you're about they become

00:16:58.079 --> 00:17:00.079
controversial you see the rage in that

00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:01.759
boy's eyes when he gets angry sometimes

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:03.519
that this man knows too much you got to

00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:05.120
see that assad clip

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.360
why he just breaks all that down yeah

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.760
dude that would be i mean imagine

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.319
how fun that would be you're a cia guy

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:14.240
and you get tasked with like red pilling

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.640
that dude it'd be the funnest [ __ ]

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.959
thing to watch him be like

00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:21.520
making a lot of good points

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.120
that's strange isn't it

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.079
dude

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:25.919
i just there's definitely something

00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:27.600
about micah where that dude has some

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.039
people telling him what he can and

00:17:29.039 --> 00:17:31.600
cannot say oh for sure he definitely

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.320
[ __ ] pops off dude it must be so

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.919
funny if he just pops off that hard and

00:17:35.919 --> 00:17:37.039
then they got like do we gotta scrub

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:38.960

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.120
yeah is he still doing his podcast i

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.200
fell off the first two episodes were

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.559
some of the funniest [ __ ] ever now that

00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:45.919
yeah i fell off because he had some

00:17:45.919 --> 00:17:47.280
climbers on there that were just there

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.559
for the cloud they weren't there to talk

00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:50.000
about michael whatsoever dude did you

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.520
see the one where he hands like the

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.840
bisexual girl rainbow flag

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.080
and he was like that's for you

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:00.400
he goes i like girls but

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.080
abundantly clear yeah i don't make that

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.160
abundantly clear what was that [ __ ] you

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.919
were saying about kamala harris

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:08.160
oh dude she uh

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.160
i just saw how she'd never been present

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.559
for our country no i glanced the news

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:14.960
i glanced the news and she uh

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.720
she apparently took a picture for i

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.720
think vogue maggie it was something

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.559
something like fashion magazine and she

00:18:20.559 --> 00:18:21.679
like was like

00:18:21.679 --> 00:18:23.120
it's actually really sad if you think

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.679
about it she like wore chucks and like

00:18:25.679 --> 00:18:27.360
some jeans and like she dressed down and

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.120
be like i'm a cool i'm cool and

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.559
approachable

00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:32.320
and then like there was a backlash

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.360
weirdly

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.840
of people being like that's not what the

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.600
first female african-american vice

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:38.880
president should look like that doesn't

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.960
look serious at all and then her team

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.720
was like put her in the hillary suit and

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.960
then they took another photo

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.440
that's wild it was just [ __ ] weird

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.559
the fact that like she got like she has

00:18:50.559 --> 00:18:52.640
she's so uh

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.799
at this point externally

00:18:54.799 --> 00:18:56.640
driven by like there's no

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.039
personal [ __ ] white chicks from laura

00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:00.640
marion yeah but there's no there's no

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.160
personality to be like yeah i wore

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.160
chunks i mean dude there's nothing there

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.160
like you're so driven by

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.760
this way the whole time yeah yeah that's

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.240
so scary dude you're a doll this is just

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.240
what it is you're irritable she was

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.160
sucking dick her whole entire career

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.559
really oh yeah she was a [ __ ] what how

00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:18.240
did you find that out bro like known

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.240
this known like really she would blow

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.200
and do like she's a [ __ ] rat and she

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.280
[ __ ] people up with [ __ ] prison

centers i know i know she was a m she

00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:29.919
definitely hates black people you think

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:32.160
100 is probably like very pessimistic at

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.840
the same time when when you resist this

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.360
is probably when it was like you were

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.039
people were getting big high fives and

00:19:37.039 --> 00:19:39.840

prison thing popped off and it was like

00:19:53.679 --> 00:19:56.000
yeah if you don't think about it like

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.520
it's not it wasn't a market they had to

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.120
create it yeah that whole tough one we

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.480

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.760

stock the port authority lost millions

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.320
of dollars in stocks like i think like

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.240

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.520
their money and they were betting down

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.039
and the one dude i knew who did stuff

00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:20.159
with them was like yeah happened with

00:25:20.159 --> 00:25:22.559

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.440
the outages in la

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.400
putting like just getting stalking and

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.240
running enron stocks going way the [ __ ]

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.159
up and then they're just like yeah we

00:25:32.159 --> 00:25:34.000

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.400
and like wiped everyone's 401k and all

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.080

00:25:42.559 --> 00:25:45.360
out and then every every normal person

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.640
is [ __ ]

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.840
and then you forget about it because

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.279
they give you a [ __ ] war they give

00:25:49.279 --> 00:25:50.640
you all this [ __ ] that you don't [ __ ]

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.159
remember about yeah and then all this

00:25:52.159 --> 00:25:53.600
[ __ ] that's going on with gas it's all

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.320
[ __ ] fake like all these gas prices

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.240
are complete [ __ ] yeah how is that

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.159
how do they do that like the second that

00:26:00.159 --> 00:26:02.080
they control the computer that makes the

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.760
numbers yeah the second that they can

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.679
announce

00:26:05.679 --> 00:26:08.000
let's go oh gas is this much now it's

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.840
almost like the gas was already here

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:10.559
well

00:26:10.559 --> 00:26:12.159
yeah that's what doesn't make sense like

00:26:12.159 --> 00:26:13.919
they get like the gas prices just

00:26:13.919 --> 00:26:16.400
skyrocketed yeah but the gas that we're

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.480
using we already had we're not waiting

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.080
for it to come in from russia is it

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.559
based are they basing on the future like

00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:24.080
like this is what it's about to cost

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.120
they're like

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.640
that's weird that's what they're trying

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.679
to say

00:26:27.679 --> 00:26:28.720
it's just like they're like oh we have

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.480
to sound like no you don't [ __ ] like

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.480
you had barrels here

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.080
yeah this should affect us in a few

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.320
months like putin just invaded whatever

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.600
i mean dude that's also when you want to

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.640
go to war when you want to get the

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.640
citizenry and engage in a war you feel

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.240
like it's you can just raise the gas

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.760
like two dollars a gallon everyone's

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.559
like yeah it's time it's time we [ __ ]

00:26:46.559 --> 00:26:48.720

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.720
with [ __ ] micro viruses that no one

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.799
can see they can't have a clear enemy

00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:04.080
anymore because everyone's hyper

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.080

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.520
invisible that everyone can get behind

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.039

think he would you knew he would have

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.159
but yeah i don't know there's a crazy

00:27:58.159 --> 00:27:59.919
thing that i watch where during the

00:27:59.919 --> 00:28:02.960
olympics gee and uh putin

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.399
this is all coming from ray mcgovern

00:28:04.399 --> 00:28:07.039
he's a former cia guy and g and putin

00:28:07.039 --> 00:28:09.279
had a meeting and they [ __ ] talked

00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:11.520
and it was very rare for china to come

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.960
out with any kind of bizarre statement

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.440
like this but the china says our

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.200
relationship with russia knows no

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.360
boundaries which is a weird thing to say

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.960
right where you're like weird that's

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.200
kind of crazy and then right after that

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.520
russia invaded china or russia invaded

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.200

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.600
into a world where there's like another

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.120
superpower there's other powers so it's

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.279

gonna [ __ ] your [ __ ] up

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.279
and then they killed him

00:33:01.279 --> 00:33:02.559
they were like yeah guess what we're

00:33:02.559 --> 00:33:04.720
gonna [ __ ] kill you yeah man and

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.559
there was multiple attempts like the

00:33:06.559 --> 00:33:08.880
craziest thing with jfk is like that he

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.720
made friends with khrushchev and

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.559
khrushchev had better

00:33:12.559 --> 00:33:14.640
they were keeping so much from kennedy

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.440
that the kgb had more intel

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.600
on what americans on what was happening

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.159
on american soil yeah so kennedy was

00:33:22.159 --> 00:33:23.600
finding [ __ ] out like about

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.679
assassination attempts on him and castro

00:33:25.679 --> 00:33:27.519
through khrushchev

00:33:27.519 --> 00:33:29.440
jesus yeah it's [ __ ] nuts these guys

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.960
have been doing this [ __ ]

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.760
forever but like the last time i wanted

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.600
i think the last time we had a chance at

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.760
like living in a regular world was when

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.919
jfk was around yeah that's why i'm way

00:33:39.919 --> 00:33:41.360
into jfk because all this [ __ ] never

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.640
would have happened if he didn't get

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.720
whacked yeah yeah that's what sucks

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.320
putin's on like a video talking about

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.399
that he goes dude like i've met all the

00:33:48.399 --> 00:33:50.080
presidents because none of it matters

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.600
he's like at the end of the day it's

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.200
like a bunch of guys in suits with like

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.120
navy blue or black ties and they tell

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.720
you what's going on like the presents

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.640
that it happened with obama dude the

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.279
last three presidents ran on

00:34:01.279 --> 00:34:04.320
not doing this stuff and they all won

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.799
yeah and but in every one of them though

00:34:06.799 --> 00:34:09.119
every one of every every one of them

00:34:09.119 --> 00:34:10.639
yeah as soon as they get in there like

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:12.720
oh no guess what we got going on

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.800
yeah and the cia is like it literally

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.720
does have to get splintered into a

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.560
thousand pieces yeah well the problem is

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.760
like i don't understand why people can't

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.399
like

00:34:20.399 --> 00:34:21.679
wrap their head around the fact that

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.679
it's like you know polite society middle

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:25.679
class upper middle class extremely

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:28.159
wealthy and then there's just like at

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:29.839
the top level it's just dudes with

00:34:29.839 --> 00:34:31.200
weapons being like we got to kill

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:32.800
there's no rules exactly there's no

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.560
rules for those guys those guys live in

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.320
anarchy yeah and it's also like so you

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.480
you you're the owner of bethlehem steel

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.800
jfk is like hey bud do me a solid for

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.480
the employees down a little bit yep that

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.399
guy's not gonna like it i would imagine

00:34:44.399 --> 00:34:46.399
i i'm speculating but i'm imagining he

00:34:46.399 --> 00:34:47.599
wasn't advocating for that guy's

00:34:47.599 --> 00:34:49.040
industry they had to make [ __ ]

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.440
monopolies because these guys are making

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.800
so much [ __ ] money that's the thing

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.639
it's like the guy probably would still

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:55.919
everything would still be fine everyone

00:34:55.919 --> 00:34:57.040
still have their money the guy would

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.280
maybe would make less money but there's

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.560
not even about the money at that point

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.560
it's like [ __ ] this guy you can't tell

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.520
me like

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.599
like jfk was like throwing the cia bones

00:35:05.599 --> 00:35:07.520
like yeah go do that go do that yeah

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.280
little [ __ ] yeah but like did not want

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.720
to do any of the big stuff they wanted

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.520
nuclear were they had dude operation

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.560
northwoods is not just two planes

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.760
like they were gonna do you know

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.599
operation northwoods all right so they

00:35:19.599 --> 00:35:21.359
were gonna

00:35:21.359 --> 00:35:22.480
stage

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.480
two planes getting blown up by the

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.880
cubans that had american passengers on

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.640
it yikes they said they could do it with

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.320
real people or they could do it with

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.480
drones this was in the 60s they had

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.760
drones

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.960

list of [ __ ] they were going to do

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.240
propaganda to sway people against the

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.040
cubans like the dude came with like a

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.960
whole game plan to start world war iii

dude we're the best you've met so much

00:36:36.079 --> 00:36:37.920
people who are like off-putting they're

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.920

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.320
bullet theory

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.400
and i'm going through the original jfk

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.480
footage where everyone said there was

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.440
multiple

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.599
shooters multiple shots all this [ __ ]

00:36:55.599 --> 00:36:57.119
and like they wrapped it all up real

00:36:57.119 --> 00:36:58.640
quick and they're like no this is what

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.320
happened and the film footage didn't

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.720
come out for a decade really yep

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.480
jesus christ

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.400

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.560
that was really funky yeah nobody

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.480

yeah and he heard a bit they heard about

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.920

with these [ __ ] yeah well it's

00:45:57.839 --> 00:45:59.760
dude i i was wrong this [ __ ] goes way

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:00.400
back

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.480
this [ __ ] goes to the vatican this [ __ ]

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.920
goes to the [ __ ]

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.760
it's all this time dude it's the tale of

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.560
power yeah tell power and corruption but

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.240
the problem with like so you but then

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.440
you take it down to the level of like

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.960
the everyday dude just kicking around

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:16.079
being like a little me blah blah blah

00:46:16.079 --> 00:46:18.000
if there's nothing in like the i'm

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.280
reading i'm rereading the book all

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.960
things shining again and they talk about

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:22.160
how

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.440
like there's people asking themselves

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.359
the ishmael book yeah people ask

00:46:25.359 --> 00:46:26.960
themselves questions all the time like

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.280
should i do this is this thing real is

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.960
this not real is this you know is there

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.200
is this war what it said it's not but

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.880
the ultimate question is

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:38.720
what am i basing my answer on or like

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.560
you know like why am i going with this

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:41.680
over that

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.280
and you have to go well i just saw it on

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.800
the news and i'm choosing to believe

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.480
that but there's people who don't take

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.000
it to that second step if that makes

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.640
sense yeah like what it to be honest i'm

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.240
being honest with myself

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.880
what am i really basing my decision to

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.040
believe this thing on and it's just like

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.800
i don't know

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.240
there's just so much there's just

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.920
they've done so much [ __ ] before where

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.520
you're like this again that's fair

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.680
enough yeah that makes sense that makes

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.520
perfect sense that's like the general

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.359
frequency of the truth but if i ask

00:47:09.359 --> 00:47:10.880
someone who's so there's a frequency to

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.000
the truth that holds but if i ask

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.240
someone even even even to make the basic

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:16.480
assumption of like

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:19.280
the government could be lying about this

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:21.119
in some even if it's some detail they

00:47:21.119 --> 00:47:22.800
could totally be covering something up

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.720
yeah and for someone to be like

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.800
[ __ ] you don't talk like that if i'm

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.079
like it's [ __ ] nuts what are you

00:47:28.079 --> 00:47:29.760
basing that off of that reaction what's

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.760
that based off of they'll just be like

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:33.119
[ __ ] you dude what are you a conspiracy

00:47:33.119 --> 00:47:35.839
and it's like no no no no go down here

00:47:35.839 --> 00:47:37.599
go down to the basement of your little

00:47:37.599 --> 00:47:38.720
you know of your character and your

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.880
thoughts what are you basing that off of

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.560
off of your personal experience and

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:44.400
feelings and if they say here's what it

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.560
is i'll i'm all ears but i never get

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.560
that like here's my sense of the thing

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:51.680
based on my real world [ __ ] you know

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:53.839
yeah i mean if if if

00:47:53.839 --> 00:47:56.640
it must be a wild ass ride if this whole

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.240
time you've just been like the news said

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.240
this and this is what's happening it's

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.920
almost like i mean my dad my dad lives

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.599
like this yeah but

00:48:03.599 --> 00:48:05.839
most people do most people do i'm saying

00:48:05.839 --> 00:48:07.119
to like actually

00:48:07.119 --> 00:48:08.640
coming up in the world and like you

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.400
don't you're not completely set like

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.760
when i see boomers doing this [ __ ]

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.760
completely understandable dude just

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.920
[ __ ] take the blue chews every now

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.359
once in a blue moon when you want to

00:48:17.359 --> 00:48:19.440
[ __ ] bang your wife do all your

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.040
normal [ __ ] yeah you can talk about

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:22.640
putin and all this it doesn't [ __ ]

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.240
matter dude i think the problem is you

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:26.000
can't strip too many conventions from

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
people too quickly so like you can't

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.680
like do to think about people in the 40s

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.680
versus people in the 60s yeah there was

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:34.240
just like years of tradition just ripped

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.400
off and the news is like was like

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:39.119
people's last go-to of like this is my

00:48:39.119 --> 00:48:40.960
[ __ ] this is my beacon into the absolute

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:43.520
reality and that got trump trump if

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.480
people say whatever they want about

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:48.640
trump he fully [ __ ] [ __ ] ended him

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.359
i obviously was like questioning the

00:48:51.359 --> 00:48:52.400
mainstream media because i was like the

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:53.920
[ __ ] looks [ __ ] not bragging i'm not

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:55.280
bragging but i was like sometime i was

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.559
like 20 i'm like

00:48:56.559 --> 00:48:58.319
kind of fake i got high in watching news

00:48:58.319 --> 00:48:59.599
one time i was like this seems like my

00:48:59.599 --> 00:49:00.880
homeroom show from high school and i

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.240

i smoked weed i would watch a movie and

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.839

00:49:07.839 --> 00:49:09.520
yeah every time it happened to me with

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.200

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.079
[ __ ] dude

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.160
he's the guy that he's the guy that

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:41.040
releases a pruder film that's the film

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.280
of kennedy being shot did he really

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.599
yeah they had him and a comedian come on

00:49:45.599 --> 00:49:47.040
and they went on it and they were like

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:49.040
yeah this is what happened and it and

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:51.119
then he came out toronto came out

00:49:51.119 --> 00:49:52.720
he pushed the single shooter narrative

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.800
well he had the video he was the one

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.640
that first shared the video to like to

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.480
the rest of the world whoa he's he goes

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:00.800
back that long oh yeah dude he's old i

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.640
must be mad i think i mix him up i think

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:04.000
i mix him up with other people oh you

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:04.720
know

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:06.480

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.800
ripped it's it's just not that long ago

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:12.000
like yeah it was forever from the day he

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.520
got shot until the film actually or the

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:14.559
footage

00:50:14.559 --> 00:50:17.280
it was like 74 i think when they did it

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.280
yeah he was a young buck

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.920
that makes sense but yeah dude the

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.599
that was like that like [ __ ] people up

00:50:23.599 --> 00:50:24.960
psychologically when trump was like yeah

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:26.319
you know the news lies all the time

00:50:26.319 --> 00:50:29.280
people are like uh wait what

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.119
that popped one chord out of the [ __ ]

00:50:31.119 --> 00:50:32.960
matrix for all these [ __ ]

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.160
but there's all there's so many others

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.920
that have been pulled out like 50 years

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:38.240
prior then dad hates me now where i'm

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.720
like how the [ __ ] did you think of that

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.160
what you'll hit me with like something's

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:43.760
[ __ ] like me when we were down in

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:46.800
florida like uh like it was maybe the

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.559
kenosha [ __ ] happened where that dude

00:50:48.559 --> 00:50:50.800
ran through the crowd and dad hit us

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:51.920
with something where he's like dude you

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.520
would never think like that like where

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.520
the [ __ ] how all of a sudden are you

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.200
thinking like this like they all stopped

00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:59.119
trusting the news and was like [ __ ] this

00:50:59.119 --> 00:51:01.520
oh yeah he's been on that for a while

00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.119
yeah he just goes along he just kind of

00:51:03.119 --> 00:51:04.640
goes along with the part he was involved

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:06.319
there i mean he didn't see these two

00:51:06.319 --> 00:51:09.839
beasts by himself you know

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:12.640
he knows of deep grease dude yeah good

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.800
point that's my that was my thing when i

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:17.440
started when i was doing government work

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:19.920
and i saw the grease dude that was my

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.400
like eye opener i was like oh [ __ ] if

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:24.960
this goes on in townships this goes on

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:27.359
like this gets bigger and this gets way

00:51:27.359 --> 00:51:28.480
bigger

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:29.839
it's not just government dude they they

00:51:29.839 --> 00:51:31.680
have their finger in private industries

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:33.359
as well i mean private industries

00:51:33.359 --> 00:51:35.119
control the government yeah true but i'm

00:51:35.119 --> 00:51:37.280
saying like they can regulate what i'm

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:38.800
talking about is aramark and local

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.480
governments dude so you have a local

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:42.240
business if you have a local business

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.920
say you're doing something the local

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.119
government can just [ __ ] with you

00:51:45.119 --> 00:51:46.960
non-stop they can just come out and

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.400
fight like hey you gotta pay us for this

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.160
you gotta pay for that they can extort

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:52.079
you in any way shape or form chester is

00:51:52.079 --> 00:51:54.400
doing a rain water management technique

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.800
yeah you would be [ __ ] shocked so and

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.520
how much power aramark has over the

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:01.680
country oh i do not know they feed the

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:03.440
children in the schools totally believe

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:05.440
it it's [ __ ] insane totally believe

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.800
it but there's a whole other level of

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:07.520
like

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.200
small medium-sized businesses and the

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:11.920
city can go around and just go like

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.079
uh you got to put on a 15 000 awning

00:52:14.079 --> 00:52:15.520
it's the ordinance thing and what

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:17.520
they'll do is they'll send like kind of

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:20.240
like a weird mobstery type dude around

00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:22.000
and be like yo the city's breaking your

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.440
balls

01:06:39.359 --> 01:06:40.559
play they blame everything on the

01:06:40.559 --> 01:06:42.000
russians yeah here's what to think about

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.200
i mean they they've been blaming

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.799
everything on the russians since [ __ ]

01:06:44.799 --> 01:06:47.200
biden's laptop was russian propaganda i

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:48.559

01:06:48.559 --> 01:06:50.400
how they think russiagate was a bizarre

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.480
thing to cover up hillary's emails

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:54.480

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:55.680
and people were forgetting about it

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:56.640

oh yeah you know what i mean yeah well i

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.240
