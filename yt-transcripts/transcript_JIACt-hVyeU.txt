00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.799
five four three two one When You Wish

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.240
Upon a Star

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.700
I don't know if that song was written

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.580
for Disney or or was a song that was

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.400
pre-existing and then Disney Walt Disney

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.680
was like I like that song but whatever

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.680
whoever wrote that song is a magical

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.920
songwriter what a magical song that is I

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.200
think of [ __ ] what's that light bulb

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.700
that flies around

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.000
the light bulb shining star oh yeah

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.079
they're thinking um the thing with the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.659
Firefly no but what's this tinker

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.380
Tinkerbell yeah yeah light bulb I don't

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.420
know what what is it she's a firefly

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.360
right yeah I don't know it reminds me of

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.640
the flyer the light bulb I'm gonna say

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.619
light bulb yeah because it reminds me of

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.380
a life yeah yeah because back in those

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.600
days I don't know what year that was but

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.899
I'm sure that was used for illumination

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.899
those little creatures fairies yeah yeah

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.460
like you know you you they have about

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.340
five I don't know people have bonfires

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.680
like and like little uh torches and

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.420
stuff but you know if you want a little

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.819
bit more illumination right you have a

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.959
campfire you just get one of those

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.360
little Tinkers right yeah is that a is

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.459
Tinkerbell the name or is that the what

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.200
they're called Tinkerbell is the her

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.640
name it's the name it's her specific

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.319
name then what are they Fair their

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.660
species is fairy my bad Ferris says

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.480
she's not a um let's look it up she's

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.220
not we have a guess I have to bring the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.180
guest up I just want to say something

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.220
about fireflies they like illuminate to

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.660
like attract the mate and then they kill

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.519
the maid so I don't know why you would

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:33.840
even throw that out there because I'm

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.480
Illuminating it oh she's gonna kill me

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.760
maybe don't they thought that freaks me

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.580
out anyway let's don't Google that um

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.319
okay you don't have to Google that um

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.319
it's a fairy she's a fair and it's her

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.180
and her name is Tinkerbell yeah and

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.800
she's not a light bulb

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.260
okay that's that I learn everything new

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.780
every day now listen um the reason why I

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.099
sing that song is because I think it's a

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.599
magical song and I have a magical guest

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.099
but if you have something on your nose

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.200
can I take it out what is it it's not a

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.700
booger it's like a healing piece of skin

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.480
what the [ __ ]

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.400
make a wish

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.090
foreign

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:18.900
[Laughter]

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.420
yeah this this move this podcast is like

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.659
let it Let There Be Blood oh yeah There

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:31.739
Will Be Blood oh is that what they're

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.060
called it's There Will Be Blood I don't

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.040
know anything right now huh no I'm

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.659
learning everything it's not let there

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.060
be blood it's There Will Be Blood what's

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.440
the difference that's almost the same

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.140
it's thank you light bulb Ferry I think

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.299
you're good

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.220
will you just introduce I will hold on I

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.620
will I will so uh

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.840
so um I don't know when it was a year

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.819
ago or two years whatever right

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.200
um

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.439
there was some sort of uproar right some

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.860
Rumblings and um I'm like what the [ __ ]

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.360
is the Rumblings about you know I mean

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.980
so you Google things you know because I

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.319
have the internet and then you know I

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.220
saw a video of the rumbling which is

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.459
some kid got cast on

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.720
SNL you know which uh by the way

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.079
you know how I feel about that show yeah

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.660
I [ __ ] hate it I'll just say it now I

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.639
hate it the reason why is because I was

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.919
on Mad TV for so long and we were always

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.139
compared to them and it's like in in the

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.160
industry if they got off that show right

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.240
the industry just you know what I mean

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.500
just sucked all their dicks and

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.300
intermitted gave them everything and

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.340
then we had to wait back in line so I

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.080
have this like weird you know I mean

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.840
anyway he said something on a podcast

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.100
and I was trying to figure out what was

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.300
the wrong thing was I couldn't even

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.880
figure out I had to call people I had to

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.040
go I had to call no I called people like

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.699
what was it though and they're like I

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.919
don't know I'm like either there's the

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.020
hanging Ducks yeah was it the hanging

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.960
out I don't even know but um

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.220
anyway

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.680
um he's but then I started Googling

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.600
inside do you think our gauge is off

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.699
because we say some really horrible

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:15.180
things yeah like is

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.660
no sweet no

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.440
nope no way I'll tell you why

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.520
because I live in this country and I

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.039
before I'm anything I'm an American

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.139
it doesn't look feel like it'll look

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.360
like it but that's what I am I was born

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.600
in San Diego Sharps Hospital

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.699
1971. let's go I believe red white and

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:42.419
blue that's the color yep she's almost

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.699
forgot right I almost forgot anyway

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:46.139
let's give him a round of applause he's

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.800
a great stand-up Shane Gillis everybody

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.720
he's saying before we start I wanna um I

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.039
have a couple of questions sure

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:59.639
because I don't want to forget them so

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:00.900
the first question is a two-part

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.319
question right and the second um yeah

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:05.520
and the second thing I want to ask you

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.180
is a request if you don't mind sure okay

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.680
um so just let me finish the questions

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.419
before you answer the two right

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.900
why do we have a Chinatown and why do

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.860
they live in one place

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.600
um

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.740
I would say

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.479
if I had to put my finger

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.300
thought about it soon

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.639
been out of my mind and I think I was

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.319
right the first I think you were yeah

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.819
yeah I think I was correct yeah you were

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:47.699
the second thing is just a request say

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:51.660
the word noodle in an Asian accent

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.419
uh neutered

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:57.139

it's an ugly City for sure yeah yeah no

00:08:17.099 --> 00:08:18.479
it's a great time because I went to a

00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:19.800
steakhouse

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.900
where I had to pause

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.520
it's like something Rose or something

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.800
where I had to buzz a door and the

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.720
little thing like back in remember Lord

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.120
we always do Lord of the Rings

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.500
references but remember in Lord of the

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.479
Rings when the hobbits go to that first

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:35.640
town and then they had to yeah I'd open

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.440
a little thing and then there's a bottom

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.000
one for Hobbits

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.399
so they did that little joke yeah was

00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:43.320
there a bottom one for you you think

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.760
there's one a third door that's even

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.220
smaller

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.820
if I was in Lord of the Rings yeah

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.040
no there was just one babe I'm not a

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.420
dwarf

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.800
can you say that

00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:01.380
well you have dwarf-like proportions

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.019
how tall are you I'm five three

00:09:07.019 --> 00:09:11.940
question five that's not bad I know it's

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.500
not great though it certainly is not

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.440
crazy how tall are you I'm six three oh

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.019
yeah that's pretty good that's all right

00:09:19.019 --> 00:09:20.760
what do you mean I think look wise we're

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.160
not dead like I think my Height's not

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.440
doing me that

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.660
I'm fine yeah yeah you think you and I

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.480
aren't the like the best specimens of

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.940
our no ethnicity I think me being six

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.940
three makes no difference as far as yeah

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.519
yeah like like if I feel like if an

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:41.279
alien race came down right let me see

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:43.980
all the you know your Prime specimens of

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.620
every ethnicity right sure they would

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.620
put on they would probably put through

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.140
here's Steven Yeon and then here for you

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.260

they're not like working out or moving

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.779

themselves or maybe in there wherever

00:10:17.579 --> 00:10:20.040

Asia right what what would I have been

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.959
like 300 years ago

00:12:15.959 --> 00:12:18.060
I don't know I feel like you guys have

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.660
like two jobs you're either

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.860
in the fields or a samurai

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.040
is more of a field agent

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.660
what

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.220
I know well you're saying that I would

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.860
be out there with the hat yes right

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.420
something would come up in the village

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.519
you'd be like oh [ __ ] we gotta get out

00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:41.339
of here you'd Scurry among the yeah

00:12:41.339 --> 00:12:43.920
right no well can I just can I give

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.519
myself something sure maybe but uh what

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:50.760
if I also right what have I also was

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.240
working on the fields but I also like

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.920
you know I don't know how they work it

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.620
but like um like in the barn I did they

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.839
have barns back then in Asia I think so

00:13:00.839 --> 00:13:03.420
yeah I would hide like

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.240
guns and machine guns for the Army or

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.440
the Rebellion oh we're doing like

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.600
Vietnamese maybe no yeah maybe

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.399
Vietnamese yeah I think I would be like

00:13:11.399 --> 00:13:13.860
doing something on the side I think you

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.120
would do something like that to get your

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.899
whole village napalmed

00:13:17.899 --> 00:13:21.139
I think you'd think you were slick

00:13:21.139 --> 00:13:24.540
and have a weapons cash yeah yeah you

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.579
know I think that you know while we're

00:13:26.579 --> 00:13:29.360
talking about Vietnam right sure

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.220
that's exactly what Shane dealer wanted

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.200
to talk about when he promotes a special

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.860
yeah Vietnam let's talk more atrocities

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.639
no no I think bro because I love Vietnam

00:13:41.639 --> 00:13:43.079
war movies

00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:46.980
I think that you and I right

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.600
let's suppose like two sides are

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.040
fighting each other right I'm obviously

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.019
the Via Kong right and you're an

00:13:52.019 --> 00:13:54.060
American Soldier you and I get lost

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.519
right and then it becomes like that

00:13:56.519 --> 00:13:58.920
movie Enemy mind where you and I are

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.560
lost in the cave right and maybe that's

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.220
a good movie where you and I Bond yeah

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.620

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.279
to come up with some sort of nickname

00:14:38.279 --> 00:14:41.480
for me what would you call me

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:52.510

I'll be honest yeah not great was it

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.339
devastating though uh I think it was

00:16:44.339 --> 00:16:47.040
just more surreal than like it took me a

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.300
while to be like damn that was

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.100
devastating because it was but like

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.360
while it was happening I was like this

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.399

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:21.660
producers and stuff and you got it yep

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.400
and then how long did you have it before

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.919
they took it away not long

00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:28.319
I mean I auditioned like two weeks

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:29.700
before they told me I was gonna be on

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.799
the show and then they told me I was

00:17:31.799 --> 00:17:33.780
going to be on the show the next day

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.720
they announced it that day is I mean

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.120
five hours in is when I started getting

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.320
like

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.600
oh this isn't going to happen you know

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.400
oh it was pretty quick

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.640
I mean honestly dude it's like

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.200
I don't want to be completely sincere

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.539
with it because I'm not emotional but um

00:17:51.539 --> 00:17:55.980
it hurts me yeah it hurts me it's like

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.600
um

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.179
because I even when I got mad back in

00:18:00.179 --> 00:18:02.400
the day I know how exciting that is yeah

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.080
it was cool yeah and I know how like

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.660
magic like you just it's everything's

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.640
other worldly almost and you're like

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.380
floating on air

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.980
and then I can't imagine somebody just

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.020
you know you're floating on a cloud and

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.299
some guy going

00:18:17.299 --> 00:18:19.679
right and then you uh and you followed

00:18:19.679 --> 00:18:21.840
like I can't imagine that so I'm sorry

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.640
than that no I appreciate it yeah yeah

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.559
there was like a few days where I was

00:18:25.559 --> 00:18:28.799
like New York's incredible I was like I

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:30.240
was like walking around the city I was

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.600
like wow my city

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.520
and then like five hours later I was

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.039
like I hate this place wow yeah did you

00:18:38.039 --> 00:18:39.960
move back after it no I said you stayed

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.919
yeah

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:43.080
and then how long did it take you to

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.020
kind of like um start feeling normal

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.000
again

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.400
uh probably

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.960
like this year it probably took a year

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.480
my god without noticing you know right I

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.980
couldn't tell you know how it is yeah

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.299
like when you're like depressed or

00:18:57.299 --> 00:18:59.220
whatever you don't really know you're

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.580
depressed yeah until you're not and

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.020
they're like oh [ __ ] I was [ __ ]

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.780
whacked out so true yeah so true so

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.240
[ __ ] true it's sort of like surviving

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.000
day today and you're sort of in a slump

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.520
but it's not until you feel like the

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.220
DraStic opposite of that that you're

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.400
like oh my God I was a zombie yeah yeah

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.580
yeah my God I can't imagine that it

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.679
makes you nicer though it does when you

00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:27.240
get [ __ ] canceled like that yeah

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.880
you're like very nice to everybody

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.820
everybody was like hey it's really I'm

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.039
so excited to meet you yeah yeah if I

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:36.360
would have got us and out I'm like shut

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.919
the [ __ ] I know don't [ __ ] wait

00:19:37.919 --> 00:19:40.260
George do you remember how we reacted to

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.880
it at that time

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.640
did we pile on or did we offer Grace

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.039
because I want to be genuine about it I

00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:48.240
don't want to be like Shane we're fine

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.919
with it but like maybe we did we say

00:19:49.919 --> 00:19:51.419
some [ __ ] we were well I know they

00:19:51.419 --> 00:19:53.039
remember what it was I know they I know

00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:54.720
that he looked up something that I said

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.720
on H3 yeah and what did I say you're

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.520
basically were just saying what you had

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.140
just said now about it's a comic you

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.159
didn't know what you found offensive

00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:03.539
about you could understand why people

00:20:03.539 --> 00:20:05.580
would be upset but you were saying yeah

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.400
it's a podcast you perform on podcasts

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.340
yeah I just you know I just find it to

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.340
be sacred you know yeah comedy be sacred

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:17.460
I just feel like you mean once we start

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:18.200
um

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.559
canceling jokes and bits it's the end of

00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:24.960
our civilization as we know it you know

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.419
and I just you know and also what he

00:20:27.419 --> 00:20:30.179
said was I mean Tony hinchclaff

00:20:30.179 --> 00:20:32.640
literally said you know I mean

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.640
one more time for the Ching

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.740
in a mic throughout a room yeah I saw

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.880
that I was like oh [ __ ] dude

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.740
it was like

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.900
yeah I knew that was just gonna bring

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.659
more pressure to me

00:20:47.659 --> 00:20:49.740
yeah when his thing happened again

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.200
everyone was like it took Shane Gillis

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.720
and Tony inch

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.600
right right yeah but I yeah and you

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.340
could level up though huh Tony got a

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.400
little wild that was real wild yeah he

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.100
was having fun yeah but again that's

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.539
another thing I've said this before it's

00:21:06.539 --> 00:21:09.480
like um you know I've seen I've said

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.539
things like if at the store if a gay

00:21:12.539 --> 00:21:14.400
comic brought me up the kind of things

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.039
that have come out of my mouth like one

00:21:17.039 --> 00:21:18.600
more time for the whatever whatever I

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.100
I'll do it in the room but not here yeah

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.080
and they give it right back to you and

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.820
they give it right back it's like you

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.980
know if I say something derogatory

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.960
toward you know I mean a black guy or

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.700
whatever then he'll yell back and say

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.159
something even worse about me but it's

00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:35.220
all in love and fun yeah and the

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.799
audience is laughing and

00:21:37.799 --> 00:21:40.620
um yeah I mean I just um maybe it's

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.500
because I'm also 50 now almost 50 now

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.780
you know I'm in and I've I've seen it

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.580
all I know what's important what I feel

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.980
like and what's not important and yeah

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.020
it's not yeah so anyway

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.940
um did you lose any Asian friends

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.020
no I don't have any Asian friends

00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.600
no no everybody no one cared yeah the

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.919
comments literally no one cared yeah

00:22:01.919 --> 00:22:04.260
real life no one cared it's so strange

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.299
yeah yeah I'm sure don't get me wrong

00:22:06.299 --> 00:22:07.500
I'm sure there were a lot of people that

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.720
that did that did bother them of course

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.299
and again I I also understood why they

00:22:12.299 --> 00:22:13.740
fired me it's not like it's not like

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.720
when I when I found out I was like what

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.360
how dare they I was like yeah yeah makes

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:21.299
sense yeah makes sense here's a video of

00:22:21.299 --> 00:22:24.539
me using a slur it makes sense yeah but

00:22:24.539 --> 00:22:27.360
so but in many ways though

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.700
and you don't have to answer this if you

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:33.480
want to but it kind of did something

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.299
different for your career definitely in

00:22:36.299 --> 00:22:37.799
the sense that

00:22:37.799 --> 00:22:38.580
um

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.620
I feel like when people say your name

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.260
it's like a legit

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.799
comedy entity you know I mean not just

00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:47.940
you know

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.440
something that's going to be here one

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.059
day gone the next yeah but somebody

00:22:51.059 --> 00:22:53.760
that's like legit like like when I think

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.620
of your name I think of Andrew Schultz

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:59.340
Chris DeStefano guys probably I don't

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.360
know if you're friends with those guys I

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.220
am Mark Normand you know I mean those

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.200
types of guys you know I mean and um

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.140
that's the vibe that you've done for

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.880
yourself I don't know you know and if

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.220
you didn't have the talent and you were

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.200
just that's one thing but you

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.260
legitimately have the talent I'm being

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.419
real I know yeah and you know how I feel

00:23:18.419 --> 00:23:21.240
about compliments you hate it because

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.679
I've been I've been seeing him all week

00:23:22.679 --> 00:23:24.179
and I give him yeah he's been watching

00:23:24.179 --> 00:23:26.340
you it gives me compliments when I see

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.500
him I give him copy hates it but I'm

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.419
just I'm not I'm very sweet is that the

00:23:30.419 --> 00:23:31.679
first thing I don't give a [ __ ] about it

00:23:31.679 --> 00:23:33.179
was like I don't care if you if you died

00:23:33.179 --> 00:23:35.120
I wouldn't care of course

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.860
no he's being honest I'm being

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.380
legitimately honest with you it's like I

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.840
would be sad if you died off no but you

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.279
know I mean I'm being you know I don't

00:23:44.279 --> 00:23:45.600
know what you're like as a person but

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.320
I'm just saying in terms of like how I

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:53.279
perceive who you are how you know I how

00:23:53.279 --> 00:23:55.260
I know what other how other Comics

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:58.140
perceive you and how we're we how we

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:01.559
talk about you and it's in in a in in a

00:24:01.559 --> 00:24:04.200
good lens you know it's like you're

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.360
legitimate you know and I I don't think

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.940
that if two three years ago if you got

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.559
on SNL that you would get the same kind

00:24:10.559 --> 00:24:12.419
of street credibility even

00:24:12.419 --> 00:24:14.220
it's almost as if you went through

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.620
something you know I mean that we you

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:18.900
what are you looking at me like am I

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.820
seeing the wrong thing no why are you

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.400
what because because he does this thing

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.740
where he has his pen in his hand and

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.240
he's gonna write down something like no

00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:31.020
you know what I mean

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.179

Asia now so oh nice yeah anyway that's

00:24:42.419 --> 00:24:44.159
enough compliments for me but it's like

00:24:44.159 --> 00:24:47.460

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.720
that you're gonna have a really good

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.740

00:27:47.039 --> 00:27:48.480
ever heard about my grandpa was like he

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.919
was fighting people he was always

00:27:49.919 --> 00:27:52.440
attacking people yeah I never heard a

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.940
story about him other than him fighting

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.720
people and then he he had a he had a

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.279
heart his heart he had a heart attack

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:01.799
obviously he was like six five 250

00:28:01.799 --> 00:28:04.080
pounds huge guy and he had a heart

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.000
attack and when he came out of surgery

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.700
he tried to attack the nurses and

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.299
doctors and his heart exploded again on

00:28:11.299 --> 00:28:15.000
the table so that's how he died wait

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.679
wait but every story I heard about him

00:28:16.679 --> 00:28:18.720
was him attacking people and I never put

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.940
together that he clearly had CTE yeah

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:23.580
until I found a newspaper article that

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.080
was from him playing football in like

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.600
1928 that he was held out of a game

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.820
because of a head injury oh wow and if

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.380
you were held out for a head injury in

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:34.020
the 20s yeah you were [ __ ] up like

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.240
yeah yeah so he played offensive line

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.980
for noting in there and what's crazy

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.480
about that is obviously they didn't know

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.520
what CTE is we're back they just figured

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.200
out they just figured that out right and

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.380
it's like that's a huge thing man even

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.419

00:29:32.159 --> 00:29:34.200
stab himself in the heart is that true

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.580
though because that's what we all were

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.260

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.580
maybe you're like oh he was like

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.740
tripping on acid and he stabbed himself

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.020
in the chest five times but like that's

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.120
the late 90s like you know we didn't

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.860

I know he's dead yeah that's fog it

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.960
wasn't like a skateboarding accident

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.419

bugs I had bed bugs where like two years

00:34:11.399 --> 00:34:14.280
ago in New York oh it's the worst they

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.359
bring about it every night you have to

00:34:15.359 --> 00:34:17.040
burn everything yeah I got rid of

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.220
everything else did they [ __ ] you up

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:22.859
yeah not really but like mentally oh wow

00:34:22.859 --> 00:34:24.720
it like [ __ ] you up no I'm not saying

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:27.780
it was like I was but like I would still

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.179
like I still look for bed bugs now like

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:32.159
it [ __ ] you up how do you know you have

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:35.520
them uh if they're not biting on you my

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.899
one roommate yeah you can get like

00:34:36.899 --> 00:34:38.700
little bites on your arm yeah or a bag

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:40.440
or something yeah on the bed and then

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:42.359
and then you look for them and you'll

00:34:42.359 --> 00:34:44.460
[ __ ] see them on your bed what freaks

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:46.619
me out is baby the worst yeah but what

00:34:46.619 --> 00:34:48.419
do they do do they eat your blood I mean

00:34:48.419 --> 00:34:49.619
how do they survive yeah they just suck

00:34:49.619 --> 00:34:51.119
your blood a little yeah and that's

00:34:51.119 --> 00:34:53.460
their whole deal yeah is their whole

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:55.260
deal that's all they do you could live

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.780
with them

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.859
you could ignore them theoretically you

00:34:58.859 --> 00:35:00.359
could yeah I think but they get on

00:35:00.359 --> 00:35:03.440
everything so like you can't

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.060
you have to burn your clothes yes yeah

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:08.339
every single thing that you have right

00:35:08.339 --> 00:35:10.260
that's a nightmare yeah and then the guy

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.480
brings in a dog that smells for them oh

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.220
[ __ ] sorry they bring in like a beagle

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.980
oh yeah my roommate said he was like

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:18.180
yeah we're gonna have to get a beagle in

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.560
here I was like you're the dumbest guy

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.760
I've ever had

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.040
I think of [ __ ] dogs coming in to

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.619
find out bed bugs and sure enough what

00:35:25.619 --> 00:35:27.480
well God came up with a beagle my

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.280
sister's jails where she used to work at

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.099
they had like I think the worst bed bug

00:35:32.099 --> 00:35:35.700
case in this the whole like City and

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.859
they had to fumigate is that the right

00:35:37.859 --> 00:35:40.260
word yeah but it took days for them to

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.599
do that they had to shut the jails down

00:35:42.599 --> 00:35:44.640
yeah but it's like if what I'm saying is

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.339
if we got big bed bugs in our house we'd

00:35:47.339 --> 00:35:49.800
have to burn like my vintage everything

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.260
first everything like Furniture [ __ ]

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.640
everything dude but why can't I just

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.140
look at the shirt and go there's no bed

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:59.160

then dogs can dogs get them yes dogs get

00:37:34.859 --> 00:37:37.260
tons of worms but you know but have you

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.020
heard of this model's supermodels going

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.359
to Mexico or something and getting a

00:37:42.359 --> 00:37:46.079
tapeworm and then it makes it eats away

00:37:46.079 --> 00:37:48.180
what is it either way it basically

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.520
forces malnutrition but the thing with

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.380
tapeworm is that again we were told that

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:53.760
in the late 90s they're like yeah you

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.320
could just cross over to Mexico and go

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.700
on and take that's right just throw up

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:59.460
what yeah yeah you just throw up because

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:02.099
tape worms can be like 80 feet long and

00:38:02.099 --> 00:38:03.720
they just wrap around and they like

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.460
don't allow you to properly absorb your

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:08.280
nutrients but but you get this this

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.680
tended belly where you look like you're

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.540

Abercrombie um ex co-worker that had

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.040
tapeworm because I would look at her

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.079
body and I'd be like I think across the

00:38:22.079 --> 00:38:24.119
border and got yourself a tapeworm

00:38:24.119 --> 00:38:26.940

real it's a funny bit great angle and

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.579

some Goods so anything where I'm laying

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.599
yeah yeah that's pretty easy yeah

00:46:39.599 --> 00:46:42.000
because I'm more of a bottomy guy kind

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.440
of are you bothering me or

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:46.140

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:48.240
copy I'll get up there yeah yeah I'll

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.740
get up there and ride a little bit he

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.359
doesn't at all

00:46:51.359 --> 00:46:55.040
well I'm also have little legs

00:46:55.099 --> 00:46:57.240
yeah I just have a little like so I

00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:58.619
can't do certain things that he can do

00:46:58.619 --> 00:47:00.180
no that's what are you talking about

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:03.420
because so like I don't mind you can't

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:06.060
you can't take a knee right no he needs

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:08.040
a little bit of a height so that he can

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.099
even yeah so I need to put like pillows

00:47:11.099 --> 00:47:13.260
which is embarrassing I think you and me

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:15.060
are in the in the two ends of the

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:16.440
spectrum because yeah it's somehow lower

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:19.619
you're too high right right it might

00:47:19.619 --> 00:47:22.500
even be harder for you yeah definitely

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.079
because no all he can oh what you can do

00:47:25.079 --> 00:47:27.780
is just give her don't point it yeah

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.960
yeah

00:47:30.079 --> 00:47:32.579
you could have the girl right on the

00:47:32.579 --> 00:47:35.520
edge of the bed right now you could be

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:37.740
standing yeah right but it not if it's

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:39.540
an Asian style bed because we like the

low beds

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:44.160

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:33.020
diddled

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:41.040
were you the funny one in high school or

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.780
no that's pretty funny but I think I was

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:44.940
I was more of a I thought it was funny

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:48.059
and I think people thought I was a bully

00:49:48.059 --> 00:49:50.040
yeah yeah but see that's the thing I was

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.200
only mean to like my friends I wasn't

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:54.240
like a bully to like the kids who were

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.619
like

00:49:55.619 --> 00:49:58.200
that it would be bullying you know like

00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.700
a kid without friends I'm not gonna pick

00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:01.500
on him yeah like a guy who thought he

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:03.000
was cool or tried to be cool yeah I

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.480
would probably yeah you I I also think

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.940
that you have the size like I think that

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:10.800
if you and I were the same way in high

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:13.020
school they would think that you were

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.000
more of a bully because of your size and

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.720
to me it's like oh he's just aggressive

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:20.700
right I think size has a lot to do with

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:22.260
it I think so too because I'm pretty

00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:25.079
bullying yeah he's a bully sure like I

00:50:25.079 --> 00:50:27.800
saw you pull up to the store

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.960
like just throwing your keys at a car

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.300
guy I figure he's been talking through

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:35.640
them and then walked right up to me he

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:38.099
was like yeah good special like started

00:50:38.099 --> 00:50:39.720

literally yeah he had some sort of a

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:16.020
machine that looked like a Batmobile

00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:19.020
there was like it was black

00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:21.780
low to the ground it was like I'm over a

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:23.819
Jeep like a combination between a Jeep

00:51:23.819 --> 00:51:26.280
like an like a Wrangler jeep that you

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:29.520

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.319
I'm not kidding you well those two are

00:51:31.319 --> 00:51:33.920
nothing alike

00:51:35.119 --> 00:51:37.740
okay let me just

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:41.040

the new one from the 1960s show yeah

00:51:44.339 --> 00:51:48.059
okay and and then but imagine like you

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:51.059
Jeep

00:51:51.059 --> 00:51:53.780
so hard to do in my brain I'm not even

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:56.579
I'm not picturing a single thing yeah

00:51:56.579 --> 00:51:58.140
but anyway we pulled up on something

00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:59.760

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.200

like ripped jeans and being cool by

00:52:46.859 --> 00:52:48.720
being a you're a comedian

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:51.960
what's that all is it a book about the

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:55.380
two guys Lenny and myself Mice and Men

00:52:55.380 --> 00:53:00.200
that's you guys that's us rice and man

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:03.260
there he is all right

00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:08.760
rice and Men that's the title of this

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:11.059
episode that's your fault

00:53:11.059 --> 00:53:14.099
but you're the Lenny I think I'm a big I

00:53:14.099 --> 00:53:15.660
do put off Lanny Vibes right many

00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:17.460
certainly or

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:20.040
Mad Max be on the Thunder dorm what's

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:21.380
that called

00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:24.780
what is it called Mad Max but beyond the

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:27.599
throne in the Thunder dorm no what's it

00:53:27.599 --> 00:53:29.640
called Thunder Dome yeah oh it's a

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:32.460
Thunder Dome I know you're going what

00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:35.460
Master Blaster there we go yeah

00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:37.980
but when I said Thunder dorm it threw

00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:40.380
you off uh it took me a second because I

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:42.420
was surprised that anybody could even

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:44.760
say that

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:48.079
I mean how could you ever do that

00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:51.420
I know that threw me off quite a bit

00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:52.559
because there's certain things I just

00:53:52.559 --> 00:53:54.300
don't know what they're called

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.760
like even if like you know you know me I

00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:58.559
have problems with

00:53:58.559 --> 00:53:59.160
um

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:01.680
like I commit to a word even though I

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:03.540
don't know how to pronounce it yeah

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.460
right whereas most people would be like

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:07.200
I'm gonna choose a different word

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.540
because I could print right I'll just go

00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:13.319
for it right so Thunder don't Thunder

00:54:13.319 --> 00:54:16.260
Dome that storm

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:18.839
the Thunder dorm the Thunder dorm seems

00:54:18.839 --> 00:54:22.339
more sounds like a porn yeah yeah yeah

00:54:22.339 --> 00:54:25.140
Shane Gillis and Bobby Lee and

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:28.579
thunderstorm two students [ __ ]

00:54:28.579 --> 00:54:31.319
adult men break into a dorm and have sex

00:54:31.319 --> 00:54:33.660
with each other I think you and I would

00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:36.000
pick a perfect

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.040
Odd Couple it would be a good Odd Couple

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:41.280
do you think so yeah obviously yeah in

00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:43.140
fact I'm trying to think of something

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:46.079
that you and I could do right that like

00:54:46.079 --> 00:54:50.059
[ __ ] the Vietnam movie right yeah

00:54:50.059 --> 00:54:52.980
Vietnam would be if I'm not Vietnamese

00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:54.599
you know yeah and I'm not exactly built

00:54:54.599 --> 00:54:57.420
like a troop yeah yeah maybe if like a

00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:59.299
chef got lost

00:54:59.299 --> 00:55:02.299
yes

00:55:05.299 --> 00:55:07.799
maybe one of the fat Cooks gets lost

00:55:07.799 --> 00:55:09.480
yeah and then you're right from salt

00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:11.760
mines of Korea so what you're saying to

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:14.579
me is the salt mines are filled are

00:55:14.579 --> 00:55:16.740
filled with mentally mentally disabled

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:19.200
Korean isn't that where they go off to

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:20.700
like they a lot of them they put them to

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:22.859
work in the salt mine in North Korea and

00:55:22.859 --> 00:55:24.780
then you're a chef right but you're

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:26.940
looking for a certain type of salt not

00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:29.700

Christmas and my [ __ ] niece had it oh

00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:51.480
my God you have to study people like you

00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:53.700
who are just so like resistant to the

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:55.980
yeah I know because I was yeah of course

00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:58.260

00:58:58.260 --> 00:58:59.160
[ __ ]

00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:01.500

00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:05.299

00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:10.740
the whole time yeah and um do you I

00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:12.660
don't feel in danger on the plane I know

00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:15.960
do you no really no no I mean especially

00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:19.140
when there's the you know Specter of

00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:21.660
plummeting to your death today that's

00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:23.040
kind of Weighing on my mind more than

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:24.720
like I hope I don't get a cold but but

00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:26.880
but at a club like the comedies I use

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:28.380
Specter correctly there right that was

00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:30.420
really good thanks but comedy clubs

00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:32.099
because there's so many comics on the

00:59:32.099 --> 00:59:35.640
mic that's the scary part right like in

00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:37.200
New York I'm sure there's a thousand

00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:39.299
guys on one like nope I don't see anyone

00:59:39.299 --> 00:59:41.940
spraying it down we were using the

00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:43.859
of the foam thing the foam thing yeah

00:59:43.859 --> 00:59:45.420
the seller was doing different mics

00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:46.980
everybody had their own mic yeah

00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:48.720
although Martin Lawrence the other night

00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:52.140
so I brought up Martin Lawrence and I go

00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:54.119
Martin Lawrence and then like three

00:59:54.119 --> 00:59:55.980
dudes walked on stage I've never seen

00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:57.119
before

00:59:57.119 --> 00:59:58.799
and they just like they weren't wearing

00:59:58.799 --> 01:00:01.440
hazmat suits but they should have been

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.119
because they were just washing

01:00:03.119 --> 01:00:05.099
everything down you're right and people

01:00:05.099 --> 01:00:06.359
were like what the [ __ ] and he goes up

01:00:06.359 --> 01:00:08.220
there but it's like I think they should

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:11.240
do that between every comic

01:00:12.119 --> 01:00:16.440
problem whose problem you no so um at

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.119
the end of our pot so I was like

01:00:18.119 --> 01:00:20.839
listening to the story

01:00:21.119 --> 01:00:22.740
sitting here listening to the story I

01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:24.660

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.780
that the Universe would somehow make us

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:32.819
bump into each other like some cheesy

01:04:32.819 --> 01:04:35.700

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.720
likes them yeah yeah it's just guys I

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:17.940
hate it too old to figure them out so

01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:21.180
what do you think uh how does this guy

01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:25.579
get a woman like you Shane

01:05:28.339 --> 01:05:31.740
his first X I believe was uh at 18

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.900
cheated on him and ever since he's been

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:36.000
alone is he just cussing [ __ ] out at

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.500
the bar like what's he doing probably

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.420
angry he's probably an in-cell possibly

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:41.400
energy you have a 10 years after you get

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.140
cheat you get cheated on and then I mean

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:44.880
if if you were dating anyone when you

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:47.760
were 18 they cheated on you yeah exactly

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.920
it's true yeah they all did we all did

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:52.319
yeah my suggestion is to go the other

01:05:52.319 --> 01:05:54.359
way which way

01:05:54.359 --> 01:05:56.039
just say forget it I'm not going to do

01:05:56.039 --> 01:05:57.119
it me one

01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:58.740
yeah that's how that will work actually

01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.839
I think that will work it's like you

01:06:00.839 --> 01:06:03.900
know what if the you know this is a true

01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:07.020
story I rarely tell true stories on this

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:09.420
this podcast sure but this one is kind

01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:13.020
of true okay I'm being real so back in

01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:15.839
the day when I was a kid I used to go to

01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:18.359
a meetings right and there was this

01:06:18.359 --> 01:06:21.059
English guy named Barry I don't think

01:06:21.059 --> 01:06:23.520
that I'm giving anything away and Barry

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:24.420
was

01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:26.640
he I'm not kidding you

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.920
Hobbits would call him

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:32.640
a little person he was that little and

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.460
he was stocky and he had these he was

01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:38.160
from England he had these rosy cheeks

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:41.400
and he was little and he hey what's up

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.500
you know I mean he was a good jolly

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:46.200
and he was a virgin until he was like in

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:47.760
his 50s

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:51.480
right he was just an alcoholic and

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.660
one day I go I I do you not want to meet

01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:56.280
women he goes well it's just not in my

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:58.440
path I've tried it's not so I just I'm

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.059
just focusing on focusing on

01:07:00.059 --> 01:07:01.500
spirituality

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:04.980
and focusing on and so be it it's God's

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:06.359
will or whatever you know a spiritual

01:07:06.359 --> 01:07:07.079
guy

01:07:07.079 --> 01:07:09.420
and then years later I came back I

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:11.160
wasn't living in Lay I went back to back

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.619
to an a meeting there and Barry was

01:07:13.619 --> 01:07:16.559
married with this really hot chick she

01:07:16.559 --> 01:07:17.760
was a little older but she was very

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:20.280
pretty and I just thought I think that

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:22.380
worked for him just focusing on his

01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:24.839
thing and then when the time came

01:07:24.839 --> 01:07:26.940
his the love of his life came around the

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:29.280
corner at that age so

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:32.640
Let It Go I think don't you think yeah I

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:35.220
mean if you're pushing it that's tough

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:36.839
yeah you're going on like Tinder dates

01:07:36.839 --> 01:07:39.599
like this is my girlfriend it's like oh

01:07:39.599 --> 01:07:41.460
this will be trouble yeah yeah I don't

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:43.440
know it's tough for me to give advice on

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:45.420
dating yeah because the only advice I

01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:47.039
can be like all right is get very good

01:07:47.039 --> 01:07:50.240
at stand up I mean

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:53.460
you and I were not doing this as a

01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:55.020
business you think I would have been

01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:56.520
able to land somebody like this I'm

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.520
surprised you were anyway

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.720
you're pretty good I hate when she goes

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.520
she go always goes well I would have

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.559
dated you in high school no you wanna of

01:08:04.559 --> 01:08:06.180
you wouldn't even know who know who I

01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:06.960
was

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.880
I dated a guy with actual Down syndrome

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:12.180
okay he's Panamanian so take that back

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:15.260
she's popping her eyes

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:19.020
so like I don't even know what you're

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:21.120
saying I hated fugly [ __ ] my

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.279
whole life okay okay babe that's just

01:08:23.279 --> 01:08:25.580
making me feel that good

01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:27.900
if that's the bar you know what I mean

01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:30.179
it's just like the bar is low I'm gonna

01:08:30.179 --> 01:08:32.699
be real with you the bar is very low

01:08:32.699 --> 01:08:34.859
has always been low and I I don't know

01:08:34.859 --> 01:08:36.620
what that says about me

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:39.659
it's jackpot

01:08:39.659 --> 01:08:41.880
but it's like um I don't know how I feel

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:45.299
about that but anyway I believe that you

01:08:45.299 --> 01:08:45.960
know

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:49.140
um that guy you gotta find that one

01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:51.480
thing that's that's nothing to do with

01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:53.460
being with a woman if being with a woman

01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:55.560
is your sole purpose in life and your

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.540
goal right I don't think it's gonna work

01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:01.259
out [ __ ] focus on you know I mean

01:09:01.259 --> 01:09:02.699
other [ __ ]

01:09:02.699 --> 01:09:05.279
don't you think and then if you're good

01:09:05.279 --> 01:09:09.060
at whatever you do they will come

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:12.239

01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:21.920
be with nobody
