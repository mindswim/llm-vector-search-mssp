00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.179
a problem obviously London real has I

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.449
mean pretty much all in one oh it's like

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.920
you don't really why I haven't watched

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.020
enough London real I mean he's never

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.609
watched I haven't watched any London

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.539
real Sebald he's a baller dude he's used

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.890
to be a banker he left you mean he left

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.660
millions and banking just you know cuz

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.090
he wanted to like talk people and really

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.800
protect he protects free speech right

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.750
now he got beat D platformed off at

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.430
YouTube for having David Icke on his

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.320
interviews he does do decent interviews

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.930
I'll give him that

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.629
he's just a [ __ ] weird dude but it is

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.250
there there is something to be said for

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.120
the fact that you can't even just get

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.800
thought just try to think things out

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.690
let's just stop [ __ ] and think things

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.930
out there there should be enough nuance

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.940
to people being like are they overtly

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.750
calling for you know yeah well I'm not

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.489
I'm not worried about people ever like

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.140
actually believing that I'm worried

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.140
about people that want to put that out

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.570
there because it's easy if you want to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.770
make someone look bad and this is the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.240
type of conversations we're having I

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.619
don't think that anybody's actually

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.570
listening to some being like oh my god

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.729
these guys are terrible it's like if

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.259
somebody wants to make it look bad they

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.479
can't it's true and that's when it's

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.979
like I know you can't live your life in

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.280
fear that so I'm not but boy they can

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.240
get you on certain things especially

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.610
it's like do I need to discuss whether

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.180
or not Jews or hey have it bad maybe not

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.390
I can avoid it but the show the show

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.610
brought me into it yeah that would have

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.200
never ever crossed my mind until I

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.600
watched that show and I was like why

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.869
like what's the what's the I ever saying

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.130
yeah you you're not you're not sitting

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.780
at home wondering about them I'm not

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.590

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.299
bad I don't care

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.549
yeah I mean it is well it's one thing

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.170
that I saw that it was kind of weird to

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.850

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.690
miles

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.400

[ __ ] insane

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.790
I only suck a trucker if they've gone at

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.050
least like 250 300 miles typically

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:21.720
sweatpants typically a [ __ ] headset

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.730
which is funny funny to see a headset

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:24.720
because it just means they're in there

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.300
[ __ ] talking [ __ ] to people all that

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.740
just I mean they're basically what

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.360
happens when they you know kids that

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.550
screamed the n-word on call duty need to

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.700
get a job it's basically the exact same

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.980
like something about sitting in a same

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.260
spot for a long time maybe bad words

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:45.420
true I could see that we prepare but I

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.580
do I see it because they you know they

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.740
usually typically the their gas pump is

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.870
a little further than the gas pump at

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.780
the rest stop and reason brothers they

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.460
got lizards wandering around you see the

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.490
boys walk by and they are some crusty

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.020
[ __ ] and if you sucked one of

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.030
their dicks after driving all day just

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.570
sweating oh my [ __ ] god dude that's

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:08.220
the devil's butt yeah I agree with this

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:08.430
guy

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.980
I mean imagine you saw her sleeping you

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.090
ever see their sleeping quarters like

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:14.550
that weird little bunk off my truck I

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:16.080
always wanted to be in there just

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.880
driving you're fending off lot lizards

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.470
on the CB people are preaching the good

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.060
word and then you just get to [ __ ]

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.760
like a Chevron rest stop and just suck

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.620

United States if they come here which is

00:13:28.089 --> 00:13:30.189

00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:36.430
type of wasp that will surround murder

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.709
Hornets and since wasps can take a

00:13:38.709 --> 00:13:40.899
higher temperature the murder Hornet

00:13:40.899 --> 00:13:42.430
burns up and dies so they're saying

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.749

00:21:23.809 --> 00:21:25.490
picking up Gallow crazy dude in the

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:27.559
opposite [ __ ] lane on the other side

00:21:27.559 --> 00:21:31.610
of the highway cut into my lane like he

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:34.309
was coming oncoming traffic there was a

00:21:34.309 --> 00:21:35.899
big median like one of those big ditch

00:21:35.899 --> 00:21:38.870

missed my car by a car length holy [ __ ]

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:45.980
I just got past him when he went right

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.049
behind me

00:21:47.049 --> 00:21:48.249
and then he was just in the middle of

00:21:48.249 --> 00:21:50.169
the highway parallel a truck [ __ ]

00:21:50.169 --> 00:21:52.179
swerved down the way right behind me it

00:21:52.179 --> 00:21:53.619
was nuts I've never seen anything like

00:21:53.619 --> 00:21:53.919
it

00:21:53.919 --> 00:21:55.570
I saw the guy coming the whole way - I

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.489
was like what's this guy he pulling over

00:21:57.489 --> 00:21:59.110
holy [ __ ] he's losing control of his car

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:00.999
holy [ __ ] he's right there and they

00:22:00.999 --> 00:22:02.440
didn't trust what happened to the truck

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.759
didn't hit him I don't know I didn't see

00:22:03.759 --> 00:22:05.230
anything after that but then like a

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:06.789
couple miles down the road a truck had

00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:08.350
gotten like blown off the road the wind

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:10.659
was crazy holy [ __ ]

00:22:10.659 --> 00:22:13.149
yeah dude I've seen some wild [ __ ] it

00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:14.559
was like in the mountains - so it was

00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:16.259
all that curvy and rainy

00:22:16.259 --> 00:22:18.940
lightning nonsti it was very spooky it

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.169
was very smooth that's what I had to

00:22:20.169 --> 00:22:21.759
stop dude I had to pull over teased a

00:22:21.759 --> 00:22:23.739
piece of that trucker dude teasing Pete

00:22:23.739 --> 00:22:25.299
I think though I saw that the door was

00:22:25.299 --> 00:22:27.850
open so I think he got out good but what

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:30.509
scared me was I was thinking about

00:22:30.509 --> 00:22:34.029
oncoming traffic we'll let you know if

00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:36.039
there's like a tornado coming by like

00:22:36.039 --> 00:22:37.600
flashing the high beams and beeping and

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.909
[ __ ] by being like yo watch out it's up

00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:41.080
there

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.450
a bunch of cars the truck started like

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:45.850
flashing their high beams on the way in

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.470
right before that axe right before I got

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:48.730
to the curve where that accident was

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:50.049
there all flashing at high beams and I

00:22:50.049 --> 00:22:52.330
was like holy [ __ ] dude I think I'm

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:53.919

00:23:54.999 --> 00:23:58.029
sat down at a restaurant and eaten who

00:23:58.029 --> 00:23:59.950

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.500
I actually am excited to do that once uh

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.840

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.990
told you about this about the UH so I

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:09.669
think Pennsylvania is expanding it to

00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:13.600
like June they're trying to say yeah

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.269
they did yeah so this is the funny thing

00:24:16.269 --> 00:24:19.419
I'm really [ __ ] trans bash soo goddamn

00:24:19.419 --> 00:24:26.710
it yes we're gonna dr. Dow fire okay

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:34.179
good that's very bad right sir

00:24:34.179 --> 00:24:37.299
yeah no it's totally fine D so they're

00:24:37.299 --> 00:24:39.309
now saying there's a new model they're

00:24:39.309 --> 00:24:41.019
like look at a very respected model

00:24:41.019 --> 00:24:42.720
we've been following all along this

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.190
predicts that our real bottle yeah it's

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:46.509
like what the [ __ ] you can't have you

00:24:46.509 --> 00:24:48.549
have like nine models but they're uh

00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:50.500
they're now saying like yeah that we're

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.360
actually thinking certain 846 thousand

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.529
deaths by by August because we're gonna

00:24:56.529 --> 00:24:58.629
do partial reopens and then I told you

00:24:58.629 --> 00:24:59.289
about this too

00:24:59.289 --> 00:25:02.200
they're saying that uh they're

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.610
predicting two million around two

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:06.009
million deaths in Africa and I told you

00:25:06.009 --> 00:25:08.019
how they're trying to give people in

00:25:08.019 --> 00:25:10.450
Africa there's one lady who's saying we

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.929
should give Africa a trillion dollars

00:25:12.929 --> 00:25:15.669
yeah yeah yeah you told me in there but

00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:17.379
again it's like don't like you know this

00:25:17.379 --> 00:25:19.809
lady was a historically critical of our

00:25:19.809 --> 00:25:21.730
the previous trillion dollars we gave

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:22.840
Africa she's like yeah but it all went

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.379
to warlords we got to give Africans ubi

00:25:25.379 --> 00:25:27.759
unless or two million people will die of

00:25:27.759 --> 00:25:30.100
Cove it and it's like this again this is

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.179
what I was talking about earlier with

00:25:31.179 --> 00:25:32.590
like so the guy said yo man it's really

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:33.759

are getting wiped out it's like that it

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:37.570
could be that's probably true I don't

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:42.309
deny that but it's yeah but so were you

00:25:42.309 --> 00:25:44.230

pastor in Liberia he was eating children

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:58.810
before battle yeah they had cut his come

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:00.820
to Jesus moment was like he was like

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.830
telling explaining the camera when he

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:04.330
heard Jesus for the first time he was

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:07.480
like yeah this I it was before battle

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.800
and usually I would like drink the blood

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.170
of a virgin child before battle so

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:12.400
typically like a two or three-year-old

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:16.320
they would execute and he would eat so

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:20.080
here's one any black kids so then when

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.540
he was about to eat this kid he was like

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:23.920
and then I looked down and I noticed

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.210
that it was one of them it was the most

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:27.010

00:28:29.919 --> 00:28:34.240
so after I ate her I knew that was well

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.620
after I ate that three year old I was

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.260
like that has to be the last one and

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:42.100
that was that was the last kid I ate a

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.779
pastor now he like he's like a mega

00:28:43.779 --> 00:28:46.179
church pastor remember we talked about

00:28:46.179 --> 00:28:48.880
this in a way way long ago when there

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.830
was a cannibalism problem in Africa

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.289
we're like yeah he got busted and like

00:28:53.289 --> 00:28:54.700
everyone came forward and was like

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.610
guilty I I some some kids - they told me

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:00.220
that give me secret power so it was like

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.590
it was mostly yeah I mean it wasn't just

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:05.049
Liberia but Liberia had a lot of it

00:29:05.049 --> 00:29:07.360

00:30:38.289 --> 00:30:41.190
landmark moment of online activism

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:08.420
you know you see something in the news

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:10.430
and they are like LeBron James tweet it

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:12.890

like you're more like you we should be

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.830
worried more about driving and obviously

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:25.810
that it's a heinous horrible act and

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:26.950

to go jogging statistically speaking you

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:35.740
will be totally fine there's your the

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:37.480
chances of you running yeah yeah yeah

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.600
yeah that dude and his son who obviously

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.880
they hyped themselves up pretty hard a

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.040
little father-and-son action but it's

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.830
like uh I mean that'd be like hongki's

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:49.360
being like what I can't pump gas anymore

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:53.530

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:56.920
father-and-son retards thank you yeah

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.350
that's that's the problem of it of like

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:01.750
oh now this is an existential threat to

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:03.310
all black people it's like no it's

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:05.680
[ __ ] up it's shitty I'm not taking

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.390
away from it but it's like LeBron James

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:10.060

no I like LeBron I don't write I'm

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:24.400

don't know I don't like nor hate him I

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:28.330
really don't have any feelings I think

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:31.360
it's I think it's pretty impressive to

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.690
be in the spotlight since eighth grade

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:37.060

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.710
mean he's becoming an activist which is

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:42.190
gay what that's the worst

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:43.510
I mean that's the worst thing you could

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:46.450
say about the guys like he's starting a

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:50.670

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:04.750

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.560
activist in that sense like he like he

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.050

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.000

because the the you're supposed to be

01:05:16.449 --> 01:05:18.519

01:05:18.519 --> 01:05:20.019
the salesperson to be kind of a [ __ ]

01:05:20.019 --> 01:05:22.119

01:05:22.119 --> 01:05:23.799
bring the manager out of the bullpen and

01:05:23.799 --> 01:05:25.239

01:05:39.279 --> 01:05:40.900
the interest rates are low so I'm not

01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:41.739

you gotta present yourself as a goddamn

01:06:09.699 --> 01:06:12.999

01:06:12.999 --> 01:06:14.469
just ask because I'm looking a [ __ ]

01:06:14.469 --> 01:06:17.309
idiot that's why I won't ask

01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:21.130
yeah that was that was cracking me but

01:06:21.130 --> 01:06:23.920
but it's here's what you do here's the

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:27.339
actual answer this is from a car

01:06:27.339 --> 01:06:27.790
salesman

01:06:27.790 --> 01:06:32.230
yeah you go to whoever they hate usually

01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:36.130
they'll tell you yeah right to go to

01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:39.160
Piazza yeah get us price on the same

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.059
[ __ ] car

01:06:40.059 --> 01:06:41.680
already doing bring it back to them and

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:43.240
say can you beat this yeah

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.010
then if you really want to be a [ __ ]

01:06:45.010 --> 01:06:47.710
bring it back to Piazza yeah I'll be

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:48.790
like can you beat that

01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:51.339
I literally I told Brittany I was like

01:06:51.339 --> 01:06:53.290
oh this is my world in terms and as soon

01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:54.640
as the first if you're going to any kind

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.170
of inventory business the first thing

01:06:56.170 --> 01:06:57.460
they show you is the thing they want to

01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:59.230
get rid of this is the thing they gotta

01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:00.430
get rid of the most that's the first

01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:02.589
thing they show you and they're like I

01:07:02.589 --> 01:07:04.329
go in with the mentality that they're

01:07:04.329 --> 01:07:04.960
trying to [ __ ] me

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.549
that's just how I think and then that's

01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:07.780
what's telling Britain that's why that's

01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:09.490
what I meant like people I actually did

01:07:09.490 --> 01:07:10.690
hate oh for sure

01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:11.890
but it's like this is like dude I'm

01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:14.260
genuinely not alright our agendas are

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:16.349
totally opposite exactly you might know

01:07:16.349 --> 01:07:19.480
the agenda here's what will happen when

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.369
you do that if you play two dealerships

01:07:21.369 --> 01:07:23.380
against each other one of them will take

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:26.290
a loss to sell a unit instead of giving

01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:28.900
a unit to the other person that's what

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:31.210
happens like one of them is willing to

01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:34.750
take like NetZero just to [ __ ] the other

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:36.549
one just to make sure the other Honda

01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:38.380
dealership doesn't get the unit sold

01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:41.079
so yeah keep keep you can keep going

01:07:41.079 --> 01:07:43.059
back up what now eventually if you're

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:45.069
too much of a heart oh they'll just be

01:07:45.069 --> 01:07:48.549
like it'll be better for them to have to

01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:51.369
deal with him yeah like if somebody's

01:07:51.369 --> 01:07:52.780
being a piece of [ __ ] customer your bag

01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:55.150
I go to Piazza that yeah now I don't go

01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:57.069
super hard oh I just blame it all night

01:07:57.069 --> 01:07:58.599
dad I'm not saying you're being harder

01:07:58.599 --> 01:08:04.150
but the classic is an Indian yes dude

01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:07.510
you are in for a [ __ ] five day haggle

01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:11.920
of just the whole family the whole thing

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:13.240

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:14.680
sitting across from you at this table

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:17.529
yeah uncles cousins are [ __ ] arguing

01:08:17.529 --> 01:08:19.810
this is all for a van it's all for van

01:08:19.810 --> 01:08:22.810
and eventually I just I'm gonna go I

01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:25.600
like you guys but I don't care yeah I

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.549
don't want to sell my this sucks I'm

01:08:27.549 --> 01:08:29.460
losing every single other customer

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:30.930

sitting here so it's beating me up you

01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:40.620
just I'm doing nothing yeah I might

01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:42.000
start once the earth Cove is over I'll

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.290
probably start is going in the ghosts

01:08:43.290 --> 01:08:44.550
just to stay sharp it's going

01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:45.780

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.610
to take care of you and you can just go

01:08:53.610 --> 01:08:55.500
to dealership to dealership and just be

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.510
like waste a guy's day every day you

01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:58.860
could just take money out of a guy's

01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:01.140
pocket and it's best mom sharpening up

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:07.980

I'll give you twenty head around I'm

01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:19.560
saying because I think I read a business

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.570
book where a guy said that he goes the

01:09:21.570 --> 01:09:23.040
dealerships Justin to go to practice

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.680
negotiation oh my god that is true it's

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.300
so [ __ ] up it's like there's a getting

01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:32.060
a realtor this big I me around yeah yeah

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:35.730
that rules oh man but yeah that was uh

01:09:35.730 --> 01:09:37.920
that was a day in absolute hell just

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.110
like wearing a mask in a brand new car

01:09:40.110 --> 01:09:42.420
that wasn't ours being like shut no

01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:44.700

01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:51.600
shut the [ __ ] up Oh brutal and then some

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:52.920
guy being like well when we get more

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:54.540
cars they're gonna be more expensive

01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:55.800
because you know how that works it's

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.650
like what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] are you

01:09:58.650 --> 01:10:06.330
talking yeah especially dude having a

01:10:06.330 --> 01:10:08.820
bay buying a car that's rough that's

01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:10.230
where I met Bay that's where I met my

01:10:10.230 --> 01:10:12.390
last girlfriend I know sold her a car

01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:14.010
and it was [ __ ] love at first sight

01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:15.570
they did I showed her my [ __ ] chud

01:10:15.570 --> 01:10:19.940
that night dad you want to see a chud

01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:24.660
bays are missing the especially

01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:25.850
basements they have kids

01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:30.930
logic I don't think they're supposed to

01:10:30.930 --> 01:10:32.280
be isolated

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:33.900
I think bays are supposed to be like

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:36.270
with other bays all day we're doing the

01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:38.130
same who was talking about it I think it

01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:40.410
was it might've been in tribe something

01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:42.600
like that like it family used to be like

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:43.389
you're in a village

01:10:43.389 --> 01:10:46.000
so like you have a wife yeah you you

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.860
have BAE she is a kid she spends her

01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:49.690
time with the family

01:10:49.690 --> 01:10:51.429
yeah like the whole groups together

01:10:51.429 --> 01:10:53.320
she's with all the other sisters and

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.600
wives and they [ __ ] get their hands

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.760
it out yeah and then the men are out

01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.500
together doing their thing that's out

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:01.840
what I'm telling man I'm I I came up the

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.280
concept I think would actually be really

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:05.980
cool they called Bay care where it's

01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:09.040
like your baby a that can work from home

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.210
right so they called spin cycle but yes

01:11:12.210 --> 01:11:16.929
bowl cycle that's big there's some pervy

01:11:16.929 --> 01:11:21.400
dude that hangs out I like to work

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:24.210
outside shut up you [ __ ] pervert you

01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:26.770
suckers musics good there's good music

01:11:26.770 --> 01:11:28.210
gets me pumped what's the what's the

01:11:28.210 --> 01:11:30.360
idea for Baker I'm sorry the bay care is

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:33.760
so it's like a it's like a shared office

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:35.560
space where it's like you know you could

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.300
throw a couple laptops you know the base

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:39.010
can get like work from home parts like

01:11:39.010 --> 01:11:41.530
oh we love we work for bells we work but

01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:43.179
and then only they have like a window

01:11:43.179 --> 01:11:45.310
where then you hire Lee a couple chicks

01:11:45.310 --> 01:11:46.449
for like 12 bucks an hour

01:11:46.449 --> 01:11:48.820
who just babysit your kids while you

01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:50.380
work with other BAE's while doing work

01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:51.580
from home things and you can just you

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:52.659
look out through a window and you see

01:11:52.659 --> 01:11:53.770
your kids like running around getting

01:11:53.770 --> 01:11:56.460
babysat by a couple like teenage brats

01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:59.290
pretty [ __ ] away that place would catch

01:11:59.290 --> 01:12:02.050
fire what do you have - two or three

01:12:02.050 --> 01:12:03.820
that literally would burn dad the bays

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:07.150
the bays need to be in an organic hen

01:12:07.150 --> 01:12:09.460
factory true they need to be in a hand

01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:11.110
farm that's organic it can't be forced

01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:12.550
it can't be like hey do work in there

01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:14.199
dude if they were working on things in

01:12:14.199 --> 01:12:15.400
there they could be like Realtors proud

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.350
they could be like no don't yearly

01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:18.699
commit they can make like bracelets and

01:12:18.699 --> 01:12:20.080
[ __ ] and like we give them like play

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:26.290
work like nurse if you're doing your

01:12:26.290 --> 01:12:28.630
wife's like some big vote on before we

01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:31.900
move forward I just disrespected nurses

01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:33.369
and I apologize I was kidding I would

01:12:33.369 --> 01:12:35.050
never disrespect there's actually

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:36.639
actually isn't it hard [ __ ] I'm

01:12:36.639 --> 01:12:38.920
talking about life would suck dude yeah

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:41.199
that's it's a I've never been in a

01:12:41.199 --> 01:12:43.119
hospital and envied a nurse and like man

01:12:43.119 --> 01:12:45.070
I wish I could stay here it's always one

01:12:45.070 --> 01:12:48.369
more [ __ ] hours in all the rooms

01:12:48.369 --> 01:12:50.949
right now she's just watching old dudes

01:12:50.949 --> 01:12:54.820
dives yourself oh [ __ ] you have it dude

01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:57.040
the

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.170
yeah I think I think dude if it was like

01:12:59.170 --> 01:13:01.930
Baker's Baker is a good idea there's no

01:13:01.930 --> 01:13:03.820
funny something there yes it's like you

01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:05.800
go get a [ __ ] just so you can be like

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:07.150
cuz it's like when you get to work all

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:08.530
the time it's like what do you think

01:13:08.530 --> 01:13:09.880
what you think workings awesome it's

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:12.370
[ __ ] sucks but yeah it was like

watching TV and he like walked in the

01:17:20.710 --> 01:17:23.200
room holding the circle packet it was

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.680

he's like it expired in 2014 and I was

01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:38.080
like I didn't see the expiration doing

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:42.150
drugs yes doing expired antipsychotics

01:17:42.150 --> 01:17:44.560
did you see what this is for I was like

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:47.470
I didn't before I took it now yes why

01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:48.820
still in my pocket dad I'm gonna throw

01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:52.210
it out I was like this yeah yeah that's

01:17:52.210 --> 01:17:53.740
how you get I think it's called target

01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:55.270
kinesia that's how you see those old

01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:58.510
guys go it's from the first class of

01:17:58.510 --> 01:18:00.370
antipsychotics it was a side effect and

01:18:00.370 --> 01:18:05.380
once you have it that's it that's pretty

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:06.670
good though you probably get a [ __ ]

01:18:06.670 --> 01:18:08.710
jacked [ __ ] jaw and tongue trio you

01:18:08.710 --> 01:18:10.180

they all don't have the teeth yeah sure

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:17.470
but I think I think the circle doesn't

01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:20.170
have that as a side effect I don't think

01:18:20.170 --> 01:18:22.060
I'm gonna get it but if I got that that

01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:23.560
