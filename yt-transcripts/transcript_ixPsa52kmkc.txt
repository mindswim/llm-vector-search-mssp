his patriarchal mindset and get into

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.910
like the stuff of basically democratic

know a lot of satanic satanic stuff

00:03:51.350 --> 00:04:00.260
going on really the paradigm shift from

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.670
the Age of Aquarius is just that we're

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.870
gonna set up business and the whole

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.430
point of business is just sustain this

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.989
business and have people be able to work

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.180
from it and draw income yeah I mean

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.160

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.780
like that won't worry though Morgan I

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.549

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.210
many hello

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.060
have a seat but one thinks it was 2,500

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.319
a month yeah okay um even that though

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:33.319
dude is like your song here know if

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:34.550
you're selling beer out of there every

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.780
night and you get a couple you know

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.889
you're just you're having people do

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.330
shows there and stuff and you know a

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.289
recording pod if you sell like if you

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.479
have a night appear like a successful

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.030
bar makes at least a G every night yeah

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.979
man if I did the thing is who's gonna

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.479
who's one of mine who's gonna want to

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.069
man the bar night after night it's like

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.860
so we means fun manner keeping the idea

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.570
that spuds coming up with it I'm

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.550
piggybacking on it's basically having a

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.130
bar where there's just like in spud tell

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.150
me if I'm wrong but it's just the

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.150
podcasts are happening upstairs people

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.669
recording podcasts and it can play down

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.229
there's bands that can play down so just

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:28.580
like a little weird little bar where

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:45.349
people can go do like whatever calling

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:48.680
tom figure out still can do it one of

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.139
you Tom will give you the number I'm all

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.630
about 360 wins me and Bill a pure

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.570
Americana dude but sometimes seat and

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.949
rear sasaki head when you bring up

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:02.840
business stuff true though I have to

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.610
sift through the [ __ ] satanic

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:15.800
diatribe this is what I here's my here's

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.719
my perverse mutation on the idea is that

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:19.940
you construct like a clear almost like

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.070
peepshow booth and you can drink around

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.320
at live podcast as it goes on and just

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:32.570
listen in on YouTube clips is hilarious

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.659
and do the lore of having dudes like

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:36.639
Irby there

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:39.379
if people are like oh man like this is

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:49.429
where those guys hang out upstairs the

00:06:49.429 --> 00:07:23.259
cellar that'd be nice to put like to do

00:07:26.739 --> 00:07:29.329
we tried to put two people together put

00:07:29.329 --> 00:07:31.039
two plum comics together and just grease

00:07:31.039 --> 00:08:03.619
up like left and right now just making

00:08:03.619 --> 00:08:06.139
memories I'm talking about dude I want

00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:11.389
to set up setting up a bar that's a

00:08:11.389 --> 00:08:13.669
democratic cooperative would be the

00:08:13.669 --> 00:08:16.339
sickest [ __ ] thing in the world where

00:08:16.339 --> 00:08:23.419
it's like here's the rent twenty five

00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:24.469
hundred will have one of those like

00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:25.879

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:28.489

00:08:28.489 --> 00:08:30.589
every month yes you just have you got it

00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:32.180
we got a hit twenty-five hundred to keep

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.649
this place open and be able to come here

00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:35.689
and just [ __ ] around and do whatever we

00:08:35.689 --> 00:08:37.039

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:42.060
equipped with a 30 man [ __ ] squad you

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.500
could do show you could do open mics

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.630
there every single night and have a boy

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.510
funny you could get if you had a bunch

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.520
of dudes hanging out for like a year

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.710

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:00.930
pods pods going on upstairs this is this

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.120
a real comedy this is a real comedy

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:12.900
ludus we're talking about and then you'd

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.600
have to put yourself into it for like

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.750
five years for sure but it still would

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:23.970
it wouldn't be bad dude you do that then

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.670
you build a spot that's like now it's

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:30.030
[ __ ] up and going itself yes right so

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.160
then so you guys are you guys will be

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.080
old and then there'll be young dudes and

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.850
the funny wall you gotta go to probably

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.260
to funniest guys in the country at that

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.410
point pretty much yeah dude who else is

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.840
a comedy Luda Stevie you would buy those

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:50.910
it's only fueled by stills I'm talking

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.530
that's just podcasts I hear you that's

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.330
just podcast and it's still you know

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.000
like the medieval top-down business

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.329
model of like you know

00:10:58.329 --> 00:11:04.360
it's a kind of zero so it's kind of what

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.980
a national you want you want a

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:34.029
nationalist socialist you're gonna like

00:11:34.029 --> 00:11:36.009
dump like lite beer around the perimeter

00:11:36.009 --> 00:11:38.489
like garlic

00:11:38.489 --> 00:11:43.059
no my idea is that [ __ ] I lost my train

00:11:43.059 --> 00:11:43.360
of thought

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:54.009
yes my whole idea is to have it where

00:11:54.009 --> 00:11:56.259
just take out the zero sum 'no stuff

00:11:56.259 --> 00:11:57.610
like the top-down hierarchy of

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.019
traditional business models and be like

00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:00.489
alright here's a space we have to keep

00:12:00.489 --> 00:12:02.860

get a little bit of liquor sales that is

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.749
a business model just to hang a [ __ ]

00:12:58.749 --> 00:13:00.819
hanging flat like a swastika flag and

00:13:00.819 --> 00:13:02.230

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.820
be like naturally funny rather than

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.040

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:47.070
exactly that unless there is something

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:48.750
to be said for being adapted for the you

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.580

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.520
dropping a hard hard F there towards the

it's all you know it's a pipe dream

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:27.000
because my brother was the one who like

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.770
was in place for like a liquor license

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.050

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.090
saying that he was a through all his st.

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:36.120
satanic meant like meanderings it's like

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.310

give up the goods we don't know dude I

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.310

your brother was not he's not going to

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:44.520
give that up I don't think he but he's

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:45.810
not planning on doing it anyway

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:47.850
looks like yeah he might want the big

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:49.650
payoff he's going 20 there they're

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:50.850
putting him as like a fat cat

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:57.210

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:03.510
miners good [ __ ] they they had to

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.970
because this [ __ ] was gonna melt down

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:08.040
into the groundwater and just destroy

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.590

[ __ ] yeah it was like it's crazy and

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.100
they had to hire these coal miners to

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.910
dig underneath Chernobyl and block it

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.370
like set [ __ ] up under there so miners

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:31.170
went down there just like they're

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:32.520

camera in his name but he was saying

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.250
like they were doing like real accounts

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:12.450
from Native Americans who were in

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:14.400
battles with the like when the white dad

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.440
came and they're like we would fight

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.600

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.550
yeah so that they were coming down very

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:22.380

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:23.070
true

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:24.630
his paintings I think it's called the

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:27.029

later okay yeah I guess they all had

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.190
different rules but yeah fighting make

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:36.899

going to war that's like this you that's

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.980
all faster I would at least wear a cup

yeah we're in a cup I could fight naked

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.269
with a couple on and some compression

00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:53.820
shorts that's it I guess in that fight

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:58.769
that's UFC that was a good look it's

00:26:58.769 --> 00:27:00.570

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.250
hill on you that was a good almost

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.169
funnies are talking about the how

00:27:04.169 --> 00:27:06.029
they're attacking just like even the

00:27:06.029 --> 00:27:07.860
white dudes first had the they were calm

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:09.240
the guns you loaded from the front they

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.649
were like dude these guys these guns are

00:27:10.649 --> 00:27:11.879
[ __ ] [ __ ] and they would hit him

00:27:11.879 --> 00:27:13.320
with arrows come down [ __ ] it let him

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.610
shoot one and run down and beat him up

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:16.590
suddenly did like the circle they circle

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:18.090
their wagons that night yeah and they

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:20.549
want to converge on him and they they

00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:21.809
took and then they had the guns they

00:27:21.809 --> 00:27:23.370
loaded from the back and they shot much

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:25.049
fat and dude they were just like these

00:27:25.049 --> 00:27:26.460
guys in their heads were like we're the

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:27.720
best we're definitely under white these

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.639
guys out and it was like something as

00:27:29.639 --> 00:27:31.830
simple as like the what's it called

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:35.629
bolt-action rifle which is like pops pop

00:27:35.629 --> 00:27:40.950
like now okay like get in they were like

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.919
[ __ ] like I mean that's we lose

00:27:42.919 --> 00:27:44.820
historically that's happened every time

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.980
technology advances yeah World War one

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.659
they were doing cavalry charges into

00:27:48.659 --> 00:27:49.340
machine guns

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:52.320
like they can't reload let's go get them

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.519
just everyone died yeah how'd it go

00:27:56.519 --> 00:27:59.129
there like turns out they figured

00:27:59.129 --> 00:28:01.080
something out and we're [ __ ]

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.070
why don't we don't use lasers now I

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:06.870
doubt they're as effective that's all

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:09.269
laser dude we don't have laser guns yet

00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:10.679
you would stand in front of my laser

00:28:10.679 --> 00:28:14.700
oh we have high-powered laser like an

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.779
m16 yes I'll take a laser yeah you get

00:28:18.779 --> 00:28:20.370
shot with a laser dude I don't think so

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.649
I mean if I had my star here that was up

00:28:22.649 --> 00:28:24.559
to me neither

00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:28.620
no those laser stinkin no-good photonic

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.179
coming at you dude what do you know

00:28:30.179 --> 00:28:31.830
about lasers I don't I know the

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:33.149
government knows about dude I'm just

00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.960
waiting to hear that get the

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.760
Declassified really

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.070
there's laser guns without a doubt

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:39.690
they're working on that they have them

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:41.430
dude they saw Star Wars and they're like

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:43.650
we got to get that dude I mean they have

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:45.420
[ __ ] lasers for sure they have

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.370
high-powered lasers they just they leak

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:49.380
out there they're like 60 years ahead of

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:50.970
us right yeah and they're slowly like

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:52.820
all right like 5 G's about the drop

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.870
that's gonna be [ __ ] with that you

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:56.340
hear all we're fighting the who I or

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:58.020
whatever it's called no there's like the

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.000
big Chinese 5g company and we're like we

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.800
don't want them to set up our 5g

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.630
infrastructure it could be like riddled

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:05.040
with bugs and stuff yeah basically

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.110
Americans like we want to [ __ ] we

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:08.610
have better 5g all right test it out

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:11.850
it's all [ __ ] doesn't work really good

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:14.250
yeah so the Chinese actually have it are

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:15.840
they fibbin they fail it's the [ __ ]

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.310
apparently just like the British just

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:19.530
put it in out but they're like while the

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:21.030
Chinese install it they have to like

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.100
slowly like double check everything to

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.360
make sure there's no trapdoors but these

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.890
things Johnny are tricky things have to

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:27.600
be constantly updated so even if you

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.460
don't throw in some updates on you that

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.200
like you know if they're hacking snow

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.090
sneaks one little [ __ ] worm in the

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:34.350
system dude it's gonna be like reading

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:36.450
an Apple contract on the update there

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.070
guy I'm not reading all those terms

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:39.990
well you can't except if you if you want

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:31.980

morning when I couldn't sleep I woke

00:32:35.309 --> 00:32:37.619
over like seven listen to Trump yeah he

00:32:37.619 --> 00:32:40.980
had a speech in PA what do you say he

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.049
was just talking about how everybody in

00:32:43.049 --> 00:32:45.840
San Diego was like thank you begging for

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.700
a wall and then he built a wall and

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.009
they're all like well now you know now

00:32:50.009 --> 00:32:51.480
we have a problem with it but they're

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.009
really happy that they have it that's

00:32:53.009 --> 00:32:54.840
what Trump said yeah he's like they're

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.149
begging for the wall a while ago because

00:32:57.149 --> 00:32:58.919
there's so many illegal immigrants in

00:32:58.919 --> 00:32:59.730
San Diego

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:01.679
what is the wall do you think is just

00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:02.480
like a

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.160
like a construction grab I don't know

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.530
what the [ __ ] he's doing yeah it's like

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:09.120
what is the real reason behind it the

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.830
real reason behind keeping us now it's

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:13.680
an argument that's all that's all it is

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:14.940
same thing with abortion that they're

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.040
all doing trade abortion for a wall is

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:18.300
better I will keep wall will keep

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.160
abortion but we need a [ __ ] wall yeah

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.670
all right or no abortion no wall no

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:24.390
borders

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:27.570
yes no borders I just don't think he's

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:29.340
like and they're gonna build a wall and

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:30.330
it's like dude you don't think those

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:32.670
guys can get around a [ __ ] wall like

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:34.320
if you're pushing drugs through customs

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.110
and all this [ __ ] erecting a physical

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:38.610
barriers gonna be tough to break through

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:41.580
though unless they're gonna do are they

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.140
gonna do like deep foundation like forty

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:46.670
foot down foundation I mean dude I just

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:49.020
that's not gonna do anything I mean I

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:50.760
guess I mean if it's a wall as wallets

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.350
you know I just prevent illegal

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:55.320
immigrants yeah well that would help a

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.300
lot I'm sure wall a giant wall would

00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.610
definitely ruin a lot of people's plans

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:00.780
but the whole problem is they still

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:04.230
can't man big sections like off that

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:06.090
stretch all you gotta do is [ __ ] well

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:07.830
the more technology advances I bet you

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:11.460
can man pretty vast like [ __ ] drones

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.740
well they just fly drones I don't know

00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:15.210
cuz the wall all you have to do with the

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:17.130
wall I mean it's gonna be what you see

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:19.560
his original concept that was just like

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.980
Mars bars and yeah you do like all you

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.120
have to do is carry some sort I get

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.370
settling torch you'll burn that thing

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:28.080
down and boom right in there be so many

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.490
[ __ ] holes in that I mean again it'll

00:34:29.490 --> 00:34:31.620
slow you down you gotta set off camp

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:33.150
burn a little hit a little settling

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:34.620
torch to burn that or if it's like stone

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.560
you know I guess I hope you tough we

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.140
gotta get dragon stone you need to you

00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:42.180
wouldn't even [ __ ] like nice dragon

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:43.350
blow that thing open

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:45.330
just the Horde will come through there I

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:46.740
can do stone will be too expensive so

00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:47.700
it's gonna be like some sort of like

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.620
metal or concrete concrete you could

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.360
Jake your blast your way through that a

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.950
little bit of [ __ ] you're gonna bunch

00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:54.030
of people gonna be bombing this wall

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:57.150
constant [ __ ] you probably on our side

00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:59.010
this is tower defense drunk anti foul

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:00.360
anti files are gonna come down you think

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.040
there's some internal wall blockbusters

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.670
yeah some wall Buster's dude yeah dude

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:06.690
Trump daddy's playing the ultimate tower

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:09.870
defense dude he is though that's how

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:12.570
hard he's black no I watched his speech

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:15.000
I gave him too much credit for being

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:15.820
hilarious

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.100
well he misses a lot of jokes when he's

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.710
like I watched him this morning he was

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:22.810
bombing a little really yeah but he

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:24.400
can't but he's at that point where he's

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.120
it good enough

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.500
he's famous enough that he can't bomb

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.210
people still love him yeah but he's

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:29.620
missing some jokes I think he's gonna

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:30.250
win again

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:34.330
yeah you think he will thank you no I

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:37.000
think he will - honestly yeah

but people were voting today in Philly

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:45.460

you'd have to figure out a way to it

00:43:40.199 --> 00:43:41.309
would be like you've had like a little

00:43:41.309 --> 00:43:43.079
open mic people can you wear spaces in

00:43:43.079 --> 00:43:45.660
Philly it's in like West Philly close to

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:49.499
like Baltimore AB around there not bad

00:43:49.499 --> 00:43:54.209
though dude I love the al yeah it's not

00:43:54.209 --> 00:43:57.269
close it's not like Kensington yeah but

00:43:57.269 --> 00:43:58.410
I mean we could have still get a

00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:00.059
warehouse in Kensington and have like a

00:44:00.059 --> 00:44:02.069
a fort basically but you wouldn't have a

00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:03.960
bar you would have bar sales

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:05.820
being plugged into direct bar sales I

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.440
mean that's amazing be tight

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:11.280

[ __ ] [ __ ] and I still woke up and

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:56.800
was like let me take a pee let's lay

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.089
here for 10 minutes so I don't fall back

00:49:58.089 --> 00:50:08.200
asleep I did the same routine so I'm at

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:10.960
the making I wanted to make a concoction

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.940
cuz they say I wanted to try to make a

00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:14.710
glycerin tincture there's a lot of

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:16.660
people say that glycerin it doesn't

00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:19.060
absorb THC as much as like say you know

00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:20.770
at like grain alcohol ethanol yeah and

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:23.980
like fats absorbent too but a gling

00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:26.050
shinto glycerin tankers are nice because

00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:28.119
they were water soluble and you can put

00:50:28.119 --> 00:50:29.349
it in make a little drink and just shake

00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:31.300
it up and you have yourself like a you

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:32.290
just drop it in your drink at the bar

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:34.599
and drink it so I was try to make some

00:50:34.599 --> 00:50:35.740
of these I'm gonna try to make this [ __ ]

00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.630
but I was like I don't like the fact

00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:38.710
that it's not that absorb

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:40.089
they're like if they make weak tinctures

00:50:40.089 --> 00:50:41.619
it's kind of not really that absorb it

00:50:41.619 --> 00:50:43.270
and I was like I don't like that so I

00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:45.609
can I put I did like a grain alcohol

00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:47.440
quick wash where I just forget it real

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.940
cold and you shake it all up and it's

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:50.260
like five minutes and that strips the

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.030
plant it turns like an amber goo and

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:54.369
then I'd strain that out into the which

00:50:54.369 --> 00:50:57.130
I'm gonna call it into the glycerin so I

00:50:57.130 --> 00:50:58.750
was like I'm gonna like I'm gonna you

00:50:58.750 --> 00:51:01.210
know basically defy the laws of fluid

00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:03.310
dynamics and you know so I'm making this

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:05.050
[ __ ] up shaking it up then I was like if

00:51:05.050 --> 00:51:06.670
I put this all together then burn off a

00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:09.010
bunch of the alcohol in a crock-pot a

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:11.140
little bit of alcohol that's left there

00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:12.760
will still hold the THC and it's going

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:13.690
to the glycerin suppose if you

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:17.050
completely burn off the alcohol the we

00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:18.520
it would turn into like basically I said

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:20.020
it Rick Simpson oil yeah and it won't

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:21.430
blend with it'll turn it like a film

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:22.869
that sits on top so I'll leave a little

00:51:22.869 --> 00:51:24.190
bit of the alcohol and the glycerin

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:25.750
sweetness will hold hide the alcohol

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:28.150
bite so I do all this stuff I do it down

00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:30.760
and then I when I was all done I took a

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:32.980
big whiff of it dude I don't know what

00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:34.450
the [ __ ] was still in here if it was

00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:36.880
just like the because I think we boil

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:38.230
off ethanol and there's all these weird

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:39.820
other gases that are supposed to escape

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:41.080
and I don't think they really got to

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:43.390
escape that much I took a sniff of this

00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:45.609
thing when it was done in a jar and it

00:51:45.609 --> 00:51:48.580
literally I wasn't gonna drop a bottle

00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:49.930

00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:56.710
in my illustrious military career

00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:59.170

cuz I honestly remember having like an

00:58:40.869 --> 00:58:43.599
aversion to it man being like this is

00:58:43.599 --> 00:58:45.970
crazy I can't yeah I saw it on like I

00:58:45.970 --> 00:58:47.920
saw snippets online I was like I didn't

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.540
have older brothers Chinese older

00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:50.890
brothers to be a part of the bum fight

00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:53.589
world oh yeah to me I was like [ __ ] it

00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:55.480
that's a good idea then you think about

00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:58.270
it like if I were to be like the idea of

00:58:58.270 --> 00:58:59.770
fighting to homeless people now Mick

00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:01.330
I'll give you 20 bucks to beat the [ __ ]

00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:03.400
out of each other it's just like it'd be

00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:04.000
horrible

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.920
yeah but back then it was just like it

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:10.380
was almost like a dude the amount of

00:59:10.410 --> 00:59:12.940
cultural awareness in the last 20 years

00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:14.670
that's come to surface is like

00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:15.880
unbelievable

00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:18.790
yeah unlike you know the [ __ ] depths

00:59:18.790 --> 00:59:20.800
that people rose out of is like no

00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:22.510
unfortunately I think it kind of

00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:24.760
inverted back in with a lot of the SJW

00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.589
stuff where they're like they just want

00:59:26.589 --> 00:59:28.089
to do the [ __ ] up stuff but in a way

00:59:28.089 --> 00:59:30.310
that they feels like sanctified yeah but

00:59:30.310 --> 00:59:31.339
still it's like

00:59:31.339 --> 00:59:35.359
you know they that whole thing that like

00:59:35.359 --> 00:59:36.890
walk around me like you're [ __ ]

00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:39.259
[ __ ] and everyone is kind of like what

00:59:39.259 --> 00:59:41.089
well it's probably been yeah like now

00:59:41.089 --> 00:59:43.069
you can't do that I remember that I

00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:45.259
remember explaining to my friends like

00:59:45.259 --> 00:59:46.999
having some of my friends come up to

00:59:46.999 --> 00:59:48.769
Philly and be like you can't like they

00:59:48.769 --> 00:59:50.150
come up like who's this [ __ ] I'm like

00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:51.949
you can't he considered anymore and

00:59:51.949 --> 00:59:54.199
they're like why we're talking about I'm

00:59:54.199 --> 00:59:55.459
like II can't say [ __ ] and they're

00:59:55.459 --> 00:59:57.049
like what do you mean I can't say [ __ ]

00:59:57.049 --> 00:59:59.539
like it was just like you they were just

00:59:59.539 --> 01:00:01.429

01:00:01.429 --> 01:00:03.140
can't I like you just can't it's like

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:04.249
people don't like it but you can't say

01:00:04.249 --> 01:00:06.829
yeah yeah man it's like it turns out gay

01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:09.589
dudes had a rough time we didn't listen

01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:10.909
we didn't know they were having a rough

01:00:10.909 --> 01:00:13.099
time so now you can't really make fun of

01:00:13.099 --> 01:00:15.799
them because it was they they had a bad

01:00:15.799 --> 01:00:17.419
time they'd have a real bad time being

01:00:17.419 --> 01:00:21.309
gay was hard yeah man yeah and it's like

01:00:21.309 --> 01:00:23.390
how come there hasn't been any sort of

01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:26.509
like sick words that have stuck for

01:00:26.509 --> 01:00:26.929
white people

get people fired up come on as it gets

01:00:34.249 --> 01:00:35.839

with that see if you can shut up for a

01:01:17.689 --> 01:01:19.069
year let's all do when they talk about

01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:20.689
fair like when they brought up like the

01:01:20.689 --> 01:01:23.209
race for the Farrakhan Farrakhan what

01:01:23.209 --> 01:01:25.369
are you why would that suicidal to like

01:01:25.369 --> 01:01:26.989
just in the numbers alone to be like

01:01:26.989 --> 01:01:28.400
yeah we're gonna do a race war he's like

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.199
no that's [ __ ] it's not an option

01:01:30.199 --> 01:01:31.339
that's like yeah that's always bothered

01:01:31.339 --> 01:01:33.259
me when people have been like I think

01:01:33.259 --> 01:01:35.299
black people would win like what are you

01:01:35.299 --> 01:01:38.869
talking about yes first off not to be a

01:01:38.869 --> 01:01:41.529
psycho the race war happened with

01:01:41.529 --> 01:01:44.160
already where

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.829
[ __ ] slaves oh yeah what was it

01:01:46.829 --> 01:01:49.980
obviously there was a war you're talking

01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:51.930
about like the capture and sell the

01:01:51.930 --> 01:01:54.059
capture of slaves would totally colonize

01:01:54.059 --> 01:01:55.470
a con that wasn't a race war conserves

01:01:55.470 --> 01:01:57.240
cooperation on both sides

01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:59.520
there's traitors that doesn't mean it's

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.890
not a war I mean yeah yeah that's but no

01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:03.569
that wasn't like a rise up two sides

01:02:03.569 --> 01:02:04.859
right there was dudes chillin and they

01:02:04.859 --> 01:02:06.359
got ambushed and snuck up on and

01:02:06.359 --> 01:02:08.700
abducted that was an abduction of course

01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:10.859

it's just like Jesus Christ dude yeah I

01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:31.910
could be wrong I think I saw a preview

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:34.520
for it on Netflix there's a show or

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:37.190
movie on Netflix now about like black

01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:39.770
teens that discover time-travel in order

01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:42.619
to undo their friend getting murdered by

01:04:42.619 --> 01:04:46.550
the police oh really Jesus Christ I can

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:49.190
black superheroes yeah one goal is to

01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:53.900

01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:57.109
know who's trying to get in again I

01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:58.400
could be getting propagandize I can't

01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.599
trust any of the information but they

01:04:59.599 --> 01:05:02.030
were trying to say like the Obamas were

01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:03.440
getting like real into Netflix and like

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.720
Clinton was going after Facebook because

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.550
when Trump that when Trump dogs started

01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:10.339
like doing his thing I think it was like

01:05:10.339 --> 01:05:11.990
the Obamas kind of went into Netflix

01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:14.000
and Clinton was like well if I ran

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.290
Facebook started trying to get that

01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:16.760
started today Facebook can become like a

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.069
public utility if do did the cliff the

01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:20.869
Hilda hug got her hands on Facebook

01:05:20.869 --> 01:05:23.060
that'll be wild but yeah if a Netflix

01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:25.849
like was primarily like a sci-fi fantasy

01:05:25.849 --> 01:05:27.980
vêoc for a long time yeah if I'm not

01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:30.500
mistaken and it more politically again

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.720
that could have been just yeah exactly

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.240
it's like it's not even they might not

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:37.310
even have an agenda it's just like this

01:05:37.310 --> 01:05:39.380
is people love social justice right now

01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:41.000
most people don't though that's the

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:34.950
I was like if I was like yo there was

01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:36.480
some like weird looking [ __ ] like

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:38.250
Jewish lettering I need a [ __ ] run

01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:40.440
over that [ __ ] people like whoa yeah

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:44.070
well they might not who the libs the

01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:46.020
extreme libs they might be like yo cover

01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:48.300
that up yeah but the people you know the

01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:49.920
head the head of memoir would be like

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:51.420
wait you're not covering up our [ __ ]

01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:53.190
weird little tour letters dude Ramon

01:20:53.190 --> 01:20:55.680
yeah exactly if you're trying to like no

01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:57.000
I mean if you're trying to like cover

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.980
that up that's run by mostly Jewish

01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:00.060
people's you're not gonna rub the

01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:01.710
[ __ ] is that on is that unlike the

01:21:01.710 --> 01:21:03.810
mainline yeah it's on the mainline so if

01:21:03.810 --> 01:21:04.770
you're gonna talk about covering up

01:21:04.770 --> 01:21:06.450
Jewish letters you want to mention Jays

01:21:06.450 --> 01:21:09.840
people did bad way exactly good that's I

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:10.980
mean that's you know that's not even

01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:11.880
gonna happen when they were talking

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:13.320
about covering up the stigmata of like

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.330
yeah I mean like bond it's like what was

01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:16.830
the reasoning just because it is

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:18.510
Christian dude they're getting emails

01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:20.910
from the National Guard we get emails

01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:22.680
from the fantasise like 10 times about

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:23.820
joining the National Guard I keep being

01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:25.560
like I see that 20 you love jumping

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.180
jacks with groups I know I see that twit

01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:28.860
doesn't give you 20 G's and I'm like but

01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:30.930
then they can deploy then you'd be in a

01:21:30.930 --> 01:21:34.320
real fort finally get your I've already

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:35.370
overcome and dispel

01:21:35.370 --> 01:21:36.780
this fantasy in my head so many times

01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:38.820
gross I'm not [ __ ] doing postman I

01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:40.740
know I'll hate it don't do it the day

01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:42.300
someone tells me to do something in a

01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:46.770
mean way I'm what I have like it'll hit

01:21:46.770 --> 01:21:48.570
me and I just like when people directly

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:50.340
order me to do stuff my body this is

01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:54.000
like last point was like who's talking

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:59.370
shut up and I was just like it was like

01:21:59.370 --> 01:22:04.650
you can't talk watch me

01:22:04.650 --> 01:22:08.160
which is good yeah I would not like to

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:10.320
me they washed me out right away I

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:12.330
couldn't be in a fraternity dude I could

01:22:12.330 --> 01:22:15.630
but maybe that as it may there was

01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:17.490
people there one person specifically

01:22:17.490 --> 01:22:19.170
just being like why are we even getting

01:22:19.170 --> 01:22:22.560
emails from the military it's like what

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:24.120
like they wanted to block emails to the

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:25.860
military and cover up the stigmata dude

01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:27.480
it's like that's the wavelength I'm

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:28.770
along with people or I'm like you guys

01:22:28.770 --> 01:22:31.110
serious of this [ __ ] right now crazy

01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:31.680
dude

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:33.570
like they're offended by an email from

01:22:33.570 --> 01:22:35.130
the National Guard to be covering on the

01:22:35.130 --> 01:22:38.490
stigmata bothers me I was chained myself

01:22:38.490 --> 01:22:41.310
in front of st. Francis yeah he had to

01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:43.620
stake a lot of people yeah any little

01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:45.660
Stiggy a lot of people have the stake

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:48.000

remember his Padre Pio had holy gloves

01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:58.980
that if Padre Pio had uh I think it was

01:22:58.980 --> 01:22:59.700
Saint friend

01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:01.020
they were greeting those around there

01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:02.370
was a church circuit where they had

01:23:02.370 --> 01:23:04.110
Padre Pio's gloves and they were like

01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:05.700

01:23:17.790 --> 01:23:20.160

trash it's like I don't care if they

01:23:31.470 --> 01:23:32.550
wanted the color if they just want to

01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:33.660
like we're gonna cover all this and just

01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:34.800
paint some different [ __ ] I'd be like

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:35.910
yeah knock yourself out but they're like

01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:37.380
you gotta erase the stigmata it just

01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:39.150
bothers me I'm like I knew that [ __ ]

01:23:39.150 --> 01:23:41.730
then you're just kind of like no damn

01:23:41.730 --> 01:23:44.970
Charlottesville's wow dude that being

01:23:44.970 --> 01:23:46.830
just like people watching bunch of

01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:48.670
[ __ ] people are fighters [ __ ]

01:23:48.670 --> 01:23:51.219
guys in Virginia fighting each other

01:23:51.219 --> 01:23:53.739
they what happened was a bunch of [ __ ]

01:23:53.739 --> 01:23:56.199
guys brought torches and surrounded a

01:23:56.199 --> 01:23:58.660
statue and then other [ __ ] people

01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:00.880
showed up to fight him yeah well it's

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:05.250
also a [ __ ] lady got hit by a guy

01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:11.050
it's horrible that lady died it's

01:24:11.050 --> 01:24:15.400
horribly horrible but I mean over that

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:16.929
though there's people who got

01:24:16.929 --> 01:24:18.820
propagandized to the point where again

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:22.260
also - you cannot dispute cannot

01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:24.610
discount the idea that this was a

01:24:24.610 --> 01:24:27.429
heavily because Russia does this - they

01:24:27.429 --> 01:24:29.590
fund groups and throwing Agent

01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:31.210
Provocateur so there's like throw off

01:24:31.210 --> 01:24:33.219
and tire well you'll have dissenters you

01:24:33.219 --> 01:24:34.690
throw off enough provocateurs to wear

01:24:34.690 --> 01:24:35.860
that it just doesn't make if you're like

01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:37.960
what the [ __ ] is going on yeah dude it's

01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:40.420
just like the idea that there is dudes

01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:42.640
with tiki torches marching on a statue I

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:45.040
mean maybe they're real there's also a

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:46.330
chance that they were provocate there

01:24:46.330 --> 01:24:48.130
were just like there was some I don't

01:24:48.130 --> 01:24:50.170
know I do real

01:24:50.170 --> 01:24:52.480
everybody there was real dude there was

01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:53.920
big parts of black lives matter that

01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.840
were just Russian trolls know the

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:58.380
Russian trolls

01:24:58.380 --> 01:25:00.550
online and what they were doing was they

01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:02.320
were organizing it they were setting up

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:03.910
the meetings yeah they were like

01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:06.699
creating the meetups they were like

01:25:06.699 --> 01:25:08.620
setting up Facebook we've done that were

01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:10.630
like going interested that thing like an

01:25:10.630 --> 01:25:11.920
event page yeah and they would

01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:13.449
coordinate it so that they were at the

01:25:13.449 --> 01:25:15.790
same time as the dudes with the trash

01:25:15.790 --> 01:25:18.429
cans let's meet up there could have been

01:25:18.429 --> 01:25:20.170
something there physically there okay

01:25:20.170 --> 01:25:21.130
there could have been that there could

01:25:21.130 --> 01:25:22.330
have been a couple provocateurs there

01:25:22.330 --> 01:25:24.070
the first person to launch a thing and

01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:25.390
then they let everyone just kind of go

01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:27.850
into it it only takes like two agents to

01:25:27.850 --> 01:25:30.100
have like get it up let's [ __ ] do it

01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:31.510
again you can you can have people who

01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:32.860
are like so yeah set it up so they're

01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:33.400
both there

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:35.050
they have provocateurs on both sides

01:25:35.050 --> 01:25:36.850
getting both sides fired up and throwing

01:25:36.850 --> 01:25:38.650
troops [ __ ] ball people like [ __ ]

01:25:38.650 --> 01:25:40.210
yeah dude people were firing guns at

01:25:40.210 --> 01:25:42.820
that yeah man watch that it's Soviet you

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:44.920
see a fat [ __ ] a guy like reach he's

01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:47.290
so pumped to be able to do like what are

01:25:47.290 --> 01:25:49.750
they do what is going on my thing is I

01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:50.830
would love to be like what's your

01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:54.280
problem what's like what's your [ __ ]

01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:56.350
problem man yeah what's bothering pretty

01:25:56.350 --> 01:25:59.380
much you could say no they're not

01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:01.790
they're trying to destroy our history no

01:26:01.790 --> 01:26:03.440
they're not and then the other side

01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:05.210
would be like 30 they shouldn't have

01:26:05.210 --> 01:26:09.680
guns like yeah they should yeah you just

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:12.590
go home yeah man go do something soon as

01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:15.560
this is too funny and then it culminates

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.600
with a lady getting [ __ ] rocked by a

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:19.550
Dodge Charger tuned exactly it all

01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:21.260
culminates in a guy expects I got it

01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:24.800
that guy the level of like how much like

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:28.840
I'm going down in history nests of like

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:32.180
just no [ __ ] traffic and everyone's

01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:33.380
just like you killed a lady with your

01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:34.970
car you're [ __ ] your [ __ ] ass

01:26:34.970 --> 01:26:36.830
call you you're an idiot you're going to

01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:39.140
jail now I mean like dude people stop

01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:41.000
talking about oh yeah fairly that was

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.490
just like it's a flash in the pan nature

01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:45.200
of our digital society did and then

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:46.550
Trump was like there's bad people on

01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:48.830
both sides yeah he should have literally

01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:50.120
just been like everybody there was

01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:54.140
[ __ ] yeah the end of meeting next

01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:56.420
what's funny is like did you see that

01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:58.820
whole speech yeah I watched what it was

01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:00.950
it what was it like they were here to

01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:02.930
discuss something else yeah he had a

01:27:02.930 --> 01:27:04.220
meeting on something else so then

01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:05.330
there's just like four or five people

01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:07.460
standing behind him awkwardly that have

01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:08.870
nothing to do with this yeah people like

01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:11.180
well you just spell white nationalists

01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:13.340
and he's like yeah and they're like he

01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:15.470
refuses to just felt really it was

01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:16.880
quickly well that's I think when he said

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:18.380
they were bad guys on both did he say

01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:20.990
yes first like yeah I guess I think well

01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:22.940
they were trying to get him to fully be

01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:24.740
like this is the Wrights fault this is

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.450
the right wing's fault gotcha

01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:28.810
and of course he's purely like

01:27:28.810 --> 01:27:31.340
argumentative no matter what yeah he's

01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:33.410
in a competition no matter what so he

01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:35.660
sees the media asking him will you blame

01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:38.450
the right for this and he's like now

01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:41.480
everybody was bad yeah which is honestly

01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:44.510
somewhat the correct answer I thought

01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:46.640
that I thought that was a measured

01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.190
response there were bad people on many

01:27:49.190 --> 01:27:50.900
sides I was reading this book where they

01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:52.520
were like coming out basically being

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:54.050
like you know this is a book as the

01:27:54.050 --> 01:27:55.610
calling of the American mind and they

01:27:55.610 --> 01:27:57.020
were like basically saying how at the

01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:58.340
universities is all this [ __ ] or

01:27:58.340 --> 01:27:59.900
kind of like going to the wayside and

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:01.730
it's like kind of ruining education but

01:28:01.730 --> 01:28:04.400
that guy was like yeah but Trump dropped

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:05.840
the ball in terms of not condemning

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:07.970
white supremacist and I was like yeah

01:28:07.970 --> 01:28:10.400
yeah he did he did avoid to do it it'd

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:12.000
be so easy to be an impress calm

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.200
again I might I don't have the pressure

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:15.060
of the nation only but it's like dick

01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:16.050
yeah if you're a white supremacist

01:28:16.050 --> 01:28:17.520
you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] we all know

01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:19.500
this yeah but those guys who are like

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:21.180
throwing rocks at other P was saying

01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:22.470
there was people who were like not like

01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:25.400
Nazis who were there it's also like dude

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.420

01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:28.890
statue anywhere I'm like all right

01:28:28.890 --> 01:28:31.950
whatever yeah although the Kate Smith

Bless America before Flyers games uh and

01:28:39.810 --> 01:28:44.450
she had a she had what I believe was a

01:28:44.450 --> 01:28:47.640
satirical song right right right like

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:50.760
and it took me and my roommate like five

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:53.880
minutes to look this up yeah listen to

01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:56.880
the song it's like that's why [ __ ]

01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:59.730
were born to do all the work it was sad

01:28:59.730 --> 01:29:01.860
but yet it was like clearly she was

01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:04.320
making funny all healed good good yeah

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:07.110
she was making fun of the way people

01:29:07.110 --> 01:29:10.470
thought yeah and then I think she was

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:13.950
like giving speeches in like the 40s

01:29:13.950 --> 01:29:17.010
that were like don't be racist didn't

01:29:17.010 --> 01:29:18.600
like the 40 they knocked down her statue

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:20.190
and then they heard that somebody

01:29:20.190 --> 01:29:24.330
brought up that old song mob mentality

01:29:24.330 --> 01:29:26.520
of like took it down to [ __ ] it tear it

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:30.060
down that's [ __ ] weird yeah yeah

01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:32.150
that's bizarre dude dude I was like she

01:29:32.150 --> 01:29:34.950
from what I gathered I could be wrong on

01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:36.830
this yeah she seemed pretty like

01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:40.050
incredibly progressive for that time

01:29:40.050 --> 01:29:40.500
period

01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:42.600
yeah to go give like a speech against

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:44.340
racism in nineteen forty then they

01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:48.360
[ __ ] tear like wait what they scroll

01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:50.490
for three seconds it's like holy [ __ ]

01:29:50.490 --> 01:29:52.320
but if you understand the fact that she

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.790
was making fun of people's thought

01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:55.470
process back then if you look at it in

01:29:55.470 --> 01:29:58.020
context yeah Jesus place the white man

01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:00.390
can't work he's too frail and frit like

01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:02.670
he's too delicate black man her [ __ ]

01:30:02.670 --> 01:30:05.010
were born to mend the fields for the

01:30:05.010 --> 01:30:07.200
white man like she was making fun of it

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.760
yeah I don't know if he was out of

01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:10.410
context did the unless she wasn't and

01:30:10.410 --> 01:30:11.790
then that's the most racist song I've

01:30:11.790 --> 01:30:12.969
ever heard

01:30:12.969 --> 01:30:16.190

such a that's such a weird thing to

01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:28.730
concentrate the black and white battle

01:31:28.730 --> 01:31:31.099
into that word basically like a lot of

01:31:31.099 --> 01:31:32.900
the energy from that goes into that one

01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:35.030

real problems from like slavery and all

01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:47.599

01:31:47.599 --> 01:31:49.309
track of who says the n-word and where

01:31:49.309 --> 01:31:50.540

money come on you ain't give me money

01:31:59.659 --> 01:32:02.210
yet me down gang is let me know what you

01:32:02.210 --> 01:32:03.679
need me to do yang if you get this

01:32:03.679 --> 01:32:05.139
transmission dude I will absolutely

01:32:05.139 --> 01:32:09.050
provocateur yang will not be in the

01:32:09.050 --> 01:32:11.030
Democratic primary he won't even make it

01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:12.920
to that he'll get to he gets to debate

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:14.389
though on the mainstage he just won't if

01:32:14.389 --> 01:32:17.510
you get one percent of the he will drop

01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:20.150
out before the DEM he won't drop it you

01:32:20.150 --> 01:32:21.590
think he'll get dropped or hold drop

01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:24.380
he'll job yang won't fold he will he

01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:26.179
won't personally fold but if he gets

01:32:26.179 --> 01:32:26.670
fine

01:32:26.670 --> 01:32:28.590
the whole half twofold otherwise it's a

01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:30.120
true it's just a waste I think he's

01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:31.590
gonna get bought out I don't think

01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:32.790
you're gonna get bought out but it's

01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:34.199
just like do I want to keep funneling a

01:32:34.199 --> 01:32:35.489
hundreds of thousands of dollars into

01:32:35.489 --> 01:32:39.090
this campaign I think he's doing it with

01:32:39.090 --> 01:32:41.100
like not a lot of money though that's

01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:42.630
probably why he's not gonna win make

01:32:42.630 --> 01:32:46.110
sure that but but in the age of the

01:32:46.110 --> 01:32:47.670
internet dude if it I don't know it's

01:32:47.670 --> 01:32:49.679
like no one's gonna need a good tweak um

01:32:49.679 --> 01:32:51.239
any hi I've been checking his likes and

01:32:51.239 --> 01:32:55.020
retweets and they are low it's what he

01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:56.280
even said he goes I don't expect to win

01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:57.750
at all but he's like if I even enter

01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:59.070
this thing into the discourse and have

01:32:59.070 --> 01:33:00.719
someone take the torch and hold it

01:33:00.719 --> 01:33:06.320
take the old Tiki Eddie I mean area

01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:09.780
defend the status defend the Stonewall

01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:11.850
Jackson so yeah it just sucks though the

01:33:11.850 --> 01:33:13.650
bottom line is now like if you want it

01:33:13.650 --> 01:33:15.890
to walk around the tiki torch you can't

01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:18.900
you gotta fix that thing in the ground

01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:21.660
hard I'm with you on the statues aspect

01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:24.650

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:51.449
time that could be his kryptonite I

01:33:51.449 --> 01:33:53.130
could be I could [ __ ] him if he's

01:33:53.130 --> 01:33:56.390
outwardly homophobic every debate yeah

01:33:56.390 --> 01:34:00.560
that could could galvanize the country

01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:07.560

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:09.300

01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:58.110
they love that anyway I was gonna get to

01:35:58.110 --> 01:36:00.469
the point that the gay dude was like

01:36:00.469 --> 01:36:02.699
talking [ __ ] on Andrew Jackson and

01:36:02.699 --> 01:36:04.920
Thomas Jefferson and I was just like

01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:08.070
yeah you know I guess I don't give a

01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:09.989
[ __ ] oh for sure I mean I mean

01:36:09.989 --> 01:36:13.860
Jefferson's the man but yeah if you toss

01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:15.330
in the fact that like Andrew Jackson

01:36:15.330 --> 01:36:18.120
might a genocided kind of did went down

01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:20.070
genocide engines decided pretty hard

01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:22.530
it's like he Jackson yeah [ __ ] him he

01:36:22.530 --> 01:36:24.690
like killed his killed his political

01:36:24.690 --> 01:36:26.940
political rivals just dude that was also

01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:28.170
like you had a bunch of [ __ ] dudes

01:36:28.170 --> 01:36:29.489
living in the woods at the time exactly

01:36:29.489 --> 01:36:31.500
I mean at the time yes you could

01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:34.680
genocide at the time but it's also like

01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:38.219
yet do we need to hang pictures of them

01:36:38.219 --> 01:36:41.310
now still [ __ ] it there was a part of me

01:36:41.310 --> 01:36:43.230
that yeah I mean normally when it comes

01:36:43.230 --> 01:36:45.060
to historical [ __ ] like like tearing

01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:46.440
down Confederate statues I'm kind of

01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:48.900
like that those guys did some or just

01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:51.510
[ __ ] keep the statue like here just

01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:53.010
update the info like this this is what

01:36:53.010 --> 01:36:53.789
this guy

01:36:53.789 --> 01:36:57.030
remember this yeah this is what this guy

01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:57.329
did

01:36:57.329 --> 01:36:59.579
yeah you can't I mean again this is just

01:36:59.579 --> 01:37:01.289
the mistake of Christianity how it kind

01:37:01.289 --> 01:37:02.429
of you know we're in a Christian nation

01:37:02.429 --> 01:37:05.309
and Christianity tries to wash out the

01:37:05.309 --> 01:37:07.500
aspect of evil and it's like let's see

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:09.090
what are you talking about I'm a duelist

01:37:09.090 --> 01:37:11.340
dude you're crazy I'm a duelist dude

01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:13.409
good and evil good thing for an equal

01:37:13.409 --> 01:37:17.519
plane also choose a life Alice's on evil

01:37:17.519 --> 01:37:20.070
how dare you know it doesn't focus on it

01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:22.019
reminds you of your evil pass wait who

01:37:22.019 --> 01:37:23.250
told you this nonsense

01:37:23.250 --> 01:37:25.199
what dualism dude who told you this

01:37:25.199 --> 01:37:28.110
Christianity avoids discussing evil it

01:37:28.110 --> 01:37:29.960
doesn't maybe these weird Protestant

01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:31.800
Christianity you want to talk

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:33.929
Catholicism Christianity elevates the

01:37:33.929 --> 01:37:35.639
good above evil whereas most other

01:37:35.639 --> 01:37:38.610
religions hold them on a the same plane

01:37:38.610 --> 01:37:40.079
of good and evil and you know you could

01:37:40.079 --> 01:37:41.519
pick one or the other but they're both

01:37:41.519 --> 01:37:43.949
on the same there you know mirror images

01:37:43.949 --> 01:37:45.119
of each other there's not like good

01:37:45.119 --> 01:37:46.409
prevails it's like no there's always

01:37:46.409 --> 01:37:47.699
good and evil and it's like you should

01:37:47.699 --> 01:37:49.320
do your best is it good but the evil is

01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:51.059
always gonna be there Christianity tried

01:37:51.059 --> 01:37:52.380
to push it towards like good boy always

01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:53.039
prevails

01:37:53.039 --> 01:37:56.309
I mean who told you this I don't believe

01:37:56.309 --> 01:37:56.579
it

01:37:56.579 --> 01:37:58.289
it's just think about it think about

01:37:58.289 --> 01:38:00.690
what they teach I don't know I think the

01:38:00.690 --> 01:38:02.429
Catholic Church is pretty high on evil

01:38:02.429 --> 01:38:04.619
they believe in like [ __ ] demons yeah

01:38:04.619 --> 01:38:07.829
they do but gargoyles yes they don't put

01:38:07.829 --> 01:38:09.030
them on equal it's like they're below

01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:12.570
like yeah Lucifer everybody the ancient

01:38:12.570 --> 01:38:14.579

01:38:14.579 --> 01:38:16.199
light and dark and it's like they're in

01:38:16.199 --> 01:38:17.789
