00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.140
pool I was out of the pool swimming

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.839

00:09:04.839 --> 00:09:06.670
Bluetooth in between them they both laid

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.330
out on it like they were Sun Tanning and

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.570

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:52.540

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.440
jeep and you feel like a real I like to

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.800
listen to my music loud you know me but

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.940
driving with the Jeep you feel like a

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.060
real [ __ ] yeah it's a weird blasting

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:19.660
rap

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.579
that's a weird disclaimer you probably

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:22.810
want to put off to every single person

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.060
you pull up next to be a guy someone

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.560
gave this to me I'm not you know you

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.529
know identity heaps are fun to drive

00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:30.760
though dude I drove one for a while

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.770
jeeps are awesome they are pretty tight

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.170
man as your as automatic or stick

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:38.800
automatic start yeah that's what I asked

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.390
dude I couldn't drive stick I'd be

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.880
[ __ ] stalling out there's the least

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.620
Jeep that's the least salt like thing

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.020
you can do especially stalled out be

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:50.320
like you should stall out and just flip

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:55.570
your own Jeep over but yeah oh my god

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.760
dude we have a situation on our hands

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.470
what's the search you got an interview

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.660
McAfee oh yeah

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.360
March 3rd minute I think I think March

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.709
30 if they're gonna start doing the

00:11:05.709 --> 00:11:06.860
interviews cuz I think he's an

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.510
a couple people or not interviewed by a

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:15.260
few dude what do you know of him so I

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.300
did it's all good

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:21.320
Kizer distill easy yeah dude true that

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.570
is ominous

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.980
it is like I think I might have said it

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.150
earlier it's weird to be down here

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:30.020
during like a crisis yeah this is

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.830
literally I went I went down to watch

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.240
the sunset last night it was just a

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.600
packed bar just [ __ ] totally packed I

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.140
just drove past it like nope yeah you no

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.900
one here gives a [ __ ] at all you know

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.340
again it doesn't really spread in the

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.130
warm weather apparently that's why I

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:50.600
didn't show too lame in Africa that's

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.700
why people are saying it doesn't fake

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.390
black people

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.190
feels like an Africa the virus is kind

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:58.670
of weak it thrives in the over my corner

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:00.290
I think it's I don't know because I

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:04.580
think nobody's visiting Africa the way

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:08.600
they are Europe and the United States

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.660
yeah maybe but pushing out still pushing

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.880
out and I'm pretty sure Africa doesn't

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.260
have a lot of geezers I think the

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:16.610
majority of their population is very

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.550
young true that's you know I mean yeah

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:22.850
but I have heard from a scientist that

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:24.770
warm weather it doesn't stand up well

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.690
against warm weather okay

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.150
they posted on row knees in the lab so

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.190
you should be safe Barclays might you

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.560
might have died when Barclays like right

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.940
before he got real close to you they

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.320
might have hit the warm weather and died

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.150
before it got in you I was I actually

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.190
was the one who suggested to Berkeley

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.470

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.110
one who suggested let's let's not touch

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:52.940
your Synod you said that's a search I

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.800

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.300
going to touch you or like a stroke

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.890

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:06.170
I he's very mad the more we talk about

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:08.150
the more the closer I think I have to

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.140
being Donald Trump

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.070

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.360
like a slaughterhouse and be like well

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.909
this is filthy and I would agree true

00:17:58.909 --> 00:18:01.100
but I think the problem lies when you're

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.320
mixing animals together like that also

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.740
if anybody if anybody wants to talk [ __ ]

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.869
it's like I will go get some entrails

00:18:08.869 --> 00:18:10.669
and put them in like a plastic cooler

00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:12.529
and I'll try to sell them on the street

00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:15.139
we'll see how well I do you know we'll

00:18:15.139 --> 00:18:17.149
come and yell at me what the party break

00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:18.769
them out break them out at work if any

00:18:18.769 --> 00:18:21.259
of you have bring work to lunch just

00:18:21.259 --> 00:18:23.749
bring a cooler full of like cat's guts

00:18:23.749 --> 00:18:29.360
start [ __ ] slurping them up I'm gonna

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.799
bring a whole animal to work and

00:18:30.799 --> 00:18:34.669
disembowel it let's go to the break and

00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:37.519
it's butchered yeah I don't want a

00:18:37.519 --> 00:18:41.840
squirrel just dig into it like

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.789
disembowel an animal next time I next

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:45.619
job I get I'm gonna go just bring a full

00:18:45.619 --> 00:18:47.960
animal like what it must taste so bad

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.279
like I've seen that I've seen a couple

00:18:49.279 --> 00:18:50.929
videos that people just munching like

00:18:50.929 --> 00:18:53.980
raw animals it must be so [ __ ] gross

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.840
yeah yeah but I think in you have to be

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.509
so hung quo cuz I was still reading that

00:18:59.509 --> 00:19:02.929
book about the Lost Boys and they would

00:19:02.929 --> 00:19:04.639
be like wandering for like ten days or

00:19:04.639 --> 00:19:06.649
whatever was five six days and then

00:19:06.649 --> 00:19:07.999
somebody would shoot an elephant in the

00:19:07.999 --> 00:19:09.350
distance and they'd like little boys

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:10.519
would run up and just pull the

00:19:10.519 --> 00:19:12.350
elephant's kid open and start eating its

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.779
raw elephant meat and they were so

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:16.360
hungry they're like this [ __ ] is good

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.919
well weren't they isn't that discusses

00:19:18.919 --> 00:19:20.929
is that kind of fiction that Booker is

00:19:20.929 --> 00:19:23.749
that nonfiction it's based the authors I

00:19:23.749 --> 00:19:26.240
mean I'm sure that's like a he said it's

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.830
a queer Demeter's taking liberties with

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.470
elephant munching no I don't think so I

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.059
think it's like a conglomeration of a

00:19:32.059 --> 00:19:33.980
bunch of people's stories as told

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.720
there's one guy who like he said he

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.269
based most of it most of it off of but

00:19:38.269 --> 00:19:40.070
he said like it's been the narrative is

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:41.570
fictional but like the little tails a

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.389
toe I think are based off people saying

00:19:43.389 --> 00:19:46.759
what a guy the guy himself it's based

00:19:46.759 --> 00:19:48.679
off of loosely said that a lot of them

00:19:48.679 --> 00:19:51.289
exaggerate how crazy the [ __ ] was so

00:19:51.289 --> 00:19:54.649
they could get citizenship but these

00:19:54.649 --> 00:19:56.269
guys definitely just walking that far

00:19:56.269 --> 00:19:58.539
sucks they did walk

00:19:58.539 --> 00:20:00.789
yeah and there probably wasn't a ton of

00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:03.759
food yeah yeah they munched health like

00:20:03.759 --> 00:20:05.769
straight from the out ripped it open ate

00:20:05.769 --> 00:20:07.839
it they would climb up trees and take

00:20:07.839 --> 00:20:09.639
birds like eggs and eat the shells and

00:20:09.639 --> 00:20:13.239
everything did it's [ __ ] nuts that's

00:20:13.239 --> 00:20:14.769
what that's what we fueling me through

00:20:14.769 --> 00:20:16.029
this thing I go to the grocery store I'm

00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:17.229
like I kind of hope we run out of a

00:20:17.229 --> 00:20:18.909
decent amount of food just a lot cuz I

00:20:18.909 --> 00:20:21.339
got like nuts dried fruit I'm like I'm

00:20:21.339 --> 00:20:22.869
gonna be a lost boy for like two weeks I

00:20:22.869 --> 00:20:25.839
think I'll kick out I got like two cans

00:20:25.839 --> 00:20:29.259
of SpaghettiOs box of Cheerios

00:20:29.259 --> 00:20:33.309
that's your rash I'm set now I only deal

00:20:33.309 --> 00:20:39.639
in foods that end with o's now I got a I

00:20:39.639 --> 00:20:42.609
got some turkey some cheese some bread I

00:20:42.609 --> 00:20:46.959
got some Pete PB&J you also you're also

00:20:46.959 --> 00:20:48.999
in a hotel so it's like they have to

00:20:48.999 --> 00:20:52.089
tend to you if you get mandated to stay

00:20:52.089 --> 00:20:53.559
there they're mandated to court like

00:20:53.559 --> 00:20:54.669
they have to come clean your room every

00:20:54.669 --> 00:20:56.079
day they have to keep everything right

00:20:56.079 --> 00:20:57.609
they did just clean my room just now

00:20:57.609 --> 00:21:00.759
which is nice yeah how's that worked oh

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:02.079
sorry it's like living with mommy and

00:21:02.079 --> 00:21:04.659
daddy dude mommy just comes in and

00:21:04.659 --> 00:21:05.979
cleans my room and then I go back to

00:21:05.979 --> 00:21:08.679
[ __ ] [ __ ] around there's there's

00:21:08.679 --> 00:21:10.089
like strict rules you can get yelled at

00:21:10.089 --> 00:21:13.359
in trouble how's that work if you get

00:21:13.359 --> 00:21:14.649
long if you go on lockdown while you're

00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:16.269
in a hotel what do they do

00:21:16.269 --> 00:21:20.499
you're not allowed to leave I bet it

00:21:20.499 --> 00:21:22.359
well I don't think it's gonna be like

00:21:22.359 --> 00:21:24.939
you have to lock down where you live I

00:21:24.939 --> 00:21:26.619
don't think it's gonna be like that but

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:28.389
yeah but if they do lockdown they can't

00:21:28.389 --> 00:21:31.149
force you out okay I bet they can I bet

00:21:31.149 --> 00:21:33.939
they can you think I don't think these

00:21:33.939 --> 00:21:37.089
people at the Laureate will give a [ __ ]

00:21:37.089 --> 00:21:39.729
I don't know if it's like a chain I

00:21:39.729 --> 00:21:42.099
don't know yeah this is just one private

00:21:42.099 --> 00:21:43.749
hotel they might honestly just be like

00:21:43.749 --> 00:21:45.399
dude get the [ __ ] out of here where do

00:21:45.399 --> 00:21:46.539
you think yeah we're about to all leave

00:21:46.539 --> 00:21:47.859
so there's gonna be nothing here for a

00:21:47.859 --> 00:21:51.279
while that would also be kind of sick I

00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:52.869
don't know they might be able to get

00:21:52.869 --> 00:21:54.669
subsidized temporarily by the government

00:21:54.669 --> 00:21:56.370
to stay open

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:59.200
keep you sheltered room service every

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.770
need to give me shelter and room service

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:05.830
but uh I back to knock le no I don't

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.830
know I don't know I know he's he started

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:11.799
the virus thing right yeah and iris

00:22:11.799 --> 00:22:13.659
yeah was it Norton Mackey for now and

00:22:13.659 --> 00:22:18.789
even activate yeah and then he went down

00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:21.720
to like Central America South America

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.070
yes I think South believes wherever that

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:28.360
is South okay and then he started like

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.250
somebody told me he was getting like he

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.799
had the locals like taking shits on him

00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:34.750
so that's from the show time died this

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:39.270
is what I ran out by people with guns so

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:42.190
the Showtime documentary I just thought

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:43.510
he was like went down there got a bunch

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:45.880
of [ __ ] he got in trouble there's a

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.440
Showtime documentary out there who pins

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.950
him as a murderer and rapist and he

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:53.350
claims that it's just the the believing

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.419
yeah it's a strong there's a strong one

00:22:55.419 --> 00:22:58.029
his strong accusation strong acted but

00:22:58.029 --> 00:22:59.440
the bleep he claims the bleeding

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.149
government is propagandizing his name

00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:03.580
lying on him because he didn't pay them

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:04.690
off they were like you know give us two

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:06.159
million dollars for like our campaign

00:23:06.159 --> 00:23:08.049
he's like [ __ ] you and he's claiming

00:23:08.049 --> 00:23:09.640
that they met up a documentary about him

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.990
getting his mouth [ __ ] in through

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:13.419
hammock all the girls said they cut open

00:23:13.419 --> 00:23:14.679
the hammock and [ __ ] through the hammock

00:23:14.679 --> 00:23:17.590
into his mouth and then his he had a

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:21.340
lady there who was like [ __ ] tough

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.740
accusation I know and that's a

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.059
government agency making that up

00:23:25.059 --> 00:23:27.250
that's so funny like the minister of

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:30.549
believes to be like a CodeRed will say

00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:32.200
we had lady [ __ ] in his mouth or a

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:32.740
hammock

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:37.600
that's weird propaganda but yeah he had

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.029
a partner he had a lab down there where

00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:43.210
he was apparently making like natural

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:45.070
pharmaceuticals for he was trying to

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:49.679
make take like organic material and make

00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:52.330
antibiotics from it and he had his lady

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:54.640
who was you know a hot young lady it was

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.070
apparently leading the lab and nothing

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:59.500
ever came of it and then he started

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.360
getting weirder a like tied in with the

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.130
gangs he had like beefs of people it was

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:05.380
weird then that lady out of nowhere was

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.059
just like you know he was getting

00:24:07.059 --> 00:24:08.600
weirder and weirder and then like

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.770
wanted to leave because he was lying

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:13.130
about the stuff in the lab and then he

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:14.960
told me I like basically she went to I

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.160
was like [ __ ] you I'm out of here and

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.020
then he gave you a glass of orange juice

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.240
just like in after a heated argument was

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.830
like here have some orange juice she's

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.690
like like an idiot I drank it I think it

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:25.490
was laced I don't remember anything and

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:26.900
I remember him just like raping me

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.970
basically I like ran away screaming

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:32.480
bloody so her stories is weird I will

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.850
say this it is a weird story to be like

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:37.820
I mean I just like up and moved and have

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.090
a lab in a shack in Belize first of all

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:42.220
huh

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.780
it's [ __ ] weird I was like okay

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.450
whatever and then you know he's if he's

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:50.090
a shaman dude dude so this is the other

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:51.830
thing there was maybe he's an actual

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.720
shaman maybe he's living the dream so

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.550
before the thing you did miss about him

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:57.890
according the Showtime doc well after he

00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:59.420
got done with mcafee he went and started

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.490
a yoga retreat when he sold it so he was

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:03.650
like a guru for a while and then he just

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:05.090
up and stopped that was like [ __ ] this

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:08.750
and I went to bun thit believes so then

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:09.890
he went to Belize and then there was

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:11.510
things there was a post apparently that

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.550
was traced to him or he detailed the

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:14.960
ingredients to I think like it's called

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.200
MVPD it's like a designer drug it's like

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.790
a bath salt so it's like meth but it

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:23.930
makes you super [ __ ] horny and it was

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:25.580
saying that he was like no I wrote that

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:26.960
post as a joke he was just down there

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.150
making meth that makes you horny that's

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:34.190
a theory and it's also well it's kind of

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:36.620
if you watch a documentary it makes the

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:37.850
most sense that they were down there

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:39.650
since I thought like synthesizing a

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:43.660
weird like chem sex drug because they um

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:48.810
proper self-knowledge I mean that sounds

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:50.940
reasonable but then you get to then I

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:53.610
don't know I mean whatever dude

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:55.170
that's a good party trick though after

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:56.970
sex if you totally swab the deck dude

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:58.080
chicks would love that

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:01.080
I've known I've heard two stories of two

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.900
different guys that have come on someone

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.670
and then licked it off of them that's

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:10.260
how you do it dude and that's a wild

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.660
move I think girls would like that if

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:15.780
you clean them up I think I've heard

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.370
they don't like that

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:20.340
if you lick your okay I think they're

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.500
it's very it's a very jarring experience

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:28.440
I got this also who the [ __ ] is still is

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:32.400
that horny then after they come that's

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.660
when you're supposed to be thinking the

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.810
clearest hell owns the most horny but

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:38.040

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:48.810
of them was the barn dog and I could be

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:49.950
wrong about that okay

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:52.080
Iran he wouldn't mind if he turned out

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.940
if I know if he was rumored that he was

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:55.170
a commie - I don't think he would find

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:59.520
it too hard I I don't I can I can safely

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.860

are pretty close to that I would say

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:35.930
swingers are like the threshold between

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:38.059
being gay and bisexual and strangers so

00:41:38.059 --> 00:41:39.769

that Roman Polanski raped her she was 13

00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:17.120
