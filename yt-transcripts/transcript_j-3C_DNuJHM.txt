00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:32.560
dude

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.480
but the funny part is you know

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.880
lewis and dave are gonna agree with us

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.040
yeah like they're like this is weird

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.399
they're gonna be like this is weird that

00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:41.680
you're this upset

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.480
on a bet you made yeah somehow that that

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.880
point's been lost a thousand times

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.639
somehow he doesn't

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:50.320
piece that together he levied the

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.560
challenge and then i think the bet

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.560
i think you made the wager but he was he

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.800
levied the challenge as like we'll do it

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.000
blah blah blah and you're like two on

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
two then 2003 is definitely handshake

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.079
yeah so the bet was made for sure lewis

00:14:02.079 --> 00:14:03.920
was the one who made the bet true lewis

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.680
goes two on two

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.959
yeah he's like are you serious you're

00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:08.240
right you're right a thousand bucks and

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.720
jay goes oh absolutely perfect deal yes

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.880

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.760
an unlisted youtube video from like

research this is all fake

00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:49.600
yeah that's a good idea we should all do

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.880
that we should first of all we should

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.279
just nix this whole segment everyone

00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:54.640
needs to see this but everyone delete

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.320
this in like 50 years yeah and we can

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.000
all come out and be like

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.360
none of us are watching porn because

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.799
they're all going to see our yeah it's

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:02.159
it's they're going to see our internet

00:30:02.159 --> 00:30:03.200
history

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.120
i'm going to stand by a lot of it so why

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.799
boy so actually you know what once a

00:30:06.799 --> 00:30:08.080
week i'm gonna there's gonna be

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.000
something i would totally disavow

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.320
there's hundreds of instances of just

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.240
something that i would i fully regret i

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.440
think here's the thing though i think

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.640
it'll be

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.200
i think that will be when all sexual

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.279
taboo will drop because everyone's going

00:30:21.279 --> 00:30:22.640
to be able to go into everyone else's

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.960

them breaks too it's like what the

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.720

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.839

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.000
people that they they get it's a daycare

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.440
who you gotta you gotta find the

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.119
headlines i know i've talked about like

00:35:11.119 --> 00:35:13.040
who's the one who made this choice we've

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.119
talked did they ever tell you who's the

00:35:15.119 --> 00:35:16.800
decider so they they go back and forth

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.160
they say we're following the health

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.640
department but then they also said but

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.400
we also get we get to choose what

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.680
policies we implement they give you a

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.119
little razzle dazzle so it's tough to

00:35:25.119 --> 00:35:26.320
nail them down

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.160
but dude they're saying so now they're

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.599
like there's been an exposure in the

00:35:29.599 --> 00:35:31.680
two-year-old class so either you

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.000
quarantine for five days or your kid can

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.400
come in but the school has to test them

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.800
nasal swab every day for five days a

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.079
two-year-old doesn't understand what's

00:35:40.079 --> 00:35:42.000
happening they're getting a thing jammed

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.119
like you get it you know you know you

00:35:43.119 --> 00:35:44.160
know how it feels it's [ __ ]

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.160
uncomfortable so you go in and they jam

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.280
your kid

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.720
right up the nose for five days in a row

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.839
it's like the kid's gonna terrify the

00:35:49.839 --> 00:35:51.440
[ __ ] kid like well that's why they

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.040
give the option it's like

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.000
you guys shouldn't even be thinking

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.599
about jamming those little guys dude

00:35:55.599 --> 00:35:57.520
yeah so all right let him stay home fair

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.640
enough or just ask the parents

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.920
yeah if you give an option how about a

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.280
third option but yo do you guys give a

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.119
[ __ ] and the parent's like no 87 percent

00:36:05.119 --> 00:36:07.119

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.480
wouldn't do it

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.160
he wouldn't do it and then his sister

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.520
came up and did it once and he

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.079
immediately it's like [ __ ] that

00:37:44.079 --> 00:37:46.400
dude a spider-man landing is better it's

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.240
so funny the knee to knuckle the knee to

knuckles classic but a spider-man lamp

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.040
is tough way more flare yeah and it's

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.640
the best is just having a room full of

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.560
adults go oh

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.480

guess they think they're spider-man

00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:15.280
that's their understanding of the world

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.119

00:38:17.119 --> 00:38:18.720

most of you are probably thinking wow

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.040
you just use incognito mode that's

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.880
because incognito mode does not hide

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:54.720
your activity and clearing your browsing

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:57.920
history doesn't erase it all right what

00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.599
it doesn't your internet service

00:50:59.599 --> 00:51:01.040
providers give me my great moment when i

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.240
go

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:06.480
yeah oh yeah yeah i know that moment

00:51:06.839 --> 00:51:08.400
chill

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.160
um your internet service provider can

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:12.480
still see every single website you've

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:15.650
ever visited i know storm front

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:16.880
[Laughter]

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:19.040
get rid of it

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.880
you just were doing investigative stuff

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:22.880
you want to see what it was

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.359
[ __ ] that's why even when i'm at home i

00:51:25.359 --> 00:51:28.000
never go online without using expressvpn

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.040

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:36.720
have to be independent i'm saying i mean

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.319
what else are they it's a useful tool if

00:51:38.319 --> 00:51:39.359
you go if you're going to do that

00:51:39.359 --> 00:51:42.160

me find out what she thinks about it it

00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:39.520
was basic there was a

00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:41.599
some health lady from like new york the

00:59:41.599 --> 00:59:43.920
new health minister or whatever

00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:45.680
came out and was like she started

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.760
talking about calling white ladies

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:49.680
birthing people she meant to call

00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:50.960
everyone birthing people this was her

00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:52.960
mistake she was like yeah well there's

00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:54.799
like she was saying that there's a big

00:59:54.799 --> 00:59:57.760
discrepancy between the deaths of

00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.119
white birthing people and uh caribbean

01:00:01.119 --> 01:00:02.880
breathings yeah barry's gonna be able to

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.440
see he's better than people

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.000
but she actually called that mother she

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.040
called she called the pirates of

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.960
caribbean mothers she's called oh

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.720
mothers she got white people birthing

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:14.240
people yeah that's a good one it was a

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.760
miss site and then of course but then

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.280
they started having this deep debate

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.559
about like

01:00:18.559 --> 01:00:20.400
like well yeah i mean

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.920
we're trying to get inclusivity like

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.760
dude we're talking about ladies dying in

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.920
childbirth yeah and you're you're

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.319
shoehorning that into there so just call

01:00:28.319 --> 01:00:29.599
my moms

01:00:29.599 --> 01:00:31.280
it'd be like we're having birthing

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.680
people die and try it's like dude why

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.200
are you complicating this issue yeah

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.880
just in case

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.400
some trans ladies watching this like

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.160
what the [ __ ]

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:42.960
why aren't they including me dude it was

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:44.400
that's why they're not saying women but

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.079
exactly what it is because being a woman

01:00:46.079 --> 01:00:47.599
doesn't necessarily entail that you can

01:00:47.599 --> 01:00:49.520
give birth exactly it's birthing people

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.440
you might have a dong birthing people

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.240
dude

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.680
i do like the idea it should be like

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:57.839
birthing people chicks with dicks

01:00:58.319 --> 01:01:00.000
i like gender i like the idea of gender

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.359
non-conforming just get it we're going

01:01:01.359 --> 01:01:02.640
to start getting the bad at we're

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.920
talking about on the way up just getting

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:06.240
bad ass gender non-conforming we're like

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.200
i don't care yeah i'm gender

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.960
non-conforming but like yeah

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:10.480
