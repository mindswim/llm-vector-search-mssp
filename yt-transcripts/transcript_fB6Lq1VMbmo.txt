not give her the four bucks possible

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.670
cashier might have pocketed for herself

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.350
because she probably has a 50% discount

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.149
at four dollars basically equals dinner

00:09:31.149 --> 00:09:34.480

the Atlantic City he opened a casino

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:49.490

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:52.250
of people to attend it to pay for it

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:56.210

would get that on a t-shirt unless so

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:05.909
funny oh yeah man he is again another

00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:07.889
fully I forgot about that like what the

00:33:07.889 --> 00:33:09.809
winter is coming ourselves like I am the

00:33:09.809 --> 00:33:12.720

trash pick it up once you get down there

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:36.390
yeah but uh this guy was like I just

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:38.460

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:40.679
on the floor and he was like do you

00:33:40.679 --> 00:33:42.990
think maybe that this president would

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:45.570
serve himself before this country that's

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:50.250

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.669
like both equal both equally

00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:14.040
oh yeah a favorite book both of the you

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.320
know 50 books in the Bayeux many books

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.750
are in the Bible I can tell you bro I've

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:21.589
been doing some Bible research lately

00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:24.599
dude what's going on there what are you

00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:27.980
reading Genesis Exodus numbers

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:30.629
Deuteronomy well I'm not gonna still

00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:32.849
reading the answers a joke joke rules

00:34:32.849 --> 00:34:36.000
dude that book is I was just in it I was

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.260
just at a house and I was like if this

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:39.839
thing collapses I might be joke of the

00:34:39.839 --> 00:34:42.210
hell's people I'm worth just I'm on it

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:44.369
quick you survive yeah dude I think I

00:34:44.369 --> 00:34:50.399
might be jobra how many boils yes dude

00:34:50.399 --> 00:34:55.950
so the answer is a Joe book is it's

00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:57.630
really like I'm only halfway through it

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:58.859
but there you know I've talked to us

00:34:58.859 --> 00:35:01.380
before the Joe man is doubt getting

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.060
[ __ ] over everything sucks everything

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.980
stinks and now they couldn't figure out

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.140
their like because you know the people

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:10.200
came up the concept of God was that God

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.510
was just order and just being like you

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:13.770
know holding up traditions and the most

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:16.410
like we're gods gambling with a guy was

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:18.359
that a joke oh yeah with the devil yeah

00:35:18.359 --> 00:35:21.089
and it's just basically like sacrifice

00:35:21.089 --> 00:35:23.280
stuff like you're in charge your

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.780
daughter's you can [ __ ] kill them

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.310
have sex or whatever just your

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:27.540
charge yourself that was how people

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.970
conceptualize God and then until like

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:32.340
people started being like oh god let's

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.140
really shitty stuff stuff happened and

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.540
then he were like no so no one can think

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.060
of it and that's where like the jeez so

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:40.380
all those other books after Jobe were

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.150
like the [ __ ] was it not Daniel all

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:43.440
those other prophets were saying like

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.660
somebody's coming something's coming

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.670
they're doing Redemption tour and the

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:50.010
whole idea was that gee you know you

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:51.210
understand the Trinity like can you

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:53.190
conceptualize it yes how do you

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:54.480
understand that you want me to tell you

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.510
how I understand it please water hmm

00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:00.240
like water okay the Holy Trinity how to

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.550
explain that well it's three different

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:06.410
things in one form Ice Cube steam liquid

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:08.850
it's all water you're warm dude you're

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:10.620
warm on the trail yeah yeah I'm not

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:11.880
doing I'm not knocking that as a good

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.610
interpretation yeah so the way you look

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:16.130
at it is it's a process

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:20.700
so it's God the Son and the Holy Spirit

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:22.170
so God is the thing that's just like

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:24.360
this is order this is my house this is

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.490
the thing you do until eventually that

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:28.050
doesn't serve people because things

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:29.820
change but garden to being obviously a

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.770
snake pops up so then the son

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:33.690
quote-unquote in like the old biblical

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:35.700
terms is the revisitation

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.830
of the old way of being like no no this

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:39.600
is what you do that way we all don't

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.980
like die and fall off and the Holy

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.900
Spirit's obviously consciousness so

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.310
that's the whole the way they can

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:46.620
sexualize that is like so God's

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:49.800
basically a process of dudes you know

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.870
obviously people reproducing and then

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:53.490
the whole point of religion is to

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:55.500
instill to be like as it's just it's

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.390
just a baton pass well you're like

00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:59.340
here's how you don't [ __ ] everything up

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:04.230
and die I have a perp right here bubbles

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.870
coming out so it's just basically this

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:08.190
is what their treasures the Holy Spirit

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:11.340
it's probably I'm about to start going

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:14.490
glassy level of your head yeah so I'm

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:15.420

about sanity and how we don't have a

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.870
working definition of sandy no one can

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:36.300
really agree of what it is but anyway so

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:37.950
and in the book he was basically saying

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:39.220
that like

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:42.160
Jesus is the answer to job you think why

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.570
do bad things happen and then it was

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:46.150
like oh it's actually man's

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:47.619
responsibility therefore that's why

00:37:47.619 --> 00:37:49.599
Christ became man to make sure this

00:37:49.599 --> 00:37:51.700
horrible stuff doesn't happen and that's

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.290
eternity comes in we're like people

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:55.570
could in theory live forever if we just

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:57.099
did the right thing and the right thing

00:37:57.099 --> 00:37:58.840
is living eternally through the

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:01.230
father-son transfer the sacred knowledge

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:03.280
consciousness the holy spirit and then

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.150
we can live forever

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:06.700
physically Christ was the whole thing of

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:09.940
being like this this is we are we're the

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:11.830
God situation yeah

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:15.130
and it's up to us to not die by being

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:19.450
[ __ ] morons basically and then if you

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:22.090
if you don't you know if you don't have

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:23.440
this if you don't get the Sun on the

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.220
right path

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:25.930

thing over and over again and getting

00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:06.210

ingratiating one guy who said that and

00:44:14.789 --> 00:44:16.170
everyone was like it sounds cool if you

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:18.059
typed that into your phone like what's

00:44:18.059 --> 00:44:19.330
the definition of insanity it

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:23.260
be that quote you know so it's been

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.510
ingrained expecting yeah it's the

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:26.890
[ __ ] devil cuz they say didn't like

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:29.410
movies who was because there is a West

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:30.970
Watson was say he actually tried to use

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:32.650
that quote and [ __ ] it up no what's

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:33.790
that quote I don't even like it it's

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:35.710
where like do the same thing in West

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:37.420
wasn't both don't like it well then but

00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:39.220
then he used it like the next video he's

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:40.360
like y'all I mean if you do the same

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.410
thing and I was probably just watching

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:42.550
you last say you didn't like this quote

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:44.680
he said who wrote the koi I forget who

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:47.050
the guy is who was just one author said

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:49.000
it and everyone's like yep that's the

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.490
definition of insanity then well dude

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:53.560
well that I mean these guys you know

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.420
that's that's just like folk that's folk

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:56.860
stuff this guy is like talking about

00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:00.370
like we have clear like delineating

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:01.960
things for like you know what are the

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.310
disorders what are when people are

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:06.640
[ __ ] up with sanity not so much it's

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.230
like nobody wants to be like you know

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:11.290
the Diamonds of insanity but the

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:12.760
definition is the state of being

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:17.800
seriously mentally ill madness man it

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.200
goes that's what uh I think what Hamlet

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:23.410
extreme foolishness or irrationality it

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:24.610
makes it I'm telling you it makes no

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:27.010
sense so this guy starts talking about

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:29.620
so there was like the psychiatry

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:31.510
movement were never you know it started

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:32.920
in like in the 60s they started get

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:35.530
pushback with the anti psychiatrists so

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:37.240
there were people who came out your boy

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.160
Foucault Albert Einstein was the one who

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.750
said that was that who was Albert

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:42.730
Einstein Albert Einstein office um that

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:45.640
[ __ ] [ __ ] Albert Einstein also said

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:49.110
yeah my cousin taught he also said that

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:51.490
the every person has to make the

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:53.620
fundamental decision whether or not they

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.240
live in a friendly universe or an

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:58.030
indifferent universe he's got a pick bro

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:00.010
Einstein said yeah I pick one he chose

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:02.440
friendly obviously yeah meant the

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:07.030
definition [ __ ] that was his quote yeah

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:12.700
I was nice unquote definition of defined

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.910
incest but yeah the but yeah there's

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:17.590
these Jews that came out who were just

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:19.780
kind of like the Foucault type dudes

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:21.100
like the obviously like the French

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:24.160
bloody post Martin I need to [ __ ] post

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.900
what he post right Ernest I don't like

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:27.310
him bro well they came out and they're

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:29.920
like well what a [ __ ] Marxist bro they

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.690
came out like what is sanity and they

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:32.740
were like

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:35.109
if you're saying in capitalism you're

00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:37.089
sick because that you're just adapting

00:46:37.089 --> 00:46:38.650
to a sick society so you can reproduce

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:40.839
and that truly we should listen to

00:46:40.839 --> 00:46:41.950
people who are insane

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:43.780
so we should be listening the people in

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:44.950
the nuthouse the guy right reading the

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:46.380
book is the guy writing the book is like

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:48.700
yeah sounds cool in all guys but you

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:50.230
guys are [ __ ] morons that's not what

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:53.200
you do yeah it kind of being like yeah

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.430
sounds coming off but he goes the thing

00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:55.750
they do point out is that we literally

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:57.339
don't have a working definition of

00:46:57.339 --> 00:46:59.920
sanity and sanity the definition of

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:01.650
sanity is soundness of mind

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:04.390
so I'm dig this dude I [ __ ] blew my

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:06.609
own mind reading this book so if you are

00:47:06.609 --> 00:47:08.560
to again like me I take a I'm more of

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.450
like a macro microcosm kind of dude I

00:47:10.450 --> 00:47:12.970
think like we're just like everything

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:14.859
you kind of like goes out on like larger

00:47:14.859 --> 00:47:16.180
scale so we're like a smaller version of

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:17.200
something else you know we're kind of

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.119
reflections of all the bigger stuff does

00:47:19.119 --> 00:47:19.630
that make sense

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:22.720
so the university what is it what is it

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:26.430
dude random chaos infinite random chaos

00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:29.349
so what would make you think that your

00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:31.780
mind should be some sort of like soundly

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:34.359
ordered system the universe s order

00:47:34.359 --> 00:47:37.330
universe bro there's order it doesn't do

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:39.010
that's the that's the religious mission

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:41.080
is that humans you're just human

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.000
enterprise you don't read enough st.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.150
Thomas Aquinas the human off about a

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:48.160
coin trying to connect the logos to the

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:52.300
[ __ ] you Matt I find God in the order of

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:52.720
nature

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.320
please I've tried to connect the [ __ ]

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.700
find God in the order of nature magic

00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.920
literally was in the air dunking the

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.510
logo Stephen you blocked it but it's

00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:05.320
funny I was reading I don't like Tanana

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.910
it's crazy to not have him there's no

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:09.160
working definition of sanity nobody

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:11.260
wants to be like no I got it I'm saying

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:12.849
I bet there's a definition of sanity

00:48:12.849 --> 00:48:15.730
dude I'm telling you there's there is a

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:18.339
definition but it's not like it's of

00:48:18.339 --> 00:48:22.780
sound - what does that mean I mean we

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:25.210
know when someone's crazy I mean really

00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:26.589
honestly I think sanity is just an

00:48:26.589 --> 00:48:29.530
agreement to like things you do to

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:30.640
ensure the fact that you're gonna

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.790
physically reproduce like settler you

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:36.640
know forcing the issue obviously that's

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.650
not cool what do you mean like there's a

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:41.410
whole set of customs and behaviors so

00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:43.510
you think there's no saying no I'm

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:45.680
saying how I said except for

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.850
sanity in my opinion is just the

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:50.330
behaviors you do to fit in basically

00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:53.850
that make sense yeah that makes sense

00:48:53.850 --> 00:48:56.340
pretty wild yes but again the fact that

00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:57.780
we don't understand it's pretty cool so

00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:00.780
I part of me I get a text message about

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:02.400
the connected logos dude I got a really

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:06.090
important text message what this is

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:10.110
rumba just drum holding it's a [ __ ]

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:13.440
dad mean it's in my family group text

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:16.530

00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:19.110
having just signed a bill and the bill

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:24.210
says Shakira and JLo can stay that's

00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:26.670
coming from an Arab immigrant know if I

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:29.670
like that Wow dude I don't know if I

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:30.960
like that I don't like I don't like

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.370
anybody making immigration jokes

00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:34.050
particularly not an actual immigrant

00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:35.670
true how dare he

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:37.650
that's that's kind of disgusting it's

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:40.350
dicey that's dicey stuff how was the

00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:41.070
halftime show

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:43.890
was it [ __ ] pretty hot was it hard as

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:45.540
everybody said if you watch that alone

00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:48.120
tonight you're gonna fall I've been

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.590
pretty good about not falling you would

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:52.230
fall if you watched it it'll fire you I

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:53.460
mean you know you're watching just be

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:55.710
like this is [ __ ] this is insane

00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:58.050
yeah that's insanely what that the

00:49:58.050 --> 00:50:00.420
halftime show was insanely becoming an

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:03.240
old white guy what were they doing just

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:05.670

but they like dudes dressed I don't know

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.980
first of all did you see a thing when

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:12.930
Shakira went like this and like yeah

00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:14.340
that's the expression of her culture

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:16.260
excuse me yeah pardon me excuse me

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:18.870
so that's actually a nod dude Oh

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:21.030
somebody posted think of that about the

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:24.480
ladybug something step dance they were

doing some dance and they're like that's

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:27.510
actually very important and celebrated

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:30.510
in Colombian culture so it's like all

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:32.340

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:35.220
dumb dance Oh what did you get the

00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:36.600

01:03:23.590 --> 01:03:24.760
school today and they're talking about

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.310
actually it made me laugh out loud at

01:03:27.310 --> 01:03:29.500
the place I was at they're talking about

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.960
like how this one therapist was working

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.220
it's like the different theories of like

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:36.610
how to correct for like prior experience

01:03:36.610 --> 01:03:38.140
in life so if you have parents who are

01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:40.570
like super strict and overbearing you

01:03:40.570 --> 01:03:45.040
develop like a mental landscape of never

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.660
being in control ever so then you know

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:47.980
you can't exercise your control then you

01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:49.240
get frustrated and you're out in the

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.680
world just being nasty or freaking out

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:53.410
you're acting out so this therapist had

01:03:53.410 --> 01:03:55.960
a young girl in the in the room with her

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:58.210
or yeah and room with him and was like

01:03:58.210 --> 01:03:59.740
all right you're the teacher I'm the

01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:01.840
student you're the boss and just let

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:04.390
this girl be the boss of him kind of

01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:06.160
weird you'd let this girl there's young

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.720
girl be like the dominatrix of him and

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.670
be like what are we doing and she this

01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:11.170
girl would just be super [ __ ] mean to

01:04:11.170 --> 01:04:13.510
him he's like sit in that chair the guy

01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:15.040
would start like whining like a little

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.290
student the doctor was like then I was

01:04:17.290 --> 01:04:18.160
like this chairs right

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.480
comfortable for me she's like that's

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:28.030
cause you're fat and dumb so [ __ ]

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:29.740
funny that's cause you're so fat and

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:31.420
dumb go write your name on the board the

01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:32.740
guy was like dude literally she made me

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:34.090
write my name on the board like two

01:04:34.090 --> 01:04:35.740
hundred [ __ ] times he said he did

01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:36.910
this with her for like six months and

01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:38.470
eventually she just started being better

01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:40.630
in school she got to like experience

01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:42.490
what when you're a baby you're supposed

01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:45.190
to experience uh omnipotence where like

01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:48.340
you cry mom comes breast you you know

01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:49.660
and like your you have to get that

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:52.480
experience in order to theoretically to

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.310
feel like you can affect change in the

01:04:54.310 --> 01:04:56.050
world and if you're a baby you nur

01:04:56.050 --> 01:04:57.460
ignored when you're an adult you just

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:59.980
are like I'm not I'm not gonna move or

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.330
act because there's no point for me to

01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:02.530
take action because it won't change

01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:05.050
anything I hope that's yeah yeah isn't

01:05:05.050 --> 01:05:06.940
it crazy yeah but yeah but you can

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:08.560
repair those in theory you can repair

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:10.480
those early experiences by giving people

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:13.030
experiences in therapy setting but again

01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:14.230
he just let this girl boss him around

01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:16.150
for like six months she's like you fat

01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:23.260
