dark

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.959
like there's like an attached garage and

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.879
the whole family can hear like ching

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.360
ching chi chi chi chi and they open the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.680

i beat my dad up he's like

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.200
no one's stopping you from just making

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.920
like an an indie biopic that'd be so if

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.599
you make your own biopic and not even

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.519
wait for hollywood

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.879
you might have to

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.640
yeah it's gotta be completely skew my

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.319
tail yeah

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.879
completely uncalled for biopic that you

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.040
should

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.640
unless you're making your biopic and

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.800
you're just like erasing all the l's and

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.959
turning them into w's i don't even want

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.640
to see your movie i don't want to see an

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.879
honest depiction of someone's luck true

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.959
yeah i would have seen everything

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.720
yeah dude it better be

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.120
dubs

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.360
and it's like even the child version of

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.159
you is played by the grown-up actor so

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.640
you're always

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.080
yeah that would be pretty great

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.599
otherwise dude don't [ __ ] show me

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.560
point i i can't even think of of a

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.799
current male actor ripped enough to play

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.519

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.239

and new expendables mark weiner

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.439

now

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.360
he was like

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.960
hanging you never saw the al sharpton

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.120
gym picture yeah i've seen that okay

i've seen that selfie yeah so yeah yeah

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.639
yeah that's why we think he's sexy he

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.320
was morbidly obese before and now he's a

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.440
little guy

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.520
so yeah that counts as that's relatively

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.680
jacked i apologize i'm sorry but jacked

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.800
means something you're getting too

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.720
literal yeah do you think that's where i

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.840
draw the comedy line

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.479
even even for the premise of this joke

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.680
you guys think al sharpton's jacked

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.919
okay

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.960
do you think let's unpack this

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.800
i'm sorry

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.160
i think the clintons had anything to do

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
with al sharp getting that skinny

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.840
the clintons yeah

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.680
you think you think this benefited the

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.919
global elite him no i'm saying he

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.840
probably could he was so fat that's what

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.199
i'm saying that's probably what the

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:10.400
clinton's got him on like all right

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.520
here's what we're going to do with you

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.960
but he's like we'll make you skinny as

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.320
[ __ ]

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.280
but

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.280
you know but when we have the train you

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.320
have to go

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.680
you have to go on to cnn and

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.400
mispronounce everything

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.280
you have to for some reason be on new

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.919
year's rocking

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.560
god damn it i just spun out on that

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.639
conspiracy bro i've been i don't want to

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.800
tell you guys i completely spun out for

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.320
a second there was a point where i was

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.600
just like

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.880
i might have to get out of here and i

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.840
was like you don't have to get out of

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.840
here dude that's just a weird thing

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.000
we should start doing like a a was it a

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.320
chiron kyran what's that thing called

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.680
that's scrolling across the bottom and

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.880
just constantly remember

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.360
a lower third i just yeah i guess now

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.280
it's all kind of longer now yeah yeah

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.520
that's but so i would just have our like

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.680
what we're like why we're so [ __ ] up

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.600
the whole i'm back yeah i'm back i took

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.520
a good like 30 seconds i think all it

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.840
was was this thing was on my cord and my

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.039
quarters pressing down on me and i was

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.960
like

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.960
the other day i was deep into a spiral

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.400
of like

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.240
like

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.880
self-imagined black conspiracies like so

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.680
my phone that is the deepest dude

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.039
it's kind of like it's kind of we're

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:26.400
getting pyramid brain it's kind of fun

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.120
right

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.319
so

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:30.240
it started it started from the theory

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.240
the conspiracy theory that

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.400
black people there are not as few black

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.360
people in america as the country would

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.800
lead us to be for sure

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.000
way more

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.520
way more [ __ ] because yeah because

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.560
first of all black people don't [ __ ]

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.440
with government papers yeah you know but

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.680
uh i think it's i mean i'm not saying

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.280
it's half and half but it's like closer

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.319
to that

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:51.919
like for this conspiracy there's more

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:53.919
blacks than latinos let's just say that

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:55.039
wait that's also that's already

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.520
reflected and that's never mind yeah

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.240
yeah yeah yeah

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.479
no but that's what they're trying to say

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:04.000
they're trying to say that uh latinos

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.759
are about to that's what i keep hearing

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.280
yeah yeah

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.120
you know so they might

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.639
but i'm just saying so that that's where

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:12.800
that's where it started and then uh and

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.080
latinos are all clapping you dude

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.120
[Laughter]

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.800
yeah dude that would be fun that'd be

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.080
the better part of the census like did

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.000
you get posted yeah come on and then

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.280
like the end is like oh by the way how

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.080
many people are in your house do you

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.199
have did you [ __ ] how many people the

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:34.400
house did you [ __ ] well there's ten

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.680
people in my house i've [ __ ] two of

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.599
them

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:39.599
that would it's bad math for a household

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:41.759
because that would be the only one only

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:44.080
one yeah but no it could be roommates

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.319
true but that's i mean

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:50.319
dude even that's the best case scenario

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:52.240
that would increase the black population

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.000
if if we were able to convince black

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.160
people that dog it kind of looks like we

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.400
don't get [ __ ] yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.319
like what are you doing we gotta have

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:01.919
more babies we gotta we need more black

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:04.000
people true

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.599
that's all that was funny when they when

00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:08.160
they uh uh what's it called the shot

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.840
when the kovid shot came out and black

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.440
people were like nah

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.960
it's only like there were a million

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.240
commercials about cove and it was just

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.919
like normal black folks just being like

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:18.879
it's cool we like dude

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:20.319
that's the other part of my conspiracy

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:22.080
by the way normal black folk because a

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.680
lot of people don't know that there are

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.919
normal black folk right so the other

00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:27.840
part of the conspiracy

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.039
what do you mean

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:30.000
they can't

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.759
fathom normal black no yeah there's

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:33.839
people that think that there's all black

00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:35.599
people are dangerous minds like yes

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:37.039
there's people who are like

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.560
i'm telling you yeah

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.959
i went to a my master's program a girl

00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:42.959
went to north philadelphia and came in

00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:45.200
the next day and cried yeah being like i

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.440
didn't know that existed it was like

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.720
that yeah

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.720
dude it's uh so yeah there's i thought

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.000
they were more like keenan thompson

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.399
kind of jolly and witty but there is a

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:57.920
hand

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.000
in like in culture and society that is

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.560
trying to make it seem like like that is

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.720
what black like that this is what black

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.640
people have to identify as yeah to be

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.560
considered black yeah and it's like the

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.240
lowest

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.720
it was like so that was like so one

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.560
black people were more of the population

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.600
normal

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.560
and that's

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.560
normal black people are more of the

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.680
black population

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.839
there's a silent majority oh for sure

00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:25.440
yeah and like when you say normal

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.440
version what would you say would the

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.839
abnormal depiction be

00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:31.279
i would i would call them more of the

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:33.360
not foolish majority do you know what i

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.720
mean sure like the ab

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.320
from foolishness down from like once

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.320
foolishness kicks in as a default

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.320
mechanism for handling situations in

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.640
public

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.120
like i'm not

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.000
after everyone pops off now it's drama

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:02.800
dude

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.920
yeah i hate drama dude let me update my

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.240
thank you

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.399
y'all i hate drama it is it is funny how

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:15.600
foolishness leads to drama

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.839
it truly is the thing with the two yeah

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:22.240
foolishness and drama yeah but it's true

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.920
you have to be wise and to be able to

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.760
like know what's foolishness and when

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.360
foolishness is occurring

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.320
mm-hmm

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.920
yeah but some i mean but some people

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.640
there is a default where they're like

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.200
foolishness has to occur in order for me

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.760
to be to even consider myself black when

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.959
i'm represent especially when i'm

00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:40.640
representing myself

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.920
amongst

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.120
that's the wild mountain

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.160
yeah

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.360
so yeah i just want to make sure i'm

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.720
following it so

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.200
you're saying you have people assuming

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.800
that it's like

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.240
what are people assuming then i don't

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.920
know that's the case so you know how so

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.120
you know how like

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.720
there's this i don't know if it's used

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.760
anymore i don't know what the kids are

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.839
saying these days right yeah but there

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:06.000
was a time when

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.480
in polite society if a black person went

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.600
from

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.519
normal to

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:13.920
popping off yeah it would in that

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.279
transition

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:17.440
it was uh oh y'all just made me go black

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.480
up in here

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.440
oh

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.720
right do you understand what i'm saying

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.920
yeah so like so that then ingrains in

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.760
the mind dude this this conspiracy went

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.839
so much deeper if if if you wouldn't

00:11:27.839 --> 00:11:29.600
touch me right yeah because now that

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.399
that ingrains in the mind that

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:34.959
acting normal as a black person like not

00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:36.800
popping off right is

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.640
considered white when you see black

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.800
people in place which is offensive to me

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.959
dude

00:11:42.959 --> 00:11:44.880
so here's here so i don't think people

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.240
realize

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.240
uh when when they are saying that like

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.079
white people or racists are like there's

00:11:50.079 --> 00:11:51.440
like this hand of white people just

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.200
keeping us down how much they're putting

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.760
white people on a pedestal oh yeah like

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.200
they're not even like if i if i would

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.720
say to them like well you know the

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.160
reason why i don't think everybody is

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.360
racist is because i don't put white

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.279
people on a pedestal mm-hmm right they

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:05.040
would they would definitely argue with

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.600
me that that's not like they're the ones

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.519
not putting white people on yeah you

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:11.839
ever get an argument with like a like a

00:12:11.839 --> 00:12:15.040
white liberal lady and she'll be like

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.160
you know what i mean oh you think you're

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.399
up here yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:19.920
exactly what yeah that's exactly what it

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.680
is and then it's it's that in reverse

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.279
it's like dude

00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:24.320
what do you mean when she shows you

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.600
think you're up here because it's like

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.200
it's i think the point this is trying to

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.440
make is that like if if we're to accept

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.440
that like all black people are held down

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.560
by the the the uh by white supremacy

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.399
yeah it's like oh well then you're

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:38.800
placing white people in a place to

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.639
control all of us you're placing them

00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:42.880
above you to give them power over you

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.639
yeah which i think

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:47.279
is not a mainstream concept no not at

00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:49.200
all yeah i think most people were like

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.959
yeah white people were kind of

00:12:50.959 --> 00:12:52.720
chilling on a lot of power right now you

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.839
know what i'm saying

00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:56.959
yeah well i mean but to to also that's

00:12:56.959 --> 00:12:58.320
that's the mainstream i don't know i

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.600
don't know that i agree with anything

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.760
i'm so that's not so

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.200
i hear what you're saying yeah you hear

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.720
what you're saying and i just can't put

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.560
them together at all well you know how

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.320
well you did i i think i understand this

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.760
because i've asked sid about this a

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.079
million times yeah let me let me white

00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:14.399
splain one thing that's it that's it

00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:15.440
okay so

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.959
here's something that sids made clear to

00:13:16.959 --> 00:13:18.079
me yes

00:13:18.079 --> 00:13:19.680
and let me let me see if this even helps

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.279
the conversation at all it might not

00:13:21.279 --> 00:13:22.720
make anything clearer we need to have

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.040
tough conversations like this yes

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.839
it's about god yeah

00:13:27.839 --> 00:13:29.120
what's so funny is that this could be

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.800
about any topic and we're explaining to

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.680
our friend who's too stoned

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.079
is that what people mean by tough

00:13:36.079 --> 00:13:37.680
conversations just explaining it to

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.480
[ __ ] people

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:43.680
that's what a tough conversation is kind

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.600
of like where it's like slightly beyond

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.160
your ability to just be like uh-huh yeah

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.680
when you're just getting ping-pong in a

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.519
conversation you're not tracking it at

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:53.199
all when you have something stop the

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:55.120
show dude it's over

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.880
yeah when you lose the confidence to ask

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.560
questions anymore it's like i don't even

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.160
know you're just going over it yeah i

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.120
know that's just crazy yeah

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.639
explain it give me your give me your

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:07.600
take on that um now i lost it

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.120
you were about the white spleen i was

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.120
gonna explain one of one of the things

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.880
that sid argues with other black people

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.760
about a lot is that uh like no matter

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.440
what they're arguing about there's an

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.600
understanding below the argument where

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.839
it's just like yo brother you know how

00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:23.519
white people are keeping us all down

00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:26.560
yeah and it's like i think sid is doing

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.639
a lot to fight against that being the

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:30.800
underlying theme of every conversation

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.240
what i'm what and what i'm trying to

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.079
illuminate to them is like dude in order

00:14:34.079 --> 00:14:36.880
for them to hold you down you have to be

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.480
hold downable

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.839
true do you know right you have to be

00:14:39.839 --> 00:14:41.440
down here they have to be up there for

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.519
your underlying premise to be true yeah

00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:45.360
you see yourself as whole like i can't

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.480
be pinned

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.240
are you kidding me i'm too squirmy

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.000
socially to be sure it's not gonna

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.800
happen yeah yeah i mean you know and i

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.040
think even for like white anti-racists

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.040
it that is black people here white

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.639
people here i know

00:14:58.639 --> 00:15:00.560
for sure let's help them up and when and

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.560
when white people are trying to like

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.000
tell me that i'm wrong in the way that i

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.480
see that this power dynamic it's almost

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.880
like you don't get it like yeah i'm

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.560
white so i understand the power that i

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.680
have yeah so it's so tragic that you

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.480
have a black brain yes you have thoughts

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.839
that are almost you you have thoughts

00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:19.120
that are almost as good as like white

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.120
brain thoughts yeah yeah it's kind of

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.720
the vibe i wish i could is there more

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.560
money that i can give to someone to help

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.120
someone like you

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.880
that's anti-racism

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.720
those are not thoughts that i would ever

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.880
have it's true yeah it is it's insane

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.800
it's insane well it's just you know so

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.880
that's that's the uh it's kind of [ __ ]

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.240
up i think they flipped the script

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.360
though because i had a theory that like

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.240
this hard anti-racist are just the

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.000
grandchildren of like the hard gym

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.480
crowers yeah so they just needed some

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.320
form of established orthodoxy on a

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.160
psychological level the content's almost

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.399
irrelevant but they're doing the same

00:15:52.399 --> 00:15:54.720
thing now but being like rather like

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.920
black people aren't allowed to do this

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.600
they're like

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.440

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.040

dude

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.280
every time will smith's in a movie where

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.720
he takes his shirt off in the past 20

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.480
years chris rock was just getting his

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.559
[ __ ] blown apart during production

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:03.919
true you've never if you look into the

00:21:03.919 --> 00:21:05.039
times you'll probably see that you had

00:21:05.039 --> 00:21:06.480
movies like six months apart from each

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.360
other yeah

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.240
i know he had to have like

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.640
reconstructive surgery i do have a hard

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.039
time seeing will smith as not the person

00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:14.880
having his ass blown out

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.440
yeah but with a high on testosterone and

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.360
replacement therapy that's that's going

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.200
to change yeah i mean yeah i don't i

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.480
don't know what i don't know what the

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.760
thrill is like

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.520
it's easy to imagine will like laying on

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.280
a hotel bed with like his head on his

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.799
arms his folded arms and he's just

00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:30.320
getting hot candle wax dripped on his

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.159
butt cheeks it's so easy to imagine

00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:34.559
wilson that way it's pretty but also

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:36.799
uh

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.520
also yeah you can see him on

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.600
testosterone dude he's pulling chris

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.159
rock into his that's what i'm saying

00:21:44.159 --> 00:21:45.840
in that scenario

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.200
so this is this is what i was what i'm

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.960
curious about now if you had to go he's

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.799
got chris rock on a sex swing with a

00:21:50.799 --> 00:21:54.159
hard dick and he's backing up

00:21:54.799 --> 00:21:57.600
top to bottom the men of hollywood like

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.440
who's at the top of the butt [ __ ]

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.520
food chain in terms of tops bottoms

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.520
and like the interlinking between yeah i

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.120
feel like a lot of this crop right now

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.360
they're all bottoms there's not a top to

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.039
be found but if you had it so if you had

00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:11.200
a so say like vin diesel versus the rock

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.440
they took the who's top uh harvey

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.320
weinstein was the top

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.280
honestly

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.559
they took them out

00:22:18.559 --> 00:22:20.640
yeah they completely destabilized jay

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.559
hollywood by taking out the king he was

00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:23.520
the top

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.760
he was detecting a game show like ellen

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.159

saying that they interviewed him and he

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.600
was like bro

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.279
if i had done a hit squad it would have

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:43.200
been professional that's a botched job

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.960

him he's like if i was going after a

00:24:55.679 --> 00:24:56.960
high level target it would be done

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.400
professionally and there'd be no mess

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.039

letting him [ __ ] get off the hook for

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.880
this and he was like bro

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.960
that's hipaa what the [ __ ] the doctor's

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.480

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.919
first they'll put him on long-term

00:33:03.919 --> 00:33:05.760
medications and he'll only take them if

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.279
he experiences like a symptom so if

00:33:07.279 --> 00:33:08.480

manager of uh comedy club james and i

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.440

a lady in the same job

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.359

00:37:39.359 --> 00:37:40.560
who was the who was the other one then

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.640
man you must have felt so alive in that

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.400
moment you realized you

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.320
did that okay so

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.000
as i look back down on my phone and i'm

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.560

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.200
three years

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.079

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.480
the cuffs of my pants wicking

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.280
it was so atrocious so the first thing i

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.440
did was actually send it to the right

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.760
chat yeah and i was like

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.440
first things first

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.720
i thought you had multiple [ __ ] yet i

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.640
was trying to find them no dude i think

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.400
it was o'connor though for some reason i

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.400
thought the chat was

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.160
it was chit chat and then i got another

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.520
one i was like does he have another [ __ ]

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.520
no the other one was the other one was

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:31.200
the problem the other one was the errant

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.119
one i don't even have it on here anymore

00:38:33.119 --> 00:38:36.240

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.599
hotel room with like my hands shaking

00:38:37.599 --> 00:38:39.200

myself like not like i'm gonna get in

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.480
trouble like i just embarrassed myself

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.079
in a way that i might not ever recover

00:38:44.079 --> 00:38:45.359
from

00:38:45.359 --> 00:38:47.839
and then obviously sending the manager

00:38:47.839 --> 00:38:49.440
like the regional manager of helium like

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.440

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.119
plumbing that human eyes never see and

00:39:01.119 --> 00:39:02.640

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.359
just being like [ __ ] i'm like i said

00:40:47.359 --> 00:40:49.520

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.119
batteries in something

00:41:09.119 --> 00:41:10.880
what happens when i'm dead yeah dude if

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.480
there's a ladder involved it's just like

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.440
what's up

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.800

00:41:16.079 --> 00:41:18.079
room so they she had to tag me in the

00:41:18.079 --> 00:41:19.119
other day

00:41:19.119 --> 00:41:20.800
we i had to go like to speed things up

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.480
because of the timeline thing it's like

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.920
well if like if you can go in there and

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.200

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.720
smoothly and it's like i was like

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.319
absolutely i'll do it i can't wait and

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:30.319
then i'd love just you got a contractor

00:41:30.319 --> 00:41:31.520
working for you it was like would you

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.040

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.800
wanted to do it they wanted to do it but

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.040
they the timeline wouldn't mesh so i was

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.720
like we we're the ones kind of rushing

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.640
it we want to get in earlier yeah so

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.079

00:41:42.079 --> 00:41:44.240
well well how about this i'll paint the

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.760

park currency and you need to trade even

00:42:11.599 --> 00:42:13.920
if you're going to be long-term [ __ ]

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.599

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:58.640
hold on hold on

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.079
hold on

00:44:00.079 --> 00:44:03.520

not had their fill of sexy girls yet

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.560
dude

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.640
whatever happened dude yeah they did i'm

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.839
telling you if we had two chicks in

00:44:19.839 --> 00:44:22.000
bikini sitting here we would get like it

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.680
would just we would get way more traffic

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:26.079
i mean it's a sad mature fact

00:44:26.079 --> 00:44:27.920
if we had like chicks here like kind of

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.280
like fidgeting with their buttholes as

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:31.599
we talk yeah totally closed and then

00:44:31.599 --> 00:44:35.720
imagine if you pranked them

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.200
i'm pretty sure all of social media was

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.839
invented to see sexy girls

00:44:45.839 --> 00:44:48.240
it would be disastrous for us dude our

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:50.079
families would fall apart we'd start

00:44:50.079 --> 00:44:52.400
like dressing cool you don't you don't

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.319
you don't think our wives like

00:44:54.319 --> 00:44:56.960
girls they'd be no they'd be so mad we

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.040
would be content hounds we'd be wearing

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.119
like flipped up brims on hats and just

00:45:01.119 --> 00:45:01.839
like

00:45:01.839 --> 00:45:03.440
so partied out looks like we could

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:05.920
barely stay away yeah

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.599

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.839

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.400
like

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.160
but yeah i didn't really listen to that

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.359
thing you just said but that way you're

00:45:55.359 --> 00:45:56.960
looking at it seriously thinking about

00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.640
doing something to you i've been here 11

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.839

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.640
your wife for sex

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.440
that'd be funny

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:12.440
yeah

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:19.440
of dudes trying to [ __ ] their wives

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.880
would be so funny

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:21.920
i would like to like have the

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.400
conversation go down and be like yo like

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.480
i wanted to talk i'd be a nice red

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.680
so you know how like your phone knows

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.119
when you're driving and you can let your

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:30.800
auto insurance company know to like get

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.640
a reduced rate there should be something

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.560
for dudes where it's like as soon as you

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.680
start trying to get [ __ ] like your

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.680
phone knows and starts recording and it

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.839
records every single attempt

00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:41.280
and then it uploads it to us and we

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.119
decide what to do with it that would be

00:46:43.119 --> 00:46:44.640
a nice branch of competitors give dudes

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.160
a break on the patreon if they install

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.640
the center desk i record every attempt

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.319
at getting [ __ ]

00:46:50.319 --> 00:46:51.839
that would be nice to send that back we

00:46:51.839 --> 00:46:54.079
can diagnose it

00:46:54.079 --> 00:46:55.440
like if you're not getting [ __ ] in your

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.640
relationship

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:59.440
send the readout yeah audio records yeah

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:00.880
spreadsheet and we could be like all

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:02.480
right analyze it be like alright so what

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:04.640
was the vibe going into it

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.160
yeah that'd be kind of nice i dude i'm

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.839
telling you it's dude it's just like

00:47:07.839 --> 00:47:09.599
it's funny to me to become like old hat

00:47:09.599 --> 00:47:11.119
at that when you're like listening to a

00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:12.800
recording in like first 15 seconds

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:13.920
you're like this guy's not kidding this

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.680
is not happening or like or if you're

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.079
like man i like where this guy is going

00:47:18.079 --> 00:47:19.920
if you can keep this up

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.440
and then yeah then you hold up then it's

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:22.720
like as you you know obviously start to

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.960
kiss and feel tits you hold up babe and

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.319
you turn around and hit turn the talk

00:47:26.319 --> 00:47:26.700
boy off

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:30.720
[Laughter]

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.800
yeah dude i uh service we could provide

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.480
that'd be nice man

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.079
[ __ ] was i just i was just thinking

00:47:36.079 --> 00:47:37.200
about something related to this now i

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.640
can't remember it oh that i ruined your

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.160
train of thought no not at all it had to

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:42.880
do with getting [ __ ] tight obviously

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:45.119
sick cool specifically specifically with

00:47:45.119 --> 00:47:47.040
like yeah trying to get [ __ ] from your

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.400
wife

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.400
oh that's what it was to set up a new

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.200
couple's counselor but this you know

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.480
like there's different focus some would

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:56.559
be like cognitive behavioral come from a

00:47:56.559 --> 00:47:58.880
lens where it's like i try to figure out

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.880
i specifically try to figure out why the

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.880
dude isn't getting [ __ ] and then like

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.520
talk to his wife with him on his behalf

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.119
and try to help him understand i thought

00:48:07.119 --> 00:48:09.839
that's all couples therapy

00:48:09.839 --> 00:48:11.839
i thought the second guy's like let's

00:48:11.839 --> 00:48:13.440
try couples counseling because like i

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:16.079
have not come in five weeks yeah and

00:48:16.079 --> 00:48:17.920
it's either this or i'm gonna take a gun

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:18.839
to

00:48:18.839 --> 00:48:20.400
church actually that's kind of what it

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.319
is like most couple therapists are in

00:48:22.319 --> 00:48:24.480
their car like this mother [ __ ] i'm

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:26.480
trying to get you to get a [ __ ] that's

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:29.359
where the happy endings realize the way

00:48:29.359 --> 00:48:31.280
like happy endings like instead of that

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.559
massage parlors

00:48:32.559 --> 00:48:34.960
couples

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:41.630
[Laughter]

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:46.720
i thought you were saying at the end of

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.200
the session the guy talks your wife you

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.800
and him talk your wife and her giving

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:54.240
you a hand job dji's your wife yeah yeah

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.240
uh linda i think it would be appropriate

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.000
for you to hand release

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
can we talk about a hand release

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.760
what are your feelings a hand release

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.079
yeah he's kind of like a dollar for your

00:49:04.079 --> 00:49:06.800
dick yeah it's like so you're not

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.319
wanting to give him just a quick

00:49:08.319 --> 00:49:09.839
old-fashioned

00:49:09.839 --> 00:49:11.119
what are your thoughts on that tell me

00:49:11.119 --> 00:49:12.960
what goes on yeah tell me what goes on

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.880
when he [ __ ] when he when he exhibits

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.720
a boner in his boxers towards you and

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.559
looks up at you yeah what's going on

00:49:18.559 --> 00:49:19.760
what does that mean when he walks into

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.280
the kitchen have he wrecked and says

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.440
whoa i have a isn't it crazy like a 3

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.960
p.m boner and he's just shaking it

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:26.880
around in the kitchen

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.480
what kind of reaction does that stir in

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.200
you

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.359
true you also yeah true

00:49:33.359 --> 00:49:35.359
it's like what level of hand jobs do you

00:49:35.359 --> 00:49:37.520
feel like is enough

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:39.040
i'd like to get your perspective on yeah

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:39.839
yeah

00:49:39.839 --> 00:49:41.200
this guy like all right so this guy's

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.880
did it this guy's worked really hard for

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.960
a week and he saved up all of his money

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.240
went out to dinner what are your

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.640
thoughts around blowing him after that

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.559
yeah i like that anything's on the table

00:49:50.559 --> 00:49:52.160
we'd like to hear like what would be

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.920
dude i think there was an attempt by the

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.920
mainstream media to like outlaw getting

00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.319
your dick sucked they almost wanted zero

00:49:58.319 --> 00:49:59.359
they thought the perfect number of

00:49:59.359 --> 00:50:00.800
getting your dick sucked was zero and

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.240
they were trying to implement that for a

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:03.599
couple of years there yeah well they

00:50:03.599 --> 00:50:05.520
didn't want any guys getting hit

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.359
yeah exactly the push the elites right

00:50:07.359 --> 00:50:09.440
now i don't know what agenda it is but

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.920
it's evil and they're part of it is guys

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:14.079
not getting hit i will like get like

00:50:14.079 --> 00:50:15.520
sneak in whatever [ __ ] up bill that

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:16.640
needs to be passed they need to like

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:18.800
stop do something you can tell all women

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.960
like stop sucking their dicks dude it's

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:22.880
like putting them on a pedestal over us

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.720
you're basically putting women down by

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.720
like black people on the mainstream

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:28.319
that power dynamic that they're trying

00:50:28.319 --> 00:50:30.160
to enforce okay like you're taking us

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.680
we're standing up here helping black

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:33.599
people and when you suck men's penises

00:50:33.599 --> 00:50:35.200
you take us down we can't help anybody

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.040
anymore yeah true but on an individual

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:38.880
level if you're like never suck dick

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.640
again a woman would probably just start

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.960
punching you in the face

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.319
yeah they could talk east dude i mean

00:50:44.319 --> 00:50:46.400
they could run they could run enough ads

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.000
to be like yeah giving a dude head is

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.040
sexist

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.640
that it would that's what i'm saying

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:51.839
they would enter the picture it would

00:50:51.839 --> 00:50:53.599
cause a conflict at least wouldn't be

00:50:53.599 --> 00:50:55.920
like yeah i saw this happen think about

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:51.599
workforce and get overwhelmed

00:51:51.599 --> 00:51:55.440
let's be reasonable here

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.800
the treasure start reading vlogs it is

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.720
crazy dude watching woman on woman

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:03.440
violence from like an hr employee

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:05.119
that's

00:52:05.119 --> 00:52:07.760
terrible magic terrible

yeah

00:52:10.559 --> 00:52:12.319
yeah they're [ __ ] nightmares in the

00:52:12.319 --> 00:52:13.920
workplace

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:15.520
i'm kidding

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:19.240
say women are nightmares

00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:24.559
[Laughter]

00:52:24.559 --> 00:52:27.040
i do not agree with what matt just said

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:30.839
but i will say this

00:52:36.850 --> 00:52:42.319
[Laughter]

00:52:42.319 --> 00:52:44.230
get their work done

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:46.400
[Laughter]

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.319
when office ladies like go the sexual

00:52:48.319 --> 00:52:50.000
route there are office women that go to

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.240
the sexual route it's pretty funny

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.160
i was thinking about that earlier when

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.280
uh

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.040
like such a funny thing to say like a

00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:58.160
point in my life where i'm gonna be

00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:01.839
allowed to be an old perv

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.119
you have to start now

00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:11.200
i want to start now that's true that's

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.200
very true when your walking stride gets

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.480
disrupted that's when they start giving

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:16.559
you a pass when you have to like like it

00:53:16.559 --> 00:53:17.839
takes a couple steps to turn around to

00:53:17.839 --> 00:53:19.599
look at an ass people just like cram

00:53:19.599 --> 00:53:20.880
yeah yeah

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:22.559
that's so i was thinking about like when

00:53:22.559 --> 00:53:23.839
that transition is in the black

00:53:23.839 --> 00:53:26.000
community right like i feel like right

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.920
like when people stop telling you you

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.800
look young for your age yeah

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:32.559
you can start blocking in yeah yeah i

00:53:32.559 --> 00:53:34.559
wonder what's the praise the waitress's

00:53:34.559 --> 00:53:35.520
ass

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:37.119
i feel like having a belly helps with it

00:53:37.119 --> 00:53:39.440
a lot too if you want to start younger

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:43.040
you got to belly out yeah

00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:52.079
[Laughter]

00:53:52.079 --> 00:53:53.839
i'm going to bring

00:53:53.839 --> 00:53:57.319
a certain athleticism

00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:07.599
[Laughter]

00:54:07.599 --> 00:54:11.079
chase down women

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:25.200
we get like talking horny dudes like the

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.240
next like

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:28.559
sorry i'm so excited about this

00:54:28.559 --> 00:54:30.079
the next ice bath challenge is like

00:54:30.079 --> 00:54:31.760
filming you running up to a woman at

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:34.000
full speed and stopping and just filming

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.280
her reaction

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:37.490
yeah checking your ram power

00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:46.640
[Laughter]

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:48.400
i don't know if my knees can hold up to

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.559
this challenge yeah well you got to do

00:54:50.559 --> 00:54:52.000
you need to do footwork drills first

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.280
like it's just it's all about how you

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:56.240
stop you can't just come to a dead stop

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:58.000
i'm rehabbing i'm re-having a knee

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.200
injury at the moment let me get out of

00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:00.319
that and then we'll see what the scene

00:55:00.319 --> 00:55:02.000
is we've talked about this before like

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.280
testing the limits on the high speed

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.119
like lifestyle are the limits to like my

00:55:07.119 --> 00:55:09.599
pedestrian speed i think if you're going

00:55:09.599 --> 00:55:11.280
into a rating to buy something you

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:13.119
should sprint directly to the item and

00:55:13.119 --> 00:55:14.880
sprint back to the counter

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:17.440
shouldn't spend any that like rite aid

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:18.799
specifically is a place you should never

00:55:18.799 --> 00:55:21.520
spend more than like an extra second in

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:22.559
sprint to the

00:55:22.559 --> 00:55:23.680
sprint to the back and then once you get

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:24.880
outside it's like okay that was pretty

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:27.440
powerful sprint to the car just bounce

00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:30.960
dude never ever i think the the accepted

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:33.760
walking speed amongst most people is too

00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:35.599
slow by about five miles an hour i think

00:55:35.599 --> 00:55:37.280
so too yeah i mean especially dude if

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:38.720
you if you stepped it up to a full high

00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:41.520
speed lifestyle

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.599
just like imagine being at meeting

00:55:43.599 --> 00:55:45.520
somebody at karamazov like yo it was

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:49.319
great we gotta do it again

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.760
you and your wife and your whole family

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:53.359
just hoofs it dude

00:55:53.359 --> 00:55:55.680
you could be the liver king of the

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.440
speed lifestyle

00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:59.839
like anywhere we go we go as fast as we

00:55:59.839 --> 00:56:01.590
[ __ ] can

00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:06.000
[Laughter]

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.160
you develop fast twitch muscle fibers i

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:10.640
think so you would have to

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:11.839
you have to

00:56:11.839 --> 00:56:13.440
i think so

00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:14.839
yeah dude you would

00:56:14.839 --> 00:56:16.160
become full right

00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.960
they're gonna be kings in this lifestyle

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:21.599
we live a pretty high speed lifestyle

00:56:21.599 --> 00:56:23.520
really it's intermittent high speed

00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:25.119
right now ansley's always ready to break

00:56:25.119 --> 00:56:27.040
into a full sprint yeah we raised our

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:29.520
kids on a high speed lifestyle [ __ ] yeah

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:31.680
like you know how like so we we were

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.200
some of those like parents that would

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:36.319
walk ahead of our kids but instead of us

00:56:36.319 --> 00:56:38.079
you know like we make them close that

00:56:38.079 --> 00:56:40.079
gap you're ahead of them there yeah

00:56:40.079 --> 00:56:42.480
so like ever since my kids could even we

00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.480
also kept our kids at a caloric deficit

00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:45.760
so that they would develop the muscles

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.599
oh no no no they they need to eat dude

00:56:47.599 --> 00:56:49.040
you need to eat to develop a muscle but

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:51.359
so we what we always do

00:56:51.359 --> 00:56:52.960
we always

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:54.480
this is important like

00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.559
when so anytime our kids would run we'd

00:56:56.559 --> 00:56:57.680
always be like get your knees up get

00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:59.599
your knees up yeah right so even when it

00:56:59.599 --> 00:57:01.200
would look ridiculous that they had

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:02.400
their knees up because of the way they

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.000
were running and sometimes they couldn't

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.520
handle the balance for it their head is

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:06.960
still bobbing dude

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.880
it looked insane the way they were and

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:10.079
like they're not even going anywhere

00:57:10.079 --> 00:57:13.359
because they're like so focused

00:57:13.359 --> 00:57:15.599
but like now that they're like my son's

00:57:15.599 --> 00:57:18.400
nine my girls are sick sick so it's like

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:20.720
they're amazing they're fast-paced like

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:22.480
my girls are fast as [ __ ] up they said

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.559
they won a race with a bare feet yeah

00:57:24.559 --> 00:57:26.480
yeah and then my son is like nine and

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:29.440
runs like a 617 mile

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:31.200
what dude that's just all from muscle

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.640
memory of running he doesn't do any

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:34.799
cardio work he just goes he's [ __ ] off

00:57:34.799 --> 00:57:37.119
that jiu jitsu it's just muscle memory i

00:57:37.119 --> 00:57:41.119
wasn't tested for fruit snacks dude

00:57:41.119 --> 00:57:42.000
dude

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.280
i guarantee he's got gushers in it did

00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:44.880
you say we're saccharine i think he got

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:45.920
gushing

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:48.000
dude

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.359
dude i was scared

00:57:49.359 --> 00:57:51.200
of sugar

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:53.040
he's gummy doping for sure come on dude

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.799
up until like five years ago i was like

00:57:54.799 --> 00:57:56.880
scared of running a whole mile

00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:58.640
i thought i would get like sick if i ran

00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:00.160
into that's the threshold that you cross

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.200
and it's like i don't want to find out

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:02.559
who i am on the other side dude i'm

00:58:02.559 --> 00:58:04.400
telling you i like like four years ago i

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:05.680
had a thing in my head i'm like a whole

00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:07.760
[ __ ] mile i'd throw up probably and i

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:09.839
would never do it i would never run a

00:58:09.839 --> 00:58:11.760
whole mile and now i finally did it like

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.280
two years ago i ran a whole mile there

00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:14.720
is something powerful like when you're a

00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:16.720
child you're like i just ran an entire

00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:17.760
mile

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.920
i didn't do it till i was an adult wow

00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:22.319
the best of my knowledge i cannot know i

00:58:22.319 --> 00:58:24.720
i don't know that ever they measure the

00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:26.640
circumference of the earth in miles and

00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:28.079
i just ran one of them that's what i'm

00:58:28.079 --> 00:58:29.839
saying it was so powerful yeah that's

00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:33.119
like that stuff's for highways i'm like

00:58:33.119 --> 00:58:35.839
i'm gonna do that

00:58:37.359 --> 00:58:39.040
yeah i want to test the limits of the

00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:41.760
pedestrian speed limit like

00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:43.920
how what's what were they what named

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:45.599
after me i always hear they clock what

would they clock me in the mall dude

00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.760
yeah and like can i jump the steps like

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:50.400
what

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.400
yeah what am i about to do about like

00:58:57.599 --> 00:58:59.280
come on keep it down

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:00.480
you're gonna start seeing no running

00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:02.319
signs everywhere like prejudice dude

00:59:02.319 --> 00:59:04.720
they're prejudiced against us

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:07.280
we're being suppressed yeah dude maybe

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:08.880
the classic scene from the movie where

00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:10.480
like instead of the car going past the

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.079
guy with the radar going to be me going

00:59:12.079 --> 00:59:13.920
like just running casting a fat dude

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:16.400
like a halfway button shirt do i be like

00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.799
oh god dammit you have to come after me

00:59:18.799 --> 00:59:20.799
i would love the like the forums i would

00:59:20.799 --> 00:59:23.440
blaze those dudes

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:24.960
i want to just test myself against all

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.960
most that might be my physical goals to

00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:29.680
just be able to completely like get a

00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:31.440
complete like tomb raider i think you

00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:34.000
view all security if you see a classic

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.680
big fat mall security guard you have

00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:37.680
like a duty to like knock something over

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:39.280
and run away from it

00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:41.040
it's very compelling you have to get him

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:43.359
like oh the initial shuffle like [ __ ]

00:59:43.359 --> 00:59:46.640
falls off of his belt he's like

00:59:52.319 --> 00:59:54.240
that would be tight to test

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:55.839
to call the mall owners like dude we

00:59:55.839 --> 00:59:57.119
have a security company where we come

00:59:57.119 --> 00:59:59.599
and test your security dude imagine

00:59:59.599 --> 01:00:01.440
doing that we could test small security

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.119
full security combat and then see what

01:00:03.119 --> 01:00:04.880
kind of like what kind of griffs we and

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.319
what kind of like crimes we could pull

01:00:06.319 --> 01:00:08.000
off yeah and obviously like we're the

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.040
part of our firm is like they're gonna

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.160
get everything back we're secret

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.839
criminals we're filming it all right

01:00:11.839 --> 01:00:13.440
we're we're seeing what kind of i always

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.119
wanted to do this forever to call like

01:00:15.119 --> 01:00:16.319
retail and different companies be like

01:00:16.319 --> 01:00:18.400
dude i will come crying i'll come crime

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:20.799
proof your guys lost prevention yeah

01:00:20.799 --> 01:00:22.640
basically but i'll carry out active

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.839
things and like break it down here's how

01:00:23.839 --> 01:00:26.319
we did it now it would be really sick

01:00:26.319 --> 01:00:28.960
is if you just started stealing and

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.960
convince them that this was true that

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.880
would be the ultimate that's the

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.799
ultimate that one step down is actually

01:00:34.799 --> 01:00:36.240
forming the company and providing the

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.480
service yeah but the ultimate the top of

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:40.640
the mountain is getting caught stealing

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:41.839
and then hitting him with this and be

01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:43.440
like yeah i'm a secret criminal thanks

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.119
you guys are great and then be like that

01:00:45.119 --> 01:00:46.480
was the next when you get caught if you

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.920
if you get caught when you go you need

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.480
to fill out if you're caught you go

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.319
perfect that was the next level of our

01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:53.920
service yeah you're giving them a

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.760
business card you're like

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.200
do me a favor if you guys thought this

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.839
went okay call in give feedback for me

01:00:59.839 --> 01:01:01.440
yeah true you know and then it could be

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:02.960
like and also if you want to know how to

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.319
steal from walmart if you want to hurt

01:01:04.319 --> 01:01:07.920
those there's uh their earnings

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:09.440
there's a security guard in the mall

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:12.400
that i frequent he's jacked as [ __ ] and

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.720
every time we walk past each other

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.319
there's this noticeable

01:01:16.319 --> 01:01:17.839
vibe between both of us where we're both

01:01:17.839 --> 01:01:19.920
like yeah [ __ ] around and find out

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:22.079
really yeah you might have to speed past

01:01:22.079 --> 01:01:23.680
him i might have to you might have to

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.079
[ __ ] blow past him dude he's the

01:01:26.079 --> 01:01:27.680
prime test candidate

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.839
i think he is i think he i think he

01:01:29.839 --> 01:01:31.599
wants to prove is he elite in terms of

01:01:31.599 --> 01:01:32.720
all security

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.799
as far as physicality for sure he

01:01:34.799 --> 01:01:36.079
definitely looks like a guy that like

01:01:36.079 --> 01:01:38.480
crosses the tees and dots his eyes so he

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.319
might be he's tactical

01:01:40.319 --> 01:01:41.520
yeah he looks he looks very what he's

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.799
doing he's putting yeah he's putting

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:44.000
together a resume to go to the state

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.319
police yeah for sure but he's been there

01:01:46.319 --> 01:01:48.400
for a while so

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.839
yeah well it's like when you fight

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:51.200
outside the ufc you want to come in as

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.960
the champ

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.160
with small security before he goes in

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.079
the state yeah he's high level that'd be

01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:58.640
another sick business of staging like

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.839
attempted uh like armed robberies with

01:02:01.839 --> 01:02:03.119
with those guys so they can get the

01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:05.119
footage of them like taking down you

01:02:05.119 --> 01:02:07.280
could easily stage those videos those

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.559
dudes will get those guys if you go

01:02:08.559 --> 01:02:09.920

those dudes usually get

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.720
taken up by like police departments so

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.000

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.960
know how the airports they have

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.799
um

01:05:44.799 --> 01:05:46.640
like the little like grass and fire

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:47.839
hydrant for people that are traveling

01:05:47.839 --> 01:05:49.440
with dogs yeah

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.119
yeah what about like the vmas they had

01:05:51.119 --> 01:05:53.760
like a little fake like hotel elevator

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:56.160
setups

01:05:57.039 --> 01:06:00.839
all right all right

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.039
like

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.160
they had you know they have like they're

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.839
like the koi tart like you put like a

01:06:21.839 --> 01:06:23.920
coin in a car you sit outside there's a

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:27.200
lamborghini you can sit in just

01:06:27.599 --> 01:06:29.520
you can take your side of your christmas

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:32.240
hit your girlfriend

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.079
it's got like a half a boxing dummy

01:06:34.079 --> 01:06:36.160
sitting in the passenger seat and you

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.079
just have to like somehow damage the

01:06:38.079 --> 01:06:40.480
head enough it's keeping track of it

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.839
and you're racking up a high score it's

01:06:41.839 --> 01:06:43.200
like the punch machine with the high

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.880
score and you're just seeing how hard

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:46.160
you can like break the bridge of her

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.000
nose with your head with your forearm

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.319
there was a quiet when ray rice i'll be

01:06:50.319 --> 01:06:52.720
honest when ray rice what was the outcry

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.920
in the black community when he like

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:55.599
sucked that chick

01:06:55.599 --> 01:06:57.200
it was i think the outcry was like nah

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:00.599
that ain't right

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:04.480
that was after they went through an

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:07.359
official but what did she say for what

01:07:07.359 --> 01:07:09.200
you got to know i think they had a they

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.280
had a formal black inquiry they said but

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.960
what did she say to him first and then

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.160
they found out what she said and said no

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.599
that's too much yeah yeah you got to

01:07:15.599 --> 01:07:16.880
know it's important to know what she

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:18.240
said true

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.920
because they you know because

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:21.599
[ __ ] be popping up yeah true yeah

01:07:21.599 --> 01:07:23.119
they filed paperwork for i want to know

01:07:23.119 --> 01:07:24.960
what she had said to him yeah

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.240
i mean and it's like most of the time

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:28.720
just he was like well i mean she

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.160
shouldn't have said that but yeah that's

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:33.440
doing it right yes so

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:38.559
that's a split decision yeah

01:07:39.039 --> 01:07:40.720
that's definitely right yeah

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.880
you barely got the call

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:46.960
yeah 29-28 victory

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.720
damn we might be two where are you

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.680
real serious business talk to you and i

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.599
would say that was a lot of fun

01:08:03.599 --> 01:08:05.520
yeah so that was fun but again i can't

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:06.960
stop thinking about how you talk about

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:09.119
just trying to study the science of fun

01:08:09.119 --> 01:08:10.720
that's that's all this is dude it's

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.000
crazy it's crazy it's like field of

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.200
study because you can't observe it

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.720
directly because the second you look at

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.239
it it starts like disappear it's like

01:08:16.239 --> 01:08:18.000
it's quantum it's it's quantum the

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.080
observable effect like i might come to a

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:21.600
party and it might i might observe a

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:22.560
party and everyone's like what the

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:25.679
[ __ ] this guy doing here

01:08:25.679 --> 01:08:28.400
and then the party somehow morphs

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:30.159
fun

01:08:30.159 --> 01:08:32.319
the second you start to examine a good

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:34.080
time it falls apart

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:35.440
true that's why you got to be there yeah

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.199
you got to be there independently like

01:08:37.199 --> 01:08:39.520
phone yeah it's almost like the study of

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.759
fun is actually very laborious

01:08:41.759 --> 01:08:43.279
yeah it's fresh because you can't use

01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:45.040
your you can't directly focus on the fun

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.640
you have to use like your peripheral

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:49.759
senses in every regard to study like you

01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:51.600
have to be like whoa this is a good time

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:53.520
there's got to be you have to be doing

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:54.880
everything possible to have a good time

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:55.920
and you're like wow this is pretty

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:56.960
[ __ ] sick

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.319
true then you're back to heaven it's

01:08:58.319 --> 01:08:59.679
like back to having fun yeah yeah but

01:08:59.679 --> 01:09:01.199
you have to be there has to be things to

01:09:01.199 --> 01:09:02.640
be able to figure out how to have more

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.400
dude you can't i mean anything can be

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.719
quantified yeah like like we established

01:09:06.719 --> 01:09:08.319
last time like the one thing that would

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:10.400
be like in the minus you know when

01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:11.679
you're like you have a long equation you

01:09:11.679 --> 01:09:14.080
have this this plus this a minus thing

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.480
would be being a dick yeah yeah sure so

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:18.319
that would we already have one quotient

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:19.920
we've got one tenant yeah let me put it

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:21.199
to you this way how much fun do you

01:09:21.199 --> 01:09:23.040
think we just had

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.279
uh i mean dude being with your boys has

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:27.679
to be a positive just hanging with me i

01:09:27.679 --> 01:09:28.799
also don't feel comfortable giving a

01:09:28.799 --> 01:09:30.960
number without like proper analysis and

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:31.920
yeah

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.239
we don't have it counterproductive yeah

01:09:34.239 --> 01:09:36.159
yeah that was fun yeah i'm just curious

01:09:36.159 --> 01:09:38.080
i had fun yeah i would say i would say

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:41.120
unofficially i had a great time yeah

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.640
off the record yeah

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.960
oh the record i enjoyed myself yeah once

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.880
you start trying to actually describe

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:48.480
how much fun you have i mean dude starts

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.560
to get a little gang

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.000
at the end of every podcast that you

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.120
like they were like i would say had a

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.719
really great time

01:09:54.719 --> 01:09:56.320
you have a great time

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:57.760
think about think about if you went two

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.360
years without having any fun there's a

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.960
lot of dudes have no fun too bro we were

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.640
talking about it we were talking about a

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.159
type of just go to the page

01:10:04.159 --> 01:10:06.320
oh yeah

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:09.320
sorry
