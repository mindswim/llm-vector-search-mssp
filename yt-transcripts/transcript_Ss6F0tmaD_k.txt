Title: Shane Gillis - Adam Carolla Show 9/17/21
Description: Shane Gillis is in studio for a one-on-one conversation with Adam. They begin by talking about how woke culture is destroying comedy, and then flash back to Shane’s upbringing and how he eventually got to audition for Saturday Night Live. From there they talk about the excitement of joining the cast, followed by the surprise of getting ‘cancelled’ four days later. They also discuss the shift in people who are censoring others, keeping in touch with Lorne Michaels, and supporting the people who were unnecessarily cancelled. As the conversation wraps up, they talk about the importance of being able to say what you want as a comedian, and Shane’s love of performing standup.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.439
thank you i uh

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.920
i know your story obviously yeah many

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.760
people do we've gone over it a little

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.160
bit toward the beginning of the show

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.079
i think we all like the kind of

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.960
redemption part of of these stories but

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.879
i'm also

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.160
um

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.320
i have some parallels with your story

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.079
which is i just got to go do it for

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:45.680
myself now i don't think there's going

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.879
to be any more relying on hbo or netflix

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.039
or comedy central or it's just going to

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.600
be just go out and hang your own shingle

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.680
and do it yourself yeah

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.600
certainly is is

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.000
which which i do think is a blessing

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.760
kind of big picture it's just the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.840
beginning part sucks

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.519
definitely and it's it's funny talking

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.200
like other comics and stuff that like

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.360
they view it as like a death sentence

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.799
because the only thing they can imagine

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.280
is like the industry right you know what

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.960
i mean right they're like oh you're

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.720
gonna you're gonna have to do it on your

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.320
own now it's like yeah i kind of had a

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.320
feeling i was gonna have to

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.520
well you know it's funny i i oftentimes

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.360
think about these conversations i have

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.600
with a lot of the kids who work here who

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.680
aren't kids anymore and should stop

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.439
[ __ ] acting like no

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.240
uh

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.000
but but i would say to him i remember

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.439
chris i probably had this conversation

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.000
with you maybe matt whatever gary

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.240
i had conversations like six seven years

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.360
ago where i was like i got to get my

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.439
phone installed the uh house line

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.520
installed and they'd go why

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.360
what do you mean why because i live in a

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.600
house you idiot i need a phone

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.079
once you just use your cell phone

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.600
because this is a house phone i'm in the

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.119
house yeah i need it and i need it and

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.640
they'd go you don't need it just use

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.399
your phone and i'd go

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.200
yeah but this is my cell phone

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.119
this is my house phone yeah i'm gonna

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.640
meet the guy who's gonna install the

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.560
phone he's gonna pull the line in from

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.879
the power pole and i'm like

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.400
i realize i think about that all the

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.400
time it wasn't that long ago

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.400
these guys were making fun of me for

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.720
putting a phone hard-wired phone in my

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.120
house and i was telling them they were

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.160
crazy but the only excuse i could offer

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.319
was this is how we always did it yeah

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.080
that's all i had and i feel the same way

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.400
about comedy it's like hbo

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.319
netflix showtime whatever you go you

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.440
want to be in that because that's the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.560
way everyone did it but not anymore yeah

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.800
i still want that landline though

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.040
i'd still love a landline

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.480
the next one hopefully the next one's a

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.040
landline well that's the

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.360
that's the question did you take this

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.840
special which i think has over a million

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.319
views on youtube it's getting there yeah

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.840
uh and

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.319
did you take it out and shop it around

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.760
or did you kind of figure it out it was

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.280
funny because my

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.120
managers and agents they were like let's

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.000
shop it and i was like no like that's

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.640
what and then what like wait a week for

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.159
them to all say no

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.599
right just put it out there no one's

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.440
gonna take it and no one's gonna take it

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.760
because of the snl dust up

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.760
yeah the snl dust up

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.159
what i talk about and who i am

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.720
in my opinion if i had to guess

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.680
right

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.640
so i'm in this boat too there's

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.000
what you know about you yeah but then

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.200
what

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.319
you know people know about you sure and

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.319
there's a chasm between those two

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.480
thoughts sometimes

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.560
and it's kind of hard to talk people out

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.920
of what people know about you

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.599
and the reason it's hard to talk people

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.000
out of it is because it's not really

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.159
true and it's harder to talk people out

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.640
of stuff that's not true definitely and

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.000
it's hard to and then the second you

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.439
start defending yourself for something

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.799
that's not true

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.799
yeah it gives it validation so what do

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.360
you think the people at netflix think

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.159
they know about you i think if i had to

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:05.599
guess i think there's a bunch of people

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.519
at netflix that have seen me and think

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.519
i'm very funny and if i had to guess

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.120
there's probably

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.280
five people there that are

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.120
kind of holding everyone hostage as to

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.120
what type of content they make

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.359
and who they select and all that

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.199
i think that go i think that that's kind

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.960
of the industry standard

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.600
so it's basically like what vegetarians

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.040
do to us yeah exactly we go

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.320
anyone has ever

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.840
done a production tv show movie whatever

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.680
there's uh 80 people on the set

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.840
three of them are vegetarians

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.120
but

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.479
we must get

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:43.680
50

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.680
beef steak subs and 50 veggie shots

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.919
right because the [ __ ] three are

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.360
controlling

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.320
the other

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.040
77 people that are on that set and it's

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.440
kind of that way artistically i mean the

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.759
zeitgeist is that way black lives matter

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.639
the times were in netflix it's a handful

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.199
of woke [ __ ] sort of

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.919
deciding which way the wind is blowing

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.479
for the company definitely and it also

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.560
you don't want to come off like a

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.280
like a sore loser or like a uh they're

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.120
not picking me because of this type

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.560
thing you know what i mean does that

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.759
make sense like

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:21.360
i'm afraid to i'm not afraid but like

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.240
i'm i'm very conscious of vocalizing

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.320
like the reason they're not picking me

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.759
is because of this

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.840
because right but that's an excuse a lot

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.720
of very bad comedians can make

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.560
yeah because you have people go hey dude

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.160
make a funnier special next time yeah

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.000
that's it or write a better book or make

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.520
a better independent

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.560
rom-com

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.400
or documentary or whatever just make a

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.479
better one and it's hard to argue

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.800
because it's invisible exactly and it's

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.840
also sort of in the ear of the beholder

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.560
so for you why don't we uh step back a

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.680
little bit

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.759
and start with your

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:57.680
upbringing and then figure out you know

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.919
we'll go through snl and we'll get to

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.759
here and sure we'll sail past where

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:03.680
we're at now all right

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.199
uh i'm from mechanicsburg pennsylvania

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.120
uh grew up nice middle class suburban

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.840
family catholic played sports

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.360
everything's good

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.240
uh went to army went to west point for

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.600
football

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.880
quit right away

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.919
right why uh right away uh it was hard

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:25.680
yeah yeah

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.240
and i cried really yeah i cried i cried

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.000
football and army are essentially the

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.919
same thing it's just it turns out

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:36.000
screaming at you football is way harder

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.639
than boot camp and football's bro

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:41.680
in college football sucks

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.520
i played a lot of football people have

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.319
no idea how brutal it is and and by the

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:47.039
way

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:49.520
it's never the games it's all the only

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.080
practices it's only practice and then at

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.120
the college level you practice like

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.800
uh like

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.080
8 a.m to 9 00 p.m every day it's just

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.560
meetings lifting film

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.240
training room film

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.520
right i mean it's just

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.360
it sucks especially when you suck and i

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.680
sucked well you had to be good enough to

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.759
get a get recruited to play there right

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:13.039
yeah i was good in high school because i

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:14.400
was big

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.160
yeah the and then the work ethic part

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.759
came in and i

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:19.520
faltered the other part about football

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.000
that nobody understands is when you play

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.039
o-line like you play offensive tackle

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:27.360
uh in many other positions you don't

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.960
even touch a football you don't see a

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.720
football you do nothing that has to do

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.400
with football it's a totally different

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.680
sport

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.280
you know i never thought about this i

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.800
played 11 years of football okay

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.240
when you were would you what position

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.240
you i played a defensive linebacker

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.360
offensive card okay when you are playing

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.240
football for fun

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.639
you are either quarterback or wide

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:52.080
receiver

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.000
defensive back you're throwing the ball

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.360
you're catching the ball you're pitching

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.280
the ball that's what you do when you're

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.680
playing for fun yeah you're never just

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.919
blocking the entire time i mean if they

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:03.280
said hey we're going to the b chain

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.879
we're playing football you're gonna be

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:06.720
blocking you're just tired no you're not

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.840
touching the football and you're not

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.039
going down on the pass you're not

00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:10.240
running you're not passing you're not

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.879
even tackling

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.960
it's the least fun thing i've ever

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.639
participated in well that's what

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:18.639
football yeah that's about 80 of

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:20.639
football yeah it's funny because that

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:22.639
yeah i have friends that played you know

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:25.280
they played wide out and and quarterback

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.360
and all that i've i literally played a

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.520
different sport offensive blind is a

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.320
different sport offensive line is

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.519
the most thankless boring [ __ ] most

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:37.360
the most miniature concussions you're

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.560
going to get sure

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.839
with boredom sprinkled in ever with zero

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:44.320
praise and almost no dick sucking from

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.320
cheerleaders yeah

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.800
that's how i was i played offensive line

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.880
but then i played defense i was like oh

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.959
yeah that's now it's [ __ ] awesome

00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:54.800
this is awesome and then i'd go back to

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.480
offense again and it was bored off my

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.279
head yes so you go to you go to westwood

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:01.519

yeah i played one season of college

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.320

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.720
army navy and

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.959
at texas a m there was so many like as

00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:28.800
far as like getting recruited i was

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.000
getting recruited by like eastern

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.560
michigan temple and army

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.200
army was like yeah that was cool so you

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.600
went there you flamed out yeah you

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.440
trained flamed out i mean i was talking

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.560
we're talking

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.320
didn't even light the match

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.560
really just showed up violet just showed

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.160
up and i was like i'm gonna head out

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:46.959
yeah

00:09:46.959 --> 00:09:48.800
uh

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.240
yeah then i went to elon in north

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.160
carolina it's one double a you remember

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.720
when app state beat michigan

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.640
appalachian city yeah yeah that was we

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.480
were in the conference with them and we

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.000
played them that year like that was the

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.440
conference it was like georgia southern

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.560
furman

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.880
so you went you went to a place that

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.399
you felt you could fit in a little

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:09.040
wasn't quite as regimented yeah for sure

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.440
but the football was just as

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.360
just as good mm-hmm and so that that was

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.200
the hardest part was

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.800
physically getting your ass kicked every

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.600
day

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.839
yeah but i i don't know i feel like

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:22.640
there's a lot of growth in there too

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.440
and

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.240
as monotonous and thankless and boring

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.720
as o-line is

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.680
it's a kind of good lesson in that you

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.200
gotta sacrifice and give yourself up and

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.240
and do your job so that somebody else

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.880
can carry the ball across the goal line

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.519
and be mobbed by the adoring teammates

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:45.600
and fans right yeah for sure sort of the

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.760
opposite of stand up yeah if you think

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.839
about it definitely the opposite does

00:10:49.839 --> 00:10:51.360
like being a writer

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.399
yeah versus being up on stage yeah

00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:56.800
so um

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.640
you do a year

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.040
there and then what

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.720
and i quit football

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.079
and after that i just stopped going to

00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:06.079
like school stopped going whatever get

00:11:06.079 --> 00:11:09.360
home i graduated from westchester

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.560
in outside of philly uh sold cars when i

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.440
got home and then uh

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.440
started doing stand-up so then i moved

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.600
to philly i lived in philly for like

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.360
five years six years

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.880
uh doing stand-up and then when i was 30

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.880
so like two three years ago i moved to

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.680
new york and then within a year i got

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.160
the snl thing was stand-up always

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.000
something or at least comedy always

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.839
something that was sort of

00:11:35.839 --> 00:11:38.000
sort of rattling around in your head

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.440
yeah absolutely

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.839
but you didn't come from a background

00:11:41.839 --> 00:11:43.839
that fostered that

00:11:43.839 --> 00:11:46.480
uh everybody was funny my family's very

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.600
funny mm-hmm very like dark

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.079
humor for sure

00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:54.959
and were funny yeah where but did they

00:11:54.959 --> 00:11:56.399
think you were funny

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:58.639
yes well that's good i think so i don't

00:11:58.639 --> 00:11:59.839
know no i think they thought i was

00:11:59.839 --> 00:12:01.920
annoying but were you ready i'm like i'm

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.839
the youngest yeah

00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:04.800
so

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.959
family's funny family has a problem with

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:10.800
alcohol yeah and uh the funny and

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.800
alcohol are good to a point and then at

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.880
a certain point you drop off then it

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.639
gets mean then it turns then it gets

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:18.240
mean at a certain point eventually it's

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.839
a fight on the way up the hill it's

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:22.560
funny on the way down the other side it

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.160
can get me well you keep digging until

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.600
you hit like the worst thing you can

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.600
possibly say right while you're drinking

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.360
you're like i'll say this right you keep

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.720
pulling it off and then finally you're

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.800
like yeah your wife's a [ __ ] right oh

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.920
we got to fight

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.639
so

00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:37.360
uh now you're selling cars sure you're

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.800
you're sorry you're living in philly

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.480
selling cars as you the stand up does

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.720
somebody say you got to go do this i

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.920
mean there's

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.440
two types of stand-ups i interviewed

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.600
they're the people whose friends at work

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.480
signed them up for the competition

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.720
that's validating because this is dude

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.720
you work with yeah then there's people

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.320
who no one says they're funny but they

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.680
do it anyway

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.040
and then there's the people where it's

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.480
sort of in between their friends their

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.560
family i think they're funny

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.760
i think i was a little in between there

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.959
was a guy

00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:07.920
in

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.720
mechanicsburg that was doing an open mic

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.959
one of my co-workers was going to do an

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.079
open mic and somebody was like hey do

00:13:14.079 --> 00:13:16.480
you want to go watch him do stand-up and

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.079
i was like oh [ __ ] like i didn't even i

00:13:18.079 --> 00:13:19.839
had no idea how to even get into

00:13:19.839 --> 00:13:21.760
stand-up comedy like there was there's

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.079
zero comedy in mechanicsburg

00:13:24.079 --> 00:13:26.399
and uh so then i went and watched him do

00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:28.639
stand-up and i was like oh i can do this

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:30.000
you know it was one of those feelings

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.200
like i was at an open mic at the

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.200
harrisburg comedy zone and i was like i

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.680
can i'm just as good as these people

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.360
and so like

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.240
a month later i tried it and i was not

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.320
it was very very bad

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.639
but you know i liked it

00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:47.600
yeah it kept going yeah and

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.079
and so and then what was the move to new

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:51.040
york

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.959
um

00:13:52.959 --> 00:13:54.639
so there's some there's new york comics

00:13:54.639 --> 00:13:56.720
like dan soder and big j ogres and they

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.639
were like coming through philly i would

00:13:58.639 --> 00:13:59.680
feature for them when they were at

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.560
helium in philly and so they started

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.000
taking me on the road

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.560
and i yeah just i felt like i was good

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.959
enough to make the jump to new york

00:14:08.959 --> 00:14:11.120
and uh yeah

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.760
i know the uh snl story

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.920
many people do but i don't know there's

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.639
some interesting facets to it certainly

00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:20.240
um

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.079
you were

00:14:22.079 --> 00:14:23.839
you you

00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:25.920
was snl now a lot of people grow up with

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.320
the dream of snl

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.079
they just watched every episode and

00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:32.240
that's the end-all be-all yeah but that

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.440
wasn't you

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.880
no and you're more of a stand-up than a

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.560
sketch person although you do some

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.320
really funny sketch stuff we can get

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.600
into as well

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.600
but so for you

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.680
how does snl come about when you're not

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.920
pursuing it um

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.800
they had just seen me at just for laughs

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.720
montreal

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.480
yeah there was a comedy festival i did

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.560
new faces so that's

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.160
for the listener that's just like a you

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.839
know up and coming comedians they have a

00:14:59.839 --> 00:15:02.480
showcase for new comics and uh i guess

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.000
there were people from snl that were at

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:04.720
the

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.120
showcase and they were like he was funny

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.880
so they contacted my agents and they

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.639
asked me to do like a writing writing

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:13.040
packet and i didn't i didn't do it i was

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.880
like i'm not i don't want to be a writer

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.480
and i'm probably not going to ever work

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.839
for snl

00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:19.120
and then they were like all right that's

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.480
fine he didn't do the writer's packet we

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.320
want him to audition

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.480
and so like i was a little like i don't

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.680
know but then they were like he doesn't

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.199
have to do the preliminary audition he

00:15:27.199 --> 00:15:28.959
can just come in and audition on the

00:15:28.959 --> 00:15:30.720
main stage

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.399
just so just straight to the main stage

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:34.079
audition and i was like all right yes

00:15:34.079 --> 00:15:35.360
i'll do that

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.519
and it seems yeah so it seems

00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:39.759
interesting that they were just watching

00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:41.839
you do stand up did you do any

00:15:41.839 --> 00:15:44.079
impressions in that stand-up no i don't

00:15:44.079 --> 00:15:45.040
think so

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.759
so they just liked your ideas i mean the

00:15:47.759 --> 00:15:49.279
way you thought

00:15:49.279 --> 00:15:51.839
yeah and yet it's not a format for

00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:54.480
stand-up but they saw something and they

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.639
thought maybe we can yeah i think they

00:15:56.639 --> 00:15:58.560
might have i think

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.959
uh i think they saw that i would be good

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:02.079
at the desk

00:16:02.079 --> 00:16:04.320
or like daily uh weekend update and all

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.360
that stuff

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.959
i think that was like where they were

00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:08.800
probably going to place me

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.639
does that mean doing the news or does

00:16:10.639 --> 00:16:12.959
that mean sliding in i think initially

00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:15.199
it means sliding in mm-hmm and doing

00:16:15.199 --> 00:16:17.040
basically stand-up which is what that is

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.399
to some extent and then i think maybe i

00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:21.360
don't know

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.800
it's tough to say i'd

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.800
host weekend update but yeah

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.800
so you go do the

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.160
you're going to do the truth never on

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.279
the show like yeah i'd probably be

00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:31.199
hosting it

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:33.199
so you go try out

00:16:33.199 --> 00:16:36.800
and uh walk us through that process uh

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.720
so what they do

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.399
did you ever no

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:42.880
they put you in the they put you in like

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.279
there's there's probably like 15

00:16:45.279 --> 00:16:47.360
20 people auditioning i don't even know

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.279
uh they put you all in green rooms all

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:51.279
like the cast screen rooms and all that

00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:54.880
so you're in 30 rock and then uh

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.399
they make you wait they make you wait

00:16:56.399 --> 00:16:58.959
like three hours you just sit there

00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:00.639
because i guess it's like a tactic to

00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:02.160
make you like nervous

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.600
or like see how you handle pressure or

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.559
whatever

00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:06.959
uh but the whole time i didn't i i

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:08.400
genuinely was like i'm never going to

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.319
get this i don't care so i was very calm

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:14.160
and never you were going to do stand up

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.360
for yourself

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.439
five minutes of stand up was it stand up

00:17:17.439 --> 00:17:19.120
you knew like the back of your hand or

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.360
did you shape it a little bit dude i

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.799
remember changing it right at the last

00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:25.439
second and i forget how i changed it

00:17:25.439 --> 00:17:27.360
i think my my my one friend reggie was

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.919
like you should do an impression

00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:31.600
you might have done one

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.960
i've yeah anyway so i didn't care at all

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.960
and then when you walk out into to do

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.280
the audition you see the stage then it

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.120
hits you and then you're like oh [ __ ] i

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.520
do care you still like i was i was cause

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.520
you're on the actual snl stage so

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.360
nervous yeah you're on the stage where

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.720
they do the opening monologue and the

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.559
band as well right and then like lauren

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:52.960
michaels is just sitting there

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.880
and the whole studio is empty there's

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.559
just a camera

00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:58.320
five feet in front of you

00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.760
it was yeah it was probably the most

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.440
nervous i've ever been

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.120
i have uh

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.320
had to do plenty of that kind of stuff

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.960
in terms of i don't know some big award

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.600
show and the day before the afternoon of

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.400
you go out and there's some big arena or

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.120
some big venue and there's nobody there

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.320
and you just have to go through your

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.679
monologue and it's the worst yeah

00:18:21.679 --> 00:18:24.799
always far more nervous out there with a

00:18:24.799 --> 00:18:26.559
couple of the director and the chick

00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:28.480
with the headphone headset on and the

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.640
stage hands and all that just doing it

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.960
to an empty place i'd say any comedian

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.679
would much rather have that place filled

00:18:35.679 --> 00:18:37.280
than just a few people sitting on

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.880
folding chairs

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.120
and it's counterintuitive to some people

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.640
because some people go oh well there's

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.320
only a few people in there but to a

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.840
comedian

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.960
that's hell

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.280
yeah it was that was yeah it's the worst

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.799
it's embarrassing

00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:52.559
it makes it embarrassing like you don't

00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:54.400
stand up for no one it's very

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.120
embarrassing yes you're in a club

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.120
there's a contact and if you're alone on

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.160
a bus

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.320
you seem insane yeah

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.559
so you start off and you remember how it

00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:05.840
went

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.000
i don't i genuinely don't but i do

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.559
remember getting laughs which they said

00:19:10.559 --> 00:19:12.559
wouldn't happen they're like the lauren

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:14.559
and the writers and all them won't laugh

00:19:14.559 --> 00:19:16.720
so just pretend they're not there and go

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.480
but yeah once i started i got some

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.559
laughs right away and i was like oh nice

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:22.320
and then just kept you know that was it

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.360
got done

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.720
you walk straight out you don't say

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.679
anything to

00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:26.880
anybody

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.799
uh

00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:30.320
and i i thought i thought i sucked

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.760
because i was nervous like i was my hand

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.520
was shaking with the mic

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.400
so i was like this is bad yeah

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.880
and then i ran into michael che

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.400
that night

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.400
after and he was like no that was really

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.440
good at a club or yeah at a show and he

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.720
was like no that was actually really

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.200
good and uh i was like i thought i was

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.559
you know my [ __ ] hand was shaking i

00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:52.080
was nervous and he was like you were the

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.320
you were the most calm one wow and i was

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.240
like oh [ __ ] and yeah it just went from

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.600
there like where it was the whole time i

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.600
was like all right this has gotta end

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.200
this isn't gonna work and then it just

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.880
kept being like

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.120
no you're our favorite no you got it now

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.520
you're on the cast now you you know

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.760
in the course of how many days

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.880
two weeks

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.640
it went from like literally

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.679
zero

00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:17.200
to on the show in like two weeks

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.360
that's this is getting canceled in like

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.480
four days

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.600
like it was gonna be like yeah you're

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.159
driving a forklift in philly and then

00:20:26.159 --> 00:20:28.720
you're banging sandra bullock yeah like

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.320
ten days later instead of believing in

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.120
him

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.720
living in malibu

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.960
is your right

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.919
and then you're just back on the

00:20:35.919 --> 00:20:40.159
forklift that's right [ __ ] just happened

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.000
yeah that was a good story for the other

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.520
guys in the warehouse

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.960
because they probably never banged

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.840
sandra

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.600
but it was literally that like you were

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.960
i mean you were a comedian you're

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.880
working and stuff like that but somehow

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.200
pow you're on snl you're not dreaming of

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.919
it they're signing up to work out on snl

00:20:55.919 --> 00:20:56.880
right yeah

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.880
so um

00:20:58.880 --> 00:20:59.840
you're

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.000
within two weeks they announce you as a

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.600
cast member yeah

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.000
and uh walk us through that if you could

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
please they actually

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.720
caught lauren called to be like because

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.240
after the audition they bring you in to

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.360
like meet everybody and talk to

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.960
everybody and i met with lauren and he

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.679
was like uh i'm gonna use you i'm just

00:21:17.679 --> 00:21:19.919
not sure if it's gonna be a writer or as

00:21:19.919 --> 00:21:22.080
a featured cast member

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:22.880
so

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.480
he thought maybe he would bring me on as

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.159
a writer to kind of like

00:21:26.159 --> 00:21:30.000
learn how the show worked mm-hmm

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.280
yeah that was what he told me he was

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.400
debating

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.400
and then

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.240
one day he called me and was like all

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.840
right we're gonna

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.080
you're gonna go straight to cast

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.080
and then the next day they're announcing

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.679
it so i had like

00:21:43.679 --> 00:21:46.480
they had like 24 hours to like vet me

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.880
and figure out what i've done and said

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.640
and uh yeah i don't think they were used

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.120
to ever checking for podcasts

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.120
yeah in fact i'm certain they weren't

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.720
nobody checked they're looking for

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.159
tweets they're looking for tweets

00:21:58.159 --> 00:21:59.840
facebook and instagram

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.520
because everybody they they put on their

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.120
show is like a

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.159
is a uh improv person not necessarily a

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:08.400
stand-up or somebody that has a podcast

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.159
and how you know were they gonna listen

00:22:10.159 --> 00:22:12.400
to a thousand hours of a podcast

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.880

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.280
show

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.799
it was

00:22:18.799 --> 00:22:22.159
very cool for about four hours

00:22:22.159 --> 00:22:23.840

on the train my agent this is like four

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.600
hours after they announced it my agent

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.400
it was a slur and i was like no i don't

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.919
think i wouldn't say that

00:22:45.919 --> 00:22:47.200
right and then she was like here's an

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.039
audio clip of you or here's a video of

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.880
said it yeah

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.000
because right when she said i was like

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.840

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.480
yeah if i if anyone ever hears me say

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.159

00:23:00.159 --> 00:23:02.320
would that definitely means i said it

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.760
yeah yeah

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.280

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.000
be some disturbing news at some point

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.159
before you walk out on stage if you're

00:23:42.159 --> 00:23:44.400
hang around long enough and say enough

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.960
and have enough kids and whatever else

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.640
something will hit you

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.080
it's got to be tough going out there

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.320
with that it's so fresh

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.559

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.559
when i walked in everyone's like holy

00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:01.919
[ __ ] there's that guy who's getting

00:24:01.919 --> 00:24:02.840
[ __ ]

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.039
crucified so

00:24:05.039 --> 00:24:08.320
first off do you ever really know who is

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.520
leading the campaign like is it a you

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.159
know is it mothers against drunk drivers

00:24:14.159 --> 00:24:19.799
is it the asian americans no this is

00:24:21.919 --> 00:24:23.440
yeah and

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.240
and

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.440
in is is the agenda

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.760
just to get you cancelled

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.559
and is it is it a group or is it just a

00:24:32.559 --> 00:24:35.440
bunch of sort of scattered individual

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.840
karens all over the world i think it's

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.080
yeah if i i i think it's like a it's

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.919
kind of like uh the network thing we

00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:43.760
were talking about they're the vegans

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.720
right it's like there's like

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.960
a hundred people on twitter that enjoy

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.279
this [ __ ] right and they just they've

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:54.400
built a career type thing around this

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.159
canceled type thing or being outraged or

00:24:56.159 --> 00:24:57.840
however you know

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.799
uh

00:24:58.799 --> 00:25:01.120
yeah i don't think it's no one cares

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.039
i i look genuinely no one cares every

00:25:03.039 --> 00:25:04.640
single time

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.559
when i used to do radio million years

00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:08.640
ago like you get called into the program

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.320
director's office and they had three

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.640
letters from the christian community or

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.640
whatever they were very upset that you

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.679
said tits or whatever it is and i'm like

00:25:17.679 --> 00:25:19.360
that's three people and then there's

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.039
three million people that laugh their

00:25:21.039 --> 00:25:23.360
ass off so why are we why aren't we

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.840
taking their feelings into account

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.080
the people want to be entertained you

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.159
know what i mean they're how why are we

00:25:30.159 --> 00:25:31.840
so dismissive

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.480
of their feelings if this person could

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.720
host this show or be a cast member or do

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.240
a radio show or something and they're

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.039
bringing a lot of joy maybe thought

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:44.240
provoking who knows what else to those

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.200
people

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.360
why do they collectively with three

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.640
million people

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.440
have zero vote in this and the [ __ ]

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.799
eight born-agains are steering the [ __ ]

00:25:54.799 --> 00:25:56.880
i don't know that's that's the question

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.600
the other thing that i found interesting

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.960
is if you hang around long enough

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.480
my whole

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.400
early career

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.880
if there was a problem in the network

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.039
and uh the program director you got to

00:26:11.039 --> 00:26:12.880
go down this office something you said

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.760
it was always a religious nut job yeah

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.000
it was religious based it was right it

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.640
was the religious right that didn't like

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.559
your language whatever

00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:25.279
if you get called out now it has nothing

00:26:25.279 --> 00:26:27.039
to do with the religious right no it's a

00:26:27.039 --> 00:26:30.320
[ __ ] lunatic left who never stops

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.200
talking about mccarthyism

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.360
yeah except for they're [ __ ] applying

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.440
it every day of their life to you and

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.440
your career yeah

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.200
it's so interesting that if you just if

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.159
you tapped me on the shoulder in 1999

00:26:44.159 --> 00:26:46.080
and said there's a letter somebody's

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.400
pissed you said i'd go religious nut job

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.360
you do it today i go [ __ ] atheist not

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:55.279
job yeah yeah same nut jobs

00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:56.159
100

00:26:56.159 --> 00:26:57.200
yeah

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.120
i see but that's the thing like i i

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.720
started

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.799
i i started doing like stand up very

00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:05.600
like actually seriously in like 2015 or

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.600
six like so

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.840
i've only been i've only been around

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.440
when it's the left

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.120
right i know i've never been a part of

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.120
it when the right wing where well the

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.120
beauty of the left

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.760
is when it was the right

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.399
they never [ __ ] stopped bellyaching

00:27:22.399 --> 00:27:24.399
about it they never stopped complaining

00:27:24.399 --> 00:27:27.600
about it they they were stuck pigs with

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.640
the religious nut job right controlling

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.240
what they could do or what they could

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.039
say by the way the religious nut job

00:27:35.039 --> 00:27:37.200
right wrote letters and tried to get

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.120
like boycott stuff they weren't very

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.440
they weren't nearly as effective

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.840
these people are [ __ ] neutron bombs

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.919
compared to their [ __ ] muskets that

00:27:45.919 --> 00:27:48.159
the religious right had the religious

00:27:48.159 --> 00:27:49.679
right relatives and people would sort of

00:27:49.679 --> 00:27:52.000
generally ignore it and kind of get on

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.360
with their life they weren't getting

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.600
people cancelled left and right they

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.600
weren't pulling everyone away from their

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.039
livelihoods

00:27:59.039 --> 00:28:01.600
the leftists figured this [ __ ] out not

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.480
sure

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.080
why it's i think the difference it's

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.399
gratifying i wouldn't i wouldn't i'm i

00:28:06.399 --> 00:28:08.000
would not be worried about someone being

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.600
like you're a sinner

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.960

and um i there was several times where

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.399
i'd be on the train and somebody would

00:29:02.399 --> 00:29:04.720
be like looking at their phone like

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.399
looking at me like oh [ __ ] that's you

00:29:06.399 --> 00:29:08.159
that's you you're the guy who's trending

00:29:08.159 --> 00:29:08.880
no

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.760
it's a very good point which is you know

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.159
paula deen made her bones and then got

00:29:14.159 --> 00:29:15.679
cancelled yeah she got she got when she

00:29:15.679 --> 00:29:17.120
got canceled or if you're rich and get

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.240
cancer you're like all right i'll take a

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.720
vacation for a month i'll go to jamaica

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.039
yeah most people put together 20. they

00:29:23.039 --> 00:29:27.159
put together 20 in a polypropylene

00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:29.840
i'll go to parts of south africa she'll

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.559
go to scandinavia so

00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:35.120
yes you you sell a million copies of a

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.960
cookbook and god knows and what else

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.120
whatever your line of clothing is and

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.600
then you get canceled but you basically

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.559
got cancelled on the launching pad

00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:46.880
real challenger yeah

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.320
really you didn't even go you didn't get

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.799
up as high as the challenger

00:29:50.799 --> 00:29:53.039
i mean as it pertains to snl you went on

00:29:53.039 --> 00:29:54.159
the pad

00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:56.240
so they were like uh

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.600
yeah here's the rocket we're thinking

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.480
about

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.640
it just explodes in the warehouse so

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.960
you're you know this is all going on but

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.000
you still have to be thinking

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.600
about the new cycle yeah because if

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.399
if there's another 911 the next day

00:30:12.399 --> 00:30:14.559
i'm off the hook you're off i know i was

00:30:14.559 --> 00:30:15.919
praying for this

00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:17.760
something

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.159
yeah or some you know senator goes on a

00:30:20.159 --> 00:30:22.799
shooting spree or you know oj goes on a

00:30:22.799 --> 00:30:25.039
slow speed chase or whatever it's pretty

00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:28.640
random yeah if if if something can

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.159
capture

00:30:30.159 --> 00:30:32.799
mine was epstein oh is epstein and i

00:30:32.799 --> 00:30:34.320
think i was the thing that covered up

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.600
epstein

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.520
oh really i think i might have been you

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.760
were i think it was a c.i.a

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.279
you were like getting more clicks than

00:30:41.279 --> 00:30:43.520
epstein's couldn't have been but it was

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.320
like

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.399
it was around that time i believe

00:30:46.399 --> 00:30:47.600
so you're

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.200
hoping you're going to wake up the next

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.960
day and they've turned the page and

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.399
moved on

00:30:52.399 --> 00:30:54.960
yeah it's funny i never i yeah i forgot

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.799
about that yes every night you'd go to

00:30:56.799 --> 00:30:57.919
sleep like

00:30:57.919 --> 00:30:59.600
hopefully it's done

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.640
right because you have all these

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.320
well-wishers like you have like managers

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:05.600
and agents and like even snl was like

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.360
hopefully that was it hopefully that's

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.120
the end of it and then you'd wake up the

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.200
next day and it'd be like oh [ __ ] how

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.600
many days did it go on i think it was it

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.679
was either four or five

00:31:15.679 --> 00:31:18.799
and i'm just like how far are you from

00:31:18.799 --> 00:31:21.519
the beginning of snl

00:31:21.519 --> 00:31:24.799
the season oh like two weeks

00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:27.360
season starts in like two weeks right so

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.720
like yeah it was getting close to like

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.760
me having to come in and start working

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.640
but you haven't heard anything thus far

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.480
um

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.200
i mean i was going into like 30 rock and

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:42.399
like lauren's and like sitting down and

00:31:42.399 --> 00:31:44.159
all of them it was funny they were all

00:31:44.159 --> 00:31:45.200
like the whole time they were the ones

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.159
that were like oh we're going to be all

00:31:46.159 --> 00:31:49.679
right i was like no we're not like if

00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:51.200
they're getting me on this

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.039
we're not we're in trouble

00:31:53.039 --> 00:31:55.279
right there's more there's more if they

00:31:55.279 --> 00:31:58.399
say no to this we're we're still

00:31:58.399 --> 00:32:01.519
and again they is randos with computers

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:02.960
and phones spread out all over the

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.679
country never really no there's no

00:32:05.679 --> 00:32:08.399
organization that you know it's it's not

00:32:08.399 --> 00:32:11.600
the southern poverty law center that

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.679
says puts their stamp on it or anything

00:32:13.679 --> 00:32:15.840
like that it's just randos everywhere

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.120
right yeah

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.240
yeah

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.519
and so

00:32:19.519 --> 00:32:21.519
uh at some point

00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:24.799
snl's gotta lower the hammer right yeah

00:32:24.799 --> 00:32:26.399
and i got it

00:32:26.399 --> 00:32:28.240
i understood i wasn't like this is

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.600
outrageous

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.000
right yeah i yeah did they call you did

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
they call you they did yeah no they just

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.159
called me on the phone mm-hmm yeah but i

00:32:36.159 --> 00:32:38.159
still i still talk to lauren like these

00:32:38.159 --> 00:32:39.039
days

00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:42.320
occasionally he's like he's a good yeah

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.720
he's just like my my hands are tied i

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.120
thought i i believe this was i think it

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.799
was new to him i think this culture was

00:32:48.799 --> 00:32:50.720
new to him all right because up until

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.559
this point he's always been like

00:32:52.559 --> 00:32:54.320
we're gonna be fine don't worry about it

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.440
right you know what i mean like no

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.640
matter what happened he'd be like don't

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.159
worry we're going to be fine and then i

00:32:58.159 --> 00:33:00.640
think this was the first time in like

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.360
his career that no

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:06.000
that now it's the internet you know

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.320
right so because he's i think he was a

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.519
little late

00:33:09.519 --> 00:33:11.840
well he's been at the helm for 40 years

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.960
at this point or

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.799
37 years or whatever

00:33:16.799 --> 00:33:18.000
more

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.360
like 45 years at the helm at this point

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.840
so he's like me with the landline going

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.600
come on yeah yeah yeah

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.880
this is gonna work your kids are nuts

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.559
when the [ __ ] goes down you're gonna be

00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:32.799
dying to get to my phone which is bolted

00:33:32.799 --> 00:33:35.120
to the wall in the kitchen

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.200
and so he's probably experiencing it

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.440
almost like you are in the sense that

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.480
like what no come on i mean we can do

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.559
this or whatever and he's he's getting

00:33:44.559 --> 00:33:47.120
schooled up by today's technology yeah

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.480
it was very interesting there was one

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.679
part

00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:50.880
are we allowed to use any type of

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.559
language anytime all right

00:33:52.559 --> 00:33:54.640
so there was one part it was me and this

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.360
is a funny story it's me and lauren

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.440
and we're in an office and we're going

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.799
over like

00:34:00.799 --> 00:34:02.880
if we can just get you to [ __ ] week

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.320
one we're gonna get out of this thing

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.000
once everybody sees who you are we're

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.679
going to be fine and then while we're in

00:34:07.679 --> 00:34:08.960
this meeting he looks at his phone he's

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.879
like oh no

00:34:10.879 --> 00:34:13.280
girls like [ __ ] what what

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.159
i'm not going to say the name of the

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:16.639
person but he's like did you call

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:19.200
a [ __ ] i was like

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.520
i don't know yeah probably it doesn't

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.879
sound like me

00:34:22.879 --> 00:34:24.000
it doesn't sound like something i would

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:24.720
say

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.720
but i was and i was like oh [ __ ] we're

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.800
done that has to be it and he was like

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.040
no it's fine what were we saying like he

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:34.000
he literally was just like no that's you

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.280
[ __ ] up that's fine we're gonna get

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.520
through it but i was like no that's over

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.520
if they have me on record saying that

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.280
yeah you know

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:44.240
it's always so weird because

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:48.399
you used to feel like as a comedian

00:34:48.399 --> 00:34:50.000
you had

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.280
some

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.919
grace or some leeway

00:34:53.919 --> 00:34:56.560
or something some room to maneuver that

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.880
you wouldn't be looked at like a school

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.440
teacher like i was being serious or like

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.480
you're being yes because you're comedian

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.240
that's traditionally

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:09.280
that's it's it's interesting to me

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.480
and to me it's not really the people

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.359
that are calling you out it's all the

00:35:15.359 --> 00:35:17.040
[ __ ] [ __ ]

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.200
that go along with it yeah and i've

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.359
talked to a lot of these people

00:35:21.359 --> 00:35:22.320
and

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.480
what these people do

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.240
because i've seen it so much it's their

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.520
fault because we're really like again

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.599
we're we're talking about the three

00:35:31.599 --> 00:35:33.680
vegans on the set who wants to get the

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.400
veggie subs that no one [ __ ] wants

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.240
it's not really their fault

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.480
they just want their veggie sub agreed

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.320
the person that's taking the order goes

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.599
i'm not gonna get a [ __ ] tray of

00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:45.920
veggie subs you guys are vegetarians

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.920
bring your own [ __ ] sandwiches

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.240
that that's what people hear meat eaters

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.079
we're going to do that or i'll tell you

00:35:52.079 --> 00:35:52.880
what

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.960
i'll get a turkey roast pull the turkey

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.800
off and just [ __ ] eat it yeah but

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.000
they don't do that they go well i'm

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.440
sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry what do you

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.200
need what do you need what do you need

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.040
it's their fault and it's the problem

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.359
like the people i talk to

00:36:05.359 --> 00:36:07.280
and then i'll go like oh god god can

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.200
believe they [ __ ] cancel that guy for

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.040
saying whatever and he's a comedian or

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.800
whatever and they'll go

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.440
yeah yeah i don't agree with that but he

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.200
shouldn't have said it

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.880
you know you go wait a minute you do

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.560
agree with it you don't agree with it

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.640
what do you agree with it's like

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.160
oh yeah

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.359
you know rounding up the jews and

00:36:25.359 --> 00:36:28.160
putting them in the concentration camps

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.800
i disagree with that but

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.119
they were jewish they were being jerks

00:36:33.119 --> 00:36:34.800
yeah like

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.359
you should vehemently disagree

00:36:37.359 --> 00:36:39.599
with it and and if there's a ground

00:36:39.599 --> 00:36:42.560
swell of that this [ __ ] would go away

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.079
tomorrow but there's so many people

00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:47.200
going well i know he's a comedian and i

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.480
know he's supposed to be able to say

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.960
what he wants but he should have known

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.040
or he had to have known or he could have

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.200
known it's like do you want comedians up

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.079
there

00:36:56.079 --> 00:36:57.280
thinking

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.040
ten syllables in front of everything

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.520
they say because i should have known how

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.520
people were going to take this yeah

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.280
especially you know in my particular

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.480
case it's like when you're doing a

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.839
podcast for

00:37:07.839 --> 00:37:10.800
500 people in philadelphia and that's it

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.480
you're an open micro

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.839
like

00:37:13.839 --> 00:37:16.640
i i wasn't worried about snl at the time

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.960
well and also that's interesting it's

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.720
like uh

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.000
here's one thing i struggle with because

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.520
i agree with you entirely when it comes

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.560
to like the

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.079
yeah cause i

00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:27.200
there's a part of me that always wants

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.720
to be like uh

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:31.839
i i don't want to defend myself too hard

00:37:31.839 --> 00:37:32.960
you know what i mean i don't want to be

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.119
the guy that's outspoken against

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:37.760
cancel culture no we're circling back to

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.920
your stand-up special like well netflix

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.119
passed well that's because they didn't

00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:42.960
like what i said exactly i mean i just i

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.119
don't want to be that guy yes i just

00:37:45.119 --> 00:37:48.240
want to do comedy so like i'm

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.200
there's i've definitely been on

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.440
camera being like well yeah i mean look

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.839
i get why they fired me

00:37:55.839 --> 00:37:58.720
and i do understand why they fired me

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.079
you know what i mean like no i get it i

00:38:00.079 --> 00:38:02.160
understand why i was fired if you want

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.760
to argue about changing the entire

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.880
culture

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.359
yes i agree with that but i understand i

00:38:07.359 --> 00:38:10.480
i know the context that i'm in

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.160
i was drinking vodka earlier am i making

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.480
sense no you are

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.400
you smell like you're making sense i'm

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:19.520
sorry i did [ __ ] bird crushers oh we

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.720
got a drink yeah and look

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.240
of course

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.599
i think there's

00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:29.119
i think we can in a way in a way

00:38:29.119 --> 00:38:31.599
lorne michaels and

00:38:31.599 --> 00:38:34.720
uh sorry six minutes and snl

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:37.359
in a way they're victims too

00:38:37.359 --> 00:38:40.240
because they wanted you to be on they

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.359
chose you they sought you out

00:38:43.359 --> 00:38:45.920
but because of the way the winds are

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:46.960
blowing

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.560
and because they're corporation they

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.240
have stock shareholders and things like

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.119
that they can't so in a weird way

00:38:53.119 --> 00:38:54.960
you should feel sorry for lorne michaels

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.359
in a sense because he got victimized by

00:38:57.359 --> 00:38:59.520
the cairns as well he didn't want any of

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.640
this he wanted you yeah and who knows

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.079
you could have been the best cast member

00:39:04.079 --> 00:39:06.079
ever probably not

00:39:06.079 --> 00:39:08.240
you could have been

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.000
all right let's take a quick break we'll

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.839
be right back with shane gillis right

00:39:11.839 --> 00:39:14.079
after this so uh back shane gillis i

00:39:14.079 --> 00:39:15.839
should tell everybody

00:39:15.839 --> 00:39:17.280
that was fast

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.839
special shane gill's live in austin it's

00:39:19.839 --> 00:39:22.079
very funny support him it's free on

00:39:22.079 --> 00:39:24.560
youtube and you know we're now at this

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.000
sort of

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.960
point in life where you're gonna have to

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.240
if

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.720
if the karen's and the hundred [ __ ]

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.480
vegans on the internet are gonna be

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.520
essentially raising boycotts or

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:40.000
presenting boycotts and getting guys

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
pulled off of the bachelor pulled off of

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.599
snl or pulled off of whatever their

00:39:43.599 --> 00:39:45.040
livelihood is

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.320
uh the rest of the community is going to

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.440
have to support them in what they do

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.200
so it's sort of the opposite of a

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.200
boycott yeah you know we're gonna have

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:58.000
to go to youtube and go download the

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.920
special and go buy the tickets and go

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.160
see the comedy shows and do that because

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.720
that's kind of where we're at now

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:05.599
and

00:40:05.599 --> 00:40:08.640
once we're there by the way and i think

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.839
we've hit a little bit of a

00:40:10.839 --> 00:40:13.440
saturation point but we're kind of there

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.079
now i i feel like

00:40:16.079 --> 00:40:19.119
no more it's now a little bit

00:40:19.119 --> 00:40:21.119
mathematically impossible to cancel

00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:23.280
somebody if they're talented if they

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.839
have ability if they can just go

00:40:25.839 --> 00:40:27.920
[ __ ] it i'll go on the road i'll play

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.160
the clubs people buy tickets yeah

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.240
there's always that argument that

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.839
the left the left likes to make that

00:40:33.839 --> 00:40:35.440
like the people that do the canceling

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:37.119
they love to be like

00:40:37.119 --> 00:40:39.280
there's no such thing as cancel culture

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.200
right they love to do that they do it's

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.200
really [ __ ] annoys me well they're

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.640
like

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.319
they're like yeah i got the guy fired

00:40:46.319 --> 00:40:47.839
from his roofing job but he can get

00:40:47.839 --> 00:40:50.800
another job roofing yeah it's like oh so

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.240
you're you're doing what you're

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.760
providing what servers for him and his

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.319
family it's like i didn't i didn't

00:40:56.319 --> 00:40:58.319
[ __ ] tackle him and prevent him from

00:40:58.319 --> 00:41:00.079
getting another job in the roofing

00:41:00.079 --> 00:41:01.920
industry i just got him fired from his

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.480
major roofing job exactly i mean that's

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.079
that's and then they're like well he's

00:41:06.079 --> 00:41:08.880
doing fine on patreon and he's doing

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.079
it's like and now you're trying to get

00:41:10.079 --> 00:41:12.560
my patreon [ __ ] oh really yeah

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.400
they're always trying to like it's

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.680
[ __ ] it's like can you believe

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.400
patreon supports

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.560
the only solace is knowing these [ __ ]

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:23.040
are miserable they have to be miserable

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.760
[ __ ] they just have to be definitely

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.920
it'd be impossible to go through your

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.040
life

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:32.079
pursuing other people and trying to

00:41:32.079 --> 00:41:35.119
bring them down in comedy in comedy

00:41:35.119 --> 00:41:37.920
right yeah it's not like these are like

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.839
you know undercover cops trying to bring

00:41:39.839 --> 00:41:40.960
down like

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.000
murderers

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
well also

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.920
or just someone who is in charge of

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.200
policy

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:50.400
like your joke somehow affected society

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.839
in some meaningful way yeah it it

00:41:53.839 --> 00:41:56.000
it's really weird

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.480
it it always feels i always talk to dr

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.560
drew about this it always feels gross to

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.520
me like it feels yucky yeah like it just

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.200
feels like ugh

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.520
it is that uh

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:08.720
it's just that

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.720
if you ever beat off three times in one

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.880
day it's that third

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.720

it's just like just like yuck yeah that

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.839
feeling going for number three though is

00:42:23.839 --> 00:42:26.240
a good feeling yeah right when you go

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.319
for number three that's good well you

00:42:28.319 --> 00:42:31.040

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.480
yeah the the i don't know why it's

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.359
satisfying it's sad i hope those people

00:42:45.359 --> 00:42:47.599
lead miserable lives but

00:42:47.599 --> 00:42:50.480
yeah what what we need i it

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.640
we're turning the corner i

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.800
absolutely feel

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.880
three years ago

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.119
i used to get a lot more like hey man be

00:42:59.119 --> 00:43:01.119
careful what you say or stop talking

00:43:01.119 --> 00:43:03.440
about this or don't do that and i always

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.440
just went i'm [ __ ]

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.760
i'm not talking about what i'm

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:10.480
wanting to talk about in defiance

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.640
of what these people are saying i'm just

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.000
talking about what the [ __ ] i want to

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.160
talk about i know it's just kind of this

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.920
weird thing where it's like oh you're a

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:20.240
rebel now not a rebel yeah you don't

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.079
want to be that guy like

00:43:22.079 --> 00:43:23.359
you don't want to be the

00:43:23.359 --> 00:43:25.520
the bad boy of comedy it's like you

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.280
never want to be that guy

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.160
well you just want to do comedy but it's

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.680
kind of an interesting

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.640
construct which is i go about

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.319
saying what i want to say you go about

00:43:36.319 --> 00:43:38.000
saying what you want to say and then

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.599
they oppose it and now you're a rebel

00:43:41.599 --> 00:43:43.440
but if you don't oppose it then i'm not

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.200
a rebel yeah i'm only a rebel because

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.440
you've told me to shut up

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.680
yeah but they also do

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.960
us a service of making it funnier

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:54.560
yeah i agree you know what i mean like

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.079
if everybody was cool with everything i

00:43:56.079 --> 00:43:57.359
was saying

00:43:57.359 --> 00:43:59.680
yeah i don't know how funny i'd be

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.240
well you know yeah i

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.680
there's a part of it

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:06.640
yeah and now you know people try to turn

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.640
you into some folk hero status for just

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.160
saying what you would have said yeah

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.160
that is embarrassing i don't like that

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.760
i'm embarrassed by that i don't like

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.000
that yeah i agree it makes me

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.119
uncomfortable

00:44:17.119 --> 00:44:18.720
yeah no that's

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.839
it's good and and i

00:44:20.839 --> 00:44:22.960
agree you don't want to become a

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.400
caricature

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.800
who is essentially

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.280
at some point you become a gay priest

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.079
who's preaching against homosexuality

00:44:32.079 --> 00:44:33.839
and it becomes kind of weird and you get

00:44:33.839 --> 00:44:35.599
tangled up in it

00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:37.440
you just want to say what you think is

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.440
funny sure

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.440
and hopefully the audience will go along

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.119
with you on that journey

00:44:43.119 --> 00:44:45.040
and that'll be the end of it i don't

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.200
know it's curious to me that there's

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:49.040
people getting in between you and the

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:52.560
audience you know or attempting to

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:53.760
yeah

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.839
i don't know yeah it's tough to it is

00:44:55.839 --> 00:44:57.440
the only the furthest i can get on this

00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:58.960
is yeah it's weird

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.200
but i don't know how to yeah but you

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:02.960
know your attitude is great because

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.640
you're not

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:07.599
i believe me i can tell your attitude is

00:45:07.599 --> 00:45:09.200
great because you don't have this sort

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.680
of vindictive if only or living in the

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:13.599
past or [ __ ] these people

00:45:13.599 --> 00:45:15.680
whatever [ __ ] feature player on snl

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.240
whatever it is if only i was in a sketch

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.880
once a season on snl right in the first

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.480
few years that's how it would be for

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.440
sure

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:24.480
so

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.359
this

00:45:25.359 --> 00:45:27.280
episode sort of

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.079
comes and goes you're having to

00:45:30.079 --> 00:45:33.119
it's a few so it's it's three pieces

00:45:33.119 --> 00:45:34.079
it's

00:45:34.079 --> 00:45:36.079
you've been accepted as cast member and

00:45:36.079 --> 00:45:38.480
snl that's big news to everyone in

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:41.200
mechanics oh man right yeah this is the

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.520
first time like my family could be like

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.680
oh nice right i mean because they don't

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.280
they don't know what the [ __ ] comedy is

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.280
someone right i got just for laughs so

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.640
like who gives a [ __ ] what are you doing

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:54.000
right how do you get a job right uh so

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.160
there's that and then there's the [ __ ]

00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.400
storm that ensues

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.560
and then there's the news that you've

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:02.720
been cancelled from essence yeah yeah

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.280
yeah so that's a rough

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.240
that's a

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:09.440
crazy crazy 10 days for the family right

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.240
yeah

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.520
and

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.440
then you're getting all these calls of

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.280
congratulations at the beginning and

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.960
then you're getting all these calls of

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:18.720
are you all right i'm guessing yeah

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.560
there's a bunch of texts that like i

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.480
didn't even have time to respond to when

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.079
they were saying congratulations that

00:46:24.079 --> 00:46:26.400
the next text was like

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.200
hang in there oh wow i never thought

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:31.520
about that yeah yeah it was four hours

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.520
so what do you do then what is your

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.280
mindset at that point

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.240
i

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.400
went and did stand-up

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.920
and it was funny because like my agent

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.280
manager and all that everybody was like

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.400
just go home

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.680
like

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:45.599
be alone i was like that's the literally

00:46:45.599 --> 00:46:47.599
the last thing i want to do is sit here

00:46:47.599 --> 00:46:48.640
and like

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.319
look at my [ __ ] phone

00:46:50.319 --> 00:46:52.000
i'm gonna go stand-up's the only you

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.280
know

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.720
that's the best thing

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.880
it's the best way to like not be in this

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.960
it's way to publicly make fun of it and

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:01.280
like see people actually laughing versus

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.359
like i was looking at my phone

00:47:03.359 --> 00:47:05.920
right reading comments that were like

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:08.000
i hope this guy dies like all that which

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.920
you know i was i was literally never

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:11.520
affected by like a death threat or

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.280
anything like that but like when it's

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.599
like [ __ ]

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:17.599
kareem abdul-jabbar writing an article

00:47:17.599 --> 00:47:19.680
that you're a piece of [ __ ] right it's

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:22.160
like what the [ __ ] is going on oh yeah

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:24.160
he's written some crazy she got that guy

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:26.640
kareem got me kareem yeah all-time

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.640
leading scorer lou alexander wrote an

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.559
article that i was i sucked and then his

00:47:30.559 --> 00:47:32.160
son stabbed the guy

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.839
oh really so maybe he should have been

00:47:33.839 --> 00:47:35.440
parenting instead of writing an article

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.119
yeah i

00:47:37.119 --> 00:47:38.800
up shoulda

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:41.200
the sky hook up top

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.319
the uh

00:47:42.319 --> 00:47:44.960
i do remember a little crack you know

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.559
i've been waiting to take a shot at

00:47:46.559 --> 00:47:49.680
kareem for two years this is it i i

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.280
support you fully

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:53.839
the the thing about there was an article

00:47:53.839 --> 00:47:56.240
that i remember where kareem

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.319
kareem and you could look it up chris

00:47:58.319 --> 00:48:00.240
there was a there was like a kareem

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:03.280
article the scariest part

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.800
is when these guys write these kind of

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.400
op-edi things

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.240
and they're like

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:10.720
they start saying [ __ ]

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.920
and they're using it as an example

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.079
and the example is something you

00:48:16.079 --> 00:48:19.200
disagree with vehemently like they'll go

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.240
you know

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.240
they'll go away shane gillis can speak

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:26.160
his mind and then be rewarded on snl and

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.200
uh so and so can the bachelor can do or

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.040
whatever do you want to live in that

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:33.520
america and i'm always like [ __ ] yes i

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.359
do yeah that's about the americans yeah

00:48:35.359 --> 00:48:37.839
i do like the [ __ ] you're talking about

00:48:37.839 --> 00:48:40.720
is the exact opposite of what it it was

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.720
a crazy article

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.480
he was probably about well it was

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.800
probably about two three years ago right

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.119
and he just maybe was a year and a half

00:48:49.119 --> 00:48:51.040
ago and he was kind of going through all

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.720
the different people

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.559
and also they have this thing too where

00:48:54.559 --> 00:48:56.880
it's like

00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.880
it reminded me when i was arguing with

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.640
gloria allred

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.480
and she was like you don't know if this

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:04.640
helped or hurt michael richard's career

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.400
this may help him you know that's like

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.160
no it's not going to help him you don't

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.400
know that notoriety it's like they do

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.160
these things like being rewarded he's

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:14.240
being rewarded now because we're all

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.760
talking about like he's not being

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.000
rewarded he got [ __ ] canceled that

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.520
that came with me a lot that happened

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.599
really a lot and it bothers the [ __ ] out

00:49:21.599 --> 00:49:23.839
of me when there's like people that

00:49:23.839 --> 00:49:26.160
aren't good at comedy right suck at

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.480
comedy or or just like desperate for

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.359
attention like i think it's good

00:49:31.359 --> 00:49:33.280
it's good what's happening to you right

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.079
like

00:49:34.079 --> 00:49:35.359
it's not good i don't think you

00:49:35.359 --> 00:49:37.040
understand others like if i sucked at

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.520
comedy this would destroy my career

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.440
right if this happened to you it would

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:44.319
ruin your career right you know not me

00:49:44.319 --> 00:49:46.559
but no no no no you the person who

00:49:46.559 --> 00:49:48.720
thinks i'm not you sure right no but

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.559
that's that's that's the whole thing

00:49:50.559 --> 00:49:52.720
like it's very annoying if you're

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.640
talentless then the bootleg porn that

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.040
came out may help you but if you're a

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.640
noted actor

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:01.119
of uh and and much celebrated it's just

00:50:01.119 --> 00:50:02.880
[ __ ] embarrassing it's not not

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.319
helping at all

00:50:04.319 --> 00:50:06.160
that article was all right you just need

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.960
a little more detail on kareem

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.839
abdul-jabbar yeah

00:50:10.839 --> 00:50:14.240
uh mine up there cream abdul shane i

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.760
could do that

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:18.079
he also went by cassius clay

00:50:18.079 --> 00:50:19.760
but i think he wrote this later in his

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:20.720
career

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:23.520
um and he had another one that just

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:26.400
i didn't know if shane was included in

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:28.400
the one where he was talking about all

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.160
these people being canceled and why it

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.760
was a good thing

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:32.480
i

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:34.720
after kareem wrote that article that one

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:35.680
hurt

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.520
how early on was that it was pretty

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.359
early i think wow i think it was like

00:50:39.359 --> 00:50:41.920
before i got fired i could be wrong yeah

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:42.800
uh

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:45.040
and then i got off a train in new york

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.800
and i did as the doors opened it was

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.960
just an ad for one of his books

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.400
oh and i was like oh that's why he wrote

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.280
that

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.839
wow he's selling a book so he stuck a

00:50:53.839 --> 00:50:55.599
knife in me

00:50:55.599 --> 00:50:58.160
like what a [ __ ] disgusting world so

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:01.040
you you didn't take a lot of down time

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:04.160
and drown your sorrows and vodka no you

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.680
said i'm gonna go back out and do

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:07.599
stand-up yeah i just stand up the whole

00:51:07.599 --> 00:51:11.119
time and you felt like

00:51:11.119 --> 00:51:14.160
almost like somebody saying get exercise

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:17.359
through covet like it kept you sane yeah

00:51:17.359 --> 00:51:20.400
in that period for sure and how long

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.400
before you sort of

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.760
i mean were you able to get

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:27.200
philosophical about it early

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:29.040
or did it take a while yeah i was i was

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.359
definitely but i like to keep that to

00:51:31.359 --> 00:51:32.640
myself

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.559
you know i'd hate to go on a podcast and

00:51:34.559 --> 00:51:37.359
be philosophical no i just mean yeah no

00:51:37.359 --> 00:51:39.520
i put it in the context i was kind of i

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.440
was able to contextualize it pretty

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:43.359
quickly and i was able to be like there

00:51:43.359 --> 00:51:44.400
was never a part of me that was like all

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.079
right i'm gonna quit or like oh this is

00:51:46.079 --> 00:51:48.160
the end it was always i always had a

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:49.680
pretty big picture idea of what was

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:50.880
going on

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.280
and i understood

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.440
the culture that we were in in comedy

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.680
better than i think most people going

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.400
into it because you experience it

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:02.240
because it always starts at like the the

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:04.400
local scene so i had experienced this

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.839
type of like

00:52:05.839 --> 00:52:08.000
left verse right

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.280
or club versus alt comedy battle right

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:13.520
in philadelphia a year or two before i

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:16.160
left so i'd seen how this works and how

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.760
like

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:20.079
people act on the internet you know like

00:52:20.079 --> 00:52:21.280
where people you thought were your

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:23.280
friends would be like yeah he also

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:26.400
uh exposed uh he outed a guy for sucking

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.480
a trans guy's dick

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.480
and they'll just tweet that just to bury

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.960
you while you you know today

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.319
what are you talking about was there a

00:52:34.319 --> 00:52:37.280
part of you that could be like

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.280
i can almost study this through the lens

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:42.079
of our like a like a

00:52:42.079 --> 00:52:44.960
sociology major like this crazy [ __ ]

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:47.280
chapter we're in in our society even if

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:50.400
it's me in the eye of the storm yeah

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.160
i will say this i definitely thought i

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.480
could which was funny because i was just

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.880
i was [ __ ] up like it was like it

00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.359
really no i know damages you

00:52:59.359 --> 00:53:00.960
so like the whole time i was trying to

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.880
like it was definitely a

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.800
self-defense mechanism where i was like

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.240
i'm fine

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:06.960
yeah

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.119
yeah it was i was [ __ ] up you know the

00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:10.960
sad part of the had this happened to me

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.119
a little bit like people

00:53:13.119 --> 00:53:14.640
you thought were

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:15.680
friends

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:17.440
it's never a best friend but it's like

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:19.440
the guys you know guys you've worked

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.480
with

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.800
comedians you've supported done things

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:25.200
for helped out blah blah blah

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.839
having them [ __ ] jump on the

00:53:26.839 --> 00:53:30.400
bandwagon it's so [ __ ] sad it's like

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.319
dude no one even knows who you are did

00:53:32.319 --> 00:53:33.920
you really have to put that up that

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:35.920
shitty tweet out there and then you

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:37.440
think back of the time you let the guy

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.440
crash on your sofa you gave him a ride

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:41.119
give him a ride to a show or you did

00:53:41.119 --> 00:53:42.720
some [ __ ] for him he put him on your

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:45.359
podcast you did blah blah blah and they

00:53:45.359 --> 00:53:47.359
got to [ __ ] jump in with something

00:53:47.359 --> 00:53:48.480
shitty

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:50.880
that's the most that's the saddest part

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:52.800
to me those were the worst

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.079
right for sure

00:53:54.079 --> 00:53:55.680
and that was all philly people that was

00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.760
all cause i was philly right so it was

00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:59.440
all the philly comedy scene they were

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.760
the ones that were really like

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:03.040
i mean there were guys that i was

00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:04.480
friends with that would like tweet out

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:05.200
like

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.960
paragraph stories it'd be like here's

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.760
the time he was a bully in the comedy

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:11.839
you're like there's adult men going

00:54:11.839 --> 00:54:14.240
around calling other adult men bullies

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.240
in [ __ ] comedy

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.400
yeah and they're [ __ ] if you're 30 and

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:21.119
you have a bully oh my god kill yourself

00:54:21.119 --> 00:54:22.800
but then it's like guys like hey dude i

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.960
played your cancer charity benefit for

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:26.720
[ __ ] free four months ago and you're

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:29.599
talking [ __ ] it's so [ __ ] sad do we

00:54:29.599 --> 00:54:32.079
have that article sir

00:54:32.079 --> 00:54:34.240
that you have the kareem article

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.680
that [ __ ]

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.440
so this is hollywood reporter september

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.040
2019

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.440
uh it's titled kareem abdul-jabbar shane

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:43.680
gillis snl the art of the post-racist

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.160
rant apology it's tempting to open this

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.599
column by repeating shane gills as

00:54:47.599 --> 00:54:50.240
homophobic anti-asian and misogynistic

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:51.839
slurs that got on fire from saturday

00:54:51.839 --> 00:54:54.079
night live already sounds funny though

00:54:54.079 --> 00:54:56.400
to show just how desperately unfunny

00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.400
derivative and dripping with fl flop

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.240
sweat they are but their level of

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.319
funniness is not the point comedians

00:55:02.319 --> 00:55:03.760
have the right to be unfunny sometimes

00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.359
just as athletes have the right to lose

00:55:05.359 --> 00:55:07.680
games and actors to be in bad films but

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:09.280
when a comedian makes hate-based

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:11.520
comments as gillis did on his podcast

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.599
right we do have an obligation to take a

00:55:13.599 --> 00:55:16.079
closer look

00:55:16.799 --> 00:55:18.960
insightful provocateurs of culture and

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:21.200
the human condition or just another

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.640
middle schooler blowing milk out of

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.640
their nose for a quick laugh not caring

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:26.160
who they spattered milking i'll be

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:27.520
honest i am

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:29.359
a middle schooler spouting milk out of

00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:32.240
my nose spit take whole milk

00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:34.960
any any time even if it's kareem's

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:37.839
chocolate milk i still feel like i want

00:55:37.839 --> 00:55:40.240
that spit take yeah and by the way this

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:42.160
is this whole thing where they go

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:44.240
i'm all for free speech i'm all for free

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.599
expression and i'm all for the first

00:55:45.599 --> 00:55:46.880
amendment but you understand if you want

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.799
to come out on this campus with your

00:55:48.799 --> 00:55:50.720
hate you know and i'll just need to vet

00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:52.480
it like they they always set the table

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:54.079
with hey i got a sense of humor this is

00:55:54.079 --> 00:55:56.160
all great but

00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.920
not this guy not now you know what

00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:59.359
bothered me the most about that it was

00:55:59.359 --> 00:56:00.839
when he said flop

00:56:00.839 --> 00:56:03.119
sweat and i remember being like this

00:56:03.119 --> 00:56:05.680
[ __ ] [ __ ] just like contacted

00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:07.760
another comedian or like he found a

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:09.359
comedian and be like right what what's

00:56:09.359 --> 00:56:11.119
like what's bombing like what's the word

00:56:11.119 --> 00:56:12.960
i should use here right while he's

00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:14.640
sitting there [ __ ] typing

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.319
flop sweat oh that's good i'll include

00:56:16.319 --> 00:56:18.640
that is there any more max batteries

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:20.880
yeah there's another extra that i liked

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:23.119
the weakest of all shane's defenses in

00:56:23.119 --> 00:56:25.280
in this case is when he's a quote

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.760
comedian who pushes boundaries

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.280
he's right that artists push boundaries

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:30.880
of culture

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.559
lenny bruce dick gregory and richard

00:56:32.559 --> 00:56:35.119
pryor all push boundaries the difference

00:56:35.119 --> 00:56:37.119
between an artist and an artisan is the

00:56:37.119 --> 00:56:38.799
artist's willingness to poke at the

00:56:38.799 --> 00:56:40.559
audience's comfort level in an effort to

00:56:40.559 --> 00:56:42.559
unveil weakness discrepancies and

00:56:42.559 --> 00:56:44.880
hypocrisy not everyone appreciates

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.960
having their values questioned that's

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.400
why it's important that we give artists

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.000
plenty of leeway to sincerely explore

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.160
their interpretation of humanity the

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:54.160
goal of the artist is to bring people

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:56.319
together by showing us our similarities

00:56:56.319 --> 00:56:58.240
through our weaknesses even when we are

00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:00.480
reluctant reluctant to acknowledge them

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:02.240
at the same time we are under no

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.920
obligation to financially support

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:06.480
self-proclaimed artists like shane

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.400
gillis self-proclaimed whose work

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:09.359
promotes

00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:11.760
his windbreaker with the rainbow tape on

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:13.200
it that's this artist and then there's

00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:15.200
an arrow just pointing

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:16.240
at him

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:18.319
self-proclaimed oh it's so exciting i

00:57:18.319 --> 00:57:20.319
love that yeah all right that's it

00:57:20.319 --> 00:57:21.520
look at the article where his son

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.760
stabbed a guy

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.680
you should have been parenting kareem

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:27.680
you're a loser

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:30.000
to be fair with that reach

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.480
it's almost impossible not to stab a guy

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:34.079
like you literally pull out a butter

00:57:34.079 --> 00:57:36.400
knife and someone gets stuck

00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:37.520
try to

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:38.880
you try to put a little schmear in a

00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:41.680
bagel someone's going to get hurt

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:43.200
the uh

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:45.440
but look let's let's look at it this way
