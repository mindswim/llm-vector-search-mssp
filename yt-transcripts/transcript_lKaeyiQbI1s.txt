upset

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.720

over the place he like did the old

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.519
spotlight trick where he outran this

00:13:15.519 --> 00:13:17.040

right a bit about to get off he was like

00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:29.200
hey

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.160
if you have the time yeah you can do it

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.000
right before you brought her on so was

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.920
it between him and his wife it was

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.440
between it was after his wife he was

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.040
like if you got three minutes because it

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.120

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.040
double whammy shitty three minutes i

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.000

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.200
out i did

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.200
well it sucked because i i opened the

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.800
show so like while people were walking

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.959
in it was kind of it was an average set

00:13:50.959 --> 00:13:52.959
yeah well you know it got really good i

00:13:52.959 --> 00:13:54.560
mean by the end of it people started

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.480
listening but at first people were

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.160
sitting down yeah and i'm up there like

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.800
you know how black dicks

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.199
[ __ ]

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.959
yeah yeah yeah i remember then i came

00:14:04.959 --> 00:14:06.320
back on and did a call back from the

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.920
first set and then yes it was like ah i

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.000
remember that yeah make some noise that

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.360

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.120
cheesesteak so i was like get the [ __ ]

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.320
out of here

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.920
it is a shame he was probably so [ __ ]

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.079
nice he was the man dude he got strong

00:14:18.079 --> 00:14:19.600
armed down to that they got strong armed

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.800
out of like a couple million [ __ ]

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.639
bucks man

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:24.560
that show is going

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.199
[ __ ] suck dude he's not on it no

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:28.880
you're talking about silicon valley yeah

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.199
he's not on it at all not definitely not

00:14:31.199 --> 00:14:33.519
[ __ ] now dude he's out he he was out

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:35.920
last season they don't know like they

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.760
rid him off and then it was he said it

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.760
was because he wanted to do other things

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.920
sure but then he got he got me too like

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.880
a month later deflect rape accusations

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.959
deflecting [ __ ] rape and then calling

00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:48.240
bomb threats

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.680
which is like he can go to jail for this

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.720
he's supposed to be at healing this

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.160
weekend right

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.240
that's probably what the train was

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.959
and live via satellite dude

00:14:56.959 --> 00:14:58.800
damn it

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.720
it was uh because tuesday they're closed

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.240
might have been a little private [ __ ]

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.480
with the tj coming down with the bomb

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.399
threats

00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:10.079
[ __ ] isis miller dude he's a man

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.680
so uh what a [ __ ]

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.320
can you imagine because he was hammered

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.199
yeah you imagine being [ __ ] hammered

00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:21.920
and making a [ __ ] bomb threat i you

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.680
imagine that hangover i've done some

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.160
i've called i've called some dumb [ __ ]

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.560
when i've been drunk i put five dollars

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.440
on a murderer's books in jail you know

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.880
yeah on gator's books you didn't see

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.160
them i showed you them emails that's

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.160
true yeah and i didn't remember at all

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.399
but a bomb threat dude i'm talking about

00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:40.160
having a [ __ ] real consequence but

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.480
the tj miller he's probably had part of

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.480
him he's probably like yes

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.519
i don't think about that not the

00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:47.440
publicity no this has all been bad

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.000
publicity for him bomb threat bombshell

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.519
against the [ __ ] and then later in the

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:53.040
article it listed what it did and it was

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.959
like all eleven hundred people were

00:15:54.959 --> 00:15:56.240
delayed

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.639
on the train and like oh my god this

00:15:58.639 --> 00:16:01.279
cost them nine hundred dollars [ __ ]

00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:02.720
that's like almost as bad as chris

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.279
christie dude with the bridge

00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:07.920
yeah that's [ __ ] up yeah god damn it

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.680
dude he is not a uh

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.680
no that's oh he's waking up like oh [ __ ]

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.040
i'm probably gonna go to jail for this

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.000
i'm gonna go to jail for a bomb threat

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.600
because i got drunk and was trying to

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.000
ruin a lady's life

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.240
i cannot wait to see him this weekend

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.399
and that only strengthens his murky

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:25.839
allegations like well if he called i

00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:27.199
guarantee well if he caught in a bomb

00:16:27.199 --> 00:16:28.959
threat against him a girl why wouldn't

00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:30.000
he do that

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
that's so late that's like the rich guy

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.759
equivalent to ding dong dash it's like

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:35.279
dude seriously that's what you're

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:36.399
[ __ ] doing

00:16:36.399 --> 00:16:37.360
that's what you're doing in your life

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.279
you're shit-faced you miss your one

00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:40.399
train you get on another and then you

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:42.160
call on a bomb threat you guys kicked

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.240
off the other train yeah and two [ __ ]

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.800
up oh oh okay yeah apparently that lady

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.720
was vocal and being like so he was just

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.680
mad and you know apparently yeah

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.920
that was just the allegedly in today's

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.600
fast-paced news world who knows how

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.360
accurate that was especially with conor

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.880
mcgregor a lot of people think that's

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.360
[ __ ] what yeah did you see the video

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.040
i saw the video but a lot of people said

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.640
it's staged it's just a hype up his

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.000
fight yeah they say that with everything

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.079
in ufc and boxing yeah anytime there's

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:09.199
an altercation they're like this is

00:17:09.199 --> 00:17:10.480
probably stage because they've done that

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.959
before yeah the water bottle thing i saw

00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:14.079
when they him and the ideas through

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:15.520
water bottles at each other i was like

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.720
yeah they could have set that up but

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.240
this one this one's not i don't think

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.520
this one's staged

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.679

mcgregor is the man i was like yeah yeah

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.559

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.240
boys like yo bro you should probably

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.679

00:18:05.039 --> 00:18:07.600
watching his boys compete in like

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.600
amateur jiu jitsu like throwing up peace

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.760
signs like west side until i died

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.760
now is he like mcgregor are they pretty

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.000
much done and they're just doing

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.120
nothing when they're gonna i think

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.720
mcgregor's gonna come back he's gonna i

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.720
i was saying this the other day i'm like

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.640
i like remember bieber [ __ ] freaked

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.400
out and had a bunch of bad [ __ ] bad [ __ ]

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.840
bad [ __ ] then came back like

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.280
magnificently

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.200
i see you he like peed in buckets said

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.360
the [ __ ] n word on youtube lest we

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.080
forget bieber said the n-word and then

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.760
he was just not doing well and then he

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.520
just [ __ ] came back triumphantly in

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.960
my head i was like i wonder if mcgregor

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.799
hired the same pr firm that bieber had

00:18:40.799 --> 00:18:44.160
just staging like no life spiral no or

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.160

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.080
difference yeah that's true because it's

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.760

boom bust up the bus windows getting

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.039
attacked by the irish mafia and i was

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:26.960
just like oh my [ __ ] yeah he's not

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.559
he's wound out my thing though was that

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:30.080
glass they were like all the glass

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.000
shattered and it's like that's you ever

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.320
break a car window yeah safety glass

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.280
dude

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.520
it kind of falls and unless it like you

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.360
get hit with like 60 mile an hour like a

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.880
car going 60 mile an hour and breaking

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.960
and hitting you like the glass from just

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.799
getting hit with a hand truck i wouldn't

00:19:44.799 --> 00:19:46.400
[ __ ] like cut you up and [ __ ] i think

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.280
it did cut that guy up they show pics

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.440
i mean he went to the hospital of course

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.640
yeah of course i think they canceled a

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.000
fight yeah it was the one i was supposed

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.440
to fight the next day they have pics of

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.880
his injuries though because i've gotten

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.880
multiple car accidents i've broken that

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.799
glass when i locked my keys in my car

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:03.039
i've shattered [ __ ] in car accidents and

00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:04.559
that glass is just [ __ ] racing do you

00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:06.720
think this is an inside job i'm just

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.640
saying bro i'm just saying what are you

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.240
saying i think they're hyping up with

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.160
dude how are they going to overcome he

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.440
did that thing with floyd mayweather

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.720
that was huge publicity it's like well

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.559
how can we have the bigger one

00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:17.760
well it's like i don't know it's never

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.520
going to be bigger than that's a weird

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.960
actually if they start [ __ ] on

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.720
follow-up that is such an easy thing to

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.600
fix

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.840
it takes a tour bus tell one fighter to

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.200
be like hey man we're gonna [ __ ] get

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.640
conor mcgregor is the biggest thing in

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.679
mma

00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:31.600
who's this other guy habib

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.600
yeah no one knows about him yeah but

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.200
i'm just saying i go to wood with all

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.960
this stuff wood knows all when it comes

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.919
to ufc stuff and he was saying like

00:20:41.919 --> 00:20:43.200
it didn't

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.200
that i think that was real just because

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.400
i don't think he would have canceled any

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.600
kind of fight

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.440
and he was like the next day and they

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.120
said he got his face [ __ ] up are they

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.320
gonna fight now though gregor and habib

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.440
uh

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.400
maybe

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.320
but or maybe he's gonna fight mayweather

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.440
they've been saying mayweather's

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.840
training

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.520

but

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.120
i wouldn't put it past the beginning of

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.279
when cam rooms were starting to become a

00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:43.679
thing and they could obviously find

00:33:43.679 --> 00:33:45.360
little loopholes to get in there now

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.279
mark zuckerberg has all the guys yeah i

00:33:47.279 --> 00:33:49.519
mean it's like you know you download a

00:33:49.519 --> 00:33:51.039
game and there's what's the first thing

00:33:51.039 --> 00:33:52.960
they ask uh connect to your facebook or

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.399
whatever because we want to send you you

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:56.080
know that's how they get it that's how

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.279
they get the data but no dude i'm

00:33:57.279 --> 00:33:58.640
telling you if you ever do a webcam and

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.720
you regret it which i did both times i

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.279
did it i just literally performed

00:34:03.279 --> 00:34:05.039
went on a capital one dude and was like

00:34:05.039 --> 00:34:06.799
what the [ __ ] is this that looks like

00:34:06.799 --> 00:34:08.480
very suspicious activity dude i didn't

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.000
do that dude they'd take it right off

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.639
really nice what site you use

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:14.480

00:34:15.919 --> 00:34:19.200
up live jasmine oh live jazz yeah

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.560
yeah and then i researched like there's

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.800
got to be one cheaper yeah chatterbait

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.320
yeah go to chatterbait that's the way to

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.919
go okay i'm so to toe

00:34:25.919 --> 00:34:27.520
i'm off the [ __ ] that's the worst

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.359
dude that's like the most shameful

00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:32.480
[ __ ] nut dude yeah when we were uh

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.399
when we were kids we would get on and

00:34:34.399 --> 00:34:36.720
make the model say my one friend's dad's

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.079
name

00:34:38.079 --> 00:34:39.520
and we would film it and be like we

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:42.000
don't think this is real say bill kelly

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.200
this girl would be fighting herself

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.760
she'd be like oh bill kelly

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.560
[ __ ] sent it to tommy

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.839

00:34:49.839 --> 00:34:52.720
dad oh my god yeah so that's that's i

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.200
mean we we handle like four girls so

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.599
what what's your day-to-day role

00:34:57.599 --> 00:34:59.680
uh building a social media it's like

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.200
building her so they all have accounts

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.040
like twitter instagram

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.040
none of them they all kind of stay away

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.359
from facebook because really with this

00:35:07.359 --> 00:35:08.960
kind of thing facebook doesn't do [ __ ]

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:09.760
for them

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.599

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.760
out of this because i had to create the

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.200

00:39:09.839 --> 00:39:11.359
in theory it makes sense of course

00:39:11.359 --> 00:39:13.440
because if you've got a woman who like

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.200
who's in the average

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.040
not the [ __ ] website girls but like

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.599
the average like street walking or back

00:39:19.599 --> 00:39:22.480
page hooker yeah i'd say

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.000
70 percent of the time probably got

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
raped at some point yeah chick who's

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.839
been raped who's using drugs and

00:39:27.839 --> 00:39:30.000
throwing the [ __ ] slammer dude i take

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.280
a hard line with that stuff since we

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.560
started this because i'll tell you right

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.720
now

00:39:35.119 --> 00:39:36.640
i think a hard-lining has raped it ever

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.079
since i started

00:39:38.079 --> 00:39:39.760
no no a couple months ago there's girls

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.599

00:39:41.599 --> 00:39:44.320
their business that are making money

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.839
they they're in it they know the angles

00:39:45.839 --> 00:39:47.359
they're making [ __ ]

00:39:47.359 --> 00:39:48.720
millions yeah but they're but the

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.160
majority are [ __ ] idiots and [ __ ]

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.760
that have probably been raped by their

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.200
uncle or whatever

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.880
they're very stereotypical stuff like

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.160
that i'm serious like what they don't

00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.280
call them but that's when they got raped

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.880

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.720
very true

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.000
we're going to get old philosophical

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.040
ones that's deep

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.440

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.240
craigslist killer dude

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.760

and just find the weirdest [ __ ] now

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.040
[ __ ] all at the same time

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.480
it was kind of one after another yeah

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.400
yeah but

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.800
that entailed him not touching the girl

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.040
yeah he just shot him he did a sniper he

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:28.000
just jerked off okay during a porn okay

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.680
and then just walked in come down this

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:30.960
girl's face and left well this is what

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.560
they do the line they're all just

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:33.920
sitting there like a bunch of other

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.520

for like 30 bucks yeah that's that's how

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.920
[ __ ] then one time this is this is

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.079
the most [ __ ] up one i thought was

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:44.240
i mean the [ __ ] thing is terrible but

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.040
uh

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.200
he met this lady on craigslist who

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.880
wanted to make a porn with him

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.599
to send to her husband that was a troop

benedict arnold except it's real

00:44:59.359 --> 00:45:01.040

there anyway that's how you kill a goal

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.480

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.400
there his parents rented a house

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.000
literally on the beach

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.280
and we used to get the same thing three

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:47.200
men slingshot water balloons in it and

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.520
sit back at our deck and fly them onto

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.880
the beach and have someone just everyone

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:52.480
to take turns standing there watching

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.000
them like oh my god it's a [ __ ] hit

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.760

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.520
you're a kid you don't think

01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.039
how far this thing's gonna go and then

01:07:59.039 --> 01:08:01.119
the first couple like successfully

01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:02.720
launched you're like holy [ __ ]

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:04.160
those things should be illegal oh

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.160

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:10.559

01:08:10.799 --> 01:08:12.000
and then you just have some we would

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.200
just walk off the beach let's go

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.640
someone's coming you put it away and sit

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.000
on the deck and it's like you ever have

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.440
it explode because you fill it up too

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:20.799
much [ __ ] yeah because then you're right

01:08:20.799 --> 01:08:22.319
it's the worst

01:08:22.319 --> 01:08:23.600
that i talked about this before on the

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.040
cast when we bombed the trolley with

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.400
like fruit and stuff

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:27.679
i had to have talked about this i don't

01:08:27.679 --> 01:08:29.679
recall so we used to go down to ocean

01:08:29.679 --> 01:08:31.440
city and there's a trolley that runs

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:33.040
around ocean city we just you know picks

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.560
everything ocean city jersey or

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:35.600
mountains

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:36.880
and there's a trolley that picks people

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.319
up might even be like a little bus but

01:08:38.319 --> 01:08:40.080
it has like open windows and everything

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.600
and it's like nice in the summer time

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.120
and you can take it it runs all along

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.920
the boardwalk so the one time we pelted

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:47.359
it with like tomatoes and eggs and [ __ ]

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:48.400
when everyone's standing on there and

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:49.839
like that wasn't enough because we would

01:08:49.839 --> 01:08:51.520
like wave it down to come stop and get

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:54.239

gayer than [ __ ] castle that means he

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.560
literally just posted a picture a screen

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:38.000
grab of

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.840
a youtube documentary he was watching

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.600
maybe eastern state penitentiary and he

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.679
put it on facebook and was like wow such

01:23:43.679 --> 01:23:45.520
an interesting documentary on the

eastern state penitentiary maybe he was

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:48.960
stoked on his local geography no that's

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.880

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:54.320
for sure that's what i'm saying i think

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:55.840
this is all of an elaborate trap to

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:58.400
catch bishops

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.800
posting this because how long were you

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:02.719
going around thinking he was ironically

01:24:02.719 --> 01:24:04.239
referring to the trait and why would he

01:24:04.239 --> 01:24:06.639
refer to the [ __ ] castle on facebook

01:24:06.639 --> 01:24:08.560
for all of us because it looks like

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:11.360
