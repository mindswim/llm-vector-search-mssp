[Laughter]

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.239
dude it would be funny if alaska got

nuked people would be more upset about

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.440

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:35.199
on

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.720
russia yeah yeah i think moss is going

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.320
to save us rely on russia and saudi

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.120
arabia

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.520
is going to make a bigger better battery

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.360

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.680
suggested drilling up there

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.000

his accumulating autobiographies yeah he

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.120
was just obsessed with it since he was a

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.040
kid so he says it in the podcast he's

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.200
like he moved from mexico when he was

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.320
seven

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.519
this is it's the best part of the

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:57.600
podcast so hopefully you get there well

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.800
we're not gonna release till wednesday

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.800
so it doesn't matter yeah he gets it's

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.360
five hours

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.640
[Laughter]

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.240
so he gets to a part where he moved from

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.120
mexico and the it was when nixon i think

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.320
was in office

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.959
so he moved him from mexico to boston

00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:27.200
and he was a seven-year-old mexican kid

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.839
that was like the president is the most

00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:32.320
powerful man in the world and he had a

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.720
picture of nixon in his room and he

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.279
loved nixon and then he said he had a

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:39.440
dream about nixon

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.040
like he he's like it's the first dream i

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.200
remember as a kid was hearing a marching

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.040
band coming down my street me looking

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.800
out the window and it was nixon

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.000
leading a marching band to my house

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.240
to his house and then he comes outside

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.079
and nixon gets on one knee and goes

00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:56.240
louie

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.040
gives him a hug

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.000
and then it was right when watergate

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.920
happened so every night he'd come home

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.279
his parents were watching the news like

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:09.680
what the [ __ ] [ __ ] this guy he's like

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.720
how's nick's on the road

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.200
i mean that was the most he was from

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.720
mexico which was like

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.040
you know [ __ ] it was mexico in the 70s

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.959
yeah and then he came to america and was

00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:28.800
like this is the best place in the world

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.959

00:11:30.959 --> 00:11:32.959

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.680
seven-year-old mexican's room

00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:39.680

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.519
a little redhead in mexico those chubby

00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:42.880

00:13:14.959 --> 00:13:15.839

the best guy ever so like when i maybe

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.680

like a running back superman crossing

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.000
the goal line

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.200
wall at the bottom

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.640
and she

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.320

00:20:06.799 --> 00:20:08.320
nate was doing when he [ __ ] passed

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.360
out snoring yeah just immediate

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.080
oh

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.440

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.640
vapors dude he's like oh

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.159
he passed out because his foot hurt

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.320
he got scared it's understandable

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.840
because the way chris described it was

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.559
like

00:20:28.559 --> 00:20:30.640
very bizarre that he just blacked out

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.440
from like his leg hurting yeah like he

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.799
got knocked out but i guess he got

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:37.600
whiplashed and then yeah hit him like 10

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.600

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.520
just was excited he was excited it was

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.919
scary

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.080
i think his heart was just trying to

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.960
catch up yeah he jumped the head

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.919
he jumped on dude

00:20:51.919 --> 00:20:53.760
that did you talk about joan going down

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.360
the stairs it reminded me how many times

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.799
as a kid i would try to run down the

00:20:56.799 --> 00:20:59.280
stairs and trip

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.840
and then just

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.640
jump i mean there's no other way to save

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.320
it the amount of times that i like

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.679
landed at the bottom and hit

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.000
in school like i

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000

that used to have you know a block like

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.400
it used to be blocked off so you went

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.400
down there it was just exposed brick

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.200
shitty tile

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.200
like a south american prison toilet

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.120
stand alone and we only had two two

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.720
toilets so someone was always activated

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.960
in like cold stuff oh my god how scary

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.960
that was dark as [ __ ] turn the lights

00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.840
off down there must have been the

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.600
scariest until like 12 years old i

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.799
couldn't go down yeah i'm still scared

00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:04.080
of that yeah you're so scared of that

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.840
yeah over covered i spent time playing

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.600
xbox in the basement

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.200
and even then i turned the lights off

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.000
and did you

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.280
that's second gear for sure

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.880
you start imagining what that demon

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.559
looks like yeah then you run up the

00:22:20.559 --> 00:22:22.799
steps and your dad said they're like

00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:25.799
running

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:32.640
[Laughter]

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.240
oh the best players at the end we had to

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.760
call an ambulance

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.679
and they show up they showed up this is

00:22:37.679 --> 00:22:39.520
after my mom like gained consciousness

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.120
they they got there did you pull her

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.120
tongue out or you didn't have no i think

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.600
my sister may have i was like you're

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.760
doing it

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.360
then the ambulance was there and they're

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.480
like are you all right she was like yeah

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.679
i'm fine my hand hurts

00:23:00.559 --> 00:23:03.280
her middle finger was just over

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.039
she was like no i'm fine i'm embarrassed

00:23:05.039 --> 00:23:09.159
you guys are here but my hand hurts

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.760
any professional football player like on

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.120
monday night football they put their

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.159
hand up and they always have that wonky

00:23:22.159 --> 00:23:23.600
yeah it's the best when those guys have

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.280
to snap it back in during the game yeah

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.799
you just go to the sideline and [ __ ]

00:23:26.799 --> 00:23:28.640
pull it yeah some guys have it

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.240
permanently like that like i think

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.640
edelman has that yeah he's got like two

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.799
jokes like most football players have

00:23:34.799 --> 00:23:36.080
like a permanent angle on one of their

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.480
fingers that's not correctable i think

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.720
as it heals it like moves

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.720
corrected in time i broke my hand once

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.159
and the knuckle went all the way back

00:23:44.159 --> 00:23:45.520
here and that's how did you break your

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.240
hand

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.080
i punched a wall yeah i had a feeling

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.600
yeah there's a couple drinks he punched

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.520
the wall he was actually sober that was

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.520
the one saving grace is that i was sober

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.520
so in my head i went you know what it's

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.520
it's not it's it was real right there it

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.520
wasn't my fault it was real rage but we

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.720
picked the goal i was playing goalies

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.159
and i had to show them and i got it

00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:07.600
right i got a little uh

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.760
cut to the uh the padded wall and just

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.520
broke it in the glove how many how many

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.720
rangers do you think punched the wall

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.960
last night

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.240
no problem if they grow out of that i

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.360
bet they don't

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.960
no professional hockey players but

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.240
there's a couple rangers at home they

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.600
saying punch the wall but they know how

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.120
to do it right the doctor told me he's

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.279
like this is a boxer's fracture but it's

00:24:25.279 --> 00:24:26.720
actually a bit of a misnomer because a

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.320
real boxer would know how to throw a

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.400
punch and wouldn't break his pinky what

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.000
a [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah that's a

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.919
little mean to say and the doxies were

00:24:33.919 --> 00:24:35.440
just wearing off by the time he came to

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.600
reset it so i had to like

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.440
poop and throw up and then the doctor

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:42.080
finally comes in to like grab my

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.159
terrible hand and reset it with his it's

00:24:44.159 --> 00:24:45.600
good that's a good doctor being like now

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.799
look you're going to think you're tough

00:24:46.799 --> 00:24:47.840
by the way

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.200
yeah you actually throw a punch like a

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.960
girl yeah so

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.200
the one thing i had was like kind of

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.279
cool right like you know boxers fracture

00:24:55.279 --> 00:24:57.039
it nope not cool did he tell you how to

00:24:57.039 --> 00:24:58.559
throw a proper punch

00:24:58.559 --> 00:25:00.000
not in the moment he was resetting my

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.080
hand no

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.520
that's actually that's a good

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.440
psychological move though right because

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.520
you're trying to deactivate the pain or

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.919
focus on the patient focusing on their

00:25:09.919 --> 00:25:11.679
pride instead of their physical pain

00:25:11.679 --> 00:25:13.279
it's like a doctor giving a

00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:16.240
a needle to a baby and they're like woo

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.760
for adults you're just like the proper

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.320
way to you know punch a wall look at me

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.279
look at me

00:25:21.279 --> 00:25:23.840
i farted and it's terrible right now

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.640
you're a [ __ ] scumbag

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.240
it's so bad it's absolutely the only

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.840
thing i thought it i thought it would i

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.720
thought it was now he's popping up

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.240
i deserve this

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.400
this is because i took the equipment

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.240
i deserve everything oh no it's because

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.400
i didn't eat anything i haven't coffee

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.760
did you not have time to make a morning

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.200
movement is that why

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.200
uh yeah no i sat down and gave the

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.559
morning movement an attempt because i

00:25:46.559 --> 00:25:48.320
had a feeling this was coming yeah yeah

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.760
that's all you got to touch it out i

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.720
just farted loud i'm good in and out

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.360
well my last two farts didn't smell

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:55.920
jesus

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.919
[Laughter]

00:25:57.919 --> 00:26:00.080
so i thought that's pretty good

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.279
here's another thing a doctor should

00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:02.960
talk about

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.480
dude you've been the way you've been

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.240

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.279
it's the sweetness from the ipas

that was a little bit of sweetness you

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:22.799

00:26:31.039 --> 00:26:32.960

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.919

boat of them i was up till and i would

00:26:58.799 --> 00:27:00.320

any [ __ ] or [ __ ] i heard

00:27:04.799 --> 00:27:06.960
i

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.919

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.559
[ __ ] piece of [ __ ]

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.440
we got to get back on that dude yeah we

fist fight

00:28:14.799 --> 00:28:16.480

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:29.600
me

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.520
i think so all right gentlemen let me

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.039
let me let's act like it's nobody's

00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:33.919
fault

00:29:33.919 --> 00:29:36.320
tell the facts

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.600
here's here's

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.000
the way i see it yeah all right so we

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
get home we we were out drinking this is

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
shane's lens mark

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.919
we come home from

00:29:45.919 --> 00:29:48.399
the bar we get back to the airbnb i'm

00:29:48.399 --> 00:29:50.159
like oh [ __ ] what's the door code i

00:29:50.159 --> 00:29:52.880
forget it and he's like 208 and i was

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.240
like no i know that's not it and he's

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.320
like that's it it worked yesterday and i

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.440
was like

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.600
i i know what it is that's not it

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.399
he's like well it worked yesterday

00:30:02.399 --> 00:30:03.279
okay

00:30:03.279 --> 00:30:04.480
but it and then i looked it up but it

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.960
was like 2 7 something yeah so i type it

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.960
in we walk in and he's like well that

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.399
was it it worked

00:30:10.399 --> 00:30:12.320
and i was like just wouldn't let it drop

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.000
well then i can't let it drop

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.200
but i was like

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.240
so that

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.919
unless there's two codes

00:30:17.919 --> 00:30:19.440
your code was wrong and maybe the door

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.279
was just unlocked yeah because that

00:30:21.279 --> 00:30:23.360
code's wrong and he's like no that

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.640
worked

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.840
and that's it

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.600
and then i'm not letting that go watch

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.600
an energy coming from some other place

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.880
just

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.480
like he and then i was like let's let's

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.000
why don't you go outside i'll lock the

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.399
door yeah see if your code works

00:30:36.399 --> 00:30:38.480
you don't come in yeah yeah you sleep

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.600
out there

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.880
and that was it

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.960
and then now of course

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.880
i can't and so i was like just admit

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.559
that's not the code yeah just say that

00:30:46.559 --> 00:30:48.799
that's not the code i can let this go

00:30:48.799 --> 00:30:50.000
i'm actually getting upset and he

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.679
wouldn't say that was the code so we'd

00:30:51.679 --> 00:30:53.840
be sitting there watching tv 15 minutes

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:55.679
later in my head i'd be like

00:30:55.679 --> 00:30:57.039
don't say it

00:30:57.039 --> 00:30:59.279
don't do it 15 minutes later i'd be like

00:30:59.279 --> 00:31:01.200
you can't admit you're wrong

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.360
just say it wasn't the [ __ ] code yeah

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.600
this is this this argument isn't about

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.760
that code it's it's something else it's

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:10.159
the perfect example yeah of like i have

00:31:10.159 --> 00:31:12.559
the number right here i've heard like

00:31:12.559 --> 00:31:14.480
this it's like look just stop

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.480
and if an x said something like that

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.000
like the two it's 208 it worked

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.919
yesterday i'm like i'm not doing this

00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:21.760
i'm not i can't do that i'm gonna go

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.679
over this way and just please don't say

00:31:23.679 --> 00:31:26.960
code don't say twos or zeros or eights

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.600
but i was the one i was the one still

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.440
saying it yes but i in my mind i because

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.039
we got out of the car

00:31:35.039 --> 00:31:36.559
[ __ ] i'm um you're gonna find

00:31:36.559 --> 00:31:38.559
yourself on that one

00:31:38.559 --> 00:31:39.919
nate and i are the last one out of the

00:31:39.919 --> 00:31:42.880
car i'm ready for this i'm outside

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.440
in like up this front stairs and shane's

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.440
like what's the code and i said whatever

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.240
208 and uh he was like that's not it i

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.240
was like well it worked earlier today

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.000
and and he was like no it's a different

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.039
code and i was like because gardeni

00:31:57.039 --> 00:31:59.279
had said the code set a code that was

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:01.440
wrong earlier in the day

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.519
uh and that's the one that i had typed

00:32:03.519 --> 00:32:04.240
in

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.039
and

00:32:05.039 --> 00:32:07.600
like as i'm typing it in he was like no

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.000
actually it's this other one and i hit

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.960
like the check mark and the door opened

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.559
so i was like yeah i know but there is

00:32:14.559 --> 00:32:16.880
like it is but that one worked so that's

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.159
what i was saying

00:32:18.159 --> 00:32:20.240
that's all and then and then i i don't

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.720
know very passive retelling no i don't i

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.039
was i was not mad about this at any

00:32:25.039 --> 00:32:26.880
point i wasn't mad as soon as you were

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.240
like this is the code and i was like no

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.000
it's not that should have been it

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.760
yeah i said it's like no that code works

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.080
it's like why don't you try it

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.080
did you try it no of course not because

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.919
you knew i wasn't invested in that i

00:32:37.919 --> 00:32:40.640
wasn't investing

00:32:45.679 --> 00:32:46.960
the problem is like just admit that

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.799
you're wrong yeah and then you're like

00:32:48.799 --> 00:32:50.559
no i don't care about this yeah and that

00:32:50.559 --> 00:32:52.080
was the worst part that was the worst

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.919
part such a psychological terrorist and

00:32:53.919 --> 00:32:55.760
then he kept going just let it go yeah

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.399
and i'm like you're the one it's on you

00:32:58.399 --> 00:33:01.919
to say yeah i was wrong yeah dude

00:33:01.919 --> 00:33:04.000
it is like a girl and he's like no just

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.600
just let it go you're being a psycho

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.279
right now i'm like i am a [ __ ]

00:33:07.279 --> 00:33:08.840
psychiatrist lady

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.799
yeah is gaslighting perfect example of

00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:13.200
gasoline gas lighting that's gasoline

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.559
i was i at no point at no point

00:33:16.559 --> 00:33:19.360
was i trying to put this code on anyone

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.279
i was just saying i know ask for the

00:33:21.279 --> 00:33:23.360
code i i would never have said anything

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.679
all right tell me about the mayor yeah

00:33:25.679 --> 00:33:27.360
so then yeah i'm not going to let the

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.960
code thing go yeah that would be the

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.640
rest of it'll be five and a half i'll be

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.679
louie

00:33:31.679 --> 00:33:33.679
five and a half hours

00:33:33.679 --> 00:33:37.720
i miss my flight to england

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.240
so

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.679
the next night

00:33:41.679 --> 00:33:42.880
uh

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.279
we were we were out at uh what you may

00:33:45.279 --> 00:33:47.919
call it we were we were out at uh zany's

00:33:47.919 --> 00:33:49.760
all night

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.640
and uh i'd been talking to gardini about

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.320
like good movies

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:58.399
and uh that i liked and we got home this

00:33:58.399 --> 00:34:00.480
was like three o'clock in the morning we

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.000
get home

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.039
i turn on uh like a woody allen movie

00:34:05.039 --> 00:34:07.039
and uh guardian and i are sitting there

00:34:07.039 --> 00:34:09.520
watching it enjoying ourselves lemaire's

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.919
rolling a blunt and he just goes i don't

00:34:11.919 --> 00:34:14.000
know about gardenia enjoying it

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.560
that's that's that's hearsay well he

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.200
said he didn't like it i don't know

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.879
if it's a lot to put on a young man be

00:34:20.879 --> 00:34:22.800
like yeah this 24 year old kid loved the

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.960
[ __ ] woody allen

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.960
creepy movies

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.560
i didn't say he loved it he said it he

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.399
said it at the time he was enjoying it

00:34:30.399 --> 00:34:31.760
okay

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.000
and then lemare chris also watches black

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.839
and white movies at like 3 p.m it's a

00:34:35.839 --> 00:34:36.720
very

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:39.119
it's a very obvious this was it was i

00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:41.040
will say this it was dumb for me to put

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.639
that movie on yeah there's no need to

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:43.839
watch that there you go that's what you

00:34:43.839 --> 00:34:45.200
should do about the code

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.599
i do i missed it all right wait i admit

00:34:47.599 --> 00:34:49.760
the code didn't work the code was wrong

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.520
yeah it didn't okay great yeah yeah you

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.280
can move on but it did work earlier in

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.520
the day it can be released you think it

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.119
worked because the door was already

00:34:57.119 --> 00:34:58.880
unlocked it must have been but obviously

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.560
i thought i thought at the time where

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.119
was this where was this

00:35:03.119 --> 00:35:04.560
that's all right it just happened the

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.480
night of this is all i wanted was you to

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.480
be like yeah i guess

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.560
too many beers old arguments

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.560
a little emotional you brought it up so

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.760
when you brought it up for the fourth

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.040
time i was like i don't know i was just

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.760
saying that it worked

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.520
and i was like i know

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.760
i know you just said that

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.760
that's what the point of the argument is

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.440
you just said it all right so what do

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.200
you mean that was a master stroke do you

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.040
see what changes did he just brought up

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.480
that gardini probably didn't like the

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.040
movie and all that parlayed into chris

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.800
admitting that the code was wrong you

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.400
should be an attorney my friend thanks

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.160
bro i admitted the coders wrong the

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.760
night uh this is one thing i regret

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.200
about you and the lemare fight is that

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.720
was the one night i didn't go out i was

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.800
like i need to take a [ __ ] day off

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.280
and i would have given anything

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.119
i tried to stay awake i was watching

00:35:49.119 --> 00:35:51.359
basketball day and i tried to stay awake

00:35:51.359 --> 00:35:52.720
for when they came back drunk because i

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.640
wanted to fight everybody yeah i wanted

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.920
everyone to come back drunk just to walk

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.400
around and be like look at you guys yes

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.000
the next morning i woke up i was like

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.480
some guys just can't handle the road

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:05.040
just [ __ ] with these dudes and uh

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.839
i missed it i i was my my roommate was

00:36:07.839 --> 00:36:10.000
gone yeah i missed it the guys on the

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.200
second floor could hear it because it

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.359
was it became a screaming

00:36:13.359 --> 00:36:16.160
match all right so what happened uh

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.560

literally just don't act up

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.680
immediately start drinking whiskey

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.280
jumping off they actually get in fights

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.960

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.119

00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:53.040
were like three rows from the field yeah

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.160
yeah is that because you're supposed to

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.599
be standing most of the time anyway

00:57:55.599 --> 00:57:56.880
you're supposed to stand and sing the

00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:58.240
whole time i don't know but even if you

00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:59.839
were standing you'd still have to like

00:57:59.839 --> 00:58:01.520
there's so many people packed in there

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.280
yeah i think that's purposeful to sell

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.280
tickets more space or less space more

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:07.040
ticket sales higher money and you're

00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:08.720
gonna be standing breathing all over

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:10.319
some fat idiot anyway it was right

00:58:10.319 --> 00:58:11.920

there's no rules

00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:29.440
