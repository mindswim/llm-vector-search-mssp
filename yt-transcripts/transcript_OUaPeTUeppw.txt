00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.120
one's asking me but he sits up there so

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.980
he's very FISA fair-skinned it's during

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.380
the book the Human Stain Phil brah

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.320
Philip Roth it's about a professor who

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.870
is he's born into a black family but

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.310
he's so fair-skinned that he actually

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.500
goes and pretends he's Jewish and his

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.420
whole life is about like he gets accused

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.510
of racism as like a pretend Jewish guy

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.950
but he's secretly black and he's like

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.420
man this is [ __ ] [ __ ] but he can't

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.190
lie about it's pretty fun yeah good book

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.620
so wait at the end he kind of he does

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.160
the it's basically the Chappelle racist

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.080
kind of okay yeah but it's [ __ ] too

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.250
because he's just using outdated

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.170
language and somebody there it's it's so

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.400

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.780
from the canceling but he doesn't want

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.070
to come out because his whole life spill

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.390
around that he like these kids don't

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.980

book dude human Philip Roth so [ __ ]

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.220

Arizona State University so I would he's

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.420
like he's black by going to Morehouse

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.330
but he's from Kentucky

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.650
black people in Kentucky there are black

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.310
people guitar

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:49.100
[Laughter]

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.529
so yeah again hey I've never seen the

00:08:52.529 --> 00:08:54.660
guy wait what the [ __ ] was that you just

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.940
gave us his Wikipedia yeah I was just

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.860
trying to give you more info no I'm not

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:03.959
Aires from no he I've seen videos of

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:05.430
this guy I remember surprisingly being

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.940
like mmhmm okay yeah just being like you

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.459
know I wouldn't put him in the Dolezal

00:09:11.459 --> 00:09:15.480
category by intent but you know it seems

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.220
like you're in a hierarchy we're here in

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.440
this hierarchy of wellness it's like how

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.089
can I ascend this at a rapid pace be

00:09:21.089 --> 00:09:24.149
like God is racist and it's like all

00:09:24.149 --> 00:09:26.959
right bro yeah thanks man in his defense

00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:29.790
he was answering it didn't like come out

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.010
and make that statement say yeah so what

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.660
happened was somebody asked him about

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.670
their like what do you think of I guess

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.160
statues of white Jesus hmm and he was

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.160
like that's white supremacist yeah so I

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.470
don't think he wanted to say that but it

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.220
did fall under his beliefs which to some

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.320
extent yes but if you're gonna you can't

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.120
go yeah well it's not gonna go to a

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.500
church in Ireland and be like I can't

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.600
believe they made him white yeah or go

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.130
to cobb viously everybody there looks

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.180
like I mean you want people to believe

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.240
in it yeah

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.829
it's bizarre or to see a black Santa

00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:03.089
Claus and be like Santa Claus isn't

00:10:03.089 --> 00:10:07.680
black yeah if you went to like a white

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.089
town they had a black Santa Claus you'd

00:10:09.089 --> 00:10:16.500
be like I mean if you swagged out every

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.620
so funny like when I was a kid dude if

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.899
there was a black SayIt like the mall in

00:10:21.899 --> 00:10:24.360
Mechanicsburg people be like who's doing

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.810
this people would genuinely be like why

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.750
is this happen why is it though who is

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.699
responding why is this happening to me

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:36.209
right now yeah I have to confront this

00:10:36.209 --> 00:10:38.100
is funny to toss up a black Santa and

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.750
have people have to confront that to be

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:44.269
like he's not oh yeah oh yes made up

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:46.949
wait a second he's white oh yeah it's

00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:50.399
not real yeah okay so the question so

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:51.959
this is the thing to it no we never have

00:10:51.959 --> 00:10:53.610
complete information so the question was

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.529
posed on he's like who's more racist

00:10:55.529 --> 00:10:58.940
Jesus are all on his like Jesus

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.640
because now easy that's Jesus so now so

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.700
the white like the foxnews types got

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.820
ahold of the tear down Jesus statues Oh

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.550
we told you if you [ __ ] come for this

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.260
what happens if they wanted to tear down

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.750
Mohammed statues now of course the

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:16.770
argument to that is there are no

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.540
Mohammed statues so people like you

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.550
[ __ ] idiot there are no Muhammad's

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.690
that they're not allowed to build them

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.000
yeah you can't you can't in you know

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.290
it's like you can't draw a cartoon of

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.970
them sure it's the same thing you can't

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.550
just go like Mama's of moment really

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:33.030
yeah there's no there's no art I guess

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.670
none would do him justice perhaps you

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.870
know they're trying to now in order to

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.820
counter that argument is to be like the

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.710
reason we don't have statues of them is

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:47.790
because we knew in the future he had

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.170
done some fucked-up things and we don't

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:50.880
want to worship any it's like today

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.770
that's what they were claiming yeah

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:53.970
they're going along there's like there's

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.830
good reasons we don't have statues of

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.680
them it's like but don't you don't get a

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.870
mistaken and he is our God okay God we

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.670
do worship Him as the Prophet that's how

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:03.960
I always felt about the Old Testament

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.220
God that's why I personally never

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.290
sculpted an Old Testament God myself I

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:10.410
was like yes he's had some he did some

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:11.160
fucked-up [ __ ]

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.470
Old Testament God was black Santa Paws

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.540
he worships I in my head that's who I

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:16.980
envisioned I mean dude

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.920
God did say he shouldn't be gay so in

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:29.610
white very much say there's one ding

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:33.920
counter P I can't he

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.080
I don't I again I I just I think the eve

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.960
I don't think you're in a quagmire no

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.450
doubt cuz it's like worshipping a god

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.520
that hates gay people like I get that

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.230
that's that's one where we're like I we

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.240
need it we needed [ __ ] 2.0 reboot

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.040
yeah we need a deep og I don't think

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.090
Jesus said anything about gay people

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:54.330
Jesus I'm fairly certain no I don't

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:59.670
think Jesus was whatever course gay be

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:00.390
chillin

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.450
Horse theater kids on yeah now this is a

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.850
hot take Adam

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:09.699
just played it out but unfortunately if

00:13:09.699 --> 00:13:12.850
you want to be woken at it Jesus didn't

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.910
you know marry a six to nine year old

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:19.980
and have sex with her or own slaves

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:25.029
which unfortunately other you know

00:13:25.029 --> 00:13:29.980
religiously deities may have yeah yeah I

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:36.639
mean how many slaves Hamid yeah yeah had

00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:38.170
him check off the box the helmet have

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.839
Jesus Jews didn't hide if I'd say the

00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:41.980
worst thing they're trying to get with

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.630
him is he was like he had sex with Mary

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.160
Magdalene which first of all he

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.810
supported sex workers way ahead of his

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.490
time but nobody people he should

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:49.870
actually a physically spit on sex

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:53.079
workers back there she's cool she's

00:13:53.079 --> 00:13:53.470
alright

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.940
yeah they were throwing stones at her

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.500
yeah it's literally he stopped it was

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.930
like who the [ __ ] is doing this I was

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.430
like look at yourself that was the first

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.019
cancel culture sure like throwing rocks

00:14:02.019 --> 00:14:04.060
at her like [ __ ] he was like [ __ ]

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.600
what have you done yeah I got you it's

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.160
like oh the guy who I did that beam that

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.540
crowd of being like I just [ __ ] my

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.480
daughter last night I really should be

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.370
throwing rocks at this wicked [ __ ]

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.579
I molested my daughter yeah before I

00:14:18.579 --> 00:14:20.980
sold her to some guy for three goats

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.350
they're like [ __ ] you Jesus we got to

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.740
kill this [ __ ] yeah I mean it's

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.959
[ __ ] this is such a complex problem

00:14:28.959 --> 00:14:31.750
that's been compounded by thousands of

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.819
years you know people think you're gonna

00:14:33.819 --> 00:14:35.560
go on there by like we're gonna fix this

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.800
by firing Jimmy Kimmel it's like dude

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.930
I'm done you can finally cancel him I

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:42.399
always thought he was kind of I mean I

00:14:42.399 --> 00:14:45.250
always prefer Jimmy Kimmel to Fallon I

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:48.399
agree but then you know they just all

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:50.920
started saying the same [ __ ] it's a job

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.110
where like nobody has there's no like

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:54.430
you were saying before how do all these

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:56.230
people think almost exactly the same

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:57.699
because they don't because it's like

00:14:57.699 --> 00:14:59.350
they haven't they basically have the

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.269
sword of Damocles over their head where

00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:02.439
it's like if Jimmy Kimmel is like you

00:15:02.439 --> 00:15:03.490
know what I actually think about this

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.769
they would be like yeah you're [ __ ]

00:15:05.769 --> 00:15:07.269
done so it's like we're getting the

00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:09.209
whole culture is being broadcasted by

00:15:09.209 --> 00:15:11.680
you know networks being like here's what

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.990
you can and cannot say go feed the

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.579
discourse of America it's [ __ ] it's

00:15:15.579 --> 00:15:18.339
nonsense dude yeah now in the colleges

00:15:18.339 --> 00:15:20.199
that's even the cultural message from

00:15:20.199 --> 00:15:20.620
entertain

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.140
is now being backed and even radicalized

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:24.970
from the place you go to supposedly get

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.370
smarter so again that this whole thing

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:30.580
will topple there's no way this as it

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.080
stands in terms of when I say as it

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.720
stands in terms of like not allowing

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.610
people to relate to each other from like

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.340
an actually honest place and then be

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.290
empathetically listen to that's gonna

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:43.090
fall apart this is an untenable way

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.160
people are going like you know I'm gonna

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.840
hold you up against my idea of moral

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.530
perfection

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.810
you're clearly gonna fail somewhere at

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:51.490
some point in your lifetime that now we

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:53.230
all have access to each other's like

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:56.320
life communications and then you can

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.300
just bring that up and be like you were

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.150
fed get out of here I was talking about

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:03.970
with even with the Lea it's like healy

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:05.560
first of all most people you ask would

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.000
have no idea what fox claw crystally

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.590
it's just people yelling if I ask my mom

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.360
she's more worried about you teeth right

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:16.030

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:51.580
word actually when you asked what I just

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.050
want to know because it was all on Fox

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:54.550
News that Donald Trump didn't know what

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:56.650
your teeth was and he was like yeah I

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.660
totally knew it it was and then his

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.550
apparently it was released later that

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:02.530
like but also a lot of people did Google

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.090

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:14.380
I'm incapable of that as soon as I heard

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.680
of it I I really text real easy answer

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.850
sorry I didn't know and it's because of

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:23.350
systemic racism that you never heard

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:24.490
that I never heard of it I should have

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:27.820
heard of it it's not my fault yeah quick

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:32.140

heard of that no problem oh you didn't

00:17:41.539 --> 00:17:43.640
[ __ ] but that's a no everything he says

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.890
is just a megaphone of like and it you

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:47.809
know he obviously he's on a whole other

00:17:47.809 --> 00:17:50.809
weird quest of well apparently Donald

00:17:50.809 --> 00:17:53.899
Trump jr. is attacking Kimmel for being

00:17:53.899 --> 00:17:56.630
like oh you guys he's got an M word tape

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:57.919

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.789
that's a muerte in his in Trump juniors

00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:05.330
defense get him yeah if somebody was out

there trying their hardest in fact it

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.029
literally just happened to me

00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:09.860
someone was traveling orders or remind

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.899

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:16.070
forgot I forgot how hard chemo was going

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.799
after Trump Kimmel was he was like he

00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:21.679
tried to help I think Tom Arnold find it

00:18:21.679 --> 00:18:23.090
tomorrow did like a documentary on

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.520
finding an n-word tape it was like

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.330
finding sasquatch this is Gillett Kimmel

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.730
was like we need to find this that's a

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:35.929
less Bigfoot should be a grainy shitty

00:18:35.929 --> 00:18:37.880
footage we're like did he say okay you

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.260
[ __ ] said it alright let's hear it

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.899
look I don't think anyone's denying

00:18:44.899 --> 00:18:47.000
Trump's got an n-word for sure

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.600
but on tape we'll say that's your

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.510
smoking gun that's a tough dude yeah I

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:54.860
mean that would be it'll be interesting

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.630
oh be interesting Gallup poll of America

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:59.510
like honest to god how how many of you

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:00.740
think Trump's ever said the n-word

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.539
it would have to be like 98% halves

00:19:02.539 --> 00:19:03.799
Trump said it for sure

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:06.529
the only people saying no or lying yeah

00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:09.020
the only people saying no or like they

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.360
think they the other side wants them to

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.490
say yes so they're just like no yeah he

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:15.760
never said it I know what Juneteenth is

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.039
it's like yes he says it yeah man I I

00:19:19.039 --> 00:19:23.179
again I don't think it's a yeah I'm just

00:19:23.179 --> 00:19:24.470
curious see where it goes I mean the

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:27.770
only way this stuff kind of it's hard to

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:31.250
separate the actual things that need to

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.679
be addressed from people kind of

00:19:33.679 --> 00:19:35.480
parroting things and trying to like self

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.070
elevate from these kind of things that

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.750
make sense so yeah because you start be

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.549
like oh this is dumb people like you

00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:42.230
don't you what you don't think slavers

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:43.309
are big deals no no I'm talking about

00:19:43.309 --> 00:19:44.510
these people who are kind of like

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:45.800
weaseling around trying

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.720
elevate themselves through this yes it's

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.280
like people's what are you talking about

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.570
how could even think about that right

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:50.750
now

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:54.110
well fine not to everybody tell you what

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.280
they're doing dude they're fighting like

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.860
al-qaeda that's how they're doing

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.890
they're hiding in civilization populate

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.200
they've they're hiding amongst civilian

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.240
population so you can't hit them yeah

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.520
you care like you pieces of [ __ ]

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.690
I send you it's like I'll [ __ ] I hit

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.750
everyone sorry about that I think you're

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.250
actually kind of right so you don't know

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:14.390
how to blow up a school you gotta blow

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:15.830
up a school we're gonna have to a drone

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:18.740
strike some schools together and I'm not

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.750
willing to do that just yet but again

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.280
isn't that seem like such a turn-off to

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.290
be like you know people who are like

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.290
vying for the public spot dude knowing

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:28.700
when it caught the price tag on it now

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.680
it's different now because it's not like

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.660
you were like Walter Cronkite you did

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.610
the broadcast people would send you

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.080
letters and you'd like [ __ ] burn

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.610
those things yes and now people can just

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.200
like beep yourself own you I can't

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.210
[ __ ] damn it yeah what did I do in

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:44.120
1984 like [ __ ] and was like no your 401

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.500
K just got drained you're out of your

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.080
neck [ __ ] yeah I think people

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.700
should be approaching show business like

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.740
kind of like global guts where this is

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.050
the aggro craig soon as you like legends

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:55.070
of the Hidden Temple soon as one of

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:58.040
those guys like you're just like I got

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.070

basically [ __ ] off I'm out thank you

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:05.870
everybody good night

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:10.580
yeah I agree but it's it's tough to take

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.770
that out especially when it's like you

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:15.760
see somebody that's done way worse

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:23.000
what's also tougher to take if you just

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.650
if they [ __ ] guy tagged you right

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:29.990
they're like I ready go gotcha yeah you

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:31.280
take a track when they're like before

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.050
the gun goes off you move like you're

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:36.380
out [ __ ] yeah damnit yeah it's also

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:37.610
funny to watch all these people post

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:39.500
these like woke things and then be like

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:43.610
book more people like me yeah wait what

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.680
well that's the seedy underbelly beware

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.560
like book me yeah that's the seedy

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:49.790
underbelly of this nobody wants to

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:51.890
address and this is why you need a

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:54.110
posing viewpoints otherwise if

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:55.400
everyone's on the same page you know

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.020
it's like

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.270
I don't have it in me it's beyond my

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:01.850
powers as a person to like disagree with

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:04.310
this personally I can't do it so like

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:05.270
you know that's where all thing I saw

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:06.830
someone who had was average I believe me

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.290
so it's like so say you're on the side

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.330
of like you know cancel Jimmy Fallon or

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.880
yeah he faced he didn't cancel it for

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:14.990
some reason he's he's cool

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:16.730
Jimmy Kimmel Fallon didn't even

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:19.040
blackface play black-faced yeah camel

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.390
Kimball's gonna get black it was got the

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:22.610
double he get anyone you got black face

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.580
and n-word oh no he's got black face and

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.350
word and I think sexism yeah he laughed

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.790
he's three straight he's California like

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:36.740
three real quick but the there's

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.360
somebody who like again to like there's

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.740
people and I you know I was in school

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.230
these people it's like to even to dare

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:45.620
question question question nine doctrine

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.200
to be like I I think it's good what

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.730
we're doing but what about this aspect

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:51.290
of it there's people who cannot do that

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:52.850
it's like their friendships will fall

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.550
apart they're so embedded in it like own

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:56.900
like a human level is their entire

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.430
identity their entire identity it's

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:00.350
their entire socializing when people to

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:04.070
have to leave like being Amish or like

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:06.410
you have no idea like I had to say

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:08.060
goodbye to everybody I ever knew it is

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:09.830
dude it's a perfect example it literally

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.750
is it's like if I say this I will be

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:13.730
shunned people will question me blah

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:17.960
blah blah blah but so that's what I was

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.310
saying so like if you have people who

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:20.690
can look at it critically you're like

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.220
yeah I think it's kind of [ __ ] they

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.390
can be wrong about a whole other things

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:24.170
but it's like then

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.120
so here's the final point I saw a text

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.100
about someone who is offering distance

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.740
rikey to people of color for free and

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.420
then you could I think that's like a

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.340
white person give her money feel like

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.450
well you know as a white person

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.820
recognizing my privilege I will give you

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.740
money so that you will go do distance

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.260
recce on pocs for free what do you want

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.660
since frankie's a good [ __ ] question

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.760
I think it's riky through zoom my keys

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.170
all about like hovering your finger if

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.430
the whole thing's about like the [ __ ]

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.230
out being over someone's back and like

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:53.090
changing their energies but I think

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:55.250
distance is like from zoom to be like

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:57.590
let me see your back the big let me see

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:58.520
your back through zoom

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.410
basically it's like there's somebody

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:02.360
who's taking a tragedy and advertising

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.940
the fact that they do zoom Reiki or do

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.770
Reiki at all it's like yeah can't you

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:08.690
see I've ever seen improv as being like

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:10.190

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.140

people and raise money for the other

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.570
shirts happen to be for my podcast it's

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:19.610
like dude I see what you're doing man

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:21.350
maybe it's the fact that I'm criminally

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:22.820
minded and I can like you know make

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.080
little connections like that but it's

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.630
like I see what you're doing man this is

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:29.030
a like their this is a hustle III can

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:32.300
see it you know maybe I'm cynical but no

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.880
I'm I don't know I think it's kind of

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.040
clear yeah right I don't even think it's

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.350
up for debate big by the way and if you

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:40.580

Realtor business card at the background

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.830
of your business card in theory would be

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:50.540
a dead guy I mean pretty much

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:56.780
Christianity but yeah that's their logo

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.300

I got hit with the Juneteenth mmm I got

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:03.260
hit with a hard Juneteenth oh right yeah

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.090
just happen to be basically a black

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.610
Israelite in the kitchen at the comedy

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:09.050
club I was just at you're talking real

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.060
black is really you know you know lying

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.130
to me are you pretty excited about this

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:14.690
I'm telling you the theories he was

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:16.580
yelling while I was on stage that were

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.970
reported to me by O'Connor where he was

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:22.100
hit right so here's what he was without

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.960
about this is what the boys view on Tom

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:27.100
Jones before you proceed hold on black

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.990
here's the bit he he was upset about I

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:33.620
was making fun of the fact that Alabama

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:38.150
football desegregated in 1971 yeah and

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:40.820
that we had already been to the moon hmm

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.580
before Alabama was like we gotta get rid

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.310
of these white cornerbacks hilarious

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:48.020
yeah just funny to think of and then

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.910
I'll give him this I was kind of giving

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:52.460
credit to bad white cornerbacks as real

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:55.130
civil rights heroes be like they were so

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:57.110
bad that everybody in the south had to

00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:00.160
be like we need black dudes to do this

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.470
like we can't keep losing games like

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:05.090
college football was more important than

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:07.820
humanity yeah so you know I'm pointing

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.050
that like it's I don't know how you

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:11.030
missed that mmm what I'm doing but

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:13.100
anyway he [ __ ] he was pissed like

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:14.990
when Outback was like screaming and

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:17.450
O'Connor was out there like smoking and

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:18.950
he came out I think he hit a couple like

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:21.880
Hitler was right

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.680
about about well I think he was saying

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.870
Hitler Hitler was right about America

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.900
being racist he tossed that out when

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.280
you're canceling Hitler he was like

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.690
America's racist which technically

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:39.230
Hitler threw himself down was like no

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:42.440
you guys were right like issued apology

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:54.730
he was like [ __ ] our leaders going down

00:26:54.730 --> 00:27:00.500
I'm gonna go paint houses like so then

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.290
after the shows was great also there are

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:05.420
two fans I forgot about this I want to

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:06.470
say sorry to them because I was out

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:07.850
front chillin with them and then I went

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:10.220
back downstairs to get a beer and when I

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.990
went back inside to get a beer I told

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:13.970
them I would be right back and instead I

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:17.090
got hit with a black black Hitler coming

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:19.310
at me tried to stay down there and argue

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:21.410
with that guy in front of the All Blacks

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:26.570
and sure on June teeth it was it was any

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:28.580
times you know what you did was yes I

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:29.210
did actually

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:34.460
and it was a big away game for me in st.

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.440
Louis in a basement with a black

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.540
Israelite in front of an all-black staff

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.870
and he was hit me with that but this is

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.220
what I knew I was dealing with just a

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.930
crazy person because he was like it's

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:46.190
ain't about the Trump [ __ ] cuz Trump's

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:52.580
all right so this guy rules who tell

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:54.410
this guy absolutely rule this guy saw

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.120
something you perceive racism outside it

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.680
was like [ __ ] Hitler was right I knew

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.170
it Hitler was right that he sat down

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:01.550
with me I was like no no Trump's

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:07.610
business man we need that and like of

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:10.070
course I felt horrible with honor told

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:17.600
me he was like that alone yeah go ahead

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.790
sorry I don't cut you off but now that

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.350
was it that should be you know you know

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.480
I'm not just trying to suck you on

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.520
camera but that should be the metric

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.680
measured is like does this person have a

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.360
conscience and if something happens

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.800
where it upsets someone you're like I

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.050
namely feel I feel the tug of humanity

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:34.460
you know I had I wanted to talk to

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:35.120
exactly

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:35.700
but in

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.679
it's like let us record a sound let's

00:28:37.679 --> 00:28:39.000
sit let's ignore what you know what

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:39.990
actually makes person a good person

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.000
ignore all that capture you in a

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.309
soundbite he's like [ __ ] kill him

00:28:44.309 --> 00:28:46.169
yeah like there would be people who have

00:28:46.169 --> 00:28:49.380
you died would be celebrating like I

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.600
know I know

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.240
try not to die before I win true but I'm

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.889
gonna I think I'm gonna die before I get

00:28:55.889 --> 00:28:58.070
to win do you think what's winning uh

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:02.159
just doing well just being respected and

00:29:02.159 --> 00:29:05.070
publicly the public opinion is no he was

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:07.950
funny and I have to sit there what cuz

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:09.179
either way when I die they're gonna die

00:29:09.179 --> 00:29:11.399
peace yeah here's a problem though if

00:29:11.399 --> 00:29:13.440
the public opinion is distorted through

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.230
how you appear personally like if I want

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:17.610
to be like Shane's funny but if I feel

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.740
like problematic and be like change

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.090
funny but I can't come on my platform

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:23.100
and say that is problematic so even if

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.149
you were like I just want you know I

00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:26.659
know I want to get to know this is corny

00:29:26.659 --> 00:29:28.649
just to the point where they do that

00:29:28.649 --> 00:29:31.320
yeah that would be a win yeah but even

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.760
like I mean think of Chappell Chappell

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.889
dropped a special that was funny as [ __ ]

00:29:34.889 --> 00:29:36.779
yeah they're all like he sucks that

00:29:36.779 --> 00:29:39.029
special [ __ ] blows and then he did

00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:40.529
another one where he just you know

00:29:40.529 --> 00:29:42.600
talked about George Floyd never was like

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.620
you have to listen what he's saying

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.299
right now I mean maybe it wasn't the

00:29:45.299 --> 00:29:46.769
same people but it's like you know it's

00:29:46.769 --> 00:29:50.389
yeah it was it was better than the other

00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:52.529
so it's like in order for them to say

00:29:52.529 --> 00:29:53.940
you're awesome in terms of the you know

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:57.690
true I guess I am not explained nor do I

00:29:57.690 --> 00:29:59.909
want to explain it you know yeah as to

00:29:59.909 --> 00:30:03.240
what I think I don't to explain my end

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.409
goals to these animals

00:30:04.409 --> 00:30:07.860
why can't tell them your moves no dude

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:13.380
why why yeah do I need to go into how

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:16.679
shitty people are sure yeah that's what

00:30:16.679 --> 00:30:19.429
that's what I've been doing for the last

00:30:19.429 --> 00:30:22.950
mmm I hear you I hear you don't you

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:24.179
don't want the you don't want to tell

00:30:24.179 --> 00:30:26.850
them basically where do you think I want

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:28.080
to do you think I want to tell people

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:31.350
hopes and dreams true can't give them

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.240
that true that's sick that's a second to

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:37.919
us as well don't get only gain advantage

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:40.340
point be like we got snipers on the roof

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:46.950
you'll never get it yeah I mean I but

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:48.460
yeah the Juneteenth

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.430
I want I won the away game reaction

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:53.200
everybody everybody in the staff was

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.960
like no he's crazy what was hilarious

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:56.560
was this

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.880
there was a white manager that was like

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.130
I'm gonna talk to him I was like don't

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:03.940
please do not I have a guy that you

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.200
can't talk to comics like you would

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.280
instantly bake this [ __ ]

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.560
silencing me yes and then I would get

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.390
dragged into it too for sure like this

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:11.950
[ __ ] was saying racist [ __ ] and

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:14.830
then this white manager told me not to

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:16.150
talk to headliners well cuz there's this

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:18.430
gigantic fire going on and like it was

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:20.920
like definitely dull well there's a

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.630
gigantic fire that's just going on that

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:23.980
everyone's just staring at it's like

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.570
dumbfounded by and this guy could have

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:27.010
been you know a simple misunderstanding

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:28.720
where managers like even if he didn't

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.160
talk to you was like I'm gonna make this

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.600
right and he did that outside of your

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.040
knowledge that guy could have perceived

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.200
it as like Shane told this guy to

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.090
silence me and then you just throw that

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:38.980
out if that's gasoline on this thing and

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:44.320
everyone's like him made up I gave him

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.710
like a bunch of weed what do you know

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:51.700
the week from so I just immediately gave

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.220
it to him I was like I come in peace

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:56.680
true and we sell it in fact we settled

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:57.880
it that night and the whole staff was

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.280
like he's [ __ ] wild I think there's

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.550
got rules he did rule it Susie mentioned

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:05.290
that Trump was the [ __ ] man I was just

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:12.400
like wait that's honestly I think that's

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.140
what he was mad at was me making fun of

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:18.640
Trump yeah I believe that but this guy

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.140
was like a mystical black conservative

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:23.500
that he was a basically pure I think it

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.850
was just a crazy guy I'd mind a

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:28.470
three-eyed Raven a black dude the staff

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:33.640
yeah you got me but um yeah so this was

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.170
good this was the piece of information I

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:36.850
want to give you as making me laugh so I

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:39.010
was listening to got a lot of more on

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:40.990
the run out got a lot of Robert Rogers

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:44.680
info and so after there was a battle

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.560
yeah and I think it was 1757 mmm-hmm

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.080
Fort William Henry fell to the French

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.640
from the British the British had it

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.260
French took it where was this

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.260
and uh like by Lake Champlain

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:59.080
okay GUP upstate New York yeah and thank

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:02.240
God I didn't say Michigan go on so

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.790
it goes back to Michigan so the French

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:06.560
were teammates with the Indians in this

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.270
war they were allies and the French were

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:09.650
like British you better [ __ ]

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:11.180
surrender because I don't think we can

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:14.390
control these boys and they want to [ __ ]

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:16.100
you up they're gonna do wild [ __ ] to you

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:19.970
yeah so the British agreed to the

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:21.290
surrender where they were like and the

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:22.340
French were like we'll let you go

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:24.530
you can keep your [ __ ] arms you can

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:26.000
[ __ ] just you just walk out of here

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.470
and the Indians were like dude that's

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:30.830
soft as [ __ ] this is [ __ ] [ __ ] as soon

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:33.170
as the French like as soon as the the

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:35.750
procession of men leaving started going

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.120
to the Indians just [ __ ] them up like

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.340
we're just scalping [ __ ] dudes like

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:41.720
just killing them while they walk it out

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.240
and here's what was funny this these

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.090
dudes didn't get enough scalps so they

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:49.100
dug up the graves of the dudes that were

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:50.450
just buried during the fight

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:52.340
yeah just started scalping dead bodies

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.230
out of the graves but what they didn't

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:55.280
know is some of those guys died from

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.760
smallpox so then they brought all those

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.530
Scouts back to their tribes like in

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:06.820
Michigan so what's funny about that is

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.380
obviously we're taught about the white

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.720
genocide of the white genocide that

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:13.040
genocide committed by the white people

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.010
giving them smallpox blankets yeah which

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:17.930
I'm not saying we didn't yeah but at at

00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:20.270
least a very small scale so the smallpox

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:22.610
was just get a little greedy with the

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:24.230
Scout ingredientes gasps oh keep a

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:26.330
couple extra scalps which I thought was

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:28.850
very funny yeah Majan digging up a dead

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:32.120
body and scalping it also to to have me

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.160
like what [ __ ] my sick now oh I think

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:35.630
you were nibbling on them too they knew

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:37.460
it oh yeah you nibbled a couple you

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:40.030
nibble scalp no they knew what the dudes

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:43.030
bite

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:45.200
yeah eat dudes after battles sometimes

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:49.550
who fry him up fair enough yeah that

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:51.890
must be so satisfying to not only beat

00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:53.420
somebody but to then eat them eat their

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.100
[ __ ] heart yeah but like beat a

00:34:55.100 --> 00:35:00.910
person I think it was the Miami they

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:02.900
switched sides and joined the British

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.300
and then the French and Indian came out

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.550
and [ __ ] them up and then at the end

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:09.230
of the battle like boiled like six of

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:10.490
them in front of their families and ate

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:12.560
them and then after Miami was like no

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.120
we're on your set like they immediately

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.990
joined back pretty funny

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:19.410
how did that work how did what work who

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:21.960
boiled who I'm nice so there was a tribe

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.030
of Indians that switched and joined to

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:25.740
the British yeah they were like we like

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.119
what these guys are off to so

00:35:27.119 --> 00:35:28.710
immediately the French Indians came out

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:30.240
and [ __ ] them up for doing that yeah

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.190
and then ate a couple of them in front

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:33.570
of their tribe and the whole tribe was

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:35.849
like all right our bad deal's off with

00:35:35.849 --> 00:35:37.050

for like three weeks it's wild oh yeah

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.310

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:08.160

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.349

eat us we're getting boiled okay I was a

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.589
problem like often getting the lobster

00:37:16.589 --> 00:37:17.430
treatment it

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:19.440
yeah the that was something I was

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.580
reading the news recently and they were

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:23.310
talking about it was a trump rally in

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:26.250
Tulsa they're like they're like dude on

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:27.340
video if you watch that

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:28.930
you're gonna be like is it ridiculous oh

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:32.320
my god they were like in the for the

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.550
rally they were like oh did you guys

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:34.480
know by the way there was like a

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.120
horrible racial massacre here yeah 1800

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.710
so now it's like what the news is now

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:40.300
like looper where they're just like oh

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:41.740
also this year in 1800 there's a

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:45.310
horrible massacre dude I mean I get the

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:47.080
point but it's also like well doesn't he

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.460
know there's a horrible massacre here

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.970
it's like dude yeah he did it yeah and I

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:55.000
think initially the rally in Tulsa was

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.770
on Juneteenth uh

00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:59.290
Tulsa was probably the last city you

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:01.750
should do that so they were like scale

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:03.280
it back yeah I think they pushed it back

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:03.880
a day

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.220
yeah well it's also it's one of those

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:07.570
things - it's like I have no [ __ ] I

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:08.800
didn't know that so it's like if you're

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.540
if you had no idea what Juneteenth was

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:11.890
you're not a student of history and

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:13.870
you're like I'm thinking Tulsa what do

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:14.680
you think about that

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.630
yeah like you already have to scan the

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:18.280
[ __ ] annals of history what was their

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:21.100
else's genocide there see Watchmen no

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:24.520
opening until just on HBO that was the

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.230
same that was the opening scene yeah

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:28.150
Tulsa was pretty rough dude they had in

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:31.540
Tulsa they had planes mmm they attacked

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:34.660
the black town with planes yeah they

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.880
were throwing bombs out of actual planes

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.320
so why don't they tell it why don't I

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.820
ever talk about that history class they

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.050
will now

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:44.050
yes sure yeah I mean that's no that's me

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:45.310
another thing too when you're in history

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:46.600
class in high school and they're like um

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.300
and the government bombed a black town

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:54.220
there was like all right so don't fail

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.540
at esident like what happens if someone

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.000
fail in like it also it was the 1920s oh

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.370
is his recent he's pretty reached so

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:01.750
this wasn't that long ago at a point I

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:05.410
thought it was like way longer no no in

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:06.700
fact I think they called it black walls

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.710
why did they go oh that also is black

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:11.520
wall street I believe so they bombed

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:18.640
yeah and I think it started when a see

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.320
that Planet Fitness keychain I see that

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.980

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.510
so they bomb a black wall I think would

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:43.030
happen I could be wrong I think a bunch

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:45.130
of white people a black dude committed a

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:48.810
crime and back then it's very like Diddy

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:50.880
yeah

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.720
so I think of a bunch of white dudes

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.790
we're gonna try to lynch him and then a

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:56.920
bunch of black dudes from that town came

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.270
and [ __ ] them up yeah and they got

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:00.400
like a gunfight and then that actually

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.980
ended up resulting in just a whole bunch

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:04.780
of whites coming through I mean I get

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:08.320
the plane like like a military plane or

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.100
someone had like a no crop duster I mean

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.710
not that you know I think I think it had

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:15.880
something to do with the National Guard

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.490
like I think they'd like I could be

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:21.340
wrong on that yeah yeah true well anyway

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:22.990
so this was a pretty well-known fact cuz

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:24.610
I was like I never I didn't yeah this is

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:25.470
also

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:28.600
Juneteenth they there's people that are

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.580
like bewildered by the fact that it was

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:32.290
two years after the Emancipation

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:35.350
Proclamation was when these but it was

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.810
because there was still a civil war yeah

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:40.000
we're in the south yeah but my larger

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.830
point nobody in the South was like well

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:44.710
he called it we got to stop yeah you

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:46.990
know my larger point isn't to be like oh

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:48.580
you know that's all [ __ ] it's like

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.860
no I don't think they're things blow

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.240
their petty they're peppering the

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.320
narrative with like you know they're

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.900
just like boom we're basically this is

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.540
like the right now from my view it's

00:40:58.540 --> 00:40:59.620
like we're convincing people it's like

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.000
the black apocalypse this is like

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.680
they're killing you and picking you off

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.960
you're being hunted by the police you

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.730
know blah blah blah and then it's like

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:09.520
oh and by the way remember in 1920 when

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.720
they did this too and then there's like

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.830
I was reading the news where there were

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:15.070
shootings in a at the Juneteenth parties

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:17.770
there like there was a one person was

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:19.720
just shot didn't talk about like any

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.130
sort of suspect or anything there like

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:23.650
someone also fired into a crowd again no

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:25.060
suspect or anything so they're just like

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:27.310
somebody got shot at a Juneteenth party

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:29.290
back to you and it's like what the [ __ ]

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:31.270
is your job to like sift through and

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:32.740
maybe get some more details that's like

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.270
what the [ __ ] happened who's a suspect

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:35.710
but they're not doing any of that

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:37.809
yeah I don't know man yes that's a

00:41:37.809 --> 00:41:39.760
little it's gets wacky it's weird just

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.050
by the way things are being presented

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:44.619
it's like and again more you know right

00:41:44.619 --> 00:41:45.790
now it's it's election year it's just

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:48.609
been going on forever so it's like you

00:41:48.609 --> 00:41:50.559
know to me it's not like it whether or

00:41:50.559 --> 00:41:52.300
not things exist or not it's like why

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:53.680
are things being for like just

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.450
everything's being hit and it's like

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:58.920
horrible man I do think - I think the

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.700
Democrats are really worried they were

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.170
losing the black vote for a while there

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:03.940
and I think they might have turned up

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:05.260
the gin I think they cranked up the jam

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.930
in terms of like pump and Sufis that's

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:09.940
my fear is a possibility dude it's a

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:11.859
positive I think they're turning up the

00:42:11.859 --> 00:42:20.309
jam dude I think who's your bet on first

00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:23.230
corporation to have a Kwanza commercial

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:26.829

00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:31.630
good choice I don't know that's going to

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:33.280
seem almost on my own for the Kwanzaa

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:38.530
celebration at Lexus first I was

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:39.670
wondering about that cuz yeah everyone's

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:41.079

00:43:07.089 --> 00:43:08.799
corners we have one for Kwanzaa

00:43:08.799 --> 00:43:12.760

kind of any sort of dedicated thought

00:44:17.299 --> 00:44:18.619
system and people are just pouring

00:44:18.619 --> 00:44:22.789
themselves into like this weird utopia

00:44:22.789 --> 00:44:24.799

00:44:42.559 --> 00:44:44.630
right now it's set up where it's like a

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:46.549
binary opposition thing where it's like

00:44:46.549 --> 00:44:48.019
I'm on this side or that side there

00:44:48.019 --> 00:44:51.349

imperialist and be like hey man that's

00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:05.130
what he does true I don't want to try to

00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:07.380
like instill [ __ ] enlightenment values

00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:08.790
over there like a [ __ ] white

00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:11.810
supremacist I do do you what

00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:13.530

00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:16.200
that that's dude that right I was in in

00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:18.150
school I would be like why don't here's

00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:19.410
what I don't understand like logically

00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:20.430
this doesn't make sense

00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:22.110
you're like logics a tool of white

00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:23.760
oppression it goes back to enlightenment

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:26.010
values and be like no they're sort of

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:28.620
good they'll argue this is this is like

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:29.850
people don't understand like when people

00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:32.000
everyone laughed at Peterson was like

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.130
okay there that's the discourse they're

00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:37.770
having in school yeah you pay thousands

00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:39.300
of dollars to send your kid to go get

00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:40.560
educated so they can come home and be

00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.180
like well I learned that logics just a

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:43.290
tool of white oppression so I'm not

00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:44.700
really supposed to like think logically

00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:45.840
on things I'm supposed to just like

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:47.580
honor people's emotions if you like yeah

00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:49.430
you're probably right

00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:51.840
since I'm telling you man so did it

00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.610
oh my white professor yeah oh yeah of

00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:56.760
course yeah man I'm telling you it's

00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:58.170
like also isn't that a little [ __ ]

00:55:58.170 --> 00:56:00.990
racist what well logic was invented by

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:04.830
white people so can't do it yeah pretty

00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:05.100
much

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:08.040
we obviously we embedded logic yeah well

00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:10.250
you know that's dude exactly it's insane

00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:12.210
you're like wait a second that's kind of

00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:14.010
weird like no you said that you know I

00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:18.300
didn't tell you man it's shaping now

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:21.180
again you it could be argued that what's

00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:23.550
driving a lot of human desire is this

00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:25.890
idea of like quote-unquote making it

00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:30.000
showbiz blowing up that's now tied to I

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.690
would say what's devolved into a kind of

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:36.300
toxic ideology so people's innate human

00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:38.220
drives is being filtered through this

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:41.130
weird new religion dude it's it's it's

00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:42.600
going to fall apart it's going to 100%

00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:44.610
fall apart yeah I was talking about a

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:45.990
little bit on stage but I was talking

00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:50.220
about how it was about Harvey not D'Elia

00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:52.170
but I was like people are like can't

00:56:52.170 --> 00:56:54.480
believe he was power to get [ __ ] yeah

00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:58.440
it's like really what you guys think the

00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:00.539
point of powers yeah

00:57:00.539 --> 00:57:02.069
no one's that's it that's little thing

00:57:02.069 --> 00:57:04.709
people are doing yeah that's the

00:57:04.709 --> 00:57:06.029
essential point man it's like dude it

00:57:06.029 --> 00:57:07.259
nobody wants to talk about this again

00:57:07.259 --> 00:57:09.689
I'll say it again if any of my boys is a

00:57:09.689 --> 00:57:11.309
pedophile I'm gonna [ __ ] come kill

00:57:11.309 --> 00:57:13.229
myself I don't [ __ ] with that I don't

00:57:13.229 --> 00:57:14.069
like that stuff

00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:15.900
absolutely but when they again when they

00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:18.839
the conversation moves towards like you

00:57:18.839 --> 00:57:20.309
know I'm trying to think of my boys I

00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:21.809
would kill all my boys if they were

00:57:21.809 --> 00:57:23.429
doing any kind of pedophilia that stuff

00:57:23.429 --> 00:57:25.229
but to be like oh yeah like the other

00:57:25.229 --> 00:57:26.189
ones that are coming out with they're

00:57:26.189 --> 00:57:27.359
like do you see the [ __ ] coming out

00:57:27.359 --> 00:57:28.949
where they're trying to say like oh this

00:57:28.949 --> 00:57:31.679
guy's cheating on his wife they're doing

00:57:31.679 --> 00:57:33.419
this it's like so we're talking I

00:57:33.419 --> 00:57:34.199
thought were voting on [ __ ]

00:57:34.199 --> 00:57:37.349
pedophiles do now now we're like yeah

00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:39.989
was like hold up adulterers yeah yeah

00:57:39.989 --> 00:57:42.299
daughters yeah we're now we're like like

00:57:42.299 --> 00:57:43.469
way he [ __ ] all these chicks and

00:57:43.469 --> 00:57:46.249
didn't want to date them get rid of them

00:57:46.249 --> 00:57:48.479
again so it's like we've come full

00:57:48.479 --> 00:57:51.359
circle we we've been like [ __ ] religion

00:57:51.359 --> 00:57:52.380
God's dead

00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:54.390
you know we're and then all of a sudden

00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:57.029
it's like and they'll shred the sanctity

00:57:57.029 --> 00:57:59.339
of marriage yeah yeah yeah cancel him

00:57:59.339 --> 00:58:02.880
yeah it's [ __ ] it's insane who knows

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:03.419
bro

00:58:03.419 --> 00:58:07.229
yeah that's the way you do it

00:58:07.229 --> 00:58:10.140
what's going on with thriving bro every

00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:11.579
day I'll give you my day today this is

00:58:11.579 --> 00:58:12.839
the other thing too there's a whole I

00:58:12.839 --> 00:58:14.880
mean this kind of dovetails into my like

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:17.009
whole idea of personal cognitive fusion

00:58:17.009 --> 00:58:18.779
where it's like you know your thoughts

00:58:18.779 --> 00:58:19.919
that just come through your head or just

00:58:19.919 --> 00:58:21.329
your thoughts they don't define you and

00:58:21.329 --> 00:58:22.769
then it's like but then we have this

00:58:22.769 --> 00:58:24.150
thing that's the media where it's like

00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:25.589
these are just stories and things that

00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:26.640
are happening obviously you know they

00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:27.959
have real-life implications obviously

00:58:27.959 --> 00:58:30.689
but it's like you also can totally push

00:58:30.689 --> 00:58:32.130
away from like a media narrative and

00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:33.509
this whole idea and just focus on just

00:58:33.509 --> 00:58:35.400
killing it yourself yeah that's all I've

00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:36.929
been doing man I just been like doing

00:58:36.929 --> 00:58:37.769
this stuff I should be doing

00:58:37.769 --> 00:58:39.929
everything's been awesome everything's

00:58:39.929 --> 00:58:41.369
been going good but as soon as I like

00:58:41.369 --> 00:58:43.709
try to touch this [ __ ] like spiked

00:58:43.709 --> 00:58:45.419
barb that is like the discourse around

00:58:45.419 --> 00:58:47.189
like entertainment and politics I

00:58:47.189 --> 00:58:49.109
instantly just walk away from it like

00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:51.329
like I got stung by a bee my blood kind

00:58:51.329 --> 00:58:53.609
of runs cold and I'm like oh god what is

00:58:53.609 --> 00:58:54.929
that it's horrible

00:58:54.929 --> 00:58:56.459
meanwhile you can totally live a

00:58:56.459 --> 00:58:58.349
perfectly fine fulfilled life and

00:58:58.349 --> 00:59:00.959
totally ignore all the [ __ ] yeah that's

00:59:00.959 --> 00:59:01.859
all I've been doing I wake up every day

00:59:01.859 --> 00:59:04.079
I play with my daughter it's it's the

00:59:04.079 --> 00:59:05.669
most I've been having I tweeted last

00:59:05.669 --> 00:59:08.069
night 2020s kind of sick actually yeah I

00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:10.679
saw it it's good I love the ear podcast

00:59:10.679 --> 00:59:13.369
as my name is

00:59:14.739 --> 00:59:17.630
every time you tweet something was I

00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:19.579
guess I'm co-signing what's what's funny

00:59:19.579 --> 00:59:21.469
I did though I did that was fine what's

00:59:21.469 --> 00:59:23.239
funny too is like people were like chill

00:59:23.239 --> 00:59:24.559
you can't say that and one guy was like

00:59:24.559 --> 00:59:27.109
well I just had a daughter like that's a

00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:29.019
pretty momentous thing so it's like any

00:59:29.019 --> 00:59:31.249
belief now it's being filtered through

00:59:31.249 --> 00:59:33.259
current events or it's like 2020 is

00:59:33.259 --> 00:59:34.940
actually pretty good it's like what are

00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:37.069
you racist you [ __ ] evolved it's like

00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:38.449
no I had a daughter it's you know it's

00:59:38.449 --> 00:59:41.589
pretty special you love the cops yeah

00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:45.170
yeah ma'am telling you it's a and I

00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:46.549
think O'Connor is wrong that it's the

00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:47.809
thing that needs to happen where it's

00:59:47.809 --> 00:59:50.390
like all right we get all this but

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:52.969
what's kind of let's try to take some of

00:59:52.969 --> 00:59:54.289
the emotionality we have to you have to

00:59:54.289 --> 00:59:55.400
take the emotionality out of this

00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:57.589
O'Connor's a big imagine if it's surgery

00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:59.660
of saying like you have to pick either

00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:00.920
side it's like no it's [ __ ] it's

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.630
designed literally to keep people apart

01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:04.699
yeah this is the lesser of two evils

01:00:04.699 --> 01:00:07.190
arguments [ __ ] that is we've gone

01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:09.589
from feudalism to capitalism you can do

01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:11.269
another major shift that just no one can

01:00:11.269 --> 01:00:12.380
know what stick enough a thing about it

01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:13.609
but you can even stay within capitalism

01:00:13.609 --> 01:00:15.619
and rearrange pretty political framework

01:00:15.619 --> 01:00:17.660
or you can be like all right like let's

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:19.670
have a third party that people to stop

01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:20.959
being like oh what's the point they're

01:00:20.959 --> 01:00:22.459
like you know we'll just you know

01:00:22.459 --> 01:00:23.779
whatever I don't know I'm out of my

01:00:23.779 --> 01:00:26.449
depth on that for sure but yeah man you

01:00:26.449 --> 01:00:27.799
can totally cut off from all this stuff

01:00:27.799 --> 01:00:29.539
and kind of live I fit my point I guy I

01:00:29.539 --> 01:00:30.380
got lost

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:31.880
yeah I can have all that stuff well how

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:33.319
are you doing what's going on chillin

01:00:33.319 --> 01:00:35.420
man dude it absolutely challenge okay

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:37.640
yeah I got to meet your kid you saw my

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:40.849
it's beautiful yeah sweet that's the

01:00:40.849 --> 01:00:42.109
whole point of it - dude I'm serving

01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:43.640
life right now it's like anything that's

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.499
anything that's involving like human

01:00:45.499 --> 01:00:47.390
beings and actually helping them versus

01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:49.430
being like remember that guy who did the

01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:51.859
thing you know we're also retweet my

01:00:51.859 --> 01:00:53.989
thing it's like dude get the [ __ ] out of

01:00:53.989 --> 01:00:55.999
here I think Hollywood's gonna implode

01:00:55.999 --> 01:00:58.849
with all the [ __ ] because he idea of

01:00:58.849 --> 01:01:00.049
being entertainer you don't need to be

01:01:00.049 --> 01:01:01.729
greenlit really by it you don't it's

01:01:01.729 --> 01:01:03.019
good less and less you need to be

01:01:03.019 --> 01:01:04.249
greenlit by people I think it's gonna be

01:01:04.249 --> 01:01:05.930
- in a pan thing we're like it's gonna

01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:07.969
be like people like meteorites we kind

01:01:07.969 --> 01:01:09.920
of like oh [ __ ] there was a guy from the

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.749
weird funny dance then you have you like

01:01:11.749 --> 01:01:13.309

don't say that was nice that was fun I

01:01:24.319 --> 01:01:25.839
mean it's weird when it's all spread out

01:01:25.839 --> 01:01:27.680
that was awkward

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:30.349
yeah but it was good yeah what was that

01:01:30.349 --> 01:01:33.440
like doing that's it was fun so on

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.230
Wednesday we went out to show with Jay

01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:38.630
mm-hmm and it was like that was fun that

01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:39.800
was the first time I was up there and

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.750
there was literally like a mouth I was

01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:43.010
like oh sure this is cool

01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:44.450
yeah you know I mean like this is

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:46.220
[ __ ] sick that I get to do this and

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:48.109
mm-hmm like there's time I was like I

01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:49.069
can't believe I'm doing this

01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:50.960
yeah I haven't done it so long I was

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.119
like this is weird to do there's a weird

01:01:53.119 --> 01:01:57.170
yeah profession how do they do the mast

01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:58.579
and the juliek take the mask off and

01:01:58.579 --> 01:02:00.079
drink and put it back on no nobody was

01:02:00.079 --> 01:02:01.940
one mast they stared oh yeah

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:03.470
they had a [ __ ] thermometer at the

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:06.349
door gosh everybody came in you read it

01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:08.150
out that's what they said to the table

01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:09.890
people are asymptomatic typically don't

01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:11.240
spread it because you have to call for

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:15.410
sneeze to spread the to put in the air I

01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:17.780
read that and then that was an argument

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:20.480
in the car as well what whether that's

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.670
true and I was like I don't think we've

01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:25.309
know anything about kovin it's like I

01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:26.780
think in the first week because I was

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:28.309
looking at I was you know I was looking

01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:30.770
up Notre Dame yeah and they are testing

01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:32.900
and anybody that tested for it has to

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:34.940
quarantine for two weeks and then their

01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:37.369
kind of practice I was like with is the

really curious to see if someone studies

01:04:25.619 --> 01:04:27.270
what makes them actually stick versus

01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:29.700

not

01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:38.280
yeah true that's usually it you ran the

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:40.640
meta-analysis yeah it's pretty easy

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.170
that's the only way you get cancelled

01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:43.680
heart

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.869

01:04:55.049 --> 01:04:58.020
sexual then you get it then you get the

01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:58.470
axe

01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:03.420

01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:11.250
decade of it Bill Cosby is the only

01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:16.789
person in jail true Harvey he's on Jill

01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:19.200

he's only he's on harsh house arrest

01:05:23.869 --> 01:05:25.950
Bill Cosby's the only one that was in

01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:28.710
jail yeah maybe our Kelly to actually

01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:29.760

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.490
committed a crime of the people were

01:05:32.490 --> 01:05:35.760
talking about who cause yeah what do you

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:37.470

01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:38.970
Harvey go to jail didn't get fair be

01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:40.650
healthy way is gonna go to jail if he's

01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:43.410
not already trill I thought he was in

01:05:43.410 --> 01:05:45.359

01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:01.200
yeah Michael Jackson's dead well

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.160
Jackson's dead

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:05.730

you might be right stop with the benefi

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:13.140
jokes like I got you King of Pop King of

01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:18.720
Pop King of Pop yeah I I just uh it's

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:21.690
just weird it's weird what uh it's and

01:06:21.690 --> 01:06:22.830
that was a theory that was bouncing

01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:23.820
around your head for a while you were

01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:25.230
like damn the only rest black dudes that

01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:28.640
get cancelled yeah for a long time your

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.650
it was true until like this year well

01:06:31.650 --> 01:06:32.940
who else would have gone to jail who

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:34.440
else should have gone to jail of the

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:38.450
hongki's that got canceled uh Matt Lauer

01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:41.280
cuz he liked Raptor he had like a lock

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.900
in his desk to like hit her with a

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:52.080
mousetrap yeah yeah he also apparently

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.850
was like show me your tits and she was

01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:55.980
like okay and did according to the thing

01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:58.530
that I read show me it was like I do

01:06:58.530 --> 01:06:59.970
think he might have a little trap [ __ ]

01:06:59.970 --> 01:07:01.770
apparently that's and again this is all

01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:03.660
charity measures they said that there's

01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:05.580
all circumstance that I was like what a

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:06.960
[ __ ] freak yeah that installed but

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.630
apparently all the doors have that so

01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:11.220
it's like and then think about it this

01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:12.720
way again I'm not defending Matt Lauer

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:14.490
I'm just exercise I'm telling people to

01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:16.290
exercise their critical thinking skills

01:07:16.290 --> 01:07:17.850
so you're getting fed this thing for the

01:07:17.850 --> 01:07:19.500
news you're going oh yeah that's exactly

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:20.040
what happened

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.870
the guy's probably a piece of [ __ ] but

01:07:21.870 --> 01:07:23.100
it's like you're about to tell a chick

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:26.190
to show her your tits lock the [ __ ]

01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:29.100
door not gonna be like play this one

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:31.290
fast you know leave it open yeah you

01:07:31.290 --> 01:07:33.420
know about this close and it's like what

01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:35.220
was the rapport before that were they

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:36.510
[ __ ] around were they giving each

01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:39.240
other sex toys and Christmas well that's

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:40.410
the other thing too nobody talks about

01:07:40.410 --> 01:07:43.200
the Legion of women who send naked

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:45.060
pictures of themselves to these people

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:47.850
continuously all day every day that's

01:07:47.850 --> 01:07:49.800
you know it's like if that was the other

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.630
way around that would be like if guys if

01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:53.250
women were getting as many dick pics as

01:07:53.250 --> 01:07:55.650
yeah maybe they are actually but it's

01:07:55.650 --> 01:07:57.750
like think they are famous what you

01:07:57.750 --> 01:08:01.800
think famous works maybe I don't know I

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.180
can't speak for dick pics I don't get it

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:05.790
right yeah I think guys that are famous

01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:08.190
guys get more nudes than just regular

01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:10.829
yes yes I'm saying so it's like no one

01:08:10.829 --> 01:08:12.450
wants to talk about that if they you

01:08:12.450 --> 01:08:14.220
know no one has to take total the total

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:15.359
picture where it's like you know it

01:08:15.359 --> 01:08:17.609
isn't like you're blaming women no it's

01:08:17.609 --> 01:08:19.319
like but if you're a dude you're rolling

01:08:19.319 --> 01:08:20.940
around and you're just every day you're

01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:22.290
just getting these pictures unsolicited

01:08:22.290 --> 01:08:24.390
pictures of naked women that's gonna

01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:26.400
distort your thinking process and you're

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:27.480
in the office you're like I think I can

01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:29.310
[ __ ] anybody really you know yeah the

01:08:29.310 --> 01:08:31.109
guy it could distort your thing in a way

01:08:31.109 --> 01:08:32.640
that makes you act like a piece of [ __ ]

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:33.779
or you know however you want to put it

01:08:33.779 --> 01:08:35.250
like you know like Matt Lauer might show

01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:36.600
me your tits or you're fired and like

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:38.640
locking his bed and I think we also were

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.710
[ __ ] Matt Lauer I don't care at all no

01:08:40.710 --> 01:08:43.290
no but again this is the problem is

01:08:43.290 --> 01:08:45.089
exactly I'm saying you can't even start

01:08:45.089 --> 01:08:47.370
to try to like what about this they're

01:08:47.370 --> 01:08:49.290
like [ __ ] you dude and someone's like

01:08:49.290 --> 01:08:51.020
that's what they said and they

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:52.949
misinterpret what you're saying see they

01:08:52.949 --> 01:08:55.589
try to get the Biebs with what sexual

01:08:55.589 --> 01:08:57.210
assault No

01:08:57.210 --> 01:08:59.430
yeah he got it unless since the last I

01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:01.819
was a Bieber he got brought down but

01:09:01.819 --> 01:09:04.350
Bieber had their receipts what happened

01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:05.819
he had the receipts from the other hotel

01:09:05.819 --> 01:09:08.460
he stayed at that night it was like shut

01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:11.279
the [ __ ] up hold on what happened girl

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:13.890
accused him of sexual assault and then

01:09:13.890 --> 01:09:15.390
he posted the pictures of the receipts

01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:17.100
of the hotel that he actually stayed at

01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:19.230
I think she said was in this other place

01:09:19.230 --> 01:09:22.560
what can he have been there you know

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.270
like five hotel rooms at once I don't

01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:25.560
know yeah I don't know exactly what

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.779
saying Bieber did that so that's all if

01:09:27.779 --> 01:09:29.520
you're just / if you just so basically

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:30.750
exactly you just post a picture of

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:32.549
receipt if you have receipts you can be

01:09:32.549 --> 01:09:35.009
like you know actually check that out

01:09:35.009 --> 01:09:37.560
yeah but it was funny cuz if that is

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.719
true if Bieber's just totally like yeah

01:09:39.719 --> 01:09:41.670
this this is where I was

01:09:41.670 --> 01:09:43.920
everybody was with me yeah sure that's

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:50.279
like what happens to the girl nothing

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:52.620
yeah it's like and there's no like maybe

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:53.699
O'Connor was talking about we were

01:09:53.699 --> 01:09:55.080
driving here and it's like the mob the

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.120
mob literally is just like get him get

01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.290
him and it's like turns out she was

01:09:58.290 --> 01:10:00.300
lying all right who's next piece of [ __ ]

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:02.460
yeah I think they turn on that person

01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:03.870
who's watering down there the

01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:06.719
seriousness of their yeah turn that and

01:10:06.719 --> 01:10:09.120
being like well maybe we were just we

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.820
just tried to kill that guy yeah

01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:14.370
there's no like you self-reflection at

01:10:14.370 --> 01:10:16.469
all of being like well that was a false

01:10:16.469 --> 01:10:18.900
accusation and with the one false

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.640
accusation we were like [ __ ] him I never

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.940
liked him kill him

01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:24.700
yeah now I'm again this it sucks we even

01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:25.930
have to do this but it's like we're not

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:27.400
defending anybody yeah

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.800
we're not like you know but it's kind of

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:31.060
the condom you have to put on everything

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.800
yeah and yeah when I was making fun of

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:36.070
using power to get [ __ ] not for minors

01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:38.530
yeah I feel like that would go without

01:10:38.530 --> 01:10:39.060
saying

01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:41.230
obviously well what dude riddle me this

01:10:41.230 --> 01:10:42.700
so there's like and this is I was

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:43.690
reading an article the other day about

01:10:43.690 --> 01:10:46.270
there's this guy he's a psychologist he

01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:48.160
was talking about how it's kind of weird

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.320
to try to for the left especially to try

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:51.670
to like get Rogen out of there since

01:10:51.670 --> 01:10:53.440
he's like you know bringing on like

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:54.940
Bernie Sanders and endorsing left

01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:58.480
political candidates but he was

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.130
basically saying like all this [ __ ] does

01:11:00.130 --> 01:11:02.980
is watered-down race racial accusations

01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:04.810
so it's like you have guys going after

01:11:04.810 --> 01:11:06.220
like you know say the Bieber a little

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:08.200
bit Bieber had an NMR tape excuse me RFA

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:12.370
Bieber did not know he was like singing

01:11:12.370 --> 01:11:15.190
like a hate song but yeah he was ancient

01:11:15.190 --> 01:11:17.680
southern hate song he was he was like

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.300
where the [ __ ] did that come from

01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:21.370
he somehow like a good point he you know

01:11:21.370 --> 01:11:27.490
he had a squash that but so it's like

01:11:27.490 --> 01:11:29.740
why it seems to be like all of these

01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:35.650
crazy he's you know he had that one fly

01:11:35.650 --> 01:11:37.420
under the radar yeah but it's like all

01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:39.430
of the for me the stuff that I've seen

01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:41.320
of like the most concentrated hatred

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:43.570
tends to be at for like racial or like

01:11:43.570 --> 01:11:46.240
perceived human error slights

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:48.820
seems to be at people and showbiz where

01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:50.950
it's like there was just a you read

01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:53.410
about the [ __ ] army guy who like sold

01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:55.180
out his entire troop to like a band of

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:56.830
neo-nazis to try to get his own troop

01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:59.260
killed because he was like I just saw I

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:01.510
was like a neo-nazi that also loved Isis

01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:03.730
or some [ __ ] it was bizarre nice you'll

01:12:03.730 --> 01:12:05.920
get the whole point was like a chef and

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.090
say Lou you're having people trying to

01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:12.880
[ __ ] people were like you guys are so

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:15.520
busy trying to like convince people or

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:18.280
Joe Rogan is at his the core of racist

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.960
human being when it's like there's

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.550
there's like they use an example of some

01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:22.930
guy who's in Congress who like did

01:12:22.930 --> 01:12:24.340
something that was like fundamentally

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.710
horrific and like like rotten heartedly

01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:29.140
racist and then when that comes time to

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:31.420
like get that guy all these people can

01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:32.740
pick how they [ __ ] say this [ __ ]

01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:34.120
about everybody and it's actually

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.410
counterproductive yeah

01:12:35.410 --> 01:12:37.060
but it's also like why is all this hate

01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:38.110
like that shit'll happen it's like

01:12:38.110 --> 01:12:39.700
alright some weird guy and they're like

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:41.410
those weird but if it's an entertainer

01:12:41.410 --> 01:12:43.270
that's what it's like it's because

01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:45.340
there's like I should be that there's

01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:47.410
this weird disgusting human aspect of it

01:12:47.410 --> 01:12:49.930
where it's like I should be there not

01:12:49.930 --> 01:12:52.150
him it's like when a military guy sells

01:12:52.150 --> 01:12:56.050
out his entire platoon to like neo-nazis

01:12:56.050 --> 01:12:58.060
through [ __ ] like a encrypted app

01:12:58.060 --> 01:12:58.930
which I'm gonna how they got through

01:12:58.930 --> 01:12:59.950
that encrypted app I'm kind of curious

01:12:59.950 --> 01:13:02.470
about that but when they sell them out

01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:04.810
and everyone's just kind of like that's

01:13:04.810 --> 01:13:05.110
weird

01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:08.620
so you'd be most mad at the actual like

01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:10.720
deport like the yeah the neo-nazi who

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.450
came out and publicly was like yes I

01:13:13.450 --> 01:13:15.190
know what I was doing I hope they

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:17.260
[ __ ] die [ __ ] you guys

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:19.480
Heil Hitler and they're like and then

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:32.700
like clip that and we'll work from there

01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:41.140
clip that oh yeah well they said what

01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:42.790
people again I this is calling for a lot

01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:43.780
this is what I've been stumbling over

01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:45.040
the whole time but it's like if you're

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.750
securing yourself and you're like dude I

01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:49.270
Know Who I am as a person I know what I

01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:51.130
want out of life I'm happy with life as

01:13:51.130 --> 01:13:53.440
it is whether I get more stuff or less

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:55.600
stuff you're immune to all this [ __ ] cuz

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.010
you're just like yeah whatever whatever

01:13:57.010 --> 01:13:58.750
do whatever the [ __ ] you guys won but

01:13:58.750 --> 01:14:00.280
again if it's like if you're striving

01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:02.290
for more it can everything you must be

01:14:02.290 --> 01:14:04.360
taken that's terrifying man there's

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.310
something I want I want to do a special

01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:09.700
yeah so I am worried about [ __ ] sure

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:11.080
there's nothing wrong with that it's

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.690
just it sucks and even if you're secure

01:14:13.690 --> 01:14:16.690
as a person there is a thing where an

01:14:16.690 --> 01:14:18.460
accusation can just be brought up like

01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:20.290
we just saw with that dude that I'm

01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:22.240
friends with yeah it's like his crime

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:24.250
was just like oh he [ __ ] a couple be

01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:27.520
[ __ ] too much yeah yeah and like you

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:29.530
now don't get again a [ __ ] it whatever

01:14:29.530 --> 01:14:31.210
I'm not gonna do it there were people

01:14:31.210 --> 01:14:32.230
that were like whether or not this is

01:14:32.230 --> 01:14:34.660
true he's a piece of [ __ ] and it's like

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:37.360
you're just gonna tweet that ok there's

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:38.680
then there's like a mob is like yeah

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:42.880
[ __ ] them and it's like there's four for

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.320
entertainers now they've entered into

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.480
this like moral Nasdaq where it's like

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:48.880
you know you like you you're a woman

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:51.520
it's like your ticket sales dip a little

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:54.400
bit arms pop back up really black lives

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.020
matter like [ __ ] yeah dude your [ __ ]

01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:58.810
eyes back up and it's like I just

01:14:58.810 --> 01:15:00.370
[ __ ] bizarre it to me it's bizarre it

01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:02.620
is it's there's people there's people

01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:04.679
are being encouraged to kind of connect

01:15:04.679 --> 01:15:07.389
with the false selves basically of like

01:15:07.389 --> 01:15:09.280
scared personalities and like Doral is

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.139
it's just [ __ ] weird dude it's weird

01:15:11.139 --> 01:15:19.000
to me they sold OG but yeah I don't see

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.780
it any well at all ending well mm-hmm

01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:25.949
what do you mean I mean people just end

01:15:25.949 --> 01:15:28.449
now because they'll go out quiet

01:15:28.449 --> 01:15:30.219
I better be quiet it'll just slowly we

01:15:30.219 --> 01:15:32.260
haven't cancelled some in a while yeah

01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:35.110
they don't keep popping up man yeah I

01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:36.310
think it'll be a long time like I

01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:37.540
remember when people were like when

01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:39.100
hopefully when kovat happens this whole

01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:42.190
thing I think I'll just get worse what

01:15:42.190 --> 01:15:44.050
do you think about the land think about

01:15:44.050 --> 01:15:46.690
since we started versus now yeah it's

01:15:46.690 --> 01:15:48.550
like completely the [ __ ] that we thought

01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:50.139
we were dealing with in a Philadelphia

01:15:50.139 --> 01:15:53.260
comedy scene has transformed Gold

01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:56.050
national politics global politics so

01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:58.540
it's like you know I used to think that

01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:02.370
total started there dude that's we want

01:16:03.330 --> 01:16:08.739

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:18.719
[Laughter]

01:16:18.719 --> 01:16:21.540
when they got banned from the comedy

01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:24.489
club found out that I had a show on

01:16:24.489 --> 01:16:31.389

a show as a guest is banned yeah wasn't

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:42.699
that exactly what they said yeah I think

01:16:42.699 --> 01:16:45.449
so yeah they put out I was the ultimate

01:16:45.449 --> 01:16:51.130
Facebook post yeah so that day I had two

01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:53.590

like historically of like hysteria right

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:45.290

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.190
don't want to assume his sexuality but

01:17:52.190 --> 01:17:55.330
he had a he's talked away sure explain

01:17:55.330 --> 01:17:57.320
his sexuality it's nothing to do with

01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:01.070
this sure I'll just um just a black dude

01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:02.660

accused her of following him at first

01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:12.620

01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:15.470
her house got out of the car started

01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:17.390

01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:31.910
was like oh like full like covering her

01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:33.410
face like screaming like you're trying

01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:35.590
to kill me you're going care environment

01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:38.300
then he was like here's her license

01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:39.739
plate everybody and she's like dove to

01:18:39.739 --> 01:18:44.320
cover it was like no no and it was like

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:46.460
you were literally trying to kill this

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:49.520
lady though for flicking you off he

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.140
tossed him she called me the n-word once

01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:53.780
and then he backed off that he went D I

01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:55.400
think he was just lying about that

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:57.110
because he really was focusing on you

01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:59.260
think you can just flip people off yeah

01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:01.910
versus the the one who's like he could

01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:02.750
she called me anyway

01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:06.230
anyway so he didn't catch he toss that

01:19:06.230 --> 01:19:08.090
in the video he did toss that real quick

01:19:08.090 --> 01:19:09.230
but the majority of the video he's

01:19:09.230 --> 01:19:11.390
screaming that she flicked him off yeah

01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:12.560
that would be the first order but that

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:14.090
was number one if you were trying to

01:19:14.090 --> 01:19:14.730
carry it

01:19:14.730 --> 01:19:17.670
you flipped me off and not to mention me

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:19.500
which I think they were in different

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:21.060
cars and if she cut him off they'd be

01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:22.980
tough to it he might also have sinned

01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:25.100
when she Mario Kart at the Edward out I

01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:29.080
[Laughter]

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:35.370
don't know how you got invited pshaw

01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:37.550
like um it was an upside-down question

01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:43.590
[ __ ] yeah but it was like and so funny

01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:45.840
it was just like yeah dude you can't you

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:49.200
can't threaten somebody with literally

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:51.660
destroying their life she laid down like

01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:53.370
a fake footlocker that he drove into was

01:19:53.370 --> 01:20:26.670
a yeah that's good stuff it's good yeah

01:20:26.670 --> 01:20:29.370
but it was it's like the hysterics of

01:20:29.370 --> 01:20:30.840
the lady there's no thing she was in

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.070
like a Geo Metro

01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:34.170
so things weren't she wasn't killing it

01:20:34.170 --> 01:20:36.239
dude that's a that could be an n-word

01:20:36.239 --> 01:20:38.989
Moby L dude did he smell like cigarettes

01:20:38.989 --> 01:20:42.690
I'm not denying that she said it yeah

01:20:42.690 --> 01:20:44.670
especially if she was like cutting

01:20:44.670 --> 01:20:50.160
somebody off especially but I don't

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:53.610
think he caught it you and I I think now

01:20:53.610 --> 01:20:54.989
you mention it you are right

01:20:54.989 --> 01:20:57.210
yeah he was correct to be like she

01:20:57.210 --> 01:20:59.250
called me the n-word yeah I mean what

01:20:59.250 --> 01:21:00.330

[ __ ] like I did I'd see it pretty

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.830
often like he was always like piece of

01:24:20.830 --> 01:24:22.750
[ __ ] he's a [ __ ] dumb redneck [ __ ]

something turned him on when he was like

01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:42.700

up things so I'm not like if you know if

01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:11.020

01:25:15.730 --> 01:25:17.380
to the point where I've honestly started

01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:19.390

01:27:41.989 --> 01:27:43.940
to be Ted Danson so he went full

01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:44.480
blackface

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:47.119
but his imaginary actually black-faced

01:27:47.119 --> 01:27:50.869
he blackface hard Stern Stern did and

01:27:50.869 --> 01:27:55.280
I'm saying wild [ __ ] he right it was a

01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:57.289
long time I'm not I'm not [ __ ] on

01:27:57.289 --> 01:28:00.679
the guy yeah but he was trying to

01:28:00.679 --> 01:28:03.650
imitate what Ted Danson was he was he

01:28:03.650 --> 01:28:05.150
was calling a Ted Danson Ted Danson

01:28:05.150 --> 01:28:07.909
erases by being racist and was doing it

01:28:07.909 --> 01:28:09.620
like

01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:11.270
dropped a couple ants so he did like he

01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:12.350
was almost doing like a blackface

01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:13.940
inception where it was it was reward

01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:15.910
just like a dream within the dream yes

01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:19.670
but it was just you know what's also

01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:20.720
again that's why he didn't get cancelled

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.340
because he's doing the voice if he was

01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:24.890
doing like if he was prime time which is

01:28:24.890 --> 01:28:26.960
this kind of news I think he's good well

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:29.140
no he won't get canceled he can't he's

01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:31.580
for stuff he's all of seriousness money

01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:34.130
yeah he's all he's literally if he goes

01:28:34.130 --> 01:28:37.010
down Sirius XM is gone yeah they're just

01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:38.060
gonna have to be like yeah [ __ ] it

01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:40.370
he's with us well this is the question

01:28:40.370 --> 01:28:41.600
and this is the thing I wonder it's like

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:44.480
if you are is it even possible to do if

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:47.510
you you know say like you want to say

01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:48.770
you want to do a special it's like well

01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:51.260
you know is that entail like having like

01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:52.640
a network or is that entail just like

01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:53.930
recording and put one out and like it's

01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:55.250
one better than the other and like you

01:28:55.250 --> 01:28:58.610
know how does that work well recording

01:28:58.610 --> 01:29:00.200
and putting one out like on YouTube yeah

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:03.710
yeah that's a definite option yeah sure

01:29:03.710 --> 01:29:05.270
but you don't get paid for that right

01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:09.320
that's secure the [ __ ] I'd like to get

01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:13.880
paid for my job yeah yeah but the good

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:15.620
part is if you put out a good special on

01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:17.600
YouTube more people come to your shows

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:19.760
so you get paid more yeah so there is

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:21.920
that and then uh plus if I did a special

01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:26.030
right now I'd get like 40 grand awesome

01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:28.760
it's also awesome but I think you can

01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:30.710
make that with ticket sales off a

01:29:30.710 --> 01:29:33.230
YouTube video if it's good enough so you

01:29:33.230 --> 01:29:35.690
still get more - I don't know that works

01:29:35.690 --> 01:29:37.310
but it's like you definitely yeah my

01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:40.700
point is my point is can you ignore

01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:43.220
those large bodies that are perpetuating

01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:45.800
and kind of like gatekeeping based on

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:48.980
this my opinion kind of nonsense I think

01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:52.010
you again you know I don't want to go

01:29:52.010 --> 01:29:55.130
too far into what I want but I'd rather

01:29:55.130 --> 01:29:58.250
be able to ignore them and get it yeah

01:29:58.250 --> 01:30:00.260
but get into the industry within there

01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:03.470
despite that yeah again again I'm not

01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:04.940
trying to get on like a [ __ ] sitcom

01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:10.640
I'm not trying to [ __ ] I'm not so it

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:12.230
would be tight I mean I take the money

01:30:12.230 --> 01:30:14.900
but that was never the goal I just

01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:16.760
wanted to be a comic yeah did you stand

01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:19.670
up you know and if yeah did you ever

01:30:19.670 --> 01:30:23.179
foresee all this [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:30:23.179 --> 01:30:25.610
yes literally from day one I was like if

01:30:25.610 --> 01:30:26.810
I guess nothing we're dead

01:30:26.810 --> 01:30:29.679
yeah but no never than ever SNL yeah

01:30:29.679 --> 01:30:32.000
wilds never thought the way I look at it

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.140
you know again maybe I'll miss the

01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:35.690
[ __ ] hippie loser but it's like you

01:30:35.690 --> 01:30:37.520
know I'm always like if I can just not

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:38.210
have a nine-to-five

01:30:38.210 --> 01:30:41.030
I'm wind so I look at it through that oh

01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:42.710
I'm screw over don't go wait wrong

01:30:42.710 --> 01:30:44.239
there's still there's always a point

01:30:44.239 --> 01:30:45.409
where I'm like even when I was just

01:30:45.409 --> 01:30:47.830
doing stand-up yeah for like a [ __ ]

01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:51.620
20% full room in a mall yeah I was like

01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:56.480
sick is a cool thing um but yeah well

01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:57.650
that's that's the thing I feel like it's

01:30:57.650 --> 01:30:59.210
all mine again I could be paranoid but

01:30:59.210 --> 01:31:01.719
it almost is like the perception of like

01:31:01.719 --> 01:31:05.480
network making it on you know now no one

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:07.640
can say to me seems like a little bit of

01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:09.830
a like one of those little animal traps

01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:10.820
where you have like a sting and it's

01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:12.679
just I guess stick in a string and

01:31:12.679 --> 01:31:14.060
you're like pull it and then once you're

01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:15.140
in there like our dude here's what you

01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:17.449
do here's you can't do it but you know

01:31:17.449 --> 01:31:19.699
so it's one of those things were yeah I

01:31:19.699 --> 01:31:21.140
don't know I mean it seems like an

01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:22.640
immense amount of pressure then once all

01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:23.840
that stuff happens and it's just like

01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:26.780
look man we're more scrutiny more this

01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:28.580
yeah but nobody's gonna go through your

01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:30.860
[ __ ] if you get a special yeah

01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:32.420
no one's gonna be like we need to cancel

01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:34.370
him for this sure if you're just doing

01:31:34.370 --> 01:31:39.469
like a whatever special so I'm not

01:31:39.469 --> 01:31:40.010
worried about that

01:31:40.010 --> 01:31:41.659
yeah and even if I if I got canceled

01:31:41.659 --> 01:31:45.650
again yeah yeah put the ball over the

01:31:45.650 --> 01:31:49.520
ends i if you get cancer twice that

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:51.469
means you're you're doing something

01:31:51.469 --> 01:31:54.020
pretty good trail like if you got

01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:58.840
cancelled and then came back he's back I

01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:01.340
mean the more cancels you get literally

01:32:01.340 --> 01:32:03.380
the more talented you the fact that you

01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:06.170
can survive one horizon Brett like shut

01:32:06.170 --> 01:32:09.440
up Mel dude Mel Mel just gets kids he's

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:15.350
a college dude dude he gets kids up hard

01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:17.300
n-word yeah he gets canceled for like

01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:19.730
the I'm he also pluralized that which no

01:32:19.730 --> 01:32:20.480
one gave him credit for

01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:22.310
so it's like when you shoot 10 people he

01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:24.020
got like a heap law realizes they gotta

01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:26.480
give him a 10 counts of the inwo oh he

01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:31.730
said so that's like you know it's like

01:32:31.730 --> 01:32:33.530
shooting at 15 P that was a tough one

01:32:33.530 --> 01:32:34.670
though because that was a private

01:32:34.670 --> 01:32:37.070
recording mm-hmm he's

01:32:37.070 --> 01:32:39.139
he said was so atrocious that it does

01:32:39.139 --> 01:32:40.760
kind of cancel out the private recording

01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:43.130
but there's kind of a part of me that's

01:32:43.130 --> 01:32:45.469
always like it's a private court make a

01:32:45.469 --> 01:32:47.780
yeah are you even allowed although I

01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:49.070
think was a voicemail and someone else's

01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:54.380
phone I think he requires I [ __ ]

01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:57.739
press record I really didn't know he was

01:32:57.739 --> 01:32:59.810
Australian it's easier to Billy I had to

01:32:59.810 --> 01:33:01.340
tell Billy last week Mel Gibson was

01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:04.130
Australia I had no femoral no I think I

01:33:04.130 --> 01:33:05.510
knew Russell Crowe I had no idea until

01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:07.460
today that Mel Gibson was Australian I

01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:09.560
watched a part of it any room I was much

01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:11.510
part of an interview and I was like what

01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:13.040
the [ __ ] is he doing a bit ok he's

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:15.409
[ __ ] Australian oh maybe that's what

01:33:15.409 --> 01:33:16.610
he liked Mel every time he said

01:33:16.610 --> 01:33:17.929
something he's doing the Australian

01:33:17.929 --> 01:33:19.869
accent dude he's clearly [ __ ] kidding

01:33:19.869 --> 01:33:25.099
the Jays are bad he's joking yeah yeah I

01:33:25.099 --> 01:33:26.690
reminds me speaking of Australian

01:33:26.690 --> 01:33:29.599
accents what you see the new uh I even

01:33:29.599 --> 01:33:31.190
tell you about this did we talk about no

01:33:31.190 --> 01:33:34.190

mm-hmm

01:33:41.409 --> 01:33:45.889
second was now I'm [ __ ] really yeah

01:33:45.889 --> 01:33:47.869
people were like how are you gonna top

01:33:47.869 --> 01:33:52.190

also [ __ ] she what she claiming

01:33:57.110 --> 01:34:02.869
she's claiming autism I think did she

01:34:02.869 --> 01:34:04.130
self diagnosed because I think that

01:34:04.130 --> 01:34:05.810
would disclose her from autism she's

01:34:05.810 --> 01:34:08.329
like no I looked it up I'm autistic no

01:34:08.329 --> 01:34:13.030

01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:17.750
of trains yeah oh no she I'm not saying

01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:19.460

01:34:34.159 --> 01:34:35.360
part of like a chick with a pregnancy

01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:37.070

special was it good yeah she's

01:34:51.349 --> 01:34:53.449
the confidence that she has in the

01:34:53.449 --> 01:34:55.429
beginning that special is its unparallel

01:34:55.429 --> 01:34:57.440
I said I'll comes out she's like you

01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:59.510

01:34:59.510 --> 01:35:04.090
be step one scoring some autism [ __ ] it

01:35:04.090 --> 01:35:07.099
all right

01:35:07.099 --> 01:35:09.349
she's like I've got a louis c.k jock

01:35:09.349 --> 01:35:11.210

01:35:20.389 --> 01:35:22.250
died and she just comes out this is like

01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:26.480
by the way or yeah I think I stopped I

01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:29.469
could get to the Louie CK close but she

01:35:29.469 --> 01:35:32.929
did that first first special claims she

01:35:32.929 --> 01:35:34.639
was retiring from stand-up I think even

01:35:34.639 --> 01:35:36.230
in this special she was like this

01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:37.550
industry's disgusting I don't want

01:35:37.550 --> 01:35:38.659
anything to do with it yeah

01:35:38.659 --> 01:35:41.750
I'm out [ __ ] you and then she was like

01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:44.659
it blew up she was like alright I'm

01:35:44.659 --> 01:35:47.690
gonna have to tour yeah obviously favor

01:35:47.690 --> 01:35:50.270
like here's 20 million dollars she was

01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:52.040
like I'll stick her out yeah I don't

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:53.409
know if it was that much obviously but

01:35:53.409 --> 01:35:57.460
cuz I can't imagine how it could be but

01:35:57.460 --> 01:36:00.469

also though that's the thing dude and

01:41:54.979 --> 01:41:56.360
then we wants to talk about it it's like

01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:58.519
this was the I believe all women thing

01:41:58.519 --> 01:42:00.769
it's like okay so in 15 of girl comes

01:42:00.769 --> 01:42:01.880
out like hey this guy [ __ ] me when he

01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:04.249
was 15 when I was 15 it's like she might

01:42:04.249 --> 01:42:04.940
not be lying

01:42:04.940 --> 01:42:05.900
she also could these are the

01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:08.690
possibilities right yeah the thing is

01:42:08.690 --> 01:42:10.099
it's like so I believe all women all

01:42:10.099 --> 01:42:11.570
right so if a woman says this guy [ __ ]

01:42:11.570 --> 01:42:12.829
me did some sort of sexual thing I

01:42:12.829 --> 01:42:14.059
automatically assume they're telling the

01:42:14.059 --> 01:42:15.739
truth and I believe him what if a woman

01:42:15.739 --> 01:42:17.960
says like oh I saw that guy one time and

01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:19.880
you know he stole something from my

01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:22.219
house do you believe her when she talks

01:42:22.219 --> 01:42:24.019
about stealing stuff you don't I mean

01:42:24.019 --> 01:42:25.550
it's guy it's just weird it doesn't

01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:27.979
really true should we believe all

01:42:27.979 --> 01:42:30.739
Karen's exactly do when she calls the

01:42:30.739 --> 01:42:32.630
cops and is like others a black guy

01:42:32.630 --> 01:42:35.420
who's attacking me believe all Karen's

01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:37.429
as well no and this all this is it's

01:42:37.429 --> 01:42:38.840
different for it's like a situation

01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:40.460
comes up and you have like nine

01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:44.960
different rigid frame works because I

01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:46.849
know exactly how it feels okay believed

01:42:46.849 --> 01:42:49.999
in all Karen's he hates lemare dude why

01:42:49.999 --> 01:42:52.670
you hate carrots no Yates in the mayor's

01:42:52.670 --> 01:42:53.119
defense

01:42:53.119 --> 01:42:55.880
lemare lemare has had a strong anti

01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:58.099
white people in general stance since I

01:42:58.099 --> 01:43:00.139
met him particularly white women I

01:43:00.139 --> 01:43:02.360
respect so I do respect his stance on

01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:03.829
this and that's my thing maybe I'm

01:43:03.829 --> 01:43:05.329

01:53:21.079 --> 01:53:22.820
back of my mind is just everybody behind

01:53:26.719 --> 01:53:28.719

that affect you but it does I'll be

01:53:32.809 --> 01:53:34.369
honest well it's also tough it's like

01:53:34.369 --> 01:53:35.179
are we're gonna talk for two hours

01:53:35.179 --> 01:53:36.889
what's the thing we've been thinking

01:53:36.889 --> 01:53:40.039
about for [ __ ] yeah all week why can

01:53:40.039 --> 01:53:42.320
i portray these thoughts that I had to

01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:44.719
myself in a way that I can't get in

01:53:44.719 --> 01:53:47.570
trouble yeah like oh yeah cuz then it's

01:53:47.570 --> 01:53:50.449
an admission of even thinking like oh

01:53:50.449 --> 01:53:52.190
look how scared all these comics are now

01:53:52.190 --> 01:53:53.749
it's like well I'm kind of worried that

01:53:53.749 --> 01:53:56.329
just accusations can ruin you also I got

01:53:56.329 --> 01:53:57.889
enough people that [ __ ] don't like me

01:53:57.889 --> 01:53:59.329
wait till they come from went for

01:53:59.329 --> 01:54:00.800
landscapers dude we'll see what the [ __ ]

01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:05.599
happens once there like I like to yeah

01:54:05.599 --> 01:54:09.079
man it's it's [ __ ] but again all I

01:54:09.079 --> 01:54:10.429
only do is think about the good stuff

01:54:10.429 --> 01:54:12.619
think about cool stuff like band girls

01:54:12.619 --> 01:54:14.449
with fat asses drinking out of a dish

01:54:14.449 --> 01:54:17.170
horse horse girls that are hot yeah

01:54:17.170 --> 01:54:20.659
horse girls is a major come up if you

01:54:20.659 --> 01:54:22.070
can get a hold on they're rare because

01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:24.499
typically they're you have like just

01:54:24.499 --> 01:54:27.050
loaded with horse blinders mustache they

01:54:27.050 --> 01:54:28.670
look they they always looks to me like

01:54:28.670 --> 01:54:30.409
Napoleon Dynamite with with a long

01:54:30.409 --> 01:54:33.229
ponytail they all look like Napoleon

01:54:33.229 --> 01:54:36.349
Dynamite but I also wonder if that was

01:54:36.349 --> 01:54:37.969
part of Gatsby's assessment where

01:54:37.969 --> 01:54:39.019
they're like how long did you pretend to

01:54:39.019 --> 01:54:40.639
be a horse for she's like half my life

01:54:40.639 --> 01:54:42.440
and then

01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:44.150
became a comedian that was a horse girl

01:54:44.150 --> 01:54:49.550
trying to compete they all nine they are

01:54:49.550 --> 01:54:51.410
dead do you think they rose died early

01:54:51.410 --> 01:54:54.140
none of them live I don't know you there

01:54:54.140 --> 01:54:55.550
should be a good role like rom-com I'm

01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:57.020
like a horse girl like that like there

01:54:57.020 --> 01:54:59.440

01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:03.020
she's all that hot some dude just yeah

01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:05.360

01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:08.930
oh man that dog girl definitely you what

01:55:08.930 --> 01:55:10.250

when you [ __ ] I mean dude no I know I

01:55:18.850 --> 01:55:23.390

her age right we're [ __ ] if you do for

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.340
the record you know hooked us if you

01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:30.140
something else all a year and do some

01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:33.170
bad math on us honestly we're definitely

01:55:33.170 --> 01:55:35.060
gonna Google her age as soon as this is

01:55:35.060 --> 01:55:40.520
done before we upload it I mean I throw

01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:42.110
it out and then if we're wrong we commit

01:55:42.110 --> 01:55:46.520
seppuku on camera we cut off our owners

01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:49.010
yes we cut off our boners on cam that

01:55:49.010 --> 01:55:50.900
bonus we didn't get to dog girl by the

01:55:50.900 --> 01:55:56.500
way boners were not from dog existing

01:55:56.500 --> 01:55:59.180
from I like to say to them for the

01:55:59.180 --> 01:56:00.410
record the boners are not for dog girl

01:56:00.410 --> 01:56:01.640
there from kick-ass women

01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:03.440
yeah boners were actually from when we

01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:09.770
were shaming at gift no I want to know I

01:56:09.770 --> 01:56:11.449
need again I need this is broken down

01:56:11.449 --> 01:56:12.890
logically if like all right so if

01:56:12.890 --> 01:56:14.870
someone if we're in a world now where

01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:16.520
anyone on Twitter can come out and be

01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:18.080
like well the guy was a piece of [ __ ] to

01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:19.670
me and you're like hey dude like the

01:56:19.670 --> 01:56:22.520
four minutes like hey McLin Qi get out

of here you're done we're through with

01:56:23.780 --> 01:56:25.640
you it's like alright if you live in

01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:26.030
that world

01:56:26.030 --> 01:56:28.040
yeah nice to kind of come up with some

01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:30.530
sort of vetting system that's all you

01:56:30.530 --> 01:56:32.510
know yeah man I gotta listen to it again

01:56:32.510 --> 01:56:36.140
that [ __ ] dead book Jon Ronson or

01:56:36.140 --> 01:56:38.270
yeah Jon Ronson - so you've been

01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:40.340
publicly shamed yeah there's a good

01:56:40.340 --> 01:56:43.219
chunk in there about like literally like

01:56:43.219 --> 01:56:45.110
the historical context of people doing

01:56:45.110 --> 01:56:45.949
this forever

01:56:45.949 --> 01:56:47.900
yeah like we've done this you put people

01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:49.610
in the stocks yeah I just put somebody

01:56:49.610 --> 01:56:51.320
up in front of everybody in town like

01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:54.380
[ __ ] [ __ ] people came I like cabbage

01:56:54.380 --> 01:56:56.230
at you I mean it's the same thing

01:56:56.230 --> 01:56:57.700
and they stopped doing it because of how

01:56:57.700 --> 01:56:59.470
[ __ ] up it was yeah like it was

01:56:59.470 --> 01:57:01.080
traumatic enough that people like I

01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:04.030
don't care if you whip me or I get

01:57:04.030 --> 01:57:05.410
flogged for this just don't do it in

01:57:05.410 --> 01:57:07.480
front of everybody I mean I know I said

01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:09.310
the only way to that is through like a

01:57:09.310 --> 01:57:11.860
nuanced discussion Beck I'm not saying I

01:57:11.860 --> 01:57:14.530
don't believe you but there are other

01:57:14.530 --> 01:57:16.360
things there's nothing's like completely

01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:17.650
you know dimensional and it's like no no

01:57:17.650 --> 01:57:19.180
that's if a woman says something I

01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:21.250
believe it that works it's like yeah it

01:57:21.250 --> 01:57:22.570
works for you in terms of you don't get

01:57:22.570 --> 01:57:23.980
any sort of weird backlash in the short

01:57:23.980 --> 01:57:25.840
term then like if you're thinking

01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:27.670
actually like how many lives are being

01:57:27.670 --> 01:57:29.170
unnecessarily ruined blah blah blah blah

01:57:29.170 --> 01:57:31.480
potentially yes if you were like well I

01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:32.620
don't even want to think about that it's

01:57:32.620 --> 01:57:34.750
like all right get ready for [ __ ] a

01:57:34.750 --> 01:57:36.760
hellish nightmare to ensue yeah we're

01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:38.650
all running on this weird fear program

01:57:38.650 --> 01:57:40.390
or it's like let's just kind of ignore

01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:42.010
the reality of situations and just like

01:57:42.010 --> 01:57:43.630
not try to get called out it's like dude

01:57:43.630 --> 01:57:46.390
good [ __ ] luck it's also it's coming

01:57:46.390 --> 01:57:46.989
for you

01:57:46.989 --> 01:57:51.070
yeah dude like and unfortunately like I

01:57:51.070 --> 01:57:54.580
I laughed it's some of these it's are I

01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:55.750
mean I've already got the bug

01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:58.120
sure okay I mean I'm immune to it at

01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:00.550
this point I could get it I could get a

01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:02.500
worse train there's one more strain

01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:04.180
that's worse than the strain I got yeah

01:58:04.180 --> 01:58:07.660
true what actually there's two more

01:58:07.660 --> 01:58:08.170
stress

01:58:08.170 --> 01:58:09.190
yeah I'm thinking about some strange

01:58:09.190 --> 01:58:13.510
yeah but all these comics that are like

01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:15.580

01:58:15.580 --> 01:58:21.850
like dude B your turn yeah dude so B's

01:58:21.850 --> 01:58:23.770
it's a hornet's nest you're just kind of

01:58:23.770 --> 01:58:26.470
like oh [ __ ] yeah why is it comics there

01:58:26.470 --> 01:58:28.690
get it so about it cuz typically

01:58:28.690 --> 01:58:30.820
comedians are [ __ ] up not now I'm not

01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:32.140
saying their behavior sure I'm saying

01:58:32.140 --> 01:58:33.940
like all these like people that are

01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:35.080
willing to backstab each other

01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:37.900
immediately to and and so excited to

01:58:37.900 --> 01:58:39.940
drag people to ask just to think of the

01:58:39.940 --> 01:58:42.790
open mikes all those people are first

01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:44.920
off most of them are are [ __ ]

01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:47.170
sure alright yeah if you want to base

01:58:47.170 --> 01:58:48.850
off that there's not really like hoarse

can't believe how bad comics are it's

01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:21.250
like no it's just we're probably the

01:59:21.250 --> 01:59:23.530
only profession where all of our

01:59:23.530 --> 01:59:25.660
co-workers are delighted to do this to

01:59:25.660 --> 01:59:28.270
us yeah they're so excited to publicly

01:59:28.270 --> 01:59:29.950
do it and they all are the same people

01:59:29.950 --> 01:59:31.810
that think they they need to speak out

01:59:31.810 --> 01:59:34.720
these are [ __ ] people that couldn't

01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:36.700
do anything else yeah that are like I

01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:38.830
need to speak well it's also the job

01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:40.840
entails taking verbal risks like you go

01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:42.280
on say like I would go to say something

01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:43.750
like horrible about myself if people

01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:46.060
don't laugh I'm like [ __ ] that's out

01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:47.800
there now so it's like you know it's

01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:50.470
also the job is going out saying like

01:59:50.470 --> 01:59:52.150
them white like the most wild [ __ ] you

01:59:52.150 --> 01:59:54.070
can think of is part of it if like how

01:59:54.070 --> 01:59:56.110
am I going to elicit a visceral reaction

01:59:56.110 --> 01:59:58.030
out of a bunch of strangers who are

01:59:58.030 --> 02:00:00.790
expecting me to elicit a verbal bodily

02:00:00.790 --> 02:00:03.340
reaction out yeah so you know your bag

02:00:03.340 --> 02:00:04.720
of tricks you start notice like now this

02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:06.100
[ __ ] works that you start throwing it

02:00:06.100 --> 02:00:07.090
yeah you're trying to make people laugh

02:00:07.090 --> 02:00:09.190
and it's like everyone's watched each

02:00:09.190 --> 02:00:11.350
other go through that process and then

02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:13.210
being like I remember something you said

02:00:13.210 --> 02:00:15.370
I wasn't very nice to say bad words to

02:00:15.370 --> 02:00:17.980
elicit a response yeah it's like but not

02:00:17.980 --> 02:00:19.570
not even that I'm just saying the fact

02:00:19.570 --> 02:00:22.750
that everyone's like there's like again

02:00:22.750 --> 02:00:24.280
like I can't believe all comedians or

02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:26.290
scumbags it's like well I think I think

02:00:26.290 --> 02:00:27.760
they're probably a little more so than

02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:29.140
others because it's mostly drinking in

02:00:29.140 --> 02:00:30.910
your bars every night so think of you

02:00:30.910 --> 02:00:33.930
drank every day how many mistakes you

02:00:33.930 --> 02:00:36.660
you're gonna be making a ton of mistakes

02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:41.260
but also the absolute losers in this

02:00:41.260 --> 02:00:43.810
profession that can't do it so literally

02:00:43.810 --> 02:00:47.410
the only thing they can do is voice all

02:00:47.410 --> 02:00:49.570
the sudden they're politicians yeah

02:00:49.570 --> 02:00:52.060
they're like I'm into politics now do

02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:53.260
you guys really what do you do it's like

02:00:53.260 --> 02:00:56.590
well I do open mics yeah is that how you

02:00:56.590 --> 02:00:59.650
help a man no it is it's a comedian but

02:00:59.650 --> 02:01:01.810
you know again it was a role typically

02:01:01.810 --> 02:01:04.210
reserved for being like nobody's talking

02:01:04.210 --> 02:01:06.160
about this thing I'm going out I'm

02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:08.020
talking about it people are so like oh

02:01:08.020 --> 02:01:09.730
my god I think about this Brigance a and

02:01:09.730 --> 02:01:12.070
they all laugh and it's being gutted out

02:01:12.070 --> 02:01:15.460
into like anyone who doesn't absolutely

02:01:15.460 --> 02:01:17.980
Bend me to an absolutely idiotic

02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:20.980
ideology is getting systematically kind

02:01:20.980 --> 02:01:22.510
of removed from there that's what this

02:01:22.510 --> 02:01:23.780
is what it is so it's a you

02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:25.880
gonna have one of the apparatus is of

02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:28.310
like you know massive self-reflection

02:01:28.310 --> 02:01:29.750
you know I'm not saying like every

02:01:29.750 --> 02:01:30.860
person talking how their dick is like

02:01:30.860 --> 02:01:33.800
total necessary for society but it is

02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:36.290
one of the places where you can go here

02:01:36.290 --> 02:01:38.000
on your dude if you're in an office talk

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.170
about like cancel cold really go this

02:01:39.170 --> 02:01:40.700
doesn't affect the world if you're in an

02:01:40.700 --> 02:01:41.990
office you can't talk about like

02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:44.630
anything ever so now it's big comedians

02:01:44.630 --> 02:01:46.490
are being almost like corporatized in a

02:01:46.490 --> 02:01:48.230
way where it's like you have to abide it

02:01:48.230 --> 02:01:49.400
like almost like a corporate policy

02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:51.050
that's what it feels like I remember

02:01:51.050 --> 02:01:52.190
going to an office and like bragging

02:01:52.190 --> 02:01:53.270
about how I got [ __ ] the night before

02:01:53.270 --> 02:01:56.690
and they were like yo bro you can't talk

02:01:56.690 --> 02:01:58.550
about that here yeah but it's being

02:01:58.550 --> 02:02:00.500
corporatized in a way that applies to

02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:04.490
only certain comics rules aren't written

02:02:04.490 --> 02:02:06.560
for everybody yeah you can go in if you

02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:08.540
give your joke is you know it depends

02:02:08.540 --> 02:02:11.330
who's saying it or how it's like I don't

02:02:11.330 --> 02:02:13.850
know yeah I mean yeah it's a be curious

02:02:13.850 --> 02:02:15.920
man again it's I'll be curious I think I

02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:18.530
think Trump gets out of office and once

02:02:18.530 --> 02:02:19.850
they have like him out

02:02:19.850 --> 02:02:22.100
I can't it's their entire identity now I

02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:24.290
know but if he's a lesson if he's out I

02:02:24.290 --> 02:02:26.300
think it will I think it'll lessen all

02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:28.280
right like you know I can't wait to oh

02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:31.820
man if I damn I was gonna sing

02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:34.310
hallelujah dressed his trunk that was

02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:35.840
the one thing I was like please let me

02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:38.810
do that we finest no but I would I can't

02:02:38.810 --> 02:02:40.040
wait to talk about how they killed him

02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:42.650
Sean yeah if he loses just be like you

02:02:42.650 --> 02:02:44.930

you killed him he was the best

02:02:46.220 --> 02:02:48.260
also dude that's gonna be awkward if

02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:51.640
Trump loses there could be like rural

02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:54.680
