00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.319
whole family's in too deep we're all so

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.720
autistic we don't know it yeah but we're

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.160
in too deep dude

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.720

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.360
for some type of weird like nah this is

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.680
i'm this

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.519
and then you guys have all bullied each

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.720
other like bill's out of his mind dude

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.159
yeah and he might be the most sane i

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.599
can't tell if he's the craziest or the

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.519
most saying isn't that isn't that wild

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.959
yeah i can't tell

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.200
i just actually genuinely can't tell if

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.680
billy's absolutely the craziest or the

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.440
most sane

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.400
who can tell yeah i don't think he knows

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.680
well let's see that's like the one thing

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.280
like if two balls are moving who knows

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.519
which ball is actually true

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:28.640
there's a space between them is

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.400
increasing yeah the first like early in

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.000
when i met billy i'd be like why are you

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.840
doing all this because he's like i wake

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.920
up at this time i'm jacked i work hard i

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.280
do i was like why why are you doing it

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.280
she's like i'm bulletproof dude

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.239
you can't make fun of me

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.680
damn yeah it's funny yeah dude i mean

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.319
it's yeah it's definitely uh

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.599
my family's

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.760
deep roots of autism dude yeah just like

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.280
feudal autism

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.040
just like yes mother lord i think that's

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.040
why we vibe dude my family is deeply

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.680
into the syndrome

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.590
we're all yeah

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.239
[Laughter]

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.120
true i get home every time

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.319
we're just two powerful clans dude

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.080
too powerful good clans the ones with

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.959
the c

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.200
not the bad k clans dude let's not get

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.799
that twisted we did not support the ku

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.000
klux klan

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.959
at all

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.799
no do you see da vinci code hold on i

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.720
want to tell you this as many as many

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.560
autists of you guys have we have several

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.400
offensive linemen in my family the whole

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.240
family's offensive line dude that's hard

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.680
syndrome but everyone else's offensive

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.880
line adjacent though that's the other

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.120
syndrome offensive line's a continuum

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.560
yeah so there's a lot of people who are

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.400
like just on the verge of offensive

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.360
linemanship yes so yeah it's pretty sick

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.639
that's definitely the most autistic

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.560
position in football no it's most

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.680
syndrome oh yeah yeah true true that

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.199
makes sense that makes sense what would

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.960
you say the most altis position in

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.320
football is fullback

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.199
not qb dude most autistic position

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.320
is there is there such a thing

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.880
that kicker

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.480
possibly

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.280
[Laughter]

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.080
no i don't know now that you're

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.240
mentioning it offensive line also

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.000
definitely has a lot of that too i

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.720
remember just like i'm here to block for

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.160
the guys running the mood i i'm selfless

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.000
but that's also syndrome

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.840
true

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.680
well football is just for the fellas

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.120
sure just for the boy doesn't matter

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.479
that was the dude when the coach would

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:23.759
tell me that in peewee football being

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:26.880
like you guys are the unsung hero dude i

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.160
[ __ ]

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.759
loved that

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.759
i like i genuinely prided myself on that

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.520
for years after i take it back the

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.680
syndrome has a lot of glory hounds

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.960
they love

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.750
like i want to score to touch them

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.520
[Laughter]

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.880
you're watching those [ __ ] glory

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.720
hounds when you get there

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.479
all tests are role players dude all

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.800
tests are role players true the syndrome

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.320
are glorious

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.680
there's always those videos of dudes

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.960
with the syndrome coming in and just

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.039
drilling threes and basketball games

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:58.400
you are right about that they are

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.039
absolutely glory hounds yeah

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:02.800
but yeah dude what about the da vinci

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.680

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.440
bit at a time

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.200

like start like painting in a warehouse

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.040
and everything's fine but for the

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.480
majority of women i think it kind of

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.680
[ __ ] them up

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.720

boyfriends yeah

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.240

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.440
if it was true or not but she was like

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.000
the quote was basically every time a

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.760
woman has sex with a man like she kind

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.839
of splits in half and the more times it

00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:29.040
happens it kind of fragments her

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.800
personality hmm

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.399
yeah pretty interesting kind of yeah

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:33.519

00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:35.920

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.120
perfect life then he came back and she

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.720
just like he was like a global sensation

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.080

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.240
light-skinned [ __ ] dude of

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.360
course green eyed light-skinned

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.799
[ __ ] dude i was i heard that i

00:20:24.799 --> 00:20:26.720
was like wow it's always the light skin

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.840
that's what he said basically he's

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.200
[ __ ] on tricks that's what he said

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.039
some light eyed [ __ ] green eyed

00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:33.120
light skinned [ __ ] dude [ __ ]

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.440
yeah dude it's the the book it is it's

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.400
interesting to listen to and it's

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.159
co-written with mark manson who's the

00:20:38.159 --> 00:20:40.159
subtle art of not giving a expletive

00:20:40.159 --> 00:20:41.679
really so there's all these little

00:20:41.679 --> 00:20:42.559
things

00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:44.960
it's it's like

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.320
you know it's read by will smith there's

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.640
a lot of like kind of like cheesy [ __ ]

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.720
kind of but if you can just listen to it

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.880
it's very interesting hmm i couldn't put

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.880
it down dude i couldn't take my earbuds

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.360
out nice he also admits to throwing up

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.159
whenever he sees or i heard that's [ __ ]

00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:02.080
well no it's because he got cuckolded

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.039
yeah

00:21:03.039 --> 00:21:04.320
and now he's literally tried to start

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.360
getting he's like i'm going to be a

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.600
[ __ ] machine he would like

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.600
he needs the glove connection dude so he

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.120
would be coming and just be like

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.880
and just get up and gag and run away

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.240
dude there was one part in it that was

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.840
possibly the most disturbing part

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.640
because like

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.640
he has a lot of insight into his younger

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.000
childhood you can tell he's working with

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.600
therapists and he's like well this was

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.799
because of this and you're listening

00:21:26.799 --> 00:21:28.480
that's kind of insightful

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.080
and then he as like the years go by

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.679
it's like newer stuff that hasn't been

00:21:33.679 --> 00:21:36.240
processed as fully so he like he's

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.440
talking he's like talking about him and

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.440
jada's relationship and at one point

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.600
there's a story he tells that he's like

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.960
yeah man i did it he's like i'm a

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.320
prankster so i did this prank on jada

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.679
and it's like she doesn't think it was

00:21:47.679 --> 00:21:49.280
funny i think it's the funniest thing

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.280
ever but like i'll leave it to you guys

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.880
to decide once and for all and he's like

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.000
you know he's like ladies and gentlemen

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.840
of the jury here's what happened and he

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.760
was like so i brought me and jada had

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.600
been together for

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.960
i i guess it was like a couple months it

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.280
was still fresh and he was

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.880
true

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.679
so she was going to meet his grandmother

00:22:07.679 --> 00:22:09.600
and so he flew his grandmother out to

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.919
california la where he was living and he

00:22:11.919 --> 00:22:13.360
has this thing where he like knows how

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.960
long it takes for anyone to get to play

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.120
he like times people in his head so he's

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.360
like it'll take her 47 minutes to get

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.600
where she's from her house to my house

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.799
this and

00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:24.240
he's like i'm gonna put on a movie for

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.400
my grandmother a movie that she had like

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.120
a

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.280
like a very notorious sex scene in with

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.280
another guy

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.280
where jada did jada did this movie

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.400
apparently that was like an

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.480
award-winning like groundbreaking sex

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.360
scene

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.360
it was groundbreaking in black cinema so

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.039
it was well known for all the actors and

00:22:41.039 --> 00:22:43.919
stuff so he timed it to where he put the

00:22:43.919 --> 00:22:45.280
movie on

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.120
with his grandmother knowing that jada

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.880
would walk in the door right as that sex

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.120
scene came on and he was like it's a

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.159
prank

00:22:52.159 --> 00:22:54.960
so she walks into her getting just like

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.600

00:23:48.159 --> 00:23:50.640
memory this is the best

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.480

00:23:57.039 --> 00:23:59.919
be like but it's perfect for us this is

00:23:59.919 --> 00:24:01.200
a memory

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.120
dude he's just [ __ ] up that's he's a

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.520
famous person yeah but it was like that

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.919
there were famous people are [ __ ] up

00:24:07.919 --> 00:24:09.360
yeah but that was the part of the book i

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.720
was like you know he's pretty hyper

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.480
competitive and it was like

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.880
are you sure you weren't punishing her

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.360
for having that sex scene definitely and

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.039
it but that was that for me that was

00:24:19.039 --> 00:24:19.919
like the

00:24:19.919 --> 00:24:21.520
part of it where i was like whoa dude

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.960
that didn't get fully processed he was

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.480
like anyway i thought it was funny she

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.720
didn't it was like yeah dude that's not

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.720
funny that's not a joke dude yeah

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.640
but i will say he does lay it all out

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.440
there i'd be so ticked off if my

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.760
wife or girlfriend was in a movie and

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.200
even kissed a guy i'd be like all right

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.320
we're done

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.919

i hear it it was just so funny to watch

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.679

00:24:51.679 --> 00:24:53.200
funny on some level but i was watching

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.480

those are the things that sell

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.480
ultimately that was initially he did

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.480

yeah they had a doctor robutnik didn't

00:27:53.919 --> 00:27:55.360

it's a marketing dude he's a marketing

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:23.279
genius yeah he would go do movies like

00:28:23.279 --> 00:28:24.640
that and then he would cut a track and

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.240
then that would get more press and all

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.520
that stuff

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.919
dude it was the weirdest part was is

00:28:29.919 --> 00:28:30.720
when

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.240
age because there was a whole thing of

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.279
like

00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:35.520
within the acting realm like he's at a

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.279
party basically and it's like damn jaime

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:38.720
fox must have felt like a loser in front

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.399
of wilson and it goes into a lot of that

00:28:40.399 --> 00:28:41.840
kind of psychology i was like there's

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.600

it was like dude it was [ __ ] correct

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.760
but that's so he got to the peak of the

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.200
mountain his family started

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.559

there and watch everyone tear his son

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.520

think jay-z was like managing willow and

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.240
then willow just cut her all of her hair

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.159
off i was like i'm done i don't know

00:30:14.159 --> 00:30:16.080

yeah we don't want to um but it was cool

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.679
but to answer your question he does

00:30:23.679 --> 00:30:26.559
eventually get into kind of like

00:30:26.559 --> 00:30:28.320
meditation and stuff because he was way

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.559
against it he was like [ __ ] weird he

00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:32.480
was a very like binary

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:33.520

i'm going to win i'm going to win and

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.080
then his family started to deteriorate

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.120
and then he did it after earth and it

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.960
deteriorated even further damn after

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.720

00:35:15.599 --> 00:35:17.440
like yeah we are independent but then he

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.640
was like guys for real we shouldn't do

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:19.440

[ __ ]

00:35:35.839 --> 00:35:37.359
was it was that the invention of

00:35:37.359 --> 00:35:39.200
guerrilla warfare

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.400
there was some of that yeah were they

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.240
still doing like shoulder to shoulder

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.680
yeah they were and there was guys like

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.760
the swamp fox basically with the movie

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.839
the patriots based off of swag this guy

00:35:47.839 --> 00:35:50.000
named swamp fox down in south carolina

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.079

war when did the revolutionary war start

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.000

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.599
americans how to like hide behind trees

00:36:03.599 --> 00:36:04.720

yeah battle there's battle bots

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.119
basically they were doing battle bots

00:36:11.119 --> 00:36:13.280
because it was like wars wars were

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.320
smaller

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.160

boyhood

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.680
oh i don't get too far into it but it's

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:06.400
about a dude who grew up as like

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.040
as they were being it was a sioux as

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.560
they were being like chased dude dudes

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:11.680
would come through their camps and like

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.960
they'd be chilling in like a spot like

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.800
all right we got some buffalos and dudes

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.920
would come through and start murdering

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.440
them yeah you'd be sitting and they just

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:18.720
get attacked and they'd have to get out

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.560
of there and then there would be like

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.800
inter-indian beef dude the [ __ ]

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.160
accidents that occurred in these things

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.240
were so [ __ ] funny like what like

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.760
they were just like

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.359
at one point they were like trying to

00:37:29.359 --> 00:37:31.359
get they dedicated like a few months to

00:37:31.359 --> 00:37:32.640
just like hacking up trees and making

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.640
maple syrup and at one point like the

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:35.920
young boys are supposed to sit there and

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.839
watch the embers and like there was like

00:37:37.839 --> 00:37:39.359
a superstition if like somebody wasn't

00:37:39.359 --> 00:37:40.800
watching the fire i mean it makes sense

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.720
something bad could happen but at one

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.119
point they like they came out though

00:37:45.119 --> 00:37:46.720
somebody screamed or something were they

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.640
like minnesota yeah they're right around

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:49.920
yep they're right around minnesota

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.599
crossing the bc when things get hot and

00:37:51.599 --> 00:37:53.760
come back down but at one point like the

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:54.560
ant

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.079
just like accidentally chopped off

00:37:56.079 --> 00:37:57.760
someone ladies fingers they're like

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.440
because they're cracking up

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.800
and she's like chopped off some lady's

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.160
fingers and lady was screaming they came

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.280
away from the fire and the ant was like

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.800
what the [ __ ] are you doing get back

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.160
over there yeah about to [ __ ] bring

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.800
us bad luck

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.119
like you you already did that and there

00:38:11.119 --> 00:38:12.720
was a part where

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.079
so they were chilling on their teepee at

00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:15.520
one point and

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.200
dude it just got like lit some of the

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.560
indians started getting guns and [ __ ]

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.800
too yeah so the one guy was like he was

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.320
trying to hunt some buffs or he was

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.079
trying to hunt a deer and he was they

00:38:24.079 --> 00:38:26.160
were like post up near a herd of buffalo

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.680
yeah and that was you were good you were

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.920
good for months but some guy took a gun

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.040
and tried to shoot a deer and all the

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.520
buffalo just like dispersed so it's like

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.880
that back then the indians would come

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.560
they would kill you for that because

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:37.680
like you know people are going to starve

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.520
to death so then they came up and they

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.800
[ __ ] just like littered up this

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.640
dude's tent they got gats and they just

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:43.839
start you they go to your teepee and

00:38:43.839 --> 00:38:46.400
just be like

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.520
so he had to like get away from that

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.359
you're just getting attacked constantly

00:38:49.359 --> 00:38:50.480
and then when you were little they'd put

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.960
you on dogs they're like dog sleds yeah

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.400
so but every now and again the dogs

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.839
weren't like horses like the dogs would

00:38:55.839 --> 00:38:56.800
just kind of

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.079
like when you were a little kid your

00:38:58.079 --> 00:38:59.200
dogs would just be like it was the

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.119
summer they would veer into rivers and

00:39:01.119 --> 00:39:02.560
dogs would just get bored and just jump

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.760
into the river and your kids would be in

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.200
there it's like dude he was like a

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.440
couple times ended up in the river yeah

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.720
the dogs are just like [ __ ] dude

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:09.680
let's play

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.839
yeah they all they only had dogs for a

00:39:11.839 --> 00:39:13.599
long time yeah man which is very funny

00:39:13.599 --> 00:39:15.280
and they didn't fully train them so like

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.320
you'd be on the thing with your little

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.920
sister and your sled would just go right

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.280
into a room yeah dog would catch the

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:19.740
zoomies

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:23.200
[Laughter]

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.800
yeah it was really funny to read but

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.079
it's about that how like you know the

00:39:26.079 --> 00:39:28.000
doggos the puppers would the poverinis

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.839
would catch the zoomies dude imagine

00:39:29.839 --> 00:39:32.160
really depending on a dog like that

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.000
i can't i might do jackson shits if i

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.760
give him two hours time he will [ __ ] and

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:38.560
piss in my basement and it infuriates me

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.160
and there's nothing you can do like i've

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.240
tried reasoning with him rewarding him

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.240
putting his face in it i'd be like dude

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.760
this is just a memory bro this is good

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.000
for us

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.880
yeah man you can't that's tough to

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.880
actually like survival wise

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.839
rely on dogs

00:39:54.839 --> 00:39:57.359
yeah but of course it was funny thinking

00:39:57.359 --> 00:39:58.480
about like two-year-olds just getting

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.079
dragged into a river by a dog yeah

00:40:00.079 --> 00:40:01.200
that's fine

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.200
that's a good laugh that's a fun time

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.520
yeah it's a fond memory probably into

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.599
the like mississippi isn't that crazy it

00:40:07.599 --> 00:40:08.880
goes up there

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.839
i didn't know the mississippi because

00:40:09.839 --> 00:40:11.440
there's another that's what splits

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.119
minneapolis and st paul is there a

00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:15.119
minnesota river or something probably

00:40:15.119 --> 00:40:16.400
there's one river they went through that

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.440
was apparent they were saying it's the

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.200
toughest river the dude's grandmother

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.760
dude the lady was like 65 swam across it

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.359
because they would make like shitty

00:40:23.359 --> 00:40:25.520
rafts and she was like nah [ __ ] that and

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.200
this lady just swam

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.440
crossed it twice pretty nasty nice

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.440
apparently people were so wildly in

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.200
shape back like you'd walk like 40 miles

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.040
and be like

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.359
so it makes sense yeah but he was saying

00:40:37.359 --> 00:40:39.280
walking dude he lost it all he was like

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.079
dude now it's like now he's a soft [ __ ]

00:40:42.079 --> 00:40:43.839
writing books he had indian boyhood but

00:40:43.839 --> 00:40:45.760
he was like he was tight but he was

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.040
talking about the lacrosse games they

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.760
were sick yeah big dust stops dude dust

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.440

00:40:54.079 --> 00:40:54.880
see

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.359
it would get so dusty oh you made a dust

00:40:57.359 --> 00:40:58.880
literally literally

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.480
and you said just one dude would break

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.839
from the dust cloud and like score and

00:41:01.839 --> 00:41:04.640
they'd be yeah that's awesome

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.280
yeah his name was basically like loser

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.280

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.560

was like that was his name

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.400
and his luckily his mother-in-law got a

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:29.520

yeah and the the tornadoes hitting like

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:38.640
power lines and [ __ ] so it's just

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.800
constant explosions in the distance and

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.720

00:48:50.559 --> 00:48:51.760
events

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:53.599
unless i think it's like an animalistic

00:48:53.599 --> 00:48:55.119
thing because it doesn't alert you it

00:48:55.119 --> 00:48:57.359
does make you scared for sure

00:48:57.359 --> 00:48:58.240
you know

00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.839

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.920
like right

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.920
the only acceptable vocal outbreak is

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.200
during the da vinci code when that

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.520

00:52:21.599 --> 00:52:22.960
about christmas lights reminds me of

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:24.720
home and being a young boy it is nice

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:26.240
but if you're if you're having maybe a

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.520
disagreement

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:28.559
with your babe and you're fighting

00:52:28.559 --> 00:52:30.480
around christmas lights dude when you

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.160
fight they can turn in from like a very

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.839
cheerful thing to like an intensely

00:52:33.839 --> 00:52:35.440
mentally sinister

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:36.960
yeah when they're like bummed around

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:38.640
this isn't my home

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:39.760
yeah when you get bummed around a

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.119
christmas tree

00:52:41.119 --> 00:52:42.640
and you're just like looking at it kind

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:44.559
of sad like

00:52:44.559 --> 00:52:46.800
that can be tough but obviously you have

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.240
to just get in the spirit of christmas i

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.920
i know i've heard this story before but

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:52.480
one time my dad kicked my sister

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:53.599
and she

00:52:53.599 --> 00:52:56.720
rolled under the tree and it fell

00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.319
i think phil had a couple drinks and he

00:52:58.319 --> 00:52:59.599
came

00:52:59.599 --> 00:53:01.040
on the loose dude

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.400
everyone's not phil would come home from

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:03.680
the nights or something it'd be fill on

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.000
the loose you got to just get out dude

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.079
because he he wasn't doing it he wasn't

00:53:08.079 --> 00:53:09.359
uh

00:53:09.359 --> 00:53:11.200
actually hitting you he was just he's

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.960
like i'm gonna get you like right it was

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:14.960
very fun it wasn't an angry kick no but

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:16.079
every once in a while he would catch you

00:53:16.079 --> 00:53:17.680
and actually be like yo you don't run

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:20.079
[Laughter]

00:53:20.079 --> 00:53:21.760
he was teaching lessons he came home to

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:25.040
teach some lessons he died from

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.720

were laying in the living room watching

00:53:31.119 --> 00:53:34.079
tv and he kicked my sister and she like

00:53:34.079 --> 00:53:36.000
rolled in she like exaggerated the role

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
but she rolled and hit the tree what was

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.599
the lesson the tree fell the lesson was

00:53:39.599 --> 00:53:40.640
probably

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.240
it was probably something like turn this

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:45.599
