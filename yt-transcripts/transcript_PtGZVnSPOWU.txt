i don't know if she raps but she's

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.480

am the only thing i know you're saying

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.280
you're not a punchline rapper

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.520
rapping just punchline wrapping you got

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.880
different styles

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.479
combined stylistically they couldn't

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.479
even step up to me

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.240
also i like is this the clip from the

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.840
sdr show i never saw how you were

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.600

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.560
king of union square

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.630

no i would like i wouldn't mind seeing

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.199
you move on because

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.880

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.600
listen ralph ralph says he says ralph

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.039
would have won if he went with the media

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.919
his second rap was significantly better

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.840
because the first one was in the i'm

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.199
ralph sutton i'm here to say

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:24.960
version then he did one that wasn't like

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.440
that however it really was not there was

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.080
really no

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.160
flow to it whatsoever he wasn't making a

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.039
song i wrote a song

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.680
to a beat you know what i mean i knew it

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.120

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.000

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.480
but the dr pimple popper one is

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.760
the name is john gilmore gil

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.160
oh you're going like indy pimple poppers

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.160
yeah you don't even do like the big time

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.839
you're going like uh oh

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.279
this guy is one of the top guys i'll

00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:27.120
make this nice and simple for you yeah

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.000
here's what goes on uh when you get into

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.360
the world of pimple popping

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.839
sure after a while you start knowing the

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:36.079
types of abscesses and things you want

00:14:36.079 --> 00:14:37.199
to see get popped because they're the

00:14:37.199 --> 00:14:38.800
most rewarding of course you pick up the

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.519
jargon

00:14:39.519 --> 00:14:42.480
right so then when you do sometimes then

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.560
you'll stop looking up just dr pimple

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.600
popper or simply

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.680
yeah i don't know when i look at porn

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.839
anymore i got very into a whole i i said

00:14:49.839 --> 00:14:50.839
the most

00:14:50.839 --> 00:14:53.680
satisfactory immediate problem fix i've

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.320
ever seen

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.639
yeah is i've got deep into a hole of

00:14:56.639 --> 00:14:59.360
watching cauliflower ear get drained

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.360
your ear just turns back to normal you

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.120
know that instant

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.720
it sucks out whatever's in there and

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.399
your ears just an ear again it's the

00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:07.120
most bizarre

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.320
i can't believe anybody lets you get as

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.639
bad as it gets i uh

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:12.079
why do they let it go just because it's

00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:13.519
easier to do that than keep having the

00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:14.320
surgery

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.320
i guess so yeah it's not surgery dude

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.519
it's just a needle

00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:19.920
but it looks like it's awful to get done

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:20.880
but

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.480
the reward is fantastic you know what i

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.240
did one time i did a stone it was just a

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:24.800
brief

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.920
stint of watching uh uh

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.399
big dreadlocks get shaved off oh yeah

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:31.040
because that wasn't

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.120
gross it seems very freeing you know

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.639
yeah but the same thing you're like wow

00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:36.079

00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:29.200
reason

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.640
dr pimple popper doesn't cram

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.679

00:17:47.679 --> 00:17:49.280
you're like what the [ __ ] going on

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.840
everyone come out of your studios

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.960
uh dr pimple popper doesn't uh

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.640
condescend to you and make you have to

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.480
see a picture of her constantly

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.160
in the thing you know i mean you just i

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.360
don't even know what duck pimp popper

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.240
looks like

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.840
i'm sure her face is in a lot of the

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.600
stuff and she does she's the most famous

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.760
so she does interviews but her videos

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.679
really focus on the problem they're

00:18:09.679 --> 00:18:12.000
trying to pop great

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.039
this one i found john gilmore you can't

00:18:15.039 --> 00:18:16.400
show their face while they're doing the

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.200
work

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.520
so every time he talks it's almost like

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.520
a lot of online videos do this

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.280
the person who's talking at the moment

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.960
they show a picture of

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.720
and then they identify and then when the

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.160
other person's talking they show their

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:28.720
picture

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.160
they're talking together sometimes

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.080
sometimes they do that in police shows

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:32.880
where they show

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.640
like a phone conversation and they'll

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.480
put a picture up of like the mafia guy

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.480
yeah they're talking yes exactly a

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.600
picture of mother talking

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.120
sure so uh with this one

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.160
it's john gilmore the doctor himself

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.480
talking to what i can only these are

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.600
assumptions i'm making

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.799
middle age to older asian woman okay

00:18:54.799 --> 00:18:57.679
his no i let's say she's in her mid-40s

00:18:57.679 --> 00:18:58.559
great

00:18:58.559 --> 00:19:00.720
maybe early 50s and maybe younger than

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.160
that who knows but i think older

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.200
yeah i think that age about she i have

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.080
to assume

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.679
uh johnny boy gilmore is wants to or is

00:19:09.679 --> 00:19:11.200
definitely laying the pipe to or maybe

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.559
it's his wife even i don't know they

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:14.000
haven't made that clear at all from what

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:14.799
i've seen

00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:17.039
however i didn't watch a lot of this

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:18.320
because this really was immediate

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.600
you're saying there's relief porn that

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.160

all

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.320
okay it's the funniest thing in the

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.600
world because

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.039
his asian middle-aged to older assistant

00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:30.480
when she talks yeah

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.360
it couldn't be more hilarious like

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.280
racist the asian voice to go with it

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.280
because this is just a guy so he's like

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.799
you gotta get in there you know and you

00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:41.200

you guys really get a lot of that pus

00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:45.039
out of there and then when the pus

00:19:45.039 --> 00:19:46.240
starts running you hear it go

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:52.080
uh so good yes uh

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.919

00:19:53.919 --> 00:19:55.360
no it's not her

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.520
it's a patient that's just the patient

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.640
that they have in there

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.159
but so who is she who the asian lady

00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:05.440
she's his assistant i'm saying oh yeah

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.360

he the assistant or i missed that

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.120

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.320
on uh on

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.600

this the visual unfortunately

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.880
it's v it's auto audibly hilarious

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.720
but when you see they show the pictures

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.760
of them when they're talking the

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.280
pictures of her

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.960

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.720
the funniest goddamn i can just

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.360
play a role right yes sir and you were

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.640
the one with the camera we've

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.240
we've changed the way we do our cameras

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.320
now right yes well so

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.760
we were just listening back to this is

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.440
all the way from 2005.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.120
those are your hands right there so with

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.280
the purple gloves gloves so you remember

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:55.600

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.280
could you believe what we finally got

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.960
out of this all right stop this right

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.240
now because immediately what this is is

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.120
this is

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.840
director's commentary on a dvd because

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.360
they did people because when they filmed

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:05.600
it

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.320
when they did it they didn't do running

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.000
commentary so now they have to go back

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.840
yeah and she goes i mean by that that

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.200

very amazing it was pretty amazing

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.799
at this point one of the things we

00:21:36.799 --> 00:21:38.240
didn't do we didn't give our patient a

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.440
nickname which we do now

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.679
we say you look like a sad dog

00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:48.799
we pop sad dogs here

00:21:48.799 --> 00:21:50.480
uh yeah dude this guy is unbelievable

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.799
they just give you really mean nicknames

00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:54.720
when you go in i know we usually give

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.000
people nicknames like

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.120
uh lard ass or [ __ ] pepperoni nips

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.120
so scared i'd just fight him he'd be

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.120

00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:07.760
blackhead on my cheek

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.440
he goes here just a portable

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.400
uh phone to video which now we try to

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.000
use something with a tripod

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.280
oh you got the red

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.000
jump ahead a little bit christine

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.080
yeah get back up dude she's got such

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.039
sultry like

00:22:27.039 --> 00:22:29.360
this is so great show me it literally

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.480
let's talk a second

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.320
but again your job was to take care of

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.600
the patient right yes sir

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.679
that's right not so much to worry about

00:22:35.679 --> 00:22:38.000
whether we were on camera or not

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.120
um god you smell good there you go

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.880
now you can see we're injecting the the

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.960
anesthetic here

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.240
so what did you think i've had some

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.000
patients some people ask

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.039
well why can't you use epinephrine um

00:22:51.039 --> 00:22:53.280
i had a number of people ask me that and

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.640
the reason you can't use epinephrine in

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.280
the ear

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.120
is because it can cause profound

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.880
constriction and it can lead to uh

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.120
look at their pictures together yeah it

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.240
looks like a married couple we're going

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.760
to tweet that out too

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.039
put that picture out of those two

00:23:05.039 --> 00:23:06.720
together because that is that looks like

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.799
a guy that just found a new bride

00:23:08.799 --> 00:23:10.880
oh yeah he goes that's my that's my dad

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.000
he lives in uh

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.159
he yeah look at that that was like that

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:15.120
kind of thing where you show your

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.640

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.440

he lives with his new girlfriend crystal

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.280
oh inside the ear look smell like a

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.240
stinky poop

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.440

about to make the first incision

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.840

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.400
incision from the back of the ear

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.600
i don't think it would have mattered

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.520
though i don't think it would matter

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:05.919
either

00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:08.960
yes and because now

and think about what you're saying

00:27:27.039 --> 00:27:28.080
think about how you can improve your

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:28.670
situation

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:30.880
[Laughter]

yeah puss and blood by the way if you

00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:51.120
think that's

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.039
i guess that that might be the thing

00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:54.799
that slows down christine on ranch and

00:27:54.799 --> 00:27:56.559

dude when a mosquito lands on a mammal

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.039
and the eggs are deposited on the skin

00:33:07.039 --> 00:33:09.279
the body heat causes the eggs to hatch

00:33:09.279 --> 00:33:10.559
in a matter of minutes the larva

00:33:10.559 --> 00:33:12.080
penetrate the skin often through the

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.039
mosquito bite

00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:14.960
or along a hair follicle so it can

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.600
happen to us

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.919

this lady's skin

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.000

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.599

getting my nails done

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:09.760

against that in fact that probably gets

00:38:41.119 --> 00:38:42.560
some kind of a weird i would design some

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.560
sort of an ear cover condom or something

like they do their homework

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.640
and they have [ __ ] where they're like

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:08.239
she got fired for stealing money bring

01:15:08.239 --> 01:15:10.080
that [ __ ] up she's a piece of [ __ ] like

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:11.440
friend's willing to dish on you you go

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:12.560
yeah dan was supposed to be here from

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.400
the airport he got so drunk he slept

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.840
through it and [ __ ] then he lied that

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:16.800
his car broke down yeah

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.320
there's definitely a process of

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:19.840
interviewing where you get like

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:22.239
dangerously nervous they knew that girl

01:15:22.239 --> 01:15:25.679
was [ __ ] that guy's friends

01:15:25.679 --> 01:15:27.280
because they probably asked questions

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:28.800
alone with them at some point to get the

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:29.199
uh

01:15:29.199 --> 01:15:30.880
gauge they're gonna say yeah and when

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.400
they ask the questions they kind of ask

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.400
like at the time they'll say like have

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.600
you ever hooked up with like any of your

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:36.640
husbands friends or anything yeah and

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:38.640
they just go like

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.800
no you know like and then they go oh

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.320
yeah we gotta put that question in there

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:43.360
because she's gonna have to tell the

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:43.840
truth

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.360
she says yes or she goes like this she

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.120
goes yes

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.560
she goes are you guys gonna use all

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.320
these no no no

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.760
what no it's mostly about the stuff of

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:52.960
like i think it doesn't matter if they

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.239
lie though in the thing because they

01:15:54.239 --> 01:15:55.520
have people there that can kind of see

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:55.840
like

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:57.760
wow this she's asking she's curious why

01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:58.640
we're asking do you think they bring

01:15:58.640 --> 01:15:59.520
people in to break

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:01.199
the sector they're hooked to a lot of

01:16:01.199 --> 01:16:02.960
times no not now they asked the

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:04.000
questions before

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.480
earlier yeah in the polygraph oh yeah

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:07.920
yeah yeah no no i know that but i'm

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:09.040
saying when they're asking around

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.800
the right questions to ask them and

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:11.920
they're vetting them i don't think

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:13.199
they're going to ask everybody if they

01:16:13.199 --> 01:16:14.640
slept with their significant other's

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:15.520
friend or whatever

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:17.920
do you think they'd tenderize them first

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:19.199
yeah and then they set them up for the

01:16:19.199 --> 01:16:20.000
lie detector

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.280
why would you ask a guy if he's ever

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.719
been paid for sex like that's the

01:16:22.719 --> 01:16:24.719

01:27:44.159 --> 01:27:46.400

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:47.679

top five deals with bully scenes part

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.560
two top five getting revenge on bullies

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:55.840
i picked the song for the uh for the

01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:57.360
dead bodies

01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.840
story and and it was funny we have 15

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:01.199
minutes left now and people are all

01:28:01.199 --> 01:28:03.360
holding tell us their dead body stories

01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.000
but

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.520
that moment of truth thing got pretty

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:07.040
intense yeah dude that went down a

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:08.560
wormhole of people just getting

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.960
their lives [ __ ] but uh shane was

01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:12.159
with me

01:28:12.159 --> 01:28:16.080
uh in in baltimore timonium

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:19.199
yeah magoobs mcgoobs uh and christine

01:28:19.199 --> 01:28:20.800
and we were driving

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:23.920
back to the hotel one night and

01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:26.639
this ambulance going weirdly slow by the

01:28:26.639 --> 01:28:27.040
way

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:29.360
where the trouble turns out was ahead

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.880
very slow-moving ambulances we had to

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.239
kind of get out of their way so they

01:28:32.239 --> 01:28:34.880
would go by you it was very bizarre but

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:36.239
then we were just sort of like you know

01:28:36.239 --> 01:28:38.239
you'd figure a quarter mile or so behind

01:28:38.239 --> 01:28:39.120
them

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:41.920
and then we got on a ramp like an

01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:42.719
off-ramp

01:28:42.719 --> 01:28:45.679
to go where we had to go and at the in

01:28:45.679 --> 01:28:47.040
the middle of that off ramp

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:48.000
like dead in the middle where you

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.520
couldn't go either way is where the

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:51.199
ambulances were pulling up to

01:28:51.199 --> 01:28:54.159
and we really couldn't see the things

01:28:54.159 --> 01:28:55.440
where we were i've never been this

01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:56.560
before in my life

01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:59.760
the first car on the side behind the

01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:00.480
trouble

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:02.000
yeah we were directly behind the

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.520
ambulance and there were fire trucks

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:04.239
behind us

01:29:04.239 --> 01:29:06.400
yeah in the middle we kind of [ __ ] up

01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:07.199
when we were in the middle because we

01:29:07.199 --> 01:29:07.600
didn't know

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:09.360
it was crazy now you should have got out

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:12.159
like detectives wrote this

01:29:12.159 --> 01:29:13.600
seal this place off that's where they

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:15.120
kept asking us questions too and like

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:16.560
what happened

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:17.920
yeah they thought we were in the

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:19.840
accident yeah there was an accident

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:21.040
they were like they would walk around

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:22.400
with my car to look for damage i'm like

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:23.120
yeah i wasn't

01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:24.880
in the yeah you guys were driving slow

01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:26.239
like a [ __ ] it's on our way back from

01:29:26.239 --> 01:29:27.199
wawa

01:29:27.199 --> 01:29:29.280
that's true i was eating a [ __ ]

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:30.960
meatball hoagie

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.560
watching carnage you probably look like

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:34.159
a detective if you got out yeah i know

01:29:34.159 --> 01:29:36.960
what happened jealous wife

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:39.760
i've seen this before yeah shane was

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:40.800
ripping into a

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:43.199
a hoag a toasted hogue yeah i said yeah

01:29:43.199 --> 01:29:44.960
taste my haggy back there

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:47.280
and then i we witnessed a toasted man

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.719
yeah well what it was you could sort of

01:29:48.719 --> 01:29:49.280
see

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:51.360
through the ambulances that one car is

01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:53.520
smashed up against the

01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:55.600
guard but you can't see yeah how much

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:56.800
it's just definitely what's going on

01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:59.360
and then an 18-wheeler pulled over

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:00.560
tractor trailer

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:03.199
and then the two things we saw was very

01:30:03.199 --> 01:30:04.159
real as we are

01:30:04.159 --> 01:30:06.080
smoking cigarettes we're giggling we're

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:07.760
making a zillion one jokes about it

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:08.800
we're watching

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:11.600
uh youtube clips of i showed him the

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:13.120
what's that name sketch

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:14.560
you're watching saturday night live

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:17.120
sketches saturday night live afterwards

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:20.000
my baby my baby no then we see they go

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.280
oh i guess they're bringing over this is

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:22.639
one of the guys i guess

01:30:22.639 --> 01:30:24.000
and then they bring them over and you

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
see as they turn that gurney sideways

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:26.320
like

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:29.600
the the sheets over the head and then it

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:32.159
shows you the lifelessness of like the

01:30:32.159 --> 01:30:33.199
feet as they're

01:30:33.199 --> 01:30:35.360
hitting bumps like the feet like moving

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:36.960
it's not because he's moving his feet

01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:38.400
it's just like there's nothing to them

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:39.520
they're gonna go wherever they go

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:41.920
what would you guys have done if he just

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:44.400
sat up

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:49.840
oh

01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:02.880
then we saw that guy they put him in the

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:04.320
ambulance and everyone's just kind of

01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:05.920
like looking at their watches i guess to

01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:07.920
get the time of death or whatever

01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:10.320
and then we see another cop walking by

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:11.199
with

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:12.800
what always seemed to be to be a trucker

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.960
who was hysterical crying as he probably

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:15.360
is

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:17.199
processing he just murdered someone

01:31:17.199 --> 01:31:19.679
[ __ ] yeah all while that's going on

01:31:19.679 --> 01:31:22.080
shane crushing that i just finished that

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:23.840
stop nothing you're like whitey bulger

01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:25.360
taking a nap after a murderer

01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:27.280
watching a dead body eating a [ __ ]

01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:30.000
meatball yeah you do you go like this

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:30.560
you go

01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:32.239
now all of a sudden no meatball hoagie

01:31:32.239 --> 01:31:33.760
tastes good unless i've seen death with

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.040
that makes more sense to me because at

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:36.560
the end of the day shane's ripping into

01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:37.679
some comfort food

01:31:37.679 --> 01:31:39.120
for whatever goddamn reason me and

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:41.040
christine were sharing like yogurt and

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:42.239

01:32:08.639 --> 01:32:09.679

this is really good writing because we

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:01.360
brought you in as a character under the

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:02.239
sheets thing

01:34:02.239 --> 01:34:03.679

01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:08.800
episode

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:10.159
you think the whole thing's about moment

01:34:10.159 --> 01:34:12.159
of truth and popping zits

01:34:12.159 --> 01:34:13.199
and then you get to the end and the

01:34:13.199 --> 01:34:16.080
character reveals it's been a lie

01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:18.800
he's been changed

01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:22.400
[Music]

he was a madman i'll tell you this man i

01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:17.360

hollywood

01:36:18.159 --> 01:36:20.239
uh the new tarantino i'm not i'm pumped

01:36:20.239 --> 01:36:21.920
for a new tarantino movie i'm not pumped

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:23.119
for the trailer because the trailer

01:36:23.119 --> 01:36:24.639
literally shows you nothing but i just i

01:36:24.639 --> 01:36:25.600
don't know i thought it was like a

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:27.040
manson movie it is

01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:28.800
at the end you see him smiling in the

01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:30.080
one part of the trailer but the bruce

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:31.600
lee scene is [ __ ] hilarious where

01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:32.080
he's like

01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:33.920
my hands are lethal weapons if i were to

01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:35.679
kill you in a fight accidentally

01:36:35.679 --> 01:36:38.560
i go to jail and he's like yeah anyone

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:39.840
kills someone accidentally in a fight

01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:41.520
they go to jail it's called manslaughter

01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:44.080
yeah yeah it looks great is that jason

01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:44.880
lee again

01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:46.320
playing bruce cause it looks like

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:48.000
exactly like another guy

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.040
really yeah yeah i thought

01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:52.800
didn't seem exactly like when jason lee

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:54.880
played him yeah

01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:56.239
yeah i'm just i'm excited to see that

01:36:56.239 --> 01:36:59.760
movie i mean i'm always anything he does

01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:03.040
damien lewis plays um

01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:06.239
he's in it steve mcqueen steve mcqueen

01:37:06.239 --> 01:37:07.440
i'm really excited to see it but i

01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:09.280
couldn't get from the

01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:10.719
i didn't get from the trailer that it

01:37:10.719 --> 01:37:12.400
was going to be about manson at all

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:15.360
so uh damian lewis told us about filming

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:15.600
it

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:16.800
because we started the season of

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:18.639
billions right as he came off this

01:37:18.639 --> 01:37:20.239
like he just finished and then came to

01:37:20.239 --> 01:37:21.760
film we're like you know everyone's

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:23.119
asking like what's like worth

01:37:23.119 --> 01:37:24.719
tarantino or whatever and he's like no

01:37:24.719 --> 01:37:26.159
one that was

01:37:26.159 --> 01:37:28.239
no one read the last 20 pages of the

01:37:28.239 --> 01:37:30.320
script that wasn't in the scene

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:31.840
really yeah like he didn't get to read

01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:33.600
it like no they kept it very

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.040
confidential like if you're

01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:36.639
the only way you'll know what happens at

01:37:36.639 --> 01:37:38.159
the end of movies if you're in it and

01:37:38.159 --> 01:37:39.119
they they said that

01:37:39.119 --> 01:37:40.560
you know he's like i think that's the

01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:42.400
marilyn manson murder scene with sharon

01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:43.840
tate

01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:47.840
god charles manson yeah would i

01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:49.840
yeah don't pin that on him i'm sorry

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:52.560
guys marijuana has worn down my brain

01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:53.679
they think they're actually going to

01:37:53.679 --> 01:37:55.280
recreate the murder scene that's

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:56.000
speculation

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.600
that [ __ ] manson smile in this

01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:00.840

anybody in the fight they go to jail

01:38:35.679 --> 01:38:37.200
it's called manslaughter

01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:38.880

good manson

javascript yeah but it doesn't matter

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.480
also quentin tarantino picks people not

01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:01.520

of the thing you know it's like yeah

01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:04.400
