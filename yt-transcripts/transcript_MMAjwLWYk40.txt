uh but before we start tonight's show

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.440
here's a little bit more about the

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.120
amazing sponsors that made tonight's

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.640
episode available for you here right now

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.980
hey y'all I think we've all learned

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.040
recently exactly how fragile life is I

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.440
mean even me Tony Hinchcliffe could die

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.620
in a perhaps a tragic golf cart accident

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.019
or maybe I wrap my Corvette around a

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.840
tree or uh perhaps my sex swing breaks

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.319
and I die falling to my death on that

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.540
note it makes sense why people get life

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.060
insurance especially term coverage which

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.760
is surprisingly affordable why not pay a

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.980
bit each month to protect the ones you

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.260

00:12:27.959 --> 00:12:30.600
which I just translate to mean that he

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.940
thinks I'm gay so it helps me it

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.500
motivates me to work harder

00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:38.760

00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:38.880
like they don't have to pay their house

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.860
fees usually strippers have to pay a 10

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.720
to the club

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.160
but it turns out if you make out with

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.500
Hans Kim you don't have to give 10 to

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.500
the strip club that you work at these

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.960

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:30.059
yeah it's a real fetish yes indeed

00:22:30.059 --> 00:22:31.860
nothing gets me off more than watching

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.080
an Asian man awkwardly make out with a

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.220
stranger

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.520
you're right I just I don't know ever

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.220
since I started it I just all right Make

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.020
some noise for Brianna switchler

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.260
everybody here we go the show begins we

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.880
don't know these people

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.039
a complete stranger out of the bucket

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:56.460
here she comes everyone

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.320
believe this is her first time on this

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.280
show

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.620
Make Some Noise one more time for

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.360
Brianna Switzerland

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.440
[Applause]

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.320
[ __ ] hello uh this is really awkward I

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.780
actually wasn't expecting to come up

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.460
here and I hate to break it to you all

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.820
I'm not a comedian I'm just a queer

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:20.340
black woman who aspires to the same

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.440
status and privilege as white men

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.480
so I figured I'd come up here and make

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.400
an ass of myself because it seemed to

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.480
work for everybody else up here

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.520
so uh you know I'm I'm really just kind

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.220
of doing this to survive you can kind of

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:36.780
think of me as like a sex worker right

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.120
you know think of this as me giving you

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.700
a really lame hand job and spitting in

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:45.600
my hand and just jerking it real slow

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.559
you you wouldn't be mad if I finish but

00:23:49.559 --> 00:23:51.240
you're kind of hoping that I'd finish a

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.440
little bit quicker

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.740
okay

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.539
speaking of white people you know uh

00:23:57.539 --> 00:23:58.980
you know how they say white people can't

00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:59.820
cook

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.039
I I beg to differ because white people

00:24:02.039 --> 00:24:04.919
really know their way around a casserole

00:24:04.919 --> 00:24:07.580
you look like you like Mayo

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:10.200

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.440
hates gay sign as soon as I got to Texas

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.240

little suspect if you ask me you know

told my mom she's a big liberal Alex

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:11.160
Jones was the guest when I was on two

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.900

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.040
she was like who was the guest and I

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.480
said Alex Jones how did your mom even

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.339

when I was in New York like when it was

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.560

everyone just got real upset and I

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.760

Pat me on the back and like yeah you got

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:00.480

[Applause]

00:47:07.319 --> 00:47:09.660

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.660
got a call from my uncle who lives in

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:26.819
Boston at night I was with a woman and I

00:47:26.819 --> 00:47:27.780
was like it's the best day of my life

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.520
and it was 9am my uncle from Boston

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.260
called and I was like if it's important

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.960
he'll call back and then uh he called

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:36.420
back right away and I was like okay

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:38.460
something bad happened because Boston's

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:39.839
eight hours from where I live so I was

00:47:39.839 --> 00:47:42.420
like and then yeah and you were with a

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:44.220
girl for the first time is that what you

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:47.160
said not the first time but uh oh what a

00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:48.480
wild one night soon that would be for

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:53.900
her oh yeah oh no no oh no

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:58.500
look some lady like oh yeah no she

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.300
offered to Uber me back home for like

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:03.240
200 and I was like I don't need you to

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:06.200
help you a hotel yeah

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.940
absolutely perfect that would have given

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:11.579
you would have gotten some rest

00:48:11.579 --> 00:48:13.859
I did go to hotel because we couldn't go

00:48:13.859 --> 00:48:17.280

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:19.200
diving deep now yeah getting into it

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.540

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:40.980

01:48:33.179 --> 01:48:34.800

01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:37.159
really understand each other

01:48:37.159 --> 01:48:39.719
uh yeah I mean it's a pretty strong

01:48:39.719 --> 01:48:41.100
connection

01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:44.219
uh it's been Redman why would you

01:48:44.219 --> 01:48:46.380
[ __ ] do that I'm being dead seriously

01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:52.699
the noises of an out

01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:56.760

was hiding over there you know God Amy

01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:06.300

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.199
awkward as [ __ ] now I'm really

01:49:10.199 --> 01:49:12.179
rethinking bringing you up here

01:49:12.179 --> 01:49:14.580

01:49:14.580 --> 01:49:17.040
mistake I thought it was gonna be so

01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:18.719

01:49:18.719 --> 01:49:21.599

01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:27.840
take the microphone I'm not trying to

01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:31.560
take anything but my [ __ ] hard-earned

01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:33.900
goddamn moment on the stage he invited

01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:36.380
me up here yeah Shane has a question

01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:38.280
what are your thoughts on the black

01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:40.820
lives matter movement

01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:43.820
foreign

01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:47.460
I have experience I brought two black

01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:49.199
men onto this Earth

01:49:49.199 --> 01:49:51.500
what the [ __ ] does that mean

01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:53.880
why am I just hearing that right now

01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:56.040
seriously what does that mean

01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:59.900
oh oh my God

01:50:00.540 --> 01:50:02.159
what the [ __ ] does that mean they're

01:50:02.159 --> 01:50:04.260
gonna watch us is that a threat William

01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:06.900
is that a [ __ ] threat seriously

01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:09.719
what's going on I think technically

01:50:09.719 --> 01:50:11.760
the math just means she only brought one

01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:14.159
black man onto this Earth William you

01:50:14.159 --> 01:50:15.659
didn't know that she has black children

01:50:15.659 --> 01:50:17.460
no she had never told me that and I

01:50:17.460 --> 01:50:18.840
specifically asked you have black

01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:21.020
children and she said [ __ ] no

01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:24.420
wow I specifically [ __ ] asked you

01:50:24.420 --> 01:50:25.619
that

01:50:25.619 --> 01:50:27.420
she said no they're white don't worry

01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:29.340
and I was like what that sounds kind of

01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:30.780
weird

01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:32.639
well how do you feel about the how do

01:50:32.639 --> 01:50:34.260
you feel moving forward it seems like

01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:35.880
there's a real spark in your eyes when

01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:37.560
you look at her and you look back at us

01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:40.020

01:50:57.420 --> 01:50:59.400
