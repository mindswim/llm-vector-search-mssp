00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.119
selling this thing called Joe's box

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.180

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.070
people would it's not that more often

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.750
that they care about it more because

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.730

vote everybody would probably do that so

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.550
but I gotta say there is what one other

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.010
person I know who had a worse one

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.480
somebody I worked with had September

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.880
11th before it happened they did 9/11

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.710
birthday yeah so oh man do they like at

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.120
least still get the Happy Birthday song

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.190
to him that night

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.200
not really no nobody really think he

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.400
stopped actually having birthdays

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.840
because in the East Coast you know

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.200
that's a pretty big deal so what but I

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.700
mean I mean I'm saying the night of 9/11

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.200
you don't think he got a cake and

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.540
candles and all that stuff I'm sure it's

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:46.380
family getting song happy birthday to on

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.750
9/11 must be the weirdest [ __ ] thing

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.190
in the world it just must be weird to be

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.080
like I gotta sacrifice my own birthday

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.820
like I used to have them now I'd rather

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.010
not if that happened to me honestly

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.050
personally if I had a sacrifice my

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.850

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.740

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.350
is the week after I graduated college in

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.080

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.530
murder trial when I was 21 was the

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.750
murder trial like a game of Clue I feel

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:33.800
like that's all rich people kill each

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.510

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:39.530
no a specific person weird tool it

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.410
wasn't originally was worth invaded it

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.710
was a 65 year old Peruvian immigrant

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:50.600

so when Sheena agency all right so the

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.390
agency she worked for was on Greenwich

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.070
Avenue which is where all the fancy

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:04.340
shops are okay and she felt that she

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.660
felt the manager of that place was

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.430
blackballing her and not giving her work

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:13.790
okay and I think she was mentally ill so

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.010
she put a wig on in sunglasses and she

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.260
got a revolver and walk in there midday

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.600

if you go on jury duty

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.800

but they do would you like I'll handle

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:54.290
the evidence and get a good look at it

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:57.110
so like they had the gun held down on

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:59.930
cardboard with like guitars what it was

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.670
like a magazine or bullets on it but we

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.110
got to pass it around and get a good

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:06.259
look at it oh that's [ __ ] weird and

00:14:06.259 --> 00:14:09.620
those photos no no like grotesque oh

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.630
yeah do you get them you got to meet the

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.120
lady that I get to see her I saw her I

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.459
mean talk to her is not allowed to talk

00:14:16.459 --> 00:14:19.040
to her kick her anger anyway so did you

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.630
get like a look in her eyes and be like

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.300
damn she [ __ ] did it she never looked

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.149
at him yeah that's true I could see that

00:14:26.149 --> 00:14:27.279
straight ahead

00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:33.079
cold dead stare old time and like I said

00:14:33.079 --> 00:14:35.750
I was gonna study but I think the guilt

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.449
a lot in the time before the you know

00:14:38.449 --> 00:14:40.880
between the time she did it and I was on

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.709
the cops caught her because she went to

00:14:42.709 --> 00:14:44.630
the landlord of her condo complex and

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.540
basically told him because she we saw it

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.880
like they had some kind of bond and then

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.079
he got on the stand he was like not

00:14:51.079 --> 00:14:54.500
honor she told me so it was so like open

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.149
and shut everyone even there's a

00:14:56.149 --> 00:14:58.880
formality she confessed to the landlord

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.459
thinking they had a special relationship

00:15:00.459 --> 00:15:04.490
and he and the landlord was like she

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.350
misinterpreted that she definitely told

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:09.079
me she did it so that plus the shells

00:15:09.079 --> 00:15:10.670
plus your family bun in her place I'm

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:15.680
pretty sure we're done here [ __ ] you do

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.100
you think she's still upstate now I have

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.810
no idea actually yeah they were a bit

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.029
more like that's a tough decision for me

00:15:23.029 --> 00:15:25.040
to make a 21 my I'm supposed to be

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.600
getting drunk and having sex and [ __ ]

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.240
dude ranch Anton's like go decide this

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.490
person shape and we're at the time were

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:32.120
you doing

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.980
we were you're doing like some heavy

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.680
drugs at the time

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:41.390
yes that must have been weird like what

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:42.680
was your party what was your party

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:47.170
regimen and like Ted 21 oh my god

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:50.360
anything you I was young guy I can't

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.800
believe me to say this I had to qualify

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.649
it I was in a fraternity but I'm not a

00:15:54.649 --> 00:15:57.110
frat boy sir I don't like that term

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.060
because the school I went to the

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.010
duration of men to women was 10 to 1

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:04.490
wait men to women or women to men yes it

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:06.019
was an engineering science school we had

00:16:06.019 --> 00:16:08.990
28 eternities and 3 sorority so it's not

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:10.579
what you were thinking like there we had

00:16:10.579 --> 00:16:13.010
frat bros that was watching one specific

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:17.779
returning imagine 27 early varieties so

00:16:17.779 --> 00:16:19.850
in order so basically the odds were so

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.290
stacked against you that if you even

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:23.690
wanted to like look at a girl you got a

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.390
squat up in a fraternity it wasn't even

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.130
there it was just like I want a group of

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.709
friends that I can relate so basically

00:16:30.709 --> 00:16:32.870
you pick the fraternity that was that

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.579
that's what's up yeah I mean I think

00:16:34.579 --> 00:16:36.140
fraternities get a bad rap I think they

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.350
could be kind of fun I really don't get

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:41.450
me wrong wrong like I don't want to

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.060
disappear but they are like they need

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.350
some governance and you can't have a

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:48.050
bunch of drunken idiots like [ __ ]

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:49.310
with other drunken idiots that should

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:51.110
happen so I'm not gonna lie yeah I never

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.690
did never join because I I just didn't

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:54.880
like getting talked to you like that

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.529
some people will come in and wipe it I

00:16:57.529 --> 00:16:59.510
just I just that they didn't appeal to

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.779
me no no I get it I get it but our

00:17:02.779 --> 00:17:04.100
program is different like they

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.740
definitely made us do stuff but it was

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.770
more like read a book and we our page

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:11.929
for every existing brother and the new

00:17:11.929 --> 00:17:14.300
to track him down and learn about him we

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.550
do whatever it was like homework reader

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:19.220
boys track the guy down limo you made a

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.350
book about each existing brother

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:24.520
currently in the fraternity okay and

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.929
then you have to track them down and

00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:28.610
like ask them questions

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:31.760
oh so I was designed to like for people

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.580
to get to know each other yeah that's

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.900
kind of sweet so you guys weren't like

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.520
sticking like toothbrushes up each

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:44.000
others butts and like chugging no no to

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.190
number one I say no to number two

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:52.040
so we along what was do it sure it was I

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.070
did a shower 151 out of a 40-foot funnel

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:58.070
when I was pink just one shot out of a

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:01.310
40-foot funnel of 151

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:03.530
oh man dude it must have hit your throat

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:07.580
at like 40 miles an hour I mean it got

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.070
my stomach at 40 and that was cool

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.370
nothing took a few steps and I'm like

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:19.100
terms no I totally like a man walked

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.740
inside that's it oh my god that would

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.050
come right out of my ass let's just come

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:30.190
right literally right through me okay

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:32.570
came out of I would it came out of me

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:33.890
like a flame from a tail place

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:38.350
[Laughter]

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.350
definitely you know did more harm than

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.950
good but uh yeah that's re the craziest

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:48.560
you know but uh otherwise I'd say Pete

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.130
look okay he flipped you know yeah so

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.510
you were combining psychedelics pretty

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:57.860
heavily I mean not all the time no no I

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.960
was there to study I got it yeah I got a

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.950
degree but I definitely wanted to get my

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.390
toe in the pool and see what was

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:06.950
available so what do you make of those

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.950
experiences in terms of what kind of

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:13.240
impact if any had they had on your life

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.280
they've made me human at least kept me

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.610
human you know really allowed me to open

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.380
my mind and see things from other

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.780
people's perspectives in a way that I I

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.910
think a lot of people today you're doing

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.100
no no I empathize when they just are

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.010
giving lip service yeah I really I think

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:33.200
I swear to god man I actually agree I

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.590
think there is something tangible to

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:38.540
that to like people who have never done

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.680
those kinds of things in my opinion have

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.380
difficulty seeing things from outside of

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:46.610
their own perspective because they've

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:48.530
never literally been outside of their

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:50.840
own perspective if that makes sense I

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.720
think everybody needs it once even if

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.150
you're looking you know just watch a

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.240
wall bend as you breathe and know like

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.040
then be like do you believe in God if

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.220
you believe in Simon

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.720
yeah which so what choice do you make if

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.370
you're seeing bending walls that's

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:11.140
actually kind of unclear iron why

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.750
because the men who invented not vented

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:18.019
but were you know came up with the

00:20:18.019 --> 00:20:20.000
concept of the double helix the way of

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.360
shaped for Dina Tripp the night before

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:27.470
they did a sit in the 70s they synced

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.450
outside the box like all great men you

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:31.340
know about well you know usually more

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:32.600
brilliant you are the more diamond you

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.340
have that's true

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.350
well I mean when you think science could

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:38.960
be contained in some sort of religious

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:44.179
conception of the universe like a lot I

00:20:44.179 --> 00:20:47.389
think a lot of the like like the mystic

00:20:47.389 --> 00:20:50.330
branches like honor science but also say

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:51.919
like it's it's just you know it's part

00:20:51.919 --> 00:20:54.799
of a like there was something I was

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:55.940
reading recently where they're talking

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:59.029
about how like it was it was a mistake

00:20:59.029 --> 00:21:01.309
it was like a young kind of juvenile

00:21:01.309 --> 00:21:03.260
mistake for people to think that like

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.769
the Sun yeah the earth revolved no no

00:21:06.769 --> 00:21:08.240
the Sun revolved around the earth and

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.679
that was like when man was like in an

00:21:09.679 --> 00:21:12.340
infancy stage and then we had science

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.990
but I think with her saying that was

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:18.019
like did it take science and think that

00:21:18.019 --> 00:21:19.399
they're now like the rest of the

00:21:19.399 --> 00:21:22.159
universe is basically like just kind of

00:21:22.159 --> 00:21:24.860
dead matter outside of Earth is there

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.570
saying that's like the folly of our age

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:28.370
where like he's saying like if you have

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:29.830
a drop of water there's like just

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.940
billions of little life-forms in that

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.500
one drop of water then on the leaf that

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.760
they drop of waters on there's a

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.830
billions of life-forms on that then that

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.330
leaves on a planet with billions of

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:40.460
other life-forms so he the idea is that

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.169
that just kind of fractal eise's outward

00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:44.059
out into the universe out in space and

00:21:44.059 --> 00:21:47.090
you know beyond and on and on and on so

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:50.529
but isn't that the science of biology I

00:21:50.529 --> 00:21:52.519
mean it turned to the religious let me

00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:53.690
put it this way like I gave it a chance

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:55.970
I was an altar boy let me sit down with

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:58.519
the Pope I was Catholic yeah but I think

00:21:58.519 --> 00:22:02.899
that good no I was just gonna think that

00:22:02.899 --> 00:22:05.029
the Caprice was they tried there were

00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:08.360
decent men but one would get handy with

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.639
the lives and the widows because you

00:22:10.639 --> 00:22:13.220
know he's not gay no he couldn't but it

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.049
was that was his thing so he was getting

00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:16.820
[ __ ] the other day

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.440
no I don't know if he was I can't I'm

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.840
not gonna you know I just think that

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:24.110
it'll look okay this man this was a

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.700
priest who I would have got a [ __ ] if

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.840
you wanted to you're saying if you

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.970
wanted probably you could if you

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:30.290
observed him you'd be like ah you're

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:31.850
pretty handy for a priest you know and I

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.470
was a kid so back then it didn't occur

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.350
to me but nowadays like yeah the other

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:38.900
one total you know I turn to the booze

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.140
okay yeah I remember being a GCD one

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.430
night somebody took a whole roll of

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.820
paper

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.230
totally thicker shoved it in the toilet

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.990
was a prank he went to use my bathroom

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:50.030
he was wasted he came out and he gave us

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.820
our business like slurring for a good 10

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.850
minutes oh [ __ ] and I was just like and

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:59.090
like these are my spiritual leaders I'm

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.320
not off to a good start here

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.120
yeah well that's that's the that's the

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.680
mistake people get you know they do

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.240
they're in the Catholic Church which is

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.330
like it's just a very kind of a really

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:09.770
bizarre form especially now it's a

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:11.240
really bizarre form of religion because

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.100
it's like it's kind of like you don't

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.140
it's like the it word yeah it's like

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.850
yeah well there's the diddlers obviously

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:18.050
and then there's also like even if

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:19.580
there's no diddlers it's like the most

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:22.670
low buy-in kind of you just sit there

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:24.770
and stand there idly and this will stare

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.470
at a dude who's boring his [ __ ] talk for

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:29.330
45 minutes and you it's like the most

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:31.280
boring terms of like religion is how

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.660
it's supposed to function in like the

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.150
need it supposed to meet in a person's

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:38.240
psyche Catholicism's like the net what

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.400
it is now is the most like boring stupid

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.440
thing you can do for religion I would

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.360
say what do you think about this like

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.270
the rate of the change of society versus

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:48.920
the weight of the change of the church I

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.300
mean like who wants to find out these

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.400
days that never have a wife and be

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.750
celibate for the rest of our lives and

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:56.420
please people it takes a real specific

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.670
personality hope to be like sign me up

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.160
for that yeah I mean it goes there's

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.260
like I would say a couple varieties it

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.840
would be like someone who like buys in

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.880
full stock and barrel like this is what

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.380
I'm doing typically it happens when

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.340
you're younger you're like you know

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.720
you're 16 you're like I'm gonna become a

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.890
priest and you just kind of get that

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:14.390
ball roll and there's a bunch of people

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:15.650
who probably won't jump out of that

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:17.240
because they're like ah [ __ ] then

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.130
there's obviously I would say gay guys

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:20.630
who are hiding that from their family

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.940
that's a good place to go also there's

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.550
just like some dudes who are just kind

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:27.980
of like I would say have like that

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.320
grifter blood who are a little lazy

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.850
it's like you if you hear you can just

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:33.740
go live for free and kind of live pretty

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.149
high on the hog and if you're kind of

00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:36.889
like whatever I'll just get some [ __ ]

00:24:36.889 --> 00:24:38.840
on the side and you know chill here

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.179
that's valid personalities I could

00:24:41.179 --> 00:24:42.649
totally see doing this and not to

00:24:42.649 --> 00:24:45.679
mention got you know far be it for me if

00:24:45.679 --> 00:24:47.059
you actually feel the grace about you

00:24:47.059 --> 00:24:48.409
you're out there doing the Lord's work

00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:51.710
just meet you yeah no I think that we

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:55.309
would you say no good for you to us or

00:24:55.309 --> 00:24:56.840
actually taking it seriously but just

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.880
you know the rate of sign up these days

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.419
I can't see going up no I also think

00:25:02.419 --> 00:25:04.519
that unless the church is like you know

00:25:04.519 --> 00:25:06.230
we're changing our rules you can have a

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:08.840
white that and there's also a huge I

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.700
think what you'll see is a lot of like

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.259
missionary you'll get a lot of like

00:25:12.259 --> 00:25:14.450
priests from the third world that's a

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:16.419
[ __ ] I mean that's that's a sweet deal

00:25:16.419 --> 00:25:19.100
if you're living somewhere like in like

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.379
some bombed out area South America and

00:25:21.379 --> 00:25:23.840
their day they scoop a couple boys up

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.480
from a village that's like that's a good

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.480
deal I remember two sewers from the

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.559
Wi-Fi podcast one about the African

00:25:32.559 --> 00:25:34.340
spiritual leader about eight for the

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.230
alligator thousand people in the lake I

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:38.690
didn't see that so it's pretty sweet so

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:41.570
that then Jeff Chow who went to Sentinel

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:45.379
island and they eat him alive damn it's

00:25:45.379 --> 00:25:50.240
[ __ ] up yeah but he's also okay so

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.080
what mission it

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.940
so you're saying again missionaries good

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:56.629
good on you but you know where the word

00:25:56.629 --> 00:25:58.460
is great why we haven't already spread

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.649
it yeah I think oh yeah it's true too I

00:26:00.649 --> 00:26:02.809
think the dream right now you said from

00:26:02.809 --> 00:26:04.549
missionary I think that you know they go

00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:08.870
out and then I guess they try to get the

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.340
priests numbers up cuz you know like

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.639
most people like you said in America

00:26:12.639 --> 00:26:14.809
aren't going for that they're like wait

00:26:14.809 --> 00:26:17.720
so I'm going to get a video yeah yeah

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.779
I'm gonna get an allowance basically and

00:26:19.779 --> 00:26:22.399
kind of have to be some like weird kind

00:26:22.399 --> 00:26:26.120
of hermit figure yeah and it's not even

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.769
like a cool traditional hermit like if

00:26:27.769 --> 00:26:29.059

in the Himalayas and I'm like meditating

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:33.620
[ __ ] as a priest you're just kind of

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.350
like sitting around watching TV and then

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:38.659
it's like oh traditional hermit I sit

00:26:38.659 --> 00:26:41.960
around looking near New York at oh we

question right that's one of my first

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.360
question I always like to ask guy to you

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.430

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:36.040
monitored in secret what do you mean

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.900
okay do you know in the game World of

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:42.380
Warcraft I'm familiar with it yeah okay

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.200
back in the day there was a website

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.880
where you could look up stuff to help

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:50.840
you play I don't know why but it was

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:56.030
called w-w-w-whoa head calm okay it

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:56.480
makes sense

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.540
Wow aad calm I don't know why World of

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:04.600
Warcraft's head comm did okay somebody

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.890
for me and three co-workers played and

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:08.270
one day one of my co-workers got called

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.250
into my boss's office because he thought

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:16.250
it was like wow head so yeah we know

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.350
we're always being watched at all times

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:19.790
yeah but I feel like in terms of the

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.560
workload wouldn't it be so easy to like

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.870
[ __ ] the people who ask you to do

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:26.090
things like oh this is gonna take me all

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:27.620
day to fix this I don't have any idea

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:30.650
how computers work so if I was like you

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:32.900
know the payroll manager and the IT guys

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:34.640
like oh man this is gonna take me like

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.530
four hours to set up this computer to

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.420
the speaker I'd be like okay whatever I

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.130
guess that's how long the pipes like

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:44.090
that that uh that is hardware I need

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:46.460
firm like let me put it fifteen years I

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.440
made websites like applications like

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.750
amazon.com uh your software your all

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:53.780
your software guy yeah so we say isn't

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:56.690
that even more nebulous in terms of like

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:58.040
like I don't know if someone's gonna

00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.450
take me two years to build a website

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:03.740
okay sounds right the show most of my

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.540
day is but like nailing people down who

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.010
are like I want this I'm like what is

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:07.520
this

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.590
to find this be very specific about what

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:13.640
this means and ends yeah for website

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.910
design you're saying for application

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:18.710
design because they may come in the form

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:20.450
of a website but most of the time it's

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:22.340
like I used Amazon that come for an

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.560
example I do custom ones like I said in

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.470
insurance the purpose so I would mine

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:29.630
would be like a list of policies and how

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:32.480
much premium you know it's summed up in

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:36.680
total so you can build apps yes whoa

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:40.490
that's awesome but I like I said I do it

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:44.120
custom jobs things i order me processes

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.280
like right now a lot of people my

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.340
company use Excel and macros and

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.860
basically that not compliant with the

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:55.100
rules that are to come in the future so

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.800
we need to automate these processes and

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.590
nobody makes mistakes

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:02.390
wait explain that again so you said no

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:04.070
one uses Excel anymore because of why

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:08.480
people now use Excel they use macros

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:12.230
currently Jataka to do calculations we

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:14.450
need to automate it for the company so

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.710
that it's not on an individual's desktop

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:19.940
right I gotta just when it's only in one

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.010
place it could make it back I can make a

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:25.970
mistake Josh uses like I said I I build

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:27.260
like you know applications like you

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:29.210
custom things for companies that you

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:31.520
know so how much don't make it anywhere

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.140
else do you think that you know might

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:34.370
you know I'm not like putting this on

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:35.930
you do you think that's putting people I

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:37.160
don't you think people will be put out

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.420
of work from all the stuff or do you

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.010
think that's just like kind of like some

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:41.600
kind of end of the world thing people

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.890
are saying I this is my opinion on that

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:49.340
yes computers are meant to the work of

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.710
people you know because the ages have

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:53.870
changed not in the Industrial Age

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:56.140
anymore or the agricultural age it's the

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.810
computer age so that's a reality that

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:01.550
everyone has to face but if you like I

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:02.900
said if you're good at anything if

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:05.600
you're not weak and not willing you know

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.550
if your go-to move isn't the first one

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:10.250
the bus and you actually have a skill if

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:11.350
nothing

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:14.590
uh yeah that's a good point damn that

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:16.900
sucks you don't have a skill right now

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.760
whether all the young talented you know

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.380
crappy people out there who don't know

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:25.450
what to do place crybabies mm-hmm yeah

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:27.610
dude I was uh yeah I thought I was just

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:30.100
thinking about that today how I was just

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.590
thinking of uh just you know I was funny

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:33.550
I was actually thinking with the people

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:35.530
at my old jobs who were just like just

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:37.930
switched on to negative all day long

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:40.330
like this is [ __ ] this sucks

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:42.850
bad and it's just like dude can you

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:45.720
[ __ ] stop like what's the problem and

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.250
don't do something as it is talk to you

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:50.770

squad okay

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:40.900
yes and Kyla yep here's here's the soy I

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.330
came across this thing today this is

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:44.770
something I asked you earlier about C

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:46.260
theory and you said you're unfamiliar

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:48.280
apparently is it's an international

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.840
peer-reviewed journal of theory

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.080
technology culture blah blah blah this

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.630
is an old article from 96 someone sent

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:57.670
it to me on the patreon I got I got to

00:32:57.670 --> 00:32:59.050
find his message give him a shout out

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:04.230
but the so this is all about the debt

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:06.460
which they're saying is it back in this

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.200
is 1996 is numbers it's saying it's

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:12.820
increasing at $20,000 a second but there

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:16.390
the other thing says that we're slowly

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:19.210
also we're all losing time all the time

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:20.560
and they're basically saying the debt

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.240
will never be paid back and that's just

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.250
going to become

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.620
like the debt is almost proof of and I'm

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.810
probably butchering this but the debt is

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:29.790
more of just it's never gonna get paid

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:32.310
back in any real way but it's just proof

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.380
of like an exponential it's like a proof

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:36.570
of exponential wealth but it's really

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:38.790
just exponential debt if that makes like

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:40.500
there's more debt in the world than

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.480
capital is what this this article is

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.340
saying I don't you know I don't I don't

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:45.840
know how people would even I don't count

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.180
those numbers I don't guarantee isn't

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.320
that [ __ ] weird to be honest so

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.150
should we need that yeah well I mean it

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:52.380
kind of makes sense because there's too

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:53.640
many people on the earth from the

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:57.660
resources we have left yeah I mean yeah

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.090
we have to we own more that we can make

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:01.680
yeah that kind of expense at this point

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.940
yeah but it doesn't know it makes that

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.350
makes that like it was saying basically

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:07.140
money is in a total orbit of just like

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:09.629
it's not attached to anything other than

00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:12.210
to the idea that wealth is infinite and

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:13.860
then the debt is something that kind of

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.230
just I guess shows people were capable

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:19.879
of like generating humongous numbers

00:34:19.879 --> 00:34:23.850
what deep money is only attached you

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:26.280
know the value of money is only whatever

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.929
value humans choose to give it and

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:30.120
that's true with anything yeah it's

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:34.440
pretty well I mean like they say would

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.179
whatever from Batman some men just want

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:37.230
to watch the world burn they're

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:41.490
motivated by money yeah yeah again I

00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:44.370
really I constantly I'm obsessed with

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:47.700
the idea of a person who owns a credit

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.500
card company or a person who's like in

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.419
charge of the mint because they're

00:34:51.419 --> 00:34:53.850
they're happy it's they're not a person

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:56.190
anymore they lost touch with reality if

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:57.990
you own that much of anything

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:01.770
oh my yeah but yeah we're it's just you

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:03.780
know here's here's the thing I think I

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:05.100
especially reading this article again I

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:07.770
only read like half of it but so if you

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:11.100
own say I don't know like if you're in

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:14.040
charge of like banks like one like

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.630
you're in charge of like the World Bank

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:17.970
and dictating currency so you have

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:20.070
someone who's just making all this money

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:22.080
and then you have basically if you're in

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.880
charge of the making and overseeing of

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.730
money then people will do whatever you

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:32.670
want basically okay did you have total

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:36.030
total rings huh what no I shouldn't say

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:37.020
this but you know

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.790
when I when I describe my job earlier

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:42.420
yeah I make over six figures and I've

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:44.640
been making that for a while I mean all

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.430
I do is go to work and deal with

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:47.610
responsibilities

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:50.520
I write the software but I often tell

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.860
people like what to do and how to do it

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:56.820
because they're not you know doing it to

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.260
my standards or they don't know what

00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:58.920
they're doing

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:03.840
yeah so so in a way I feel like a well a

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.070
poor wealthy person

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:09.060
I mean these days why I mean you said

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:10.740
you feel comfortable but you you feel

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:14.520
like a poor wealthy person why because a

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.290
six-figure salary these days is just

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:18.620
enough to die comfortably in America

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.640
because there is no middle class anymore

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:24.270
and again we had the urgency for us to

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:25.590
talk is because I'm going under the

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:25.920
knife

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.110
real soon oh yeah what is it well yeah

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:31.260
you're doing surgery right all right

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:35.670
yeah so uh I need to get implants in my

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:38.190
teeth you know top and bottom because I

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:39.660
knew what I signed up for with the

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:41.160
smoking I mean I wasn't an idiot

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.640
but unfortunately there's also a genetic

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.740
problem I'm the dad my dad's side of the

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:49.590
family with teeth with our teeth

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:52.110
yeah and gums and I found out last year

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:53.370
looked at some old pictures and

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:55.170
everybody on my dad said the family's a

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:57.240
real you know back when people only live

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:00.720
for 40 just like in the 1940s pictures

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.640
on that side of the family and no one

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.140
smiles and anyone who did it's a

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.480
disaster damn so what are you getting

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:10.740
done um I'm having them all taken out

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:14.370
because in the past five years I've had

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:19.440
two root canals for crowns and then two

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:21.270
for teeth had to be pulled out of my

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:22.980
mouth just straight out so I'm actually

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.560
down in 1420 so you're gonna get a whole

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.060
new grille one you're gonna get a whole

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:29.910
new grille um I'm having them all taken

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:32.100
out sewn up and then having hard work

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:35.330
put in so I could snap in the old thing

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:37.950
damn so you're gonna have gums and keys

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:42.690
on top and bottom gums and teeth oh I

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:44.100
mean oh be plastic I'm gonna be fake

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:47.220
because it'll be hiding the original you

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.580
know the metal that attaches

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:52.200
so hey it could be like a snap but under

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.180
Jean that's a huge yeah that's like a

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:57.630
real serious deal I know it is I'll be

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:59.030
two coats for six months

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:01.200
whoa what are you gonna do for six

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.980
months I don't know and I've been

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.750
racking my brain figuring it out or

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:08.070
trying to figure now and all it does is

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:11.550
cause me anxiety so I've decided do work

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:12.930
doing those things I'd rather take off

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:14.970
what do you do yeah ii-i've done

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:17.010
paperwork I did all the you know legwork

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:18.900
I'm cleared to work from home for six

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:19.320
months

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.780
that's cool I will have to tell people

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:24.150
as I go and they can only talk to me by

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:26.730
typing and answer the phone so you can't

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:29.850
talk for like six months for real I can

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:31.800
but I just don't yeah I wouldn't go to

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.810
work and show my face to people yeah

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:36.140
dude though he's [ __ ] wild

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.430
okay so then everything else everyone's

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:40.680
like are gonna eat I'm like the more I

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:41.910
think about it the more I get anxiety

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:44.040
because they don't know so let's just

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.810
get it over with and then when I wake up

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:48.720
and I'm hungry I'll figure it out yeah

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.520
well you know that's like you know

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.920
that's a horrible idea you should plan

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.980
this out well otherwise you're gonna be

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:59.130
there so just I know you're gonna do on

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:04.860
soups a lot of soups in shakes jello

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:07.890
whatever no no I if you if you're gonna

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:09.750
be doing a six-months you have it you

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:11.400
might as well use this six months to

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.980
just to like eat nothing but gruel so

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:15.240
you can do you can probably blend

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:15.930
oatmeal

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:17.640
I would blend up vegetables you're not

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.930
gonna like eat any of this [ __ ] I would

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:21.500
just eat a bunch of like good mush and

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.190
just swallow again

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:25.890
yeah shakes you can make soup and then

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:27.900
grind it all up so it's like a soup like

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:32.760
just slushy all and then I'm gonna stay

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.130
home in my house and work out I said I'm

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:37.170
saying we'll have the middie time yeah

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:39.180
dude you should just get all your teeth

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:40.800
ripped out and then just get ripped in

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.420
your house for six months and not get

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.370
new teeth and just be ripped as [ __ ] and

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:49.490
not have new teeth now no no I need I

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:55.080
want that custom grille like it's over

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.360
done oh yeah no for sure you will have a

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:59.370
sick [ __ ] girl but I'm telling you if

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:00.960
you use that six bullets right if you do

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.450
that six months right

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:04.070
you were gonna be a [ __ ] animal

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:08.720
coming out of there absolutely and the

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.270
last thing that you know calm my anxiety

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:13.430
was a friend of mine at work reminded me

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:15.200
that uh Simpsons episode for Homer

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.700
Tiffany's drawl wired shut and his life

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.589
gets better cuz because he can't talk

00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:22.310
it's raw so you know who knows maybe

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:26.660
that will happen and things will just be

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:29.180
cool yeah I mean that'll be pretty wild

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:32.180
I mean I guess you'll still want to talk

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.099
here and there just to keep the vocal

00:40:34.099 --> 00:40:37.339
chords working but that's gonna be maybe

00:40:37.339 --> 00:40:38.540
a challenge to you because yeah your

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:40.099
voice will be everything you'll talk

00:40:40.099 --> 00:40:42.619
totally different it's not it's actually

00:40:42.619 --> 00:40:44.060
not the voice my Dennis just told me

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:47.930
this it's kind of cook apparently what

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:49.190
he's supposed to do is get like a

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:52.359
temporary set of dentures in six months

00:40:52.359 --> 00:40:55.040
okay I passed on that because it's an

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:58.970
extra five thousand yeah I has my teeth

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:01.400
my gums heal I have to go back every

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.349
week because they won't say lot to be

00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:06.560
readjusted okay and then I you know

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:10.250
Chuck them yeah so I I was like yeah

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:12.410
I'll work from home I'll skip that okay

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:16.099
then uh right just recently mentioned I

00:41:16.099 --> 00:41:18.680
forgot to tell you uh when you I

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.480
actually put the teeth back in its gonna

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.190
feel uncomfortable and I'm like why he's

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:23.569
like well your jaw muscles will atrophy

00:41:23.569 --> 00:41:26.000
during the six months that's what

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.829
actually the fake teeth are kind of

00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:31.490
there for so you're really not I feel

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:34.190
great oh it's like if I don't feel great

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:35.810
for two days on the draw I'm like you

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:36.740
know what I don't give a [ __ ] at this

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:39.230
point that's King [ __ ] yeah I mean for

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:41.000
two days it's nothing yeah but you can

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.530
still keep the gums tough if you're just

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:44.210

00:42:44.839 --> 00:42:46.759

00:42:51.079 --> 00:42:55.430
family it's very weird really and that's

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:57.650
a super adult divorce like yeah that's I

00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:59.180
guess it's like a posted old divorce

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.619

new phenomenon dude like elder divorce I

00:43:39.859 --> 00:43:41.359
don't think there's really a manual for

00:43:41.359 --> 00:43:45.079
that to make it worse they started the

00:43:45.079 --> 00:43:47.269
business together so yeah they'd have to

00:43:47.269 --> 00:43:49.430
dissolve it yeah I've seen that a lot

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:51.049
going on yeah I've seen it a couple

00:43:51.049 --> 00:43:52.519
divorced when they both owned a business

00:43:52.519 --> 00:43:53.930
together it was like probably one of the

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:57.079
ugliest divorces I've seen final layer

00:43:57.079 --> 00:44:00.619

basically was writing the [ __ ]

00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:33.170
gibberish on the paper he actually made

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:37.070
it so clear here and and you know did it

00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:39.560

going in at night still bucked up yeah

00:46:57.530 --> 00:46:59.780
but he was taking it because of the [ __ ]

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:02.090
that they put now you see yeah that's

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:05.210
true yeah they're doing that yeah he was

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:06.980
not prepared yet people can handle it

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:09.620
better than others yeah I think it takes

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:11.330
a certain type man I think it's like I

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:13.310
forget what it is it's like something I

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:14.900
don't know the exact statistic but it's

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:18.260
like 40 percent or something it's a

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:20.950
pretty high percentage of cops have a

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:23.810
have like a some sort of emotional

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:25.610
disturbance or like or could you know

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:28.130
could technically classified as having

00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:30.680
some sort of like traumatic or some sort

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.570
of disordered thinking or behavior

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:35.630
because no job well you if you ever

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:36.980
check out that episode the worst part is

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:39.260
you'll see that he had to come in hot

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:41.330
like he he don't look like a cop at all

00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:43.490
and looks like the opposite of one so he

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:45.590
was undercover dark squad first three

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:49.010
years buying bundles of the you know age

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:52.550
and parking lot ya know and then yeah

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:53.750
doesn't a guy would drive off and then

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:55.100
they pull them over and bust them down

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:57.350
the street that's hilarious

00:47:57.350 --> 00:47:59.570
the crowd was the problem with that is

00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:01.820
that you actually make a lot of

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:04.670
connections realizing it so if your life

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:06.950
ever goes wrong you know a lot of people

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:11.240
get in touch with [ __ ] yeah I don't even

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.760
think about that so [ __ ] starts Danny I

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.410
think a lot of those dudes to get kind

00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:17.180
of seduced by the life and they're like

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:18.680
dude I think I could I could [ __ ]

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:21.200
like they see how dusarian busted a

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.410
story I heard the stories I heard like

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:25.940
some bears on the night shift you know

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.850
the birds get out at to nominate their

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:31.520
director side-pieces house until 1:30 I

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:39.380
know man [ __ ] if I'm like what yeah it's

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:42.560
like you're shattering my vision to

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:44.270
reality I have no idea what's going on

00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.570
right now

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:46.970
yeah dude do to cops things that are in

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:49.180
their head they're rock stars dude

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:53.330
so I some I know no but I think how the

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:55.370
job I see how the talk can make you can

00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:57.200
make you sick ain't like can turn you

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:57.890
into that

00:48:57.890 --> 00:49:00.200
I bite totally agree I wouldn't be able

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.060
to it would it would instantly corrupt

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:04.970
me I would instantly ruin myself with my

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:09.260
newfound power so yeah like I said if

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:10.880

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:14.380

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:19.760
explaining was like a you could see

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.200
people with the bulges where the guys

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.420
would be I'm like good for you maybe

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.040
they are packing if I'm gonna get it I

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.930
don't want to know about it yeah yeah I

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:29.270
mean dude again it that that that job

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:31.610
grips a certain person a certain type of

00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:33.830
person pretty hard and that's yeah

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:35.210
that's something that's tough to let go

00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:37.640
of we're like I said you're buzzing

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.500
around all day and people have to listen

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:43.130
to you so so people really and again

00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:47.150
they look it content to to to division 1

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:50.030
division into two categories if you

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:51.500
would have expanded your mind with

00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:55.310
psychedelics at all you have empathy and

00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:58.040
you can sympathize with what you see

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:01.360
yeah you can relate you can understand

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.800
their brothers biggest problem with was

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.600
okay was with the other side who had

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.790
never done it and Trust looked down and

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:11.540
considered those people trash yeah

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:13.130
yeah I kind of run into that every now

00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:14.930
and again okay you're riding around with

00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:17.030
a car like that guy in your car eat your

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:18.500
partner you just mouthed it off about

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:21.740
you know it doesn't help and then you

00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:23.870
add the regular politics of any job on

00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:25.520
top of that yeah man

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:27.410
we should double we should have all all

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:31.460
their salaries you say double now yeah

00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:32.990
well do think you're PPS [ __ ] good

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:34.550
man with the overtime and all they

00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:36.920
clearly don't get it it's never enough

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:39.350
and III but yeah but over times weird

00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:40.550
because my brother said that some people

00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:42.500
can abuse that by comparison

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.480
do you know how I the track the area

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:47.180

00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:50.020
mm-hmm

00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:52.520
