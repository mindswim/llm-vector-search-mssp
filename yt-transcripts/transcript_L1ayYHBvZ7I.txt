00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:32.319
yeah you go to black cherry tight

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:35.009
I started microdose and on mushrooms

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:38.440
first day fell on a Sunday dude I was

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.030
like there's I'm not dancing usually

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.039
like you know you got to do like you got

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:44.530
to clap it up but everyone has to go

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.090
around and talk so you've been taking

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.310
mushrooms and then dancing a black shirt

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.729
I don't dance

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:52.900
usually I'd be kind of like oh man I'm

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.130
weird for not dancing but I just sit

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.120
there and I'm like I'm just gonna let

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.430
everyone dance and sit here normally so

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.400
I can't do it but it was definitely

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.779
weird cuz I didn't know like it Catholic

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:03.310
this is my point a Catholic Church like

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.069
you just go and show up this is like a

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:10.029
hedge fund bet like yeah yeah I'm here

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:11.680
it's like it was like touching like the

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.419
home base yeah I'm here

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:15.190
but Baptist Church you have to like oh

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.020
they actually like ask you your thoughts

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.319
cuz there's like nine people there oh so

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:21.279
they talked to everybody individually

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:23.590
yeah so they came it was my turn and I

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:24.699
was like well I got a couple of [ __ ]

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:27.400
fosters shared shared my thoughts on the

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.990
Catholic faith and like for a while and

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.979
the guy was like hey that's good

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.660
imagine that black preacher just hitting

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.080
the worst landmine mystery he's like

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.460
everybody know let's share I thought

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.250
sure I thought you young man oh I just

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.060
took mushrooms what up I don't think God

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:52.600
is a sellable product a collection

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.490
plates going around brother interesting

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:02.080
thought is that is that God it's the

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.880
thing like they had it on lock for a

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.430
while cuz like you were eating Jesus for

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.260
like hundreds of years people like dude

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.940
this is which is crazy because that

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.040
never sat well is this sat well with me

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.570
at all like when I was a kid

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.970
remember in communion I mean do you

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:21.160
believe you bought but when they first

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.780
were like yeah this is the actual body

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.670
of Christ I was like alright so we're

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.060

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.150
we're just my parents are dumb or

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.000
they're lying yeah I know hard well

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.740
thirty years later I came to the same

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.729
realization so dumb for coming here this

00:08:39.729 --> 00:08:41.190
place sucks

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:44.950
they're not gonna make it man well [ __ ]

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:47.110
they're like little boys ball count so

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.760
[ __ ] they just hit a hard one in

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.110
Pennsylvania for Hondo in PA how many

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:54.630
hot boys are in Pennsylvania

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.750
Pennsylvania is such a hot boy problem

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.280
I'm not trying to blame these priests or

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.060
Penn State or anybody

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.730
there's a rampant hot kid problem in

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.670
Pennsylvania true I think we all need to

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:12.580
agree on that extra this adorable kid

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.870
you know what do you see an adorable kid

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:19.040
and you just want to come I guess an

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.690
issue we need to talk about

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.460
there's too many upcoming book id's

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.400
walking around especially when you dowel

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.320
up in this little road all them up do

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.370
they look like little baby hot ghosts

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:46.990
problem that no one ever talks about

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:52.159
commas hydrophilic whatever come hates

00:21:52.159 --> 00:21:52.929

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:05.299
when it's in your pubes and then again

00:22:05.299 --> 00:22:07.759
the shower and there just disperses it

00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:12.230
like white just give calif real right

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.419
like weird dry come that you got a like

00:22:14.419 --> 00:22:17.090
walkouts you have even with the water do

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:18.200
you ever feel it on your leg every

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.190
jerk-off does anyone turn off this

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:22.129
shower all right give her filled on your

00:22:22.129 --> 00:22:26.480
legs after all yeah it's an

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.009
indescribable if you feel it later

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:32.990
you really just accidentally leave come

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:37.730
on you probably that's a feeling you

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:40.220
don't forget now know what you mean it's

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.720
like it's at your skin it's like a

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.139
glimpse of your skin in like 70 years

00:22:44.139 --> 00:22:46.639
y'all like wrinkly weird skin is seven

00:22:46.639 --> 00:22:48.360
year olds are pretty much made entirely

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.940
[Laughter]

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.499
figure that next time you hug your [ __ ]

00:22:54.499 --> 00:22:55.980
Nana

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.830
the grouse Nana made entirely of comedy

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:01.020
actually you know what speaking of your

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.900
Nana's sex drive your uh no I've thought

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.730
about this I've talked about this before

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.010
and I think you got to lead it I had it

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.920
I have a theory that like you're you're

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.210
set like you kind of like as you get

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:13.530
older you kind of like sublimate your

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.570
sex drives into like other weird stuff

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:16.980
you know like guys get obsessed with

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:20.310
their lawns and women bake when they get

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:21.810
older women get into like weird [ __ ]

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:24.330
like that guy's gonna do [ __ ] just is

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.610
what it is I remember this yeah my thing

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:28.380
is that when your mom you know like I

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:29.430
don't know if your mom's like this my

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.110
mom makes me eat if I come home check

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.150
come on have some food in my head like

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.330
that's my mom's sublimated sex drive

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:38.850
invite me not eating I'm giving my mom

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:42.630
blue balls theoretically so I just

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.540
[ __ ] eat dude come home like another

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:52.890
helping please mom dude I'm hooking my

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:55.410
aunts up I never turn down meals so that

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:58.380
like eating their macaroni is basically

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:05.100
eating their [ __ ] yeah no no no it's

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:06.960
like eating a thing that's like through

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:21.180
like yeah no I remember this I remember

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.800
this and this is the type of stuff we

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.620
talk about that always bothers me why

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.720
that's a solid theory it's a solid

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.220
theory I agree but it's like don't even

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:33.180
think about it I can't not like you give

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.010
these animalistic and I was kind even

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:39.450
think about gravity dude no but the

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:40.830
other [ __ ] he thought about like bending

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:44.880
space in time Lightspeed dude the

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.390
Einstein of ants plus eats

it no I mean the point is to hook up but

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:38.450

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:47.510
anyway so I was like so I was in the

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.280
flow tank and I couldn't remember any of

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.260
my thoughts and just it was all I could

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:53.300
feel was my nervous system pinging the

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.340
whole time just like all the adrenaline

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:57.560
and for like 10 minutes I was like this

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:04.820
is what it's like to be a deer [ __ ]

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:11.990

customers do you think get in that tank

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:24.740
or like [ __ ] poor deer for sure I

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:27.680
came up with the fact that like I was

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.390
having whole things about sell you're

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:34.060
like cellular consciousness makes sense

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:38.150
I was a sperm cell yeah I'm conscious

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:40.400
now our sperm cells conscious and then

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.990
like you know like certain cells fight

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:44.060
disease are they like oh [ __ ] there's

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.500
that disease like let's get him boys and

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:46.610
like I'm like the whole your whole

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:50.900
body's consciousness I'm saying prove me

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.660
wrong dude was the sperm cell did you

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.490
just absorb consciousness once you grew

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:57.530
up or as a sperm cell were you pre

00:31:57.530 --> 00:31:58.580
equipped with consciousness

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:00.590
you know I mean you're having something

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:02.390
really actually probably pretty

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:05.000

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.200
a real actual breakthrough it is I was

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.580

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:05.450

I don't [ __ ] know

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:18.310
everybody should know that guy's name

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:20.780
there's three names again Lee Harvey

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:26.750
Oswald II was it yeah yeah yeah big

they sued in civil court cuz he was like

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.160
dude I didn't [ __ ] do it

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:40.190
just cuz alright but I think he won this

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:43.250
one it'll be the civil court and they

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:44.420
found like actually according the

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:45.860
evidence we couldn't really convicted on

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:49.220
this I mean again I kind of I kind of

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:51.740
[ __ ] crush information and sometimes

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:55.580
misrepresented but do your own research

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.080
I mean I don't think it would be

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:59.840
surprising if the CIA killed a black

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.570
leader they definitely happened yeah and

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:04.250
like I said before you follow cast the

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:06.800

some some bill some dude what up maestro

00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:37.269
upside my thing here's what happened to

00:46:37.269 --> 00:46:41.380
me because it's not like I I've dated

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:43.029
I've dated across the board

00:46:43.029 --> 00:46:44.859
well what happened to me was when I was

00:46:44.859 --> 00:46:46.660
younger I told you guys about standing

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:49.500
up and shooting into the bathtub the

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:52.269
only court found porn in the woods when

00:46:52.269 --> 00:46:53.890
I was 8 but after that I couldn't find

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:59.890
it for a while for a long time so I used

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:02.049
to get Victoria's Secret catalogs my mom

00:47:02.049 --> 00:47:03.849
my mom didn't receive a Victoria's

00:47:03.849 --> 00:47:07.390
Secret catalog for like a decade and at

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:09.309
the time if you do my timeline I was

00:47:09.309 --> 00:47:11.950
born in 86 when I was coming of age Tyra

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:15.010
Banks was it just open that up come on

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:18.460
Tyra Banks every day every day for years

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:21.849
you would come on the same picture they

00:47:21.849 --> 00:47:24.400
had multiple shots of her like I get to

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.289
come on one for their to pull it out of

00:47:26.289 --> 00:47:28.089
the tree I buried it under the trash bag

00:47:28.089 --> 00:47:31.510
in the trash can pop it out sometimes

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:34.029
the paper would tear I'm not gonna so I

00:47:34.029 --> 00:47:36.670
can act like I have not done that yeah I

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:38.430
think I imprinted myself so I naturally

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:40.539
gravitate towards dating like black

00:47:40.539 --> 00:47:49.349
women Dominican sometimes oh yeah so but

00:47:53.549 --> 00:47:56.230
I don't look like my thing is I know

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:57.730
people who only date within the race and

00:47:57.730 --> 00:48:00.309
it's like your little cutting off like

00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:02.500
your if you just expand it to other

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:03.880
races that's five times the amount of

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:07.059
closer you get or seven however many

00:48:07.059 --> 00:48:08.289
continents or countries I don't know

00:48:08.289 --> 00:48:09.190
dude

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:10.869
I've really thought you were gonna

00:48:10.869 --> 00:48:14.259
actually say something like nice this

00:48:14.259 --> 00:48:15.549
give me a nice moment he's like you

00:48:15.549 --> 00:48:17.319
should expand it to be you know honestly

00:48:17.319 --> 00:48:19.299
I can accepting normal humors I give you

00:48:19.299 --> 00:48:20.960
so much more [ __ ]

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:23.330
[ __ ] all these other races do however no

00:48:23.330 --> 00:48:26.630
however I do think that's the only thing

00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:28.849
that started cooperation between the

00:48:28.849 --> 00:48:30.740
races we definitely saw people who

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:31.910
didn't look oh yes on the way [ __ ] that

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:33.140
it was like wants to trade Boucher's

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:34.160
whatever those things are called you're

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.290
throwing a [ __ ] flaming arrows and

00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:37.730
then someone who looks like those people
