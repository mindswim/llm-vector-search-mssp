Title: Psych Naw Meditation Series Part 2: The Level of the Mind
Description: In this video we explore the nature of our "thinking-mind" or ego and how it dictates our experience of reality for better and for worse. 

Though by cultivating what we call our "aware-mind" through meditation we can start to observe our ego in real time so we can assess the accuracy, or perhaps usefulness, of our thoughts and feelings as they pertain to what we're trying to do with ourselves.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.110
[Music]

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.620
[Applause]

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.519
[Music]

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.559
let's just make this distinction

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.359
this distinction between awareness

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.760
and thought you may have a concept that

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.480
you have a distinction between

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.920
awareness and thought but i would

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.400
suggest that you take a look because it

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.720
would seem to me you actually don't have

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.200
that distinction you're not seeing that

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.520
distinction you're not knowing

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.360
that distinction

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.920
between awareness

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.160
and thought

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.039
awareness

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.640
is not thought

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.480
awareness is

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.840
consciousness prior to thought

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.640
and

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.680
you realize

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.320
that you are that

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.239
and whatever the mind

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.140
produces

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.240
[Music]

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.080
and says our thoughts

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.000
now for most of us we are identified

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.360
with that mind as being me

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.720
right this is this is what i am

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.600
and the practice of mindfulness is to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.119
recognize that actually there's

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.960
something that comes before that mind

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.960
right there is this awareness that is

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.360
aware of the mind in whatever is arising

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.210
within it

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.320
[Music]

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.759
this endless stream of mental content is

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.960
propagated from an underlying source

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.730
that can be located and identified

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.759
[Music]

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.880
the ego cannot

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.439
dissolve itself but in the light of

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.680
awareness

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.820
it dissolves

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.020
[Music]

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.840
thinking about ourselves

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.840
and observing about ourselves

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.360
there are two different things

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.400
then you are in a state which we will

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.520
call meditation

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.400
and slowly

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.360
without being pushed your thoughts

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.599
will come to silence

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.480
that is to say all the verbal symbolic

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.720
chatter going on in the skull don't try

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.560
and get rid of it

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.400
because that will again produce the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.840
illusion that there's a controller

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.879
question

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.360
the structure and complexity of the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.239
ego's functions and proclivity to

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.280
automatically edit perceptions

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.120
make it seem like a formidable obstacle

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.480
answer

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.040
if we know its structure and mode of

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.000
function

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.440
then we know its susceptibility

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.400
this becomes experientially apparent

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.519
during meditation

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.720
from the impersonal viewpoint of the

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.800
witness observer

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.720
we watch how it operates

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.360
just

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.000
it it goes on it goes on it goes on and

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.760
finally it gets tired of itself and

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.239
bored and stops

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.680
and so then there's a silence

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.920
and this is a deeper level of meditation

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.239
and in that silence

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.920
you suddenly begin

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.879
to see the world as it is

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.560
okay so in the last video we fully

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.840
conquered the body we learned how to

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.920
breathe properly we learned how to pace

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.000
our breathing if you haven't watched it

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
please go back and watch that one it'll

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.400
only make this 100 times easier

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.920
we even did a little meditation in that

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.599
one so again that's a that was a great

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.159
primer but as you may have noticed from

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.920
doing that or even trying to meditate

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.040
yourself

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.680
you know that it can be difficult

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.840
because your your mind can just start to

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.600
distract you you get so many thoughts

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.919
you start to judge it am i doing it

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.560
right blah blah blah so this one and

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.400
this the level two the cognitive or

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.479
mental level of meditation

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.240
we're going to learn how to deal with

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.560
that pesky mind of ours and how to put

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.560
it in its place so we can actually

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.560
meditate you know successfully quote

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.240
unquote so the main objective i'm

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.759
spelling it all out here this is what

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.120
we're trying to do today is learning

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.759
that our thinking minds or our egos are

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.000
only part of the total system of our

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
perception and cognition we also have

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.680
another part of us that can just watch

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.919
our thoughts or experiences really our

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.919
feelings and everything else which we'll

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.520
call our aware mind and there's a

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.199
distinction between those two things and

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.680
that it's very helpful to learn how to

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.600
tap into this thing we're going to call

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.280
our where minds and that's what we're

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.880
trying to do through meditation and you

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.560
know why are we doing this well it's

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.560
because we're learning how to deal with

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.240
all of these thoughts and feelings that

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.479
are coming rushing up at us constantly

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.080
that we notice when we're meditating

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.280
because we're not distracted by a

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.039
million other things

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.800
and again it's

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.160
the whole point of it is if you can't

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.520
sit still in a chair for five minutes

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.360
without freaking yourself out

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.680
how are you handling your work day

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.479
so or you know how are you handling

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.479
a dinner with your girlfriend's parents

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.080
or just dinner with her or your

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.240
boyfriend whatever how are you handling

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.840
the stuff of life if you squirm in a

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.000
chair in five minutes of silence

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.360
that's the question we gotta start

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.440
asking and i also i'm stressing the idea

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.000
here is not to stop thinking or control

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.680
our thoughts or anything like that but

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.520
instead it's to learn how to mentally

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.960
step aside from our thoughts and

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.520
feelings and just watch them be aware of

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.280
them and you might be thinking why would

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.199
i want to watch my thoughts and honestly

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:59.039
that's a fair question the reason i

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:00.560
would say that it's good to watch your

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.880
thoughts is that thinking consumes

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.360
energy and some thoughts consume so much

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.360
energy via the feelings they create that

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.960
they can literally have a negative

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.319
effect on your health

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:11.840
they can strain your body your

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.840
relationships and even cause some people

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.199
to kill themselves

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:16.800
thoughts and the feelings they generate

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.720
are incredibly powerful and for that

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.400
reason they should be watched closely

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.919
and also there's just a matter of

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.240
efficiency like we've all had situations

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.280
that

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.360
loomed ahead of us that we might

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.600
we stress ourselves about we we start

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.199
thinking about freaking out about to the

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:32.479
point where we're almost physically

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:34.240
nauseous or anxious then you do it and

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.000
it turns out to be not that bad

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
seldom do we ever go

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.639
i just put my body through like a level

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:43.280
of hell for no reason at all

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.080
so part of this is learning how to

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.160
just look into the fact of like might we

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.000
be just slightly out of touch with

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.840
what's actually happening our little

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.080
blueprints for reality might they have

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.759
some errors in there can we look at them

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:57.840
can we be honest about that and how can

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.919
we kind of investigate that and think

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.680
about it this way we've all met people

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.120
who we think are great but they

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.199
constantly trash themselves and we think

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:05.919
like

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:07.440
this person has no idea how great they

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.720
are why are they always so down on

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.479
themselves like their perception of

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:13.440
themselves just doesn't match up to how

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.199
they actually are or there's the

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:16.800
opposite of that which is unfortunately

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.560
seen more often where a person seems to

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.000
think that they're like the best thing

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.919
ever when in reality you and perhaps

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:24.080
everyone around you seems to experience

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.080
that person as annoying and pompous or

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.319
perhaps even downright shitty

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:29.759
and we say the same thing in this

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:31.520
instance as well it's like man this

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.840
person is oblivious they're completely

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.319
out of touch they have no idea

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:37.919
well ask yourself this

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:40.160
exactly what are they out of touch with

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.479
and is it possible that i might be even

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:44.639
if just a teeny bit out of touch with

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:46.639
this thing as well in some capacity

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:48.319
here's an example you're about to go on

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:50.400
a date and you're nervous you imagine

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.240
your date just seeing you and instantly

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.919
rejecting you on the spot just you walk

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:55.360
in they go oh hell no and they get up

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.400
and leave and you're like oh if that

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.080
happens that'd be so embarrassing or

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.840
maybe you just you imagine that you

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.919
can't sustain a conversation and there's

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:03.919
just a dead silence and it just gets

00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:05.599
awkward and you're like i hate when that

00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:06.800
happens it's definitely going to happen

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.560
what am i going to talk about or maybe

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.360
you

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.120
worry about getting bad gas like last

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.879
time or you have a pimple on your neck

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:14.479
and you're just imagining it like

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:16.560
you strain to sneeze and it pops and

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.319
[ __ ] bleeds and it's disgusting and

00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:19.919
all these horrible scenarios run through

00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:22.000
your head and they get all these panicky

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.680
feelings and eventually you just start

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.000
to kind of quote know that this date is

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.360
going to be horrible you say i got a

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.039
feeling this is going to be bad just

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:31.039
like the last one and you start to feel

00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:33.360
sorry for yourself and then you just

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.039
start to think about dying alone you

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.800
just spin yourself out what have i done

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.279
blah blah that is a hell purely

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:41.519
contrived of the thinking mind

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:43.839
from the perspective of the aware mind

00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:45.839
you are just a person sitting on a couch

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:47.680
watching tv before a date who is

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.440
experiencing an onslaught of anxious

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.200
negative thoughts there's a humongous

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.480
difference there if you're stuck in the

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.399
thinking mind you're like in a nightmare

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:56.080
you can't wake up from when you're in

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.680
the aware mind you're waking up from

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.519
your daydream and just saying

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:02.560
that's not real i'm a person in a room

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.959
freaking myself out

00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:06.640
and you just let your body kind of go

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.080
back to its baseline rather than

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.839
constantly ramping it up by trying to

00:09:09.839 --> 00:09:11.360
solve this problem that you've created

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.120
in your mind in the first place so from

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.880
and it seems subtle but from this more

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.800
like spacious and aware perspective we

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.440
can simply opt to let go of this mental

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.120
simulation of the date and just

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.480
experience it

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.959
as it really is from a more open and

00:09:24.959 --> 00:09:27.200
curious perspective versus like a closed

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.200
off nervous and gloomy one as you try to

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.720
like you know you have your idea for how

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.920
it's gonna go and you're just looking

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.440
for all the negative things that align

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.120
with your preconceived notion of how

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.800
this is going to play out even though

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.480
you genuinely have no idea alright so

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.880
let's try to do a tiny little warm-up

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.880
to get us in this mind space we're going

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.160
for again

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.920
we're trying to shift from our thinking

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.120
minds

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.200
into what we're going to call our aware

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.279
minds and it's very simple to do this it

00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:53.360
just takes discipline to hold this

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.519
position mentally so let's jump in and

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:56.480
again

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.880
just see how much you can let go of the

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.320
thinking mind

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.560
let's go

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.040
all right so let's start with a nice

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.720
deep breath in through the nostrils and

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.120
remember just like before put one hand

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.440
on your chest one hand on your belly

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.040
make sure when you breathe in your

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.560
belly's rising

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.920
let me let go

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.279
the belly falls you want to make sure

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:24.959
we're breathing into the belly not into

00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:26.160
the chest

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.079
so let's take a just a few seconds take

00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:31.040
a couple breaths just

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.240
into the nostrils

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.680
out through the mouth

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.640
and your nostrils

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.120
out through the mouth

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.360
now as you continue to breathe like this

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.519
you might be thinking like is it working

00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:54.079
how do i know if i'm in the wear mind

00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:56.560
what does this even mean

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.399
i'm going to tell you this is all you

00:10:58.399 --> 00:10:59.600
got to do

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.519
let your thoughts come up

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:03.279
and just notice that you're thinking

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:05.040
when a thought comes up

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.640
all we're going to do

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.800
is just label what's happening that's

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.480
what the aware mind is when we're first

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.560
getting into it it's just a labor we're

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.160
just using it as like a one of those

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.279
labeling guns so when a thought arises

00:11:17.279 --> 00:11:19.680
rather than participating in the thought

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.160
just say i am having the thought that

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.440
whatever

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.600
and let it go

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.880
i have a feeling arises same thing

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.360
i am having the feeling that

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.600
whatever you're feeling just notice it

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.440
that's all we have to do in the aware

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.360
mind again

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.200
it's simple

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.360
just notice what's happening

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.680
be aware

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.079
that's all there is to do

00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:48.560
is just let things pop up into our field

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.160
of awareness

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.839
and just see them for what they are

00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:55.440
maybe you're thinking i don't think i'm

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.839
doing this right

00:11:57.839 --> 00:11:59.440
see that thought

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.480
see the fact that you're thinking

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.959
i am having the thought that i am not

00:12:04.959 --> 00:12:06.880
doing this right

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.399
well that's all there is to this

00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:12.399
i am having the thought

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:14.959
that's all there is to this or

00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:17.839
my mind is being judgmental

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:19.680
and you keep breathing

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.600
you keep letting whatever needs to come

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.160
up to the surface just let it come up

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.600
notice it

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.399
label it for what it actually is

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:31.680
and just keep it pushing

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.079
it might sound simple or kind of dumb

00:12:36.079 --> 00:12:38.959
but again it's it's a powerful trick to

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:41.760
reduce the bodily load of thoughts

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.279
if you're having the thought i'm gonna

00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:45.680
get fired today and i'm gonna run out of

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.240
money and get kicked out of my house

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.560
if you notice you're having that thought

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.480
versus fully participating in that

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.519
thought

00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:56.880
it's two very different things

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.639
so again just see if you can play with

00:12:58.639 --> 00:13:00.880
this just notice

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.760
take a breath in

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.800
and let it out

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.399
as you breathe in just

00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:11.279
whatever pops up just notice it

00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:12.880
and as you breathe out

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.440
let it go

00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:18.720
maybe you'll get a period of silence or

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.720
inner stillness where nothing pops up

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.440
even if it's just for like three seconds

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.519
once we start to experience that we see

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:27.680
that we can actually cultivate a sense

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.240
of peace within ourselves

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.000
the trick is

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.760
how we choose to interact with the

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.600
contents of our mind

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.240
and by noticing that they're happening

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.720
noticing the fact that we are thinking

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.320
versus the fact that we think we're

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.240
predicting reality

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.800
create two very different sets of

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.720
feelings within our body

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.040
when we know a thought is just a thought

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.480
we're relaxed

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.279
when we think a thought is reality

00:13:57.279 --> 00:13:59.120
we're on edge

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.040
just like when you wake up from a dream

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.360
realizing it was just a dream and say

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.880
oh thank god

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.519
oh thank god

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.399
we can kind of consciously tap into that

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:13.120
by extricating ourselves from the mess

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.320
of our thinking minds at any time

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.680
so take a few more breaths

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.560
into the nose

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.920
out through the mouth

00:14:26.959 --> 00:14:29.440
just keep breathing and keep noticing

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.040
how you're feeling it's all you have to

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.279
do it sounds so simple that it almost

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:35.920
seems like i'm not doing anything

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.120
that's just your mind notice it

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.880
let go of it

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.279
see what happens

00:14:51.279 --> 00:14:54.279
so

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.120
so

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.120
whenever you're ready

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.079
open up those eyes

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.320
learning how to tap into this aware mind

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.000
to see the fact that we are only

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.920
thinking versus accurately predicting

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.600
the future as we tend to think we're

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.839
doing helps alleviate the bodily load

00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:41.600
generated by our thoughts in terms of

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.600
bad or uncomfortable feelings and this

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.639
is why we want to learn how to

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:46.240
discipline ourselves around thinking

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.920
through meditation because we don't want

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.079
to be unnecessarily redlining our bodies

00:15:50.079 --> 00:15:51.839
by producing all these feelings via the

00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:53.680
thoughts we have all the time

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.839
unnecessarily and that's not to say that

00:15:55.839 --> 00:15:57.680
thinking in and of itself is inherently

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.440
bad because that's not true at all we

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.800
need our thoughts thoughts are like

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.320
cells in our body they all have their

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.320
specific function and uses but our

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.320
thoughts need a boss

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.639
and that boss is the aware mind that

00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:10.639
we're cultivating through meditation the

00:16:10.639 --> 00:16:12.959
very center of our willpower thoughts

00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:15.040
control action but willpower controls

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.120
thoughts and the way we build willpower

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.199
is through meditation specifically when

00:16:19.199 --> 00:16:20.880
we space out and get lost in our

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:21.759
thoughts

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:24.399
realize that we're lost in them and then

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:26.959
through willpower bring our awareness

00:16:26.959 --> 00:16:29.519
back to our breath or just to being

00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:32.560
itself back to the person you who is

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.720
simply sitting in a chair breathing

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.560
versus the person who is experiencing

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.720
boredom and patience frustration or

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.560
worried about all the stuff they have to

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.279
do or how this is a waste of time etc

00:16:43.279 --> 00:16:45.920
etc so i say all of that to say this

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.920
there is awareness and then there's

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.120
thinkingness

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.519
awareness slows the mind

00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:53.360
thinkingness multiplies thoughts and

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.920
speeds it up one relaxes the body

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.560
awareness and thinkingness if left

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.279
unchecked taxes the body by producing a

00:17:01.279 --> 00:17:03.360
wide array of feelings that if conjured

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.280
up in excess like anxiety stress anger

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.160
depression take a serious toll on not

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.160
just our physical well-being but the

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.640
quality of our life i i can't stress

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.280
this enough our thinking mind also does

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.720
awesome stuff like comes up with

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.120
formulas writes books design stuff so

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.559
don't for a second get down on your

00:17:20.559 --> 00:17:22.480
thinking mind

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.280
it is not a bad thing it's just

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.880
it's all we're really taught about in

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.559
the west about our minds we see our

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:30.880
minds as the singular glob of brain that

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.720
only produces thoughts and for that

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.280
reason we fail to develop the aware mind

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.520
which if anything only enhances the

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.280
quality of our thoughts

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.880
we're forced to live in our thinking

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.440
minds when in reality it's just a place

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.520
we want to visit it's like home depot we

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.039
just go there to get stuff and we get

00:17:47.039 --> 00:17:48.880
the [ __ ] out we're much better off

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.960
living in or being grounded in our

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.200
present moment awareness which again is

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.200
what we are doing when we meditate we're

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.120
building a house brick by brick in this

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.200
more peaceful open state that exists

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.120
within us but we just got to take the

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.200
time to visit it and see for ourselves

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.280
none of these words matter unless you

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.039
take the time to sit down

00:18:07.039 --> 00:18:09.440
and practice feeling what i'm talking

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.160
about this aware expansive

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.240
state where you're just you're just

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.400
there and when i say grounding ourselves

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.400
in awareness i mean willfully centering

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.559
ourselves our attention in its very

00:18:20.559 --> 00:18:22.799
source which is consciousness rather

00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:24.720
than the contents of consciousness which

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.520
are thoughts feelings sounds smells etc

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.360
it's like a tv identifying with its

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.600
electricity rather than whatever show is

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.120
playing on the screen so let's take a

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.720
few minutes to stop and chill out and

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.720
just let ourselves process this idea of

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.039
awareness versus thinkingness just see

00:18:39.039 --> 00:18:40.240
if you can get a sense for what i'm

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.919
talking about if you can't no big deal i

00:18:41.919 --> 00:18:43.760
got more tricks up my sleeve to come

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.760
just see if you can to the best of your

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.960
abilities

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.679
just watch thoughts arise

00:18:49.679 --> 00:18:51.120
and if you get snagged into them no

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.640
problem but just play around with this

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.400
pretend you're like a dog on a couch or

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.520
something just

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.120
be where you are

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.039
and see if you can see your thoughts for

00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:01.039
what they are from a stance of grounded

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:03.120
awareness of you the person who is

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.799
really just sitting in a room while your

00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:06.400
mind produces thoughts

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.840
versus you entertaining them getting

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.080
swayed by them just it's very subtle but

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.600
see if you can play with this we're not

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.039
trying to wipe our minds clean or

00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:14.880
anything but we're just looking at it

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.880
we're looking at our mind from a more

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.960
secure perspective something we might

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.880
not have known was there before and if

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.600
we get lost in our thoughts great that's

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.440
actually good because when we're lost in

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.440
our thoughts and we notice that we can

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.160
then practice using our willpower to

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.720
gently guide our awareness back to our

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.280
breath back to the meditation the same

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.000
thing applies to boredom judgment or any

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.480
feelings you can just you notice them

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.240
three world powers say i'm not doing

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.440
this right now

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.960
i'm going back to the you know back to

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.679
the breath i'm taking my attention my

00:19:47.679 --> 00:19:49.919
focus my awareness and i'm concentrating

00:19:49.919 --> 00:19:52.480
it and bringing it back exactly where i

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.520
want it

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.799
it's pretty cool

00:19:54.799 --> 00:19:56.720
so here we go timer set for three

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.919
minutes let's go

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.520
for the next three minutes this is going

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.200
to be a quick one

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.480
we're going to continue to breathe

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.840
just like we've been doing in through

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.320
the nose

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.559
and out through the mouth

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.559
into the nose

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:29.440
and let it go through the mouth

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.600
as you continue to breathe

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.600
again try to just notice what's coming

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.600
up

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.840
let the thoughts come up

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.760
let them go

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.840
if you get lost in them of course just

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.120
notice that

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.120
and bring your attention

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.840
back to

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.200
breathing maybe you're thinking like is

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.120
this working how do i tell if it's

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.480
working am i doing it right

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.039
though what if the problem

00:20:57.039 --> 00:20:59.760
wasn't so much a lack of benefits on the

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.840
side of

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.280
meditation what if the problem stems

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.240
from the

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.080
urge we have

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.400
to alter the way we feel

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.120
to change

00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:14.320
i wonder what we'd feel like if we let

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.919
go of that just in the space of

00:21:15.919 --> 00:21:18.919
meditation

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.799
maybe what you don't need to be doing

00:21:32.799 --> 00:21:34.240
right now

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.320
is trying to assess

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.919
whether you're getting this immediate

00:21:37.919 --> 00:21:41.679
direct benefit from this practice

00:21:41.679 --> 00:21:44.320
maybe that act in and of itself is

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.080
causing stress unnecessarily

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.679
again meditation is just giving

00:21:51.679 --> 00:21:53.760
ourselves a break

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.320
from the feelings and

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.360
urges and all the sensations

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.200
drummed up by the thinking mind and the

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.600
world

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.360
so for the rest of this meditation if

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.039
you catch yourself assessing or

00:22:07.039 --> 00:22:09.520
wondering like is this working for me

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.480
i don't think i'm doing it right notice

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.480
that's what you're doing

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.400
and instead

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.320
see if you can just accept how you're

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.799
feeling or accept your thoughts or

00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:23.440
wherever you're at currently

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.880
as it is

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.559
rather than trying to optimize in this

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:30.880
space we're gonna try to just accept

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.159
make peace with what currently is

00:22:34.159 --> 00:22:36.320
accept it

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.520
feel that it's okay

00:22:39.679 --> 00:22:41.600
i'm not getting the benefits i want

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.240
right i expect it right now

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.840
and notice that you're kind of ramping

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.120
yourself up

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.720
notice that you're talking yourself out

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:49.919
of it

00:22:49.919 --> 00:22:51.440
and just be at peace with it that's

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.280
where you're currently at that's totally

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.799
fine that's where everybody starts

00:22:56.799 --> 00:22:58.799
so just continue to breathe

00:22:58.799 --> 00:23:00.880
and see if within this space you can

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.320
accept things

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:06.120
just as they are

00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:11.679
and whenever you're ready

00:23:11.679 --> 00:23:13.600
open up those eyes

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.120
okay so maybe you can get a sense for

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.320
what i was talking about and maybe you

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.720
didn't it's fine either way here's a

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.480
little snippet from the audiobook of the

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.240
untethered soul a journey beyond the

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.640
self this passage in the book really

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.320
really helped me understand the very

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.159
thing that i'm trying to get across here

00:23:28.159 --> 00:23:29.840
so we're going to listen to it

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.760
though being that this is a meditation

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.080
exercise see if you can try to get into

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.000
a meditative mode to absorb this

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.760
information rather than focusing on your

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.960
breath we're gonna you know this will be

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.880
about i think nine or ten minutes

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.960
rather than focusing on your breath

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.640
see if you can direct that awareness you

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.799
are just using to focus on your breath

00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:48.400
and put that awareness on the

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.559
information that is coming at you and if

00:23:50.559 --> 00:23:52.480
you notice yourself getting distracted

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.080
you can pause the video and rewind to

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.000
the last moment you are fully conscious

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.840
and fully aware on the information if

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:58.880
you got to break it up into little

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.200
chunks totally fine again we're

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.120
strengthening the willpower here and at

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.240
the same time we're going to take an

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.000
information that'll just help us do the

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.159
thing that we're trying to do 360 win

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.720
1879 to 1950 a great teacher in the

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.320
yogic tradition

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.200
used to say that to attain inner freedom

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.760
one must continuously and sincerely ask

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.039
the question

00:24:29.039 --> 00:24:30.720
who am i

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.240
he taught that this was more important

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.799
than reading books learning mantras or

00:24:34.799 --> 00:24:36.720
going to holy places

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.919
just ask

00:24:37.919 --> 00:24:39.520
who am i

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.080
who sees when i see

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.559
who hears when i hear

00:24:44.559 --> 00:24:47.200
who knows that i am aware

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.200
who am i

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.679
let's explore this question by playing a

00:24:51.679 --> 00:24:52.799
game

00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:54.240
make believe that you and i are having a

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.679
conversation

00:24:55.679 --> 00:24:57.840
typically in western cultures when

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.919
someone comes up to you and asks

00:24:59.919 --> 00:25:01.760
excuse me who are you

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.760
you don't admonish them for asking such

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.200
a deep question

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.440
you tell them your name for example

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.200
sally smith

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.960
but i'm going to challenge this response

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.400
by taking out a piece of paper and

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:16.799
writing the letters s a l l y

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:18.880
s m i t h

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.799
and then showing it to you

00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:22.960
is that who you are a collection of

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.080
letters

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.400
is that who sees when you see

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.200
obviously not okay you're right i'm

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.039
sorry i'm not sally smith that's just a

00:25:31.039 --> 00:25:33.200
name people call me it's a label

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.760
really i'm frank smith's wife

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.440
no way that's not even politically

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.679
correct nowadays how could you be frank

00:25:39.679 --> 00:25:41.120
smith's wife

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.799
are you saying you didn't exist before

00:25:42.799 --> 00:25:44.559
you met frank and you would cease to

00:25:44.559 --> 00:25:47.120
exist if he died or you got remarried

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.520
frank smith's wife can't be who you are

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.520
again that's just another label the

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.760
result of another situation or event you

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.360
participated in

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.440
but then who are you

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.440
this time you respond

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.000
okay now you have my attention

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.799
my label is sally smith i was born in

00:26:04.799 --> 00:26:07.840
1965 in new york i lived in queens with

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.000
my parents harry and mary jones until i

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.520
was five years old

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.039
then we moved to new jersey and i went

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:14.799
to newark elementary school

00:26:14.799 --> 00:26:16.960
i got all a's in school and in the fifth

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.480
grade i played dorothy in the wizard of

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.360
oz

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.679
i started dating in the ninth grade and

00:26:21.679 --> 00:26:24.320
my first boyfriend was joe then i went

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.760
to rutgers college where i met and

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.520
married frank smith

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.440
that is who i am

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.240
wait a minute that's a fascinating story

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.080
but i didn't ask you what has happened

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.960
to you since you were born i asked you

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.400
who are you

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.760
you've just described all these

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.039
experiences

00:26:41.039 --> 00:26:43.360
but who had these experiences

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.279
wouldn't you still be in there aware of

00:26:45.279 --> 00:26:47.440
your existence even if you had gone to a

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.200
different college

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.679
so you contemplate this and you realize

00:26:51.679 --> 00:26:53.520
that never in your life have you asked

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.279
yourself that question and really meant

00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:56.080
it

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.080
who am i

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.880
that is what ramana maharshi was asking

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.559
so you ponder this more seriously and

00:27:02.559 --> 00:27:04.000
you say

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.640
okay i am the body that is occupying

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.840
this space

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.320
i am five foot six and i weigh 135

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.480
pounds and here i am

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.720
when you were dorothy in the fifth grade

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.120
play you weren't five foot six you were

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.559
four foot six

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:20.960
so which are you are you the four foot

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.120
six person or are you the five foot six

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.399
person

00:27:24.399 --> 00:27:25.679
weren't you in there when you were

00:27:25.679 --> 00:27:28.080
dorothy you told me you were

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.360
aren't you the one who had the

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.279
experience of being dorothy in the fifth

00:27:31.279 --> 00:27:33.120
grade play and is now having the

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.640
experience of trying to answer my

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.919
questions

00:27:35.919 --> 00:27:38.159
isn't this the same you

00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:40.000
perhaps we need to step back for a

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.799
moment to ask some exploratory questions

00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:45.440
before returning to the core question

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.679
when you were 10 years old didn't you

00:27:47.679 --> 00:27:49.360
look in the mirror and see a

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.279
ten-year-old body

00:27:51.279 --> 00:27:53.200
wasn't that the same you that now sees

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.120
an adult body

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.840
what you looked at has changed but what

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.799
about you the one who is looking

00:28:00.799 --> 00:28:03.440
isn't there a continuity of being

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.039
wasn't it the same being that looked in

00:28:05.039 --> 00:28:07.200
the mirror throughout the years

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.640
you have to contemplate this very

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.000
carefully

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.760
here's another question

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.600
when you go to sleep every night do you

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:14.880
dream

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.480
who dreams

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.520
what does it mean to dream you answer

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.520
well it's like a motion picture plays in

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.360
my mind and i watch it

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.880
who watches it

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.080
i do

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.399
the same you who looks in the mirror

00:28:28.399 --> 00:28:30.480
does the same you who is listening to

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.720
these words also look in the mirror and

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.320
watch the dreams

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.159
when you awake you know you saw the

00:28:36.159 --> 00:28:37.039
dream

00:28:37.039 --> 00:28:38.640
there is a continuity of conscious

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.480
awareness of being

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.399
ramana maharshi was just asking some

00:28:42.399 --> 00:28:45.440
very simple questions who sees when you

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.399
see

00:28:46.399 --> 00:28:48.480
who hears when you hear

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.720
who watches the dreams

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.120
who looks at the image in the mirror

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.880
who is it that is having all these

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.440
experiences it's actually pretty easy to

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.200
see that you're not the objects you look

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.320
at it's a classic case of subject object

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.399
it's you the subject that is looking at

00:29:04.399 --> 00:29:05.520
the objects

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.960
so we don't have to go through every

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.799
object in the universe and say that

00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:10.320
object is not you

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.640
we can very easily generalize by saying

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.640
that if you are the one who is looking

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.559
at something and that something is not

00:29:16.559 --> 00:29:17.440
you

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.720
so right away in one fell swoop you know

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.000
what you're not

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.320
you're not the outside world

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.480
you're the one who is inside looking out

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.080
at that world

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.520
that was easy

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.880
now at least we've eliminated the

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.720
countless things outside

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.240
but who are you

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.000
and where are you if you're not outside

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
with all the other things

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.679
you just have to pay attention and

00:29:39.679 --> 00:29:41.679
realize that you would still be in there

00:29:41.679 --> 00:29:43.919
experiencing feelings even if all the

00:29:43.919 --> 00:29:46.320
outside objects disappeared

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.720
imagine how much fear you would feel

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.880
you might also feel frustration and even

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.840
anger

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.000
but who would be feeling these things

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.520
again you say me

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.360
and that's the right answer

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.159
the same me experiences both the outside

00:30:00.159 --> 00:30:03.279
world and the inside emotions don't you

00:30:03.279 --> 00:30:04.559
have times when you're not having

00:30:04.559 --> 00:30:06.480
emotional experiences and instead you

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.480
just feel quiet inside

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.000
you're still in there but you're just

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.320
aware of peaceful quiet

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.399
eventually you will begin to realize

00:30:14.399 --> 00:30:16.559
that the outside world and the flow of

00:30:16.559 --> 00:30:19.120
inner emotions come and go

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.159
but you

00:30:20.159 --> 00:30:22.480
the one who experiences these things

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.320
remain consciously aware of whatever

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.399
passes before you

00:30:26.399 --> 00:30:28.559
but where are you

00:30:28.559 --> 00:30:30.720
maybe we can find you in your thoughts

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.880
rene descartes a great philosopher once

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:33.679
said

00:30:33.679 --> 00:30:36.000
i think therefore i am

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.320
but is that really what's going on

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.799
the dictionary defines the verb to think

00:30:40.799 --> 00:30:42.720
as to form thoughts

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.960
to use the mind to consider ideas and

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.480
make judgments

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.960
the question is who is using the mind to

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.039
form thoughts and then manipulate them

00:30:51.039 --> 00:30:53.279
into ideas and judgments

00:30:53.279 --> 00:30:55.600
does this experience of thoughts exist

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.919
even when thoughts are not present

00:30:57.919 --> 00:30:59.200
fortunately you don't have to think

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.200
about it you are very aware of your

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.880
presence of being your sense of

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.720
existence without the help of your

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.320
thoughts

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.919
thoughts can stop

00:31:07.919 --> 00:31:10.720
and they can also get extremely noisy

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.080
sometimes you have many more thoughts

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.159
than other times you may even tell

00:31:14.159 --> 00:31:17.279
someone my mind is driving me crazy

00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:19.279
ever since he said those things to me i

00:31:19.279 --> 00:31:21.039
can't even sleep

00:31:21.039 --> 00:31:23.279
my mind just won't shut up

00:31:23.279 --> 00:31:25.279
whose mind who is noticing these

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:27.120
thoughts isn't it you

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.279
don't you hear your thoughts inside

00:31:29.279 --> 00:31:31.279
aren't you aware of their existence

00:31:31.279 --> 00:31:33.679
in fact can't you get rid of them

00:31:33.679 --> 00:31:35.360
if you start to have a thought you don't

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.640
like can't you try to make it go away

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.240
people struggle with thoughts all the

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.200
time

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.200
who is it that is aware of the thoughts

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.440
and who is it that struggles with them

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.760
again you have a subject object

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.679
relationship with your thoughts

00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:52.000
you are the subject and thoughts are

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.640
just another object you can be aware of

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.279
you are not your thoughts you are simply

00:31:57.279 --> 00:31:59.279
aware of your thoughts

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:01.519
finally you say

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:02.559
fine

00:32:02.559 --> 00:32:04.640
i'm not anything in the outside world

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.640
and i'm not the emotions

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.559
these outer and inner objects come and

00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:10.559
go and they experience them

00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:12.399
plus i'm not the thoughts

00:32:12.399 --> 00:32:15.600
they can be quiet or noisy happy or sad

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.880
thoughts are just something else i'm

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.320
aware of

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.480
but who am i

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.120
it starts to become a serious question

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.880
who am i

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.559
who is having all these physical

00:32:26.559 --> 00:32:29.360
emotional and mental experiences

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.120
so you contemplate this question a

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.399
little deeper

00:32:32.399 --> 00:32:34.000
this is done by letting go of the

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.960
experiences and noticing who is left

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.720
you will begin to notice who is

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.279
experiencing the experience

00:32:41.279 --> 00:32:42.399
eventually

00:32:42.399 --> 00:32:44.159
you will get to a point within yourself

00:32:44.159 --> 00:32:46.080
where you realize that you the

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:49.600
experiencer have a certain quality

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.240
and that quality is awareness

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.840
consciousness an intuitive sense of

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.080
existence you know that you're in there

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.760
you don't have to think about it you

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.120
just know

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.039
you can think about it if you want to

00:33:03.039 --> 00:33:04.399
but you will know that you're thinking

00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:05.760
about it

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.720
you exist regardless thoughts or no

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.679
thoughts

00:33:09.679 --> 00:33:12.000
let's try another experiment

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.320
let's say you are in a room looking at a

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.640
group of people and a piano

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.559
now make believe the piano ceases to

00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:20.640
exist in your world would you have a

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.320
major problem with that

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.440
you say

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.039
no i don't think so i'm not attached to

00:33:25.039 --> 00:33:26.399
pianos

00:33:26.399 --> 00:33:28.559
okay then make believe the people in the

00:33:28.559 --> 00:33:30.799
room cease to exist are you still okay

00:33:30.799 --> 00:33:32.159
can you handle it

00:33:32.159 --> 00:33:33.279
you say

00:33:33.279 --> 00:33:35.679
sure i like being alone

00:33:35.679 --> 00:33:37.760
now make believe your awareness doesn't

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.799
exist

00:33:38.799 --> 00:33:40.480
just turn it off

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.399
how are you doing now

00:33:42.399 --> 00:33:44.480
what would it be like if your awareness

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.559
didn't exist

00:33:46.559 --> 00:33:48.720
it's actually pretty simple you wouldn't

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.760
be there

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.080
there would be no sense of me there

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.000
wouldn't be anyone in there to say

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.640
wow i used to be in here but now i'm not

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.880
there would no longer be an awareness of

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.080
being

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.240
and without awareness of being or

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.640
consciousness there is nothing

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.360
are there objects who knows

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.359
if no one is aware of the objects their

00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:11.440
existence or non-existence becomes

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.119
completely irrelevant

00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:14.720
it doesn't matter how many things are in

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.399
front of you if you turn off the

00:34:16.399 --> 00:34:18.560
consciousness there is nothing

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.639
if you are conscious however there can

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:22.320
be nothing in front of you but you are

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.399
fully aware that there is nothing

00:34:24.399 --> 00:34:26.639
it's really not that complicated and

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:28.800
it's very enlightening

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.399
so now if i ask you

00:34:30.399 --> 00:34:31.760
who are you

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.359
you answer

00:34:33.359 --> 00:34:35.679
i am the one who sees

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:38.480
from back in here somewhere i look out

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.560
and i am aware of the events thoughts

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.200
and emotions that pass before me

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.119
if you go very deep

00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:47.119
that is where you live

00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:49.919
you live in the seat of consciousness

00:34:49.919 --> 00:34:51.919
a true spiritual being lives there

00:34:51.919 --> 00:34:54.639
without effort and without intent

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:56.800
just as you effortlessly look outside

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.640
and see all that you see

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.960
you will eventually sit far enough back

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.200
inside to see all your thoughts and

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.400
emotions as well as outer form

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.560
all of these objects are in front of you

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.400
the thoughts are closer in

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.720
the emotions are a little further away

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.119
and form is way out there

00:35:15.119 --> 00:35:16.560
behind it all

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.240
there you are

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.560
you go so deep that you realize that's

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:22.560
where you've always been

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.960
at each stage of your life you have seen

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.680
different thoughts emotions and objects

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.359
pass before you

00:35:29.359 --> 00:35:31.359
but you have always been the conscious

00:35:31.359 --> 00:35:34.079
receiver of all that was

00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:35.760
now you are in your center of

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.119
consciousness

00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:40.880
you are behind everything just watching

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.960
that is your true home

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.480
take everything else away and you're

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.760
still there

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.400
aware that everything is gone

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.200
but take the center of awareness away

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.359
and there is nothing

00:35:53.359 --> 00:35:56.160
that center is the seat of self

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.400
from that seat you are aware that there

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.640
are thoughts emotions and a world coming

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.560
in through your senses

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.680
but now you are aware that you're aware

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.160
that is the seat of the buddhist self

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.839
the hindu atman and the judeo-christian

00:36:10.839 --> 00:36:14.560
soul the great mystery begins

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:17.599
once you take that seat deep within

00:36:17.599 --> 00:36:19.200
so meditation is the process of

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.880
continually getting in touch with this

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.119
part of ourselves this aware open

00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:25.440
expansive state and then losing

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.359
connection with it we're getting in

00:36:27.359 --> 00:36:29.040
touch we're in it we're calm we're

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.280
centered and then we drift off into our

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.280
thoughts and feelings and then we come

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.119
back and repeat this over and over and

00:36:35.119 --> 00:36:37.280
over until finally we've cultivated

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.920
enough willpower to just finally be

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.320
mostly based in this space of awareness

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.320
or what they call our larger self our

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.640
big self so this stuff is simple in

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.560
theory but it's very difficult to

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.480
practice and this is why people spazz on

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.880
meditation there i i just can't do it it

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.240
just doesn't work for me i just don't i

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.160
don't feel calm it's just my mind is

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.680
racism whenever i close my eyes and

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:58.960
think of nothing i just kind of like

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.240
freak out and get panicky and blah blah

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.160
blah blah it's a waste of time it feels

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.480
dumb which is very common and it's also

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.640
fine that that happens meditation is a

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.400
practice of just letting go of that

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.000
stuff and doing it anyway that's where

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.839
the willpower comes in if it was easy

00:37:11.839 --> 00:37:13.760
you wouldn't need to be exercising your

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.920
willpower the fact that it's hard is

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.119
telling you

00:37:17.119 --> 00:37:18.480
there's something within you that needs

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.800
to be cultivated to be able to take

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.200
boredom take frustration this is the

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.359
willpower this can steer us through

00:37:25.359 --> 00:37:27.440
these little kind of like short-term

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.960
negative events that kind of stand in

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.880
the way of something that might make our

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.480
experience better in the long run so

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.839
meditation is the practice of just

00:37:33.839 --> 00:37:36.240
letting go of that stuff and meditating

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.400
anyway the mind will continue to protest

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.160
with all of its best most personal

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.079
theories and ideas as to why this is a

00:37:42.079 --> 00:37:44.640
waste of time reminding us of all the

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.560
very important stuff we have to do and

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.480
how this doesn't even work and how

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.480
people like us just don't have time to

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.400
meditate while the average american

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.480
spends about four hours per day watching

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.880
tv while also clocking about three to

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.560
five hours per day of screen time on

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.640
their phone so yeah so you know so much

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.560
for the time crunch argument so the

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.560
whole point is that what you think is

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.359
meditation not working is actually

00:38:07.359 --> 00:38:09.200
meditation working you just don't like

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.200
it it's like if you went to the gym and

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.720
you were lifting weights being like why

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.000
is this so heavy it's like well if it

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.599
wasn't heavy it wouldn't do anything for

00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:17.280
you so when you start to meditate you'll

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.880
probably notice that your awareness gets

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.960
snagged into your thoughts over and over

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.119
almost instantly and again that's good

00:38:23.119 --> 00:38:25.359
the untrained mind is a total willpower

00:38:25.359 --> 00:38:27.200
wimp but if we're constantly shifting

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.359
our focus away from our thoughts and

00:38:29.359 --> 00:38:32.160
back to our boring old awareness we are

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.400
building that will power muscle which

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.480
takes as long if not even longer to

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.480
build as real muscle but the benefits

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.160
are never ending and just to illustrate

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.640
this here's a personal story as to how

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.480
it's helped me it was one situation but

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.680
this is

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.280
kind of what i'm trying to describe and

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.440
this is kind of like some of the direct

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.960
benefits you get

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:51.839
so

00:38:51.839 --> 00:38:53.599
here is the scene so my wife's alarm

00:38:53.599 --> 00:38:55.520
goes off every morning at 5 a.m which

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.280
you know kind of pisses me off

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.280
and both of us before the alarm had gone

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:03.200
off had just been woken up at about 4 45

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.720
by our you know one and a half year old

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.720
daughter who just screamed for whatever

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.960
reason woke us up and then just went

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.119
right back to sleep and i i see the time

00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:12.880
like [ __ ] [ __ ] wife's alarms when i

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.960
go off and i'm i'm starting you know

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.640
my brain just starts churning out as

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.560
usual assessments and judgments of this

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.480
situation which just it just happens

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.800
automatically you know i saw my goddamn

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.720
[ __ ] wife so loud i hate how she

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.839
snoozes her alarm five times

00:39:27.839 --> 00:39:29.520
she's got the light on in the bathroom

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.599
she didn't shut the door all the way oh

00:39:31.599 --> 00:39:33.280
god damn it i'm wide awake and it's

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.520
[ __ ] five o'clock and i'm [ __ ] so

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:38.000
awake today's gonna suck and on and on

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.440
and on i went with all these negative

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.440
appraisals of a situation that just

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.440
sprouted out of me just like grass

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.119
growing out of a hill just

00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:46.720
they all just started coming out of me i

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:48.560
wasn't even trying to have them

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.160
and the reason i was pissed off was

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.200
because

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.520
i was so wide awake at five in the

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:56.320
morning and you know i i decided i was

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.520
like let me just

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.960
check in with myself and this is where

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.960
meditation comes in so i automatically

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.640
all these negative thoughts come up but

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.079
since i had been practicing meditating

00:40:04.079 --> 00:40:05.440
what also happened automatically was

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.520
that i checked in with myself

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.880
i'm feeling negative i'm getting all

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.560
these negative thoughts i'm blaming i'm

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.480
just pissed and it

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.920
again through the practice somehow my

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.359
brain was like

00:40:15.359 --> 00:40:17.200
what's actually occurring so i checked

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.520
in with myself and how i was actually

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.440
feeling aside from all my judgments how

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.040
am i feeling right now and i was

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.480
surprised to learn that i was feeling

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.480
wide awake and actually i was pretty

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.839
refreshed

00:40:27.839 --> 00:40:29.920
which was why i was pissed

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:32.160
i had interpreted my level of being

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:35.040
awake as a negative thing since i have

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.760
this idea of what time i'm supposed to

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.839
get up when in reality

00:40:39.839 --> 00:40:41.920
i was awake and feeling good what caused

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.240
my negative state wasn't how i actually

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.560
felt but how i interpreted how i

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.640
actually felt so i just laid there and i

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.319
meditated on this on how awake and

00:40:50.319 --> 00:40:53.119
refreshed i felt and how if i was tired

00:40:53.119 --> 00:40:54.880
it wouldn't have mattered anyway because

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.200
i'm up the reality of the situation was

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.040
that i was awake and it was up to me to

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.599
decide how to conduct myself then out of

00:41:01.599 --> 00:41:04.000
nowhere weirdly my wife just came and

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.839
like just jumped on me which was a risky

00:41:05.839 --> 00:41:08.160
move on her part since you know i can be

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.359
a serious grump under these

00:41:09.359 --> 00:41:10.720
circumstances

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.800
and my my reaction after i did this

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.480
assessment i kind of like

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.000
checked my thoughts

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.920
saw where i actually was versus my

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.000
appraisal of it my reaction to her

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.359
jumping on me was kind of happy and

00:41:21.359 --> 00:41:23.520
playful versus what i swear to god if i

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.800
hadn't checked in with myself it would

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.079
have been just like

00:41:26.079 --> 00:41:28.319
what are you doing you ruined my sleep

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:29.599
we would have gotten in a fight the

00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:31.440
point being by checking in with how i

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.520
was actually feeling rather than my

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.960
personal interpretation of the

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.119
circumstance i was able to bypass the

00:41:37.119 --> 00:41:39.280
internal pity party and instead just be

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.720
present for the moment that i was

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.040
occupying and by doing that i avoided

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.800
starting the day off for both me and my

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.119
wife on a negative angry foot and maybe

00:41:47.119 --> 00:41:48.560
this doesn't sound like much but these

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.400
are the small but glorious victories of

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.640
meditation of continually being aware of

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.800
that which actually is versus your

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.880
interpretation of it and adjusting your

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.359
behaviors accordingly so meditation this

00:41:59.359 --> 00:42:01.359
practice of just centering ourselves in

00:42:01.359 --> 00:42:03.280
awareness and watching our thoughts it's

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.000
like holding a mirror our awareness up

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.920
to our thinking mind so that it can see

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.560
itself for what it actually is

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.560
it eventually goes oh

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.200
i'm just a thinking mind i'm just an ego

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.440
thank god what a relief

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.880
for a second there i thought i was the

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.960
sole arbiter of matt mccuskers or

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:24.079
whoever's total experience of reality

00:42:24.079 --> 00:42:26.160
turns out i'm just like a scheduler

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.880
think tank that works for the big self

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.200
or awareness though getting our thinking

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.880
minds on board with this takes a minute

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.560
and for good reason naturally anyone

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.000
confront it with their reflection is

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.280
going to have some thoughts about what

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.040
they're seeing and will often try to

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.720
evade the reflection since it can be

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.160
kind of uncomfortable to stare at

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.240
oneself for too long due to the personal

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.839
nature of the thoughts that arise from

00:42:45.839 --> 00:42:48.079
perceiving yourself in such a direct way

00:42:48.079 --> 00:42:50.240
i know that sentence is confusing but

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.760
basically none of us like to look at our

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.599
reflection and it's the same thing

00:42:53.599 --> 00:42:55.359
applies to your thinking mind

00:42:55.359 --> 00:42:57.119
anyone who's ever done mushrooms knows

00:42:57.119 --> 00:42:58.800
exactly what i'm talking about when i

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.480
say catching yourself in the mirror

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.240
while in that state

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.760
is like the worst it's entirely

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.839
uncomfortable and strange but mushrooms

00:43:05.839 --> 00:43:06.800
aside

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.079
go right now and look at yourself in the

00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:09.599
mirror for 10 minutes don't break eye

00:43:09.599 --> 00:43:11.599
contact the overwhelming majority of us

00:43:11.599 --> 00:43:13.119
are going to be like i'm good on that

00:43:13.119 --> 00:43:15.440
why it's just uncomfortable

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.119
it's just so personal there's so many

00:43:17.119 --> 00:43:18.800
things to think about and when you it's

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.160
one thing looking at your face and being

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:22.240
like one [ __ ] face

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.319
do that with the

00:43:24.319 --> 00:43:25.839
very essence of who you're telling

00:43:25.839 --> 00:43:27.520
yourself you are and your sense of

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.680
reality it's like yeah that's a big no

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.359
thanks for me and also some of the

00:43:31.359 --> 00:43:33.119
discomfort of meditation also has to do

00:43:33.119 --> 00:43:35.200
with the silence as well as annoying and

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.119
distracting as our mental chatter can be

00:43:37.119 --> 00:43:38.880
it's kind of weird when it goes away

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.720
kind of like when a party gets quiet all

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:41.760
of a sudden everyone gets all

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.680
uncomfortable and someone usually says

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.520
man it got quiet in here and everyone

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:46.960
just kind of like laughs and resumes

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.720
their chatter hoping to avoid that

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.960
strange eerie silence meditation is

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.640
sitting with that quiet while watching

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.319
the mind resume its internal

00:43:54.319 --> 00:43:56.640
conversation we're watching the gears of

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.720
a clock so to speak rather than reading

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.480
what time it is which is another great

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.160
analogy which is what happens when you

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.920
meditate you start thinking strictly in

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.000
riddles and cool ass analogies but for

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.359
real though think of it like that your

00:44:07.359 --> 00:44:09.040
customized version of reality the way

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.800
you are convinced things are is

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.720
projected out from your thinking mind

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.200
and kind of projected on to that which

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.200
actually is it's like a movie

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.839
playing on the film of another movie and

00:44:19.839 --> 00:44:21.920
again this is insane this isn't to say

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.440
that like everything you think is

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.640
[ __ ]

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.240
but there are inconsistencies and

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.160
recognizing that your mode of thinking

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:30.560
or your map of reality is

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:33.040
probably imperfect in a lot of spots

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:34.560
grants you the space to kind of work and

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.160
develop rather than to just kind of like

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:37.839
withdraw and tighten everything and try

00:44:37.839 --> 00:44:39.359
to like control everything around you so

00:44:39.359 --> 00:44:41.119
that that thing is perceived as right

00:44:41.119 --> 00:44:42.640
think of the way you personally see

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.880
things like the time on a clock someone

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.319
comes up and asks us what time it is and

00:44:46.319 --> 00:44:47.839
we confidently check our watch and say

00:44:47.839 --> 00:44:49.599
well it's 1 pm and i'm certain of that

00:44:49.599 --> 00:44:51.440
because i checked my watch and it told

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.760
me so but maybe the person's like 1 pm

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.920
what are you nuts my watch says it's 2

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.720
30 am at that and you say what

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.640
what the [ __ ] [ __ ] you man no way that's

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.560
the time meditation would be those two

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:04.319
people opening their watches up and

00:45:04.319 --> 00:45:06.720
observing the gears realizing that maybe

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.640
a few would stop spinning or maybe one

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.400
was spinning too fast

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:11.920
and then maybe a third person walks up

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.680
and you say hey man what time is it i'm

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.920
thinking it's 1 pm this guy says it's 2

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:17.760
30. we need you to settle this once and

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.079
for all which one of us is right and the

00:45:20.079 --> 00:45:22.480
third guy just smiles and says dude time

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.319
is merely a construct created by humans

00:45:24.319 --> 00:45:26.000
to make themselves feel in control of

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.839
the heavenly bodies that move about and

00:45:27.839 --> 00:45:29.839
create the phenomenon we experience of

00:45:29.839 --> 00:45:31.760
night and day

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.839
don't you see man

00:45:33.839 --> 00:45:37.280
what you're witnessing is just eternity

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.800
and then the two guys tie him up and

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.680
burn him alive so just to recap the

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.839
mental or cognitive level of meditation

00:45:43.839 --> 00:45:45.520
is the practice of rescuing our

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.680
awareness from the infinite tangle of

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.599
our thinking minds and the way that we

00:45:49.599 --> 00:45:51.280
reclaim our awareness is by

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.359
strengthening our mental willpower to

00:45:53.359 --> 00:45:55.200
resist the onslaught of mental

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.920
temptation and distraction or just

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.079
noticing when it occurs and gently

00:46:00.079 --> 00:46:02.319
guiding us back to awareness back to

00:46:02.319 --> 00:46:04.560
that which just is but like we said

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.160
talking about meditation is only one

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.400
percent of the battle the rest lies in

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.480
practicing it it's an experience not

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.240
just a theory so let's let's do a little

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.079
meditation again only this time when

00:46:14.079 --> 00:46:16.000
thoughts come up or if we hear noises or

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.440
we have feelings

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.920
say to yourself in your mind or out loud

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.079
i am not that just trying to see how

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:23.920
much you can let go of the contents of

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.520
your thinking mind we're going for five

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.800
minutes here and maybe you'll think

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.119
you're quote doing it wrong that thought

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:30.720
requires no adjustment or correction

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.960
from yourself no need to participate in

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.800
it perhaps halfway through you think

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.800
this is pointless dumb or a waste of

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.640
time and fair enough but again for the

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.800
sake of this exercise just see if you

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.800
can observe that thought or feeling as a

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.599
separate entity i am not that it is

00:46:45.599 --> 00:46:47.520
something arising within my field of

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.440
experience that can be noticed and

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.680
observed rather than being participated

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.760
in like we said or maybe you become

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.599
bored for the sake of this exercise try

00:46:55.599 --> 00:46:57.440
to get a sense of what boredom feels

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.680
like rather than trying to quote fix it

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.599
or entertain yourself in some way as to

00:47:01.599 --> 00:47:04.079
not be bored see if you can kind of meet

00:47:04.079 --> 00:47:06.240
your boredom or meet your thoughts or

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.160
judgments just for five minutes you can

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:09.839
always go back to being a miserable

00:47:09.839 --> 00:47:12.000
preoccupied dick when it's over but for

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.920
now just try to watch yourself

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:17.680
experience the contents of your mind

00:47:23.359 --> 00:47:24.880
all right so we're back at the river

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.040
we're meditating again

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.680
before we start keep your eyes open

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.839
and wherever you are pick an object in

00:47:31.839 --> 00:47:34.480
front of you it could be the wall

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.079
it could be a pen on your desk it could

00:47:36.079 --> 00:47:37.200
be a book

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.720
be a coffee cup it doesn't matter what

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.960
it is pick an object

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.640
and just stare at it

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:45.119
look at it

00:47:45.359 --> 00:47:46.720
see if you can get a feel for the

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.880
distinction between yourself

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:51.280
and the very object you're looking at

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:53.119
just like we said we're gonna do look at

00:47:53.119 --> 00:47:54.800
this physical object

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:56.800
and try to feel

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.480
try to know that you are not that

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.359
physical object

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:06.559
now with your eyes closed

00:48:06.559 --> 00:48:08.319
keep breathing

00:48:08.319 --> 00:48:10.800
into the nose out through the mouth

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.760
just like we've been doing

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.839
and when thoughts arise

00:48:15.839 --> 00:48:18.240
the feelings arise

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.960
you hear sounds above you or outside or

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.880
below you

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:25.280
do the same thing with them

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.040
that you did with the physical object

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:30.480
you saw when your eyes were open

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:32.800
whatever pops up

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:35.040
hold it in your awareness

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:38.400
and know that you are not that thing

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.280
you are your awareness

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.960
play around with this for the rest of

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.440
the time

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:49.400
see what you can do

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000
so

00:52:45.359 --> 00:52:47.920
and when you're ready open your eyes

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.400
okay and we're back so nice work just

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:51.920
meditated again and maybe you were

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:53.520
distracted the whole time or itching

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.119
your butt or constantly adjusting your

00:52:55.119 --> 00:52:56.800
posture maybe even you checked your

00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.480
phone or something it doesn't matter you

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:01.040
didn't do it quote wrong or are bad at

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.800
meditating meditating is something you

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:05.520
either do or don't do and at its essence

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.760
in its simplest form as far as i can

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:08.640
tell

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:10.480
all meditation is

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:13.599
is consciously placing your awareness

00:53:13.599 --> 00:53:15.520
on a single point

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:18.319
and using your willpower to keep it on

00:53:18.319 --> 00:53:21.200
that point as long as possible

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.839
while you just watch and pay attention

00:53:23.839 --> 00:53:26.000
to what's going on in your mind that's

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.680
all you do it's very simple you can put

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:28.480
it on

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.000
you can place your awareness on your

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.319
breath you can place your awareness on

00:53:32.319 --> 00:53:34.800
just looking around outside of yourself

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:37.119
you can place the awareness

00:53:37.119 --> 00:53:40.160
on anything you want it doesn't matter

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:42.319
you just have to consciously keep your

00:53:42.319 --> 00:53:44.960
awareness on that singular point but

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:46.720
that's all this is don't over complicate

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.160
it

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:50.000
don't over complicate it that's all this

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.119
is

00:53:51.119 --> 00:53:53.040
take your awareness pick a thing to

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.119
focus it on keep it there as long as

00:53:55.119 --> 00:53:57.839
possible watch what your mind does

00:53:57.839 --> 00:53:59.599
i like to do a little exercise i call it

00:53:59.599 --> 00:54:01.839
in-breath out breath where i take a walk

00:54:01.839 --> 00:54:03.599
i take a long walk

00:54:03.599 --> 00:54:05.920
and all i do i tell myself no headphones

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:10.319
no podcasts no music nothing i walk and

00:54:10.319 --> 00:54:12.800
i just label when i breathe in in my

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:14.880
head i say to myself in breath and when

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:17.280
i breathe out i say to myself out breath

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:19.200
and in the meantime i'm just walking and

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:20.880
looking at stuff that's all i'm doing my

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:23.119
brain is occupied my awareness is

00:54:23.119 --> 00:54:25.040
occupied with you know or my let's say

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:27.599
my mind the mind that could wander

00:54:27.599 --> 00:54:29.760
is occupied by a simple task in breath

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.079
out breath and as i walk

00:54:32.079 --> 00:54:34.160
i just notice how it feels to not have

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:36.079
my mind going in 20 different directions

00:54:36.079 --> 00:54:38.000
and specifically i notice how it feels

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.240
to not be engaged in egoic thought

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.200
patterns

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.400
meaning like

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.559
you let your mind wander naturally it

00:54:44.559 --> 00:54:46.079
starts to just like this is what happens

00:54:46.079 --> 00:54:46.960
to me

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:48.640
it starts to cultivate

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:50.400
little scenarios

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.319
about like stuff i'm gonna get in the

00:54:52.319 --> 00:54:54.720
future good and bad like and then this

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.240
will happen and i'll do this and that

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:57.760
and everyone be pumped on me or do the

00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:59.040
opposite and then this will happen and

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.480
then i'll do this and then everyone be

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:01.520
[ __ ] pissed at me and hit me i'm

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.200
[ __ ] slow going you know and you

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.480
oscillate between those two different

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:06.160
things and you know you get the whole

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:07.680
spectrum of feelings good and bad

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:09.839
between that you know that's not saying

00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:11.680
to get away from that forever

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:14.319
but meditation is learning how to take

00:55:14.319 --> 00:55:16.799
your awareness place it on a singular

00:55:16.799 --> 00:55:17.839
point

00:55:17.839 --> 00:55:19.040
however you want to do that there's a

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.640
ton of different ways but to start it's

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.559
like again your breath

00:55:22.559 --> 00:55:24.000
you can put it on

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.200
something you repeat in your head like a

00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:26.400
mantra you know which we'll talk about

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:29.200
in the spiritual level but again that's

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.960
all it is so don't over complicate this

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:33.040
man that's all you're doing

00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:34.880
and you're just noticing how it feels

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.160
this is what you're starting to wake

00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:37.839
they say waking up to meditation or

00:55:37.839 --> 00:55:39.280
mindfulness

00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:42.720
you can finally begin to contrast

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:45.920
being in like a meditative aware state

00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.359
versus when you know you're doing the

00:55:47.359 --> 00:55:49.520
you know i do the in-breath out breath

00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:51.359
when i'm doing that and all of a sudden

00:55:51.359 --> 00:55:52.799
my mind slips back into that like and

00:55:52.799 --> 00:55:54.319
then i'm gonna do this and then

00:55:54.319 --> 00:55:57.200
everyone's gonna be [ __ ] pumped on me

00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.480
and then i go oh

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.640
i slip back into thought and i real

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:02.480
quick notice how i feel and i'm like you

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:04.160
notice that it's subtle but like your

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.760
body's kind of tensed up you're kind of

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:07.920
on edge and it's like holy [ __ ] i spend

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.680
most of my time like this i just wasn't

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:10.799
aware of it

00:56:10.799 --> 00:56:12.319
and that's why meditation's helpful and

00:56:12.319 --> 00:56:14.319
this is what we're trying to do it's

00:56:14.319 --> 00:56:16.559
going to feel like you suck at it

00:56:16.559 --> 00:56:18.799
i'm not doing this right blah blah blah

00:56:18.799 --> 00:56:20.960
blah that's just all [ __ ]

00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:23.119
all you have to do is continue to try

00:56:23.119 --> 00:56:25.119
continue to keep your awareness on

00:56:25.119 --> 00:56:27.520
whatever you decide to put it on

00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:29.440
notice it slip away and put it right

00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:33.200
back it's so simple it's so

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.200
[ __ ] simple

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.040
but it's hard to do

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:38.799
okay so before we end i'm sorry this is

00:56:38.799 --> 00:56:40.480
a bit of a longer video but before we

00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:42.960
end here's one more brief exercise

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:44.400
you can take out a piece of paper if you

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.760
want you know so you can write stuff

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.440
down or just keep it in your mind

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:49.119
whatever you want to do but think or

00:56:49.119 --> 00:56:50.960
write down two things to say about

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:51.920
yourself

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:54.319
one of them is a very nice complimentary

00:56:54.319 --> 00:56:55.520
thing

00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:56.480
and then

00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:58.319
write something that's negative or

00:56:58.319 --> 00:56:59.920
something you don't like to think about

00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:01.680
or you wouldn't like people saying so

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:03.280
try to use things you actually believe

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:05.440
for the sake of this exercise and again

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:06.640
you can take out a piece of paper to

00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:08.240
write them down if you want to start

00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:09.680
with the positive something like i am

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:11.520
friendly or i am jacked or whatever you

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:13.040
come up with just be as honest as

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:14.799
possible and then take after you write

00:57:14.799 --> 00:57:16.880
it down or think of it take a moment to

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:18.880
really imagine people saying this about

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:20.559
you and then observe how you feel when

00:57:20.559 --> 00:57:22.400
you imagine this thought playing out in

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:23.680
this way or maybe you're just thinking

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:25.520
it about yourself you know whatever

00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:27.200
however it kind of affects you the most

00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:28.720
and just sit there in that feeling

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:30.960
that's you know i'm a good person i am a

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.559
nice person

00:57:32.559 --> 00:57:34.799
i'm so good at rollerblading whatever it

00:57:34.799 --> 00:57:36.640
is just

00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:38.319
feel that positive description about

00:57:38.319 --> 00:57:40.880
yourself and how that feels okay and now

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:42.480
you know take the negative one said to

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:43.920
write that out or think about something

00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:45.760
bad you know perhaps it's like i'm dumb

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:48.000
or shitty or i'm a junkie or

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.160
i have a small weird dick or i'm a dirty

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:51.839
disgusting [ __ ] or something it's the

00:57:51.839 --> 00:57:53.599
same thing write it down or hold it in

00:57:53.599 --> 00:57:55.440
your mind and see what it feels like to

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:57.119
really think this about yourself or

00:57:57.119 --> 00:57:59.839
imagine others saying it about you

00:57:59.839 --> 00:58:01.839
sit in this negative space for a moment

00:58:01.839 --> 00:58:03.760
just observe the experience of being the

00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:05.839
object of negative judgment just for a

00:58:05.839 --> 00:58:08.839
moment

00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:16.000
now take your description statements

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.760
both the good and bad and compare them

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.839
one felt good and the other felt bad or

00:58:19.839 --> 00:58:21.200
perhaps you felt nothing for either who

00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:23.760
knows but now look at both statements

00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:26.160
both negative and positive and cross out

00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:28.400
the descriptions leaving you with just i

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.280
am

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.880
now just like you did with feeling the

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:32.640
descriptions of yourself see if you can

00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:35.760
try to feel the statement i am as well

00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:37.839
imagine scrapping all descriptions all

00:58:37.839 --> 00:58:40.160
judgments and just existing in this i am

00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:43.200
mode like a frog on a lily pad or a dog

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:46.160
lying on a couch this is pure being

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:47.920
pure awareness

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.280
this is one of the major goals of

00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:51.839
meditation entering into this i am mode

00:58:51.839 --> 00:58:53.760
this is awareness when you take away the

00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:55.760
descriptions it's neither good nor bad

00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:57.680
it just is let's sit in this i am mode

00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.359
for two minutes and see what happens to

00:58:59.359 --> 00:59:03.000
close off the video

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.839
if any thoughts or feelings arise just

00:59:09.839 --> 00:59:11.920
imagine just crossing them out

00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:13.839
and entering right back into your i am

00:59:13.839 --> 00:59:15.359
mode

00:59:15.359 --> 00:59:18.319
this is the seat of your consciousness

00:59:18.319 --> 00:59:21.960
this is your awareness

00:59:51.599 --> 00:59:54.599
so

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.359
okay so we covered a couple different

01:01:15.359 --> 01:01:18.160
techniques for getting at this thing

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.000
that we're trying to cultivate that

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.640
we're calling the aware mind the part of

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.119
us that can just watch ourselves think

01:01:25.119 --> 01:01:27.680
watch ourselves react and observe

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:28.960
ourselves

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.720
and this is weird it might seem like

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.400
things are kind of still loose and not

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:36.160
neatly tied up and kind of messy but

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.480
this part of meditation you know the

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.839
mental level whatever you want to call

01:01:39.839 --> 01:01:40.480
it

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.000
it's way different than the physical

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.720
level because the physical level is

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.720
entirely more simple

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.720
it's much easier to slow your heart rate

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:51.760
down than it is to calm your mind

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.599
for the heart rate you just change the

01:01:53.599 --> 01:01:55.119
way you breathe like we did you breathe

01:01:55.119 --> 01:01:57.119
through the diaphragm you space your

01:01:57.119 --> 01:01:58.400
breaths out

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.520
voila your heart slows down

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.720
you know that's one side of it we're

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.000
playing a song on the piano we got our

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.400
left hand going you know really easy

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.920
now we're adding in the right hand and

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.839
it gets a little more complicated but

01:02:09.839 --> 01:02:11.200
the reason

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.760
this idea of cultivating the aware mind

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:16.319
is tricky is because again like we said

01:02:16.319 --> 01:02:18.400
this is in this is an experiential

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:21.280
concept we're trying to go beyond

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.119
our thinking mind

01:02:23.119 --> 01:02:24.559
which when you're thinking mind hears

01:02:24.559 --> 01:02:25.920
that it goes what

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.440
this is [ __ ]

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.119
because it hasn't experienced the thing

01:02:29.119 --> 01:02:31.760
we're trying to cultivate so just know

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:34.160
that again if right now you're like i

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:36.640
don't know if this really works

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.079
if you're watching you're noticing the

01:02:38.079 --> 01:02:39.599
fact that your mind is doing that that's

01:02:39.599 --> 01:02:40.799
all we're trying to do we're trying to

01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:42.480
give ourselves some distance away from

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.480
this thinking mind but

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:46.720
the overwhelming majority of us are so

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.400
intimately connected

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.640
with our thinking mind or ego

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.720
that this information seems like it's

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:54.640
like it does doesn't add up

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.520
and that's again that's that's fine it's

01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.440
not this isn't meant to satisfy you

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.760
intellectually this is meant to give you

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:02.799
a tool

01:03:02.799 --> 01:03:05.200
to watch that thing that resides within

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.680
you our mind that needs to be satisfied

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.039
intellectually

01:03:09.039 --> 01:03:11.839
so it's a weird distinction right we're

01:03:11.839 --> 01:03:14.240
trying to calm the mind you know we need

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.039
to use the mind to calm the mind and if

01:03:17.039 --> 01:03:18.640
we're approaching it from like i need to

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:21.200
fix this now perspective in reality all

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.920
we're doing is just ramping up our mind

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.280
because when we're saying i need to fix

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.440
this now or i'm taking all these steps

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.039
to like i'm gonna meditate i'm gonna be

01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:30.640
so calm i'm going to be blah blah blah

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.640
in reality we're just telling ourselves

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:34.720
there's a problem to be solved and when

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.799
we think there's a problem we're on

01:03:36.799 --> 01:03:38.720
alert so like i'm taking all these steps

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.160
i'm taking all these steps and hey it's

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.079
not working that's because you're

01:03:42.079 --> 01:03:43.599
in a way telling yourself there's

01:03:43.599 --> 01:03:44.960
something that needs to be solved

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.280
whereas the aware mind all we're doing

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.559
is watching

01:03:48.559 --> 01:03:50.160
we're learning how to sit within

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.200
ourselves

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:54.240
and just watch what is and the reason

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.559
i'm really hammering on this idea of the

01:03:56.559 --> 01:03:58.960
wear mind or building awareness

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:02.640
is because by spending time in awareness

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.799
where we're just watching where we're

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:06.559
just noticing

01:04:06.559 --> 01:04:08.720
when we cultivate whatever that is in us

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.640
that allows us to do that

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:12.960
we start to then approach these everyday

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:15.520
matters of life with a sense of poise

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.359
that we didn't have before and if you're

01:04:17.359 --> 01:04:19.039
thinking like poise what do you what

01:04:19.039 --> 01:04:20.319
what poise what are you talking about

01:04:20.319 --> 01:04:21.680
well let me quote from this book the

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:23.520
glorious presence is very good where

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.680
they talk about boys so here's the quote

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.680
poise means that we stop the mental

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:30.000
running about which goes on constantly

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.640
like a panic is your mind like a person

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:34.960
shut in a room which has taken fire

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.559
dashing at this door and that door and

01:04:36.559 --> 01:04:39.039
banging upon them beating upon the walls

01:04:39.039 --> 01:04:40.799
stamping and shouting

01:04:40.799 --> 01:04:42.559
look into this matter

01:04:42.559 --> 01:04:44.640
is there peace of mind so that's it

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:45.920
we're just going to start building

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.520
awareness

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.440
watching ourselves think

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.760
watching the way we feel about things

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.520
and just start to realize

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:56.000
that the way we think now

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.559
is only part of the puzzle

01:04:58.559 --> 01:05:00.240
there are errors in the way we think

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.920
there are errors in the way we perceive

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.559
judgments there are errors in the way we

01:05:04.559 --> 01:05:06.400
perceive ourselves

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.960
and the only way we can realize them

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.599
is if we just quietly and silently

01:05:11.599 --> 01:05:14.640
watch ourselves go about our day

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.520
see you in the next one

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:20.079
we ever just watched

01:05:20.079 --> 01:05:23.720
watch what's happening

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.160
and watch what you are doing by way of

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.760
reaction to it

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:30.400
just watch it happen

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.799
and don't be in a hurry

01:05:32.799 --> 01:05:35.680
to think you know what it is

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.680
in other words people look at the say oh

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:41.039
that's the external world

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:42.559
oh

01:05:42.559 --> 01:05:45.119
how do you know

01:05:45.119 --> 01:05:49.119
you think this is the material world

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.799
well that's somebody's philosophical

01:05:50.799 --> 01:05:52.240
idea

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.559
or maybe you're you think it's spiritual

01:05:54.559 --> 01:05:56.240
that too is somebody's philosophical

01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:00.160
idea this real world is not spiritual

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.319
it is not material

01:06:02.319 --> 01:06:05.839
the real world is simply

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:13.839
so could we look at things in that way

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:19.520
without as it were fixing labels and

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:22.079
names and gradations and judgments on

01:06:22.079 --> 01:06:23.119
everything

01:06:23.119 --> 01:06:26.319
but watch what happens

01:06:26.799 --> 01:06:29.599
watch what we do

01:06:31.359 --> 01:06:33.280
now you see if you do that

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:37.039
you do at least give yourself a chance

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.520
and it may be

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:42.960
that

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:47.440
when you i are in this way freed from

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:49.520
busy bodiness

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:52.880
and being out to improve everything

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:55.440
that your own nature will begin to take

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.760
care of itself

01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.039
because you're not getting in the way of

01:06:59.039 --> 01:07:01.839
yourself all the time
