a lot of chia pudding this weekend

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:16.970
really a lot of chia pudding and I've

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:20.180
been taking like real weird dumps

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.820
what's chia pudding chia-chia seeds are

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.410
like these little seeds and if you let

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:26.510
them sit in water they kind of expand

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:27.920
and become kind of little like chewy

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.930
little balls almost like tapioca okay

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:31.100
but you know they actually have like

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.080
some nutritional content I like tapioca

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.180
what's the tapioca you know bubble tea

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.830
yeah I know what it is but what what is

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.350
just tapioca flour okay so it doesn't

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.350
have nutritional value no not compared

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:43.430
to a chia seed dude

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:48.260
so tapiocas dishonest cuisine would you

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.500
say tapiocas dishonest or null uh let's

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.630
see if you have bubble tea and you put

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.220
something completely devoid of nutrition

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.140
and give someone three bucks for it I

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.910
don't know I'd say it's a bit of it sure

00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:59.600
it's tricky

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.790
I'll say it's tricky cuisine for sure I

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:05.959
don't know about these adjectives but go

00:17:05.959 --> 00:17:10.670
ahead the adjectives I might use but go

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.800
ahead yeah bubble tea no it's pretty

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.560
good it's just tea with tapioca balls so

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.480
you just suck the tea up in a huge ball

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.980
flies up in your mouth and you just chew

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.540
it it's like a flavorless gummy bear oh

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.689
nice it's like gnocchi you know mochi

00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:24.949

00:30:42.929 --> 00:30:44.880
spilled over so I grabbed an empty water

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.860

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:31.530
thing with tor sirs is they're a lot

out of the equation and you know what

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:17.609
the one of the stranger aspects of this

00:43:17.609 --> 00:43:19.410
is like they make kids sighs sex though

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:27.150

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:38.550
that's tough debate I don't know you

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:39.780
should let the boys have those

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:41.099

00:46:07.229 --> 00:46:09.719
fill inside the serum and yes a serum if

00:46:09.719 --> 00:46:11.279

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:28.040
little fool me for like 10 minutes I

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.770
usually like the third or fourth row

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:33.660
my house sucks yeah probably factory

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:34.950
workers feel when they see like

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:36.330
everything automated that they used to

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:39.240
do see this these farmers putting

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.800
together like a like a Cadillac or

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.780

tell ya there that's probably the demand

00:46:49.859 --> 00:46:51.420
thing that's probably like a regulation

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:54.180
or true right yeah I also would imagine

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.800
they're not marketing them as little

00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:00.150

is ever risky that's what I'm saying is

00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:07.090
like now open the closet for any kid to

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:08.980

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:16.300
crossroads right there yes that's a new

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:18.010
comic they have a name yet that's a

00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:20.410
complex for you know row your kid might

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:22.119

00:50:22.119 --> 00:50:28.030
[ __ ] your kid might [ __ ] your torso your

00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:31.180

it

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:41.680
your boy doesn't [ __ ] that thing he's

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:43.180
not a [ __ ] age yeah he's got another

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:45.580
two years all right I think before

00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:46.990
that's one that's when you're at the

00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:48.430
potential for the most disturbing [ __ ]

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:49.210
the heavily

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:51.520
yeah like when you're not expecting it

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:53.290
that's when because like right now like

00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:55.780
our boys taking a lot of showers lately

00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:58.660
but he's too young so like now I'm like

00:50:58.660 --> 00:50:59.619

as soon as I figured out how how the

00:51:37.839 --> 00:51:40.059
pieces work that's all I was doing what

00:51:40.059 --> 00:51:43.480
age probably 11 and then I remember I

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:44.589
had it would take like an hour long

00:51:44.589 --> 00:51:46.300
shower after school every day and I came

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:48.010

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.150

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:15.900
he's like you know I think you're

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:17.009

01:00:17.009 --> 01:00:19.200
like my stomach just sank because I knew

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.609

01:00:20.609 --> 01:00:22.470

01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:23.940
kept making the motion with his hands on

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:26.190
the steering wheel of his thumb at his

01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:28.710
forefinger making a circle and his index

01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:30.509
finger going in and out of the circle

01:00:30.509 --> 01:00:32.519
and it's just like all right this is I'm

01:00:32.519 --> 01:00:34.289

found a stack and I ran back home and I

01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:56.069
went my clouds with a flashlight and the

01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:57.569
first time I ever saw what a [ __ ] look

01:03:57.569 --> 01:03:59.369
like up close it was like I felt like

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:01.109
Nicolas Cage and national treasures like

01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:03.299

01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:07.740
for me having this document we didn't

01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:09.180
live near any woods cuz we lived in

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:11.160
Kensington and there was this time where

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.530
we found a bunch of like discarded the

01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:17.130
VHS cases on these abandoned trolley

01:04:17.130 --> 01:04:20.430
tracks leading into an abandoned Factory

01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:22.680
and now it feels like it was gumdrop

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:24.390
like it was a trail we're supposed to

01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:26.040
follow but mostly we just stood there

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.450
and like no one wanted to touch them

01:04:27.450 --> 01:04:28.770
because obviously they had come on them

01:04:28.770 --> 01:04:32.820
yeah but we're all like I can I can look

01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:34.650

her place and we didn't have sex or

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.620
anything like that but um we were

01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:37.140

01:07:42.930 --> 01:07:44.190
the embarrassment that they should feel

01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:46.470
well I have that association with

01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:48.600
Titanic now anytime it comes on I

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:49.920

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:52.290
what she did she did the dance yeah well

01:07:52.290 --> 01:07:53.840
she was white and like these dances were

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.280
obviously designed for you know Puerto

01:07:56.280 --> 01:08:01.110
Rican her black girls okay it was a lot

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:05.270
of the running man and like so actually

01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:07.590
it was the running man and I remember

01:08:07.590 --> 01:08:09.750
like the head swirl so that your hair

01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:12.240
flips around and then like pulling like

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:13.980
on an imaginary thing to pull yourself

01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:17.880
toward it yeah and she did that for you

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.800
in front of you yeah she auditioned for

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.830
the ego's though it's pretty hot yeah

01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:25.350
like the open tryouts yeah she was

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:30.299
Apollo did you fog

01:08:30.299 --> 01:08:32.099
and I didn't get anything from her oh

01:08:32.099 --> 01:08:34.199
really you just wants to do that then

01:08:34.199 --> 01:08:35.969
we'll do like how hard did you clap for

01:08:35.969 --> 01:08:38.279
the audition I just stood there frozen

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:40.020

01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:47.849

01:08:47.849 --> 01:08:49.739
any interaction with women like I was a

01:08:49.739 --> 01:08:50.639
real late bloomer

01:08:50.639 --> 01:08:52.559
and honestly like I started to develop

01:08:52.559 --> 01:08:54.389
strong feelings for her and my feelings

01:08:54.389 --> 01:08:55.650
were so strong that like I didn't know

01:08:55.650 --> 01:08:57.029
how to deal with it so then I joined the

01:08:57.029 --> 01:08:58.889

01:09:42.719 --> 01:09:43.889

week later but like that it was like

01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:31.320
cool to be a big drop in 99 it was cool

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.400
to be able to get like a week break

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.020
before I actually had to go because you

01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:37.050
got too much [ __ ] to go yeah it was

01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:38.699
like actually on my paperwork it's like

01:11:38.699 --> 01:11:41.429

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:52.620
yeah in a roundabout way but then like

01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:54.210
of course I had to [ __ ] creep it up I

01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:56.010
ended up dropping her off at like 6:00

01:11:56.010 --> 01:11:57.870
in the morning and then like I remember

01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:59.160

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.719
she was selling t-shirts as a fundraiser

01:12:00.719 --> 01:12:04.620
for school and at 7 a.m. it made sense

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:06.510
my mind like I got to go back and see if

01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:08.880

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.050
pounding on her parents through it like

01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:12.030

01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:08.739
front of the family at their funeral or

01:13:08.739 --> 01:13:09.850

01:13:09.850 --> 01:13:11.830
one last time I get emotional well I

01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:12.880
