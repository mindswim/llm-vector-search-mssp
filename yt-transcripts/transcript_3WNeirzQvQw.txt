00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.539
sinus infections for years and I just

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.760

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.969
I don't get those yeah and then like

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.770
yeah Brittany convinced me to start

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.180
taking Sarah Tech and I'd never have

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.800
that problem seemed to get worse every

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.039
year

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.290
yeah they seemed yeah what's this planet

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.000
trying to buck us off as planes trying

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.890
to stop us we're [ __ ] fleas it's

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.409
pretty [ __ ] gay you think so yeah

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.020
or you were ready for a space station um

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.840
I live very yeah I could live in a space

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.340
station pretty is it it's skipping

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.860
[ __ ] you know nicer Claudia do you

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.630
just float in the vacuum have you

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.340
awesome yeah I've been watching the 100

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.570
yeah you got a lot of problems though

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.770
when you live in a space station you got

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.710
to deal with them their quality

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.130
radiation yeah and then like you know

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.259
space justice is pretty wild yeah they

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.759
just let you out into the [ __ ] abyss

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.189
really you walk the plank sort of they

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.479
put you in a chamber and then they shut

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.250
the pressure lock doors and they open it

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.960
up and you go flying yeah so exactly

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.880
like walking look like that yeah exactly

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.619
exactly like walking flag but they do

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.350
they do uh you know it's weird - I was

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.670
talking to my friend you know how many

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.049
people like believe that like if you get

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.430
a tiny hole in an airplane like it

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.869
automatically like sucks everyone out

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.850
and everyone dies yeah someone was

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.869
saying that to me the other day time out

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.040
air marshals like yeah you can shoot

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.780
someone if you missed everyone dies it's

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.420
like pretty sure a plane could sustain

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.420
like a bullet-sized hole there's like a

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.340
lot of people around if there's a tiny

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.110
hole everyone like everyone just gets

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.260
like sucked out

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.330
yeah only becomes a Gravitron it's like

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.250
in movies yeah I don't know if everyone

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.799
just goes I was just watching the gray

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.709
you remember that listen when he fights

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.250
all those wolves it's [ __ ] sick

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.390
I bet sound Liam Neeson's like he works

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.730
at this oil this oil drilling thing in

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.040
Alaska yeah and he his job is to like

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.989
keep Wolves away and like predators and

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.629
stuff he's like a sniper and then on

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.569
their flight back to the Continental

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.540
he's a wolf in lower 48 yeah he's a wolf

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.410
sniper the plane crashes and then the

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.940
survivors have to try to get out but

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.760
they land in a pack of wolves hunts them

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.760
the entire time here though Neeson

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.609
survives the he's gone-gone gun breaks

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.129
out as soon as the crash yeah otherwise

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.250
it'd be a pretty quick movie so we hear

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.799
there's dumb wolves like kill these so

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:06.940
what do they do they did run from the

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.260
Wolves oh they run from the Wolves and

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.590
the Wolves kill all of them except

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.340
Neeson now spoiler yeah everyone dies

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.840
it's pretty [ __ ] sick that's pretty

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.370
cool the way Neeson dies is [ __ ] sick

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.590
- it was [ __ ] the airplane bottles

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.989
and he makes like claws out he breaks

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.609
them and makes like claws out of them

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.299
and fights the Alpha is big out that's a

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.160
yes movies that you want a spoiler that

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.870
I'll watch that yeah just to get I could

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.459
read the script to stick around after

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.290
the credits a little Marvel action but

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.329
what was funny is it reminds me the

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:41.980
reason to remind me that both the plane

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.209
crash and the wolves

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.459
I don't think wolves have ever killed

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.340
people y'all think huh I think I read

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.169
that both never kills him I don't think

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.200
wolves attack people that are alive

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.019
really yeah like ever I would make sense

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.430
cuz they'd be kind of slowly became our

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.690
friends like wolves would just circle

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.769
the perimeter and we would leave them a

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.120
little bits of food and they slowly got

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.030
the message you google that [ __ ] it

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.799
someone's got to do someone's got have

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.379
died by hands of the wolf I I don't know

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.750
I mean yeah there's no reason that yeah

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.430
I can see that I mean here I'm in every

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.829
[ __ ] myth it's like the problem like

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.709
the big bad wolf and like Saint Francis

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.989
with the wolf what is it's a [ __ ]

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.120
there was a hole for Terra as a village

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.860
what'd he do when he went up and [ __ ]

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:24.220
was

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.630
boys with it and said everybody in this

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.160
village better be nice to this [ __ ]

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.380
wolf even they were all friends he

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.550
probably crunched the numbers he's like

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.930
googled it was like you know I don't

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.250
think anyone's ever been killed by a

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.260
wolf

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.060
that's a bold set that's a [ __ ] I'm

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.730
taking a shot on set now let it be one

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.440
day I bet wolves have killed kids that

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.270
have been left around yeah I bet they've

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.980
killed well there's that there's people

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.780
they've definitely hurt like no no I'm

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.920
saying killed someone that's like

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.310
wounded in the a stranded yeah but I

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.480
don't think they killed people

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.730
there was a run man I don't think they

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.140
would yeah but then again they attack

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.670
like [ __ ] what was that planet Earth

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.480
with the cities and they had like

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.310
Jaguars in India no no you see the other

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.320
one where they threw the like African

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.940
village would throw the bones outside

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.770
and let like the hyenas come yeah

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.300
there's like a pack they made with them

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.830
like will throw you bones and the hyenas

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.450
became friends oh yeah it's pretty much

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.850
yeah definitely [ __ ] lives

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.169
and that'd be a whole that's why they're

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.970
not allowed in the the aligned Kingdom

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.400
true that's why they have to sit on the

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.380
edges of the Lion King - yeah that's

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.790
pretty that's based on their stay in the

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:31.240
bones

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.770
yeah that's based on fact and stay on

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.380
the bus a bad line this is my tea like

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.810

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.540
preacher I did I tried it I try to use

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.910
our collective powers to do magic and I

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.220
mean that's what prayer is the prayer is

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.590
magic exactly but yeah she didn't like

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.260
when I when I used her religious powers

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.360
to Nissen turns on God pretty hard and

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.560
does really yeah he's like where the

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.200
[ __ ] are you dude rightfully so even his

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.130
boys know that's so crazy crazy to think

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:55.430
like I mean it's crazy you're like call

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.200
upon God to save you from wolves it's

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.290
like dude yeah they're saying like thank

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.030
you yeah thanks yeah the wolves are

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.530
praying they're holding stuck in this

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.660
[ __ ] mountain you just delivered us a

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.320
hundred dudes this is manna from heaven

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.570
yeah it's a I've been reading about that

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.850
a lot how they're talking about how like

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.370
religious energy never goes away so it's

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.810
like since like God people would like

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.090
medieval times like if I were trying to

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.680
like turn my tartar sauce in a [ __ ]

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.600
lemon aioli I could have been like tar

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.950
and feathers I've tarred and feathered

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.510
people didn't like that they don't like

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.070
that so like that energy that serious

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.140
energy people in religion the arguments

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.880
that it never went away so like you know

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.380
the gods people stopped believing in

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.790
that but then that energy goes somewhere

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:36.410
else and the thing people have to think

00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:37.640
about is where they're actually putting

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.200
them oh wow their energy into hmm yeah

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.980
pretty wild stuff to think about some of

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.060
the theories are just like it just

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.620
wanted to like health and like the idea

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.350
of like disease when like they did

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.030
like a demon we have like diseases that

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.280
plague us yeah that stuff pretty neat

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.500
Wow yeah you learned a lot about

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.040
medieval stuff yeah dude I love medieval

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.630
stuff but this was really i usually i

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.760
used medieval stuff as my reference

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.070
point yeah because i like pin down

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.260
medieval thought I have a phenomenal

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.820
understanding of medieval thought of

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.560
course and I compared to modern-day

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.750
thought and dude weird too still we're

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.220
still in our little cocoon dated people

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.050
people start trying to think like we're

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.240
[ __ ] poor out of it we figured it all

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.980
out all I can do is s mhm dude I'm

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:25.950

were like alright we fixed it but then

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.810
because of all the surgeries like some

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.900

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.720
weird I mean it's like maybe he's in

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.770
just a weird

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.120
obviously he's in a weird head space

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.000
yeah like first off while someone's

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.560
dying like that to go online and post

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.470
about it interesting I mean you're just

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:24.970
looking for something I don't think

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:26.200
you're making it about yourself I think

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.900
at that point you're just like anything

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.090
I give me some sympathy right this is a

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.220
sinister sinister with that I'll end it

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:41.010
with FML yes I almost responded smdh I

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.260
remember when my pop-pop died I remember

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.200
there was a very very sinister part of

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.910
me that was like oh I get to post this

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:52.870
online now yeah dude I pop up in 24 year

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.810
old fiancee I knew you've watched

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.300
struggle through like I hey dude there's

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.510
no veg

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.850
of state yes oh yeah he was at the

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.230
hospital when he wrote that probably

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.860
yeah I mean what a horrific you know

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.170
this person really well no not really so

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:10.610
you never know I'm like you know my

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.440
thing is it's like back to be that as it

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.190
may

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.710
there's always a little part in somebody

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.300
like you were fantasize about like your

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.020
parents dying

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:25.580
oh yeah exactly it's like you definitely

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.470
at some point there's some part of that

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.750
guy that was probably like you know I

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.460
can't speak for him but I don't know I

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.650
bet at that point like where he was at

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:36.890
was like um he definitely check to see

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:40.000
how many likes you got on that status

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.890
i'ma say that's the sick and twisted

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:44.510
[ __ ] that's the second twisted

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.580
reality right now that's [ __ ] up it's

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.790
super [ __ ] FML dude f no [ __ ] FML

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.740
threw me off I read the whole thing and

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.140
I was like Jesus Christ this is sad like

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.270
[ __ ] I'm feel bad for you dude see

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:58.340
you're basically like f HL and yeah and

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.440
then at the end I was like oh [ __ ]

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:06.310
H [ __ ] dude yeah that's so [ __ ] weird

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.780
B and you don't even get me started on

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.940
social media bro I believe in acronyms

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.220
is that was cold I think so yeah just

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.660
tossing in one of those at the end of

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.200
like a horrific story yeah I mean and

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.740
also yml what about HL do you what about

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.770
her life that's f HL like you were

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.990
saying that's f a gel and to throw it in

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.090
it's like FML it's a little digital

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.010
Freudian slip to show the true intention

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.540
possibly I don't want to speak here

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.340
you're sorry sorry no it's okay sorry I

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.570
don't speak I didn't bring it up to

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.070
crush him I brought it up cuz it was

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.460
just a funny thing to like he it is odd

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.740
it's odd to end it with that and it is

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.210
another situation it's definitely a

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:45.710
shame know what I've been doing that's

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:47.360
weird I realized what's a I had a

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.740
meeting yesterday that's my supervisor

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.100
dude I had the most paranoid fantasy if

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.350
like I'm being exploited this is

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:56.270
ridiculous this whole place is as evil

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.610
like money-grubbing like yeah you know

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:00.710
which I think things can be done

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.180
differently but dude this was in my head

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.130
as fact and like finally yesterday at

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:05.270
least sit down with her me I don't like

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.890
have a meeting and I was like I'm gonna

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:08.210
tell her everything as soon as I sat

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:09.920
down in front of her like 50% of it just

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.510
burn away is like oh wait that was just

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:12.920
a paranoid delusion

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.660
I have no proof of any of this anyway

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.519
all [ __ ] then like it was just so funny

00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:18.019
how until you sit down and talk to

00:13:18.019 --> 00:13:19.550
someone you can spin up the most like

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.800
insane version of what you think they're

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.570
up to until you sit down you're like oh

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.880
god I have nothing to [ __ ] do any of

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.410
this on other than me being a paranoid

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:32.149
freak I think I feel like when I was

00:13:32.149 --> 00:13:34.070
younger I didn't give a [ __ ] yeah I

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.380
didn't think about anything like that

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.269
now I'm just like they're [ __ ] trying

00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:40.670
to [ __ ] me over there against me it's

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.649
like no one's against it dude here's the

00:13:42.649 --> 00:13:44.209
whole thing it's like I signed up to

00:13:44.209 --> 00:13:45.740
that thinking that I'd be able to like

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.420
after like you know I did my thing and

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:48.889
get people housing I'd be able to go

00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:50.360
visit them like once a month and

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.800
continue like work with them and doing

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.180
stuff that's what I wanted to do yeah

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.949
and then I just she was like well here

00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:56.300
we'll take over that and you just keep

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:57.889
you know doing the paperwork which I

00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:59.120
still think there's an element to where

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.860
like I'm giving like the [ __ ] end of the

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.240
steak like you know that's undeniable

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.370
but as soon as I was like yeah I kind of

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:05.570
want to drive and she's like oh why did

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:06.620
assume people didn't want to put miles

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.389
on their car and I was like oh yeah

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:10.100
that's kind of a little sense most

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.449
people probably would worry about that

00:14:11.449 --> 00:14:14.990
yeah and I was like [ __ ] I said so many

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:22.339
bad things about you yeah but um but yes

00:14:22.339 --> 00:14:23.690
that was weird yesterday I was like god

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:25.339
I probably do that like so much it was

00:14:25.339 --> 00:14:26.720
so many different people that if I just

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.070
don't talk to them for a while I'm like

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:29.240
what are they up to I'm like probably

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:35.300
being a [ __ ] ass everything like

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:38.209
they're even thinking about you well

00:14:38.209 --> 00:14:40.610
this is clearly out like this collusion

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:41.959
dude everybody's colluded but the worst

00:14:41.959 --> 00:14:43.399
part is so many people think like this

00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:44.630
as soon as I bring this up in class

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.190
you're like yeah and I'm like yes I knew

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.209
I was right perfect

00:14:47.209 --> 00:14:49.910
yeah dude it's [ __ ] I've been reading

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.589
about all this stuff with like the

00:14:51.589 --> 00:14:55.220
shadow and projection and it's like it's

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.310
bad dude it's what most most people once

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.079
you really start at a lot of people

00:15:00.079 --> 00:15:01.550
aren't really psychologically minded to

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:02.899
where like they think about how they're

00:15:02.899 --> 00:15:04.579
thinking and once you start opening that

00:15:04.579 --> 00:15:07.010
can of worms it's like dude we're like a

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.360
[ __ ] bunch of balloons floating

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.889
around it was like not much rhyme or

00:15:09.889 --> 00:15:11.720
reason going on with us it's [ __ ]

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.019
scary it is pretty terrifying dude yeah

00:15:15.019 --> 00:15:16.490
I was thinking about that and I was like

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.260
jesus [ __ ] christ

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.510
yeah like did that dude I started

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.760
getting real into uh like the book I'm

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.070
reading is basically that's fun

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.590
fantastic yeah it's insane I did this

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.350
book it's all about like how to like not

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:32.690
just ruin your life off like projecting

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:33.980
all your weird [ __ ] on to other people

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.450
and like I figure that's where I'm at

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:36.920
right now it's where everyone is stood

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.150
until you start thinking about it and

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.880
then the what the [ __ ] are they talking

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.760
about you're somewhat like projecting

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.560
your thing on other people and also how

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.540
people just kind of huddle around these

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.460
weird institutions like Catholic Church

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.470
namely other ones too and the most no

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.060
I'm just saying don't be like because

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.990
you huddle around your university the

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.360
same [ __ ] thing dude or they just get

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.280
into these weird ideals and it's like no

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.230
one gets anything really out of it no

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:04.760
one gets anything that serious out but

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.380
for the most part and you just kind of

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.300
show up and it's just like it's a it's a

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.670
it's a idolatry that's what ideology is

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:12.290
one it's a false idol there's no real

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.870
energy so that I went and saw the the

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.340
author speak with the spud man not too

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.080
long ago actually is pretty sick and the

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.910
guy just a spud man the guy likened it

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:21.860
to like a light bulb he was like if you

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.660
just a light bulb itself if you sat

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.520
there and were like thank God for this

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.230
light bulb it's the energy inside of the

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:28.220
light bulb and he was saying with

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.680
religion that energy transfers to other

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.180
things and it's all about like finding

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.350
out where that is for you do you have

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:35.270
like your energy center so if you go

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.070
against your energy center we when

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:38.240
you're younger you construct a false

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.430
self to please your like authority

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.230
figures and if you never shake that off

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.760
you just go towards things that you

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.350
don't care about your entire life and

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:46.310
that's where like a lot of like

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:47.900
depression and anxiety comes from yeah

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.580
and then you get that and then your

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:50.780
doctor is like here take these pills and

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.070
we'll go away so then you're able to

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.960
continue your false self and like walk

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.210
around and intoxicated in this life at

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:58.070
like you don't really want to be in so

00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.390
you get anxiety and depression that's

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:00.770
your body it's your subconscious being

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:14.480
like dude oh god I drove you yeah it

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.100
gets [ __ ] worse dude and then the

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:17.630
only thing you well this is not the only

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.130
thing but what people what he urges

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.709
people to do is find your energy centers

00:17:21.709 --> 00:17:23.329
which I think I figured out how to find

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:25.550
yeah so you have to if you get again I'm

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:27.140
sorry that all my theories kind of come

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.330
down to this you can get really stoned

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:30.230
to the point where you're kind of

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:31.820
bugging out and then start doing

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.650
activities and whenever you can get

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:35.870
stoned now yes you gotta get [ __ ] out

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.490
you know you're on the right path you

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:37.830
know what

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:39.360
you got to do I'm saying for someone who

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.720
feels if they don't let it alive to do

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.519
its continued stuff but that's what I

00:17:44.519 --> 00:17:45.960
was like you just sit down and do the

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.850
things that you like to do and if you're

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:49.230
bugging out while you're stoned that

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.760
paranoid feeling goes away because

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.010
you're in your energy center okay if you

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.240
guess why have you get really high and

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.220
go to your job but you're just like [ __ ]

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.110
all thought but if you're if you really

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.100
really like your job and feel

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.630
comfortable there you can be stun at

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.750
your job I'm [ __ ] proof dude I don't

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:07.649
know cuz I've had and I love stamps real

00:18:07.649 --> 00:18:09.090
[ __ ] doing stand-up on your highest

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.130
misery and I can't be high that's true

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:11.490
okay

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.860
my theory definitely has sunk my theory

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.500
I'm sorry my theory I'm sorry no you

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.850
partially so I could get one you can

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:22.500
find hobbies that don't get high and

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.090
find your life's calling most yet cuz

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:25.860
then my life's calling would have to be

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.850
me being a totally alone if I'm getting

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:35.429
stoned as [ __ ] could be a hermit no

00:18:35.429 --> 00:18:36.960
that's a bad as a bad theory I'm glad

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:44.399
you shot that down I'm sorry that's how

00:18:44.399 --> 00:18:46.760
I roll do not Alex Mac dude I'm a wolf

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.370
liquid that's how I am but that was a

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.320
I'm glad you shot that down but this guy

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.000
who's I guess obviously much more

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.590
qualified to talk about these things he

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.260
his whole thing is that like so you do

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.360
go into these like false versions of

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.769
yourself to please other people when

00:19:01.769 --> 00:19:03.450
you're like when it starts coming down

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:05.159
on you people have these weird crises or

00:19:05.159 --> 00:19:06.210
they're like super depressed super

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.500
anxious and they don't know why and it's

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.149
usually if they like look at themselves

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:10.830
or just living a life they don't want to

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.840
live yeah but you know I was basic

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.850
enough but he was saying but you have to

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:16.559
go on starting off it's like you got to

00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:18.240
start like being real honest with

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.919
yourself and really start paying

00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:21.570
attention to your dreams because that's

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:22.980
like at the end of the day you have a

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.630
mechanism inside of yourself that's

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:26.460
trying to talk to you yeah through your

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.760
dreams we're starting dreams yeah dude

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.590
it's the subconscious this is Jungian

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:34.169
stuff dreams are gay do you say that

00:19:34.169 --> 00:19:36.809
dumb sisters ball you say marrying books

00:19:36.809 --> 00:19:39.269
when I was a young when I was a young

00:19:39.269 --> 00:19:42.590
warthog dude and I knew there

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.300
well that's that's their ebooks yes

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:49.200
you're getting endings in astrology

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.630
Darrell oh man no no no James Hollis

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:55.750
talks about this jigsaws a bit [ __ ]

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.730
Jimmy Hollis Jimmy Hollis is the [ __ ]

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:59.620
man dude so he basically says that's

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.720
like that New Age stuff yeah it's just

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.520
it's negative or just kind of you know

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.920
it's only you can decipher your dream so

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.410
you'd have to do dude I see Smokey the

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:10.510
Bear think yes dude think about this

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:13.090
thinking this is this is some real weird

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.880
[ __ ] but so what I've been trying to

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.050
figure out about myself is my

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.690
relationship pattern right so it's

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:23.170
historically been I just kind of linked

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:24.460
up and it dude and this is the weird

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.190
part I don't know if this but base I

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:30.430
have a subtype that I that I like get

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.140
linked into we're like I dated you know

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.120
your trick will be attractive should be

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.070
you know as pretty as they come the

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:37.810
fairest chicken off the land the fairest

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:39.730
the fairest in the land and it was

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:41.710
usually not fair think who all had there

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.330
had been in the past but I'm talking

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:45.310
about like us in fair woods - I'm super

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.290
fair ones bro I didn't know it but it

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.400
would like fall around you I mean

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.790
College damn decade ago yeah I popped in

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.350
I popped in on team like super

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:57.910
light-skinned a couple times in between

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:00.270
dating and stuff

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:02.830
great they're not really that yeah yeah

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:07.330
but my thing is I've gotten a subtype of

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:09.460
like I don't want to say emotionally

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:12.820
crippled women but like high-maintenance

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.790
babes dude and that's been my [ __ ]

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.520
that's so far and it's like even with a

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.230
physical attraction my body somehow

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:23.290
other so you think oh that all of them

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:30.120
are emotionally I'm talking like we are

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.290
know but I'm talking ones that knee like

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.420
knee like high maintenance super high

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.760
maintenance almost like you know and

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.900
this isn't you know this isn't like a

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.460
broad stroke across-the-board broad

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.650
stroke it's a broad stroke to it but I'm

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:45.190
talking like like like like a perverse

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:47.710
need for a caregiving that links up with

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.240
a perverse need for attention and care

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.550
care receiving okay that makes sense

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.320
yeah sometimes a lot of times is the

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.410
other way and the girls are more

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.150
the caregivers traditionally yeah in a

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:57.350
relationship or the like what's matter

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.030
and they're like drawn to like these

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.550
broken [ __ ] warriors dude yeah leave

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:02.330
me alone

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:04.700
instead my animal is dabbed with like a

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.690
wet cloth exactly sure yeah I'm somehow

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:11.000
inhabitants over here dude so last night

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.070
I have a dream this is [ __ ] up dude

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.790
this I'm just watching do actually is

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:18.260
yeah there's a initial part of it that's

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.690
not important the second part was I was

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.220
sitting there and there was a guy he was

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.560

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.820
it's like going to town on it and

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.210
they're resolved Nuggets there was there

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.010
was three babes in the tall grass and

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:51.080
the one came with a knife and just slid

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.700
him down the back and I just sat in the

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.250
shadows I was like yes yes yes and then

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.380
I had it was [ __ ] up dude and then it

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.870
morphed into like me on a like a scag a

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:02.270
lawnmower 61 inch deck and I was trying

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:03.770

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:07.940
that's when I went back to that was dude

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.170
up my dreams were all over the place and

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:10.700
then I go back to this dreaming about

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:14.090
landscaping so I did my thing so this is

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:15.470
my second was that's the first part of

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.000
my dream my second or that was really

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.410
wait wait so you were landscaping when

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:20.150
you witnessed this nugget no I was just

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.070
I was just in the shadows and then it

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:23.540
was like really hot toward ever cut -

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.430

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.420
behind yeah I love you know I'm talking

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:39.770
about zero turn so I had so I'm riding

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:41.600
that onto a trailer and I'm like I knew

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.900
this trailer belongs in experts huh did

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.130
you hit the primer on the own kind of

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:47.570
right there do you make you bag the

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.330
front okay you know there's no bag for

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:53.020
this guy Skaggs two days before your dad

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:56.130
get off the couch and come along

00:23:56.130 --> 00:24:00.670
I'm going dude boy hey my dad used to

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.220
inspect I used to leave a patch behind

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.410
the sand mound undone every single time

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:07.660
and every I'd be like maybe he won't

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.190
notice in every single time it'll be

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:12.250
like 6:30 p.m. on summer I just get out

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:13.300
of the shower like I'm out of here

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:14.680
anything you didn't do be honest and man

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:18.130
I think all right so I had I had to

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:20.590
drive this gag on to a trailer but the

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.810
trailer I knew I was like it was like a

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:24.520
single detached home in Philadelphia

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.650
like a warehouse set up and I was like

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.230
Oh an old Mexican landscaper lives here

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:31.330
this isn't my dream my thoughts I was

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:32.800
like this is his trails at the ancient

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.870
last it was the ancient land dude so I

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:36.220
was like I added if I got a part I'd

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.990
want to park this on I park my lawnmower

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:39.220
on this guy's trailer because like

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.360
apparently that was the only place I

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.700
could park this but I was like if he

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.260
sees it he might come out and take all

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.120
my crate my lawnmower and it was like

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.920
who else he would definitely want to use

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.350
this [ __ ] sick ass keg so I was like

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:52.750
he might take my so I like deliberated

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:54.250
on a lawnmower on a trailer for like

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.230
five minutes in a dream like if I wake

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:57.580
up early enough with my Kaabah this guy

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.080
probably wakes up early as [ __ ] and I

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.150
was like and then I next day I was in it

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:02.920
I was upstairs in the this house and

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.570
I've invented like a video game system

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:06.520
that was just controllers surface 8

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.170
controllers and they project a thing

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:09.850
onto a wall and everyone can just play

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:11.620
like a fly get a person like Rommel

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:12.820
Street Fighter it's pretty [ __ ] sick

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:14.860
and I've you know so that was the end of

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:19.210

weird stuff on other people that I don't

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.340

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.420
100 some deep deep leverage you're

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.220
saying please don't listen this on

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.200
surface level go deep with this do you

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.210

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.970
perceiving them than only control

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:16.230
they're perceiving them as the Nugget

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:18.540

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:30.180
true never have not only dull never nice

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.970
no guy has gotten killed by all got in

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:33.660
the history

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.060
I wonder who first laid that fact down

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.970
to wax me thinking about some dude with

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:39.990
a feather and a quill and was like

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:41.370
something else I've noticed there's

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:45.510
never been a wolf definitely like pit

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:47.520
bulls that have killed people pit bulls

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:53.610
are worse than find this out you got it

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:55.680
you gotta just yeah [ __ ] Google your

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.320
FAC to see what's good get pause for one

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.800
tiles do it we're back I mean I gotta be

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.220
honest I don't think I've been this far

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:08.940
off on a Colfax get that where'd that

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:10.230
come from I have no idea

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:12.390
that's [ __ ] wild I think I've been

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.370
telling people that you that wolf said

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:15.590
that almost don't kill people

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:18.840
damn did but granted there were three in

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.660
North America in the last 50 years but

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:23.340
three with all of Norfolk Ashley's

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:27.660
Canada Alaska okay so you're not that

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:29.790
far and there's three so I'm talking

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:31.980
that doesn't tell whether the person was

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.870
wounded or it was a child this is wolf

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:37.440
attack wolf killing someone but I mean

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:41.100
but in the country with the most this is

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.410
this is the first thing I saw which when

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:44.640
I was like I don't think it's any and

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.050
then I googled it in this stack came up

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:47.580
cut through the most extensive

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:49.110
historical records as France where

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:52.320
nearly seventy seventy six hundred fatal

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:56.730
attacks were documented between 12 so

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:58.470
the 13th century it is so the nineteen

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:00.030
wolves like French

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:01.770
was love eating French people and make

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:06.870
sense but 7,600 from medieval times to

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:10.650
World War one and I mean those people

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:12.620
were fibbin all right

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.760
yeah that's pretty I mean they

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.230
definitely put not below number so you

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:17.730
could say you could definitely your rest

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.500
the odds are in your favor if you

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.680
encounter widely not zero yes what I was

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:26.310
hinting yet well I don't think there's

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:28.110
anything that hasn't killed somebody

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:31.320
once sure you know what I mean yeah this

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.090
one's definitely died as a result of new

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:35.490
socks before yeah they put on new socks

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:39.320
and a hardwood floor and we're like dead

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.580
that's dude I'm glad you could spell

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.140
deck I'm glad you spell that on here

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.180
half century up to 2002 there were eight

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:48.570
fatal attacks total in Europe and in

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:51.480
Russia yeah oh yeah dude there's Peter

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:54.690
in the wolf yes that was fax yes miss I

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:59.430
mean I don't believe what competing

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:01.380
wolves have never attacked someone true

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:04.410
Mose have never killed I I'm talking to

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:06.810
predatory unprovoked killing uh but

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:08.250
that's what I'm saying - dude that's

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:10.440
what I'm saying so like like they don't

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:15.330
hunt and eat humans ever ya know we be

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:21.450
cooking up all that but dude so I you

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:22.980
know I did ancestry and then I had the

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:24.420
Australian kid definitely [ __ ] Bruce

Rosabelle I'm sad by that and that's

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:28.560
that's what [ __ ] trapped in the

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:33.360
closet was based off of the we did

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.360

hers I have like I mean out I have a

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.160
little bit of Western Asian because

c'mon Gurion very like trait they were

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.150
saying like my ancestors like like ten

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:56.340
thousand years ago basically my my thing

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.290
was like you know obviously everyone

00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:00.360
came from Africa but like my mom's side

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.880
was chilling in like North Africa West's

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.920
age basically the Tarte Aryans was out

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:07.050
and like the people who became like

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:09.180
Vikings and [ __ ] in the Celts really

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:10.950
yeah you know the calls are the Celts I

00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:13.710

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:14.080
Celts

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:16.330
yeah so it's like you guys people so my

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:18.700
mom's side was more like North like way

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.280
way long ago was like there's like 0.1%

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:24.520
of me North African out to my Korean

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.930
land like Western Asia pretty much

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:28.030
Western Asia is the Middle East or like

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:30.520
yeah or like Russia you know whatever or

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:32.710
what you know I'm saying it wasn't it

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:33.940
wasn't rushing back then but I'm talking

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:35.350
about just the lands you know it was

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:35.800
close

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.140
Siberia like eastern Russia is close to

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:41.980
Western Asia sort of but yeah Middle

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:42.330
East

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:44.620
what like the very end of run doesen't

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:48.400
Russia but up to the Middle East yeah

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.990
like he was Beck and Stan and all that

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:51.730

Mongolia is without way near China okay

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:00.610
yeah so I was like you were saying I was

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:04.990
your rep well I think so you have a back

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:06.730

someone up the neck no that's just

00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:35.539

00:45:35.539 --> 00:45:36.919

00:45:36.919 --> 00:45:38.239

00:45:38.239 --> 00:45:40.429
finally they'll go okay alright I could

00:45:40.429 --> 00:45:40.999

00:45:40.999 --> 00:45:43.130
dude they like it was it was really good

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:45.489

00:45:45.489 --> 00:45:48.679
he was like it's talking about like he

00:45:48.679 --> 00:45:51.859
he was like you guys read DMS and

00:45:51.859 --> 00:45:53.929
they're like it one guys like not not

00:45:53.929 --> 00:45:56.299
that I I don't I don't think no I don't

00:45:56.299 --> 00:45:57.739
think we'd it was obviously like dude

00:45:57.739 --> 00:45:59.449
you guys are [ __ ] lying he said then

00:45:59.449 --> 00:46:01.579
I don't know how this came up but he

00:46:01.579 --> 00:46:03.289
started saying like yeah you know when

00:46:03.289 --> 00:46:04.489
people harasses like how do you know if

00:46:04.489 --> 00:46:05.630
someone's harassing you through DMS

00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:06.559
aren't you guys haven't like stop

00:46:06.559 --> 00:46:08.599
harassment Mahwah and he said well I

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:09.679
mean he's like what about the case when

00:46:09.679 --> 00:46:11.719
one person says and the next person says

00:46:11.719 --> 00:46:13.339
I and then he's like you know where this

00:46:13.339 --> 00:46:15.109
is going and that dude it was so funny

00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:16.819
that happens all the time like people

00:46:16.819 --> 00:46:24.949
just like bomb it's so [ __ ] weird

00:46:24.949 --> 00:46:27.679
yeah I have a theory on the alright and

00:46:27.679 --> 00:46:29.989
the [ __ ] identitarian left that it's

00:46:29.989 --> 00:46:32.299
just all since now we're confronting

00:46:32.299 --> 00:46:34.099
like racism like for real like before

00:46:34.099 --> 00:46:35.539
just we were just like kind of

00:46:35.539 --> 00:46:37.069
disbelievers it's like sure no it's with

00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:38.419
a black guy and they're like in the

00:46:38.419 --> 00:46:40.189
early 90s you could totally [ __ ] to

00:46:40.189 --> 00:46:41.659
be at the family party and be like yeah

00:46:41.659 --> 00:46:43.159
and like Chuck around jokes like that

00:46:43.159 --> 00:46:46.069
even then I think in the early 90s it

00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:48.109
was a [ __ ] family party with me yeah

00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:49.729
but I'm saying it's tied up it's tied

00:46:49.729 --> 00:46:50.839
off yeah

00:46:50.839 --> 00:46:52.579
so it's like we grow up around that and

00:46:52.579 --> 00:46:53.779
then all of a sudden everyone's like

00:46:53.779 --> 00:46:55.339
anyone who's never done anything like

00:46:55.339 --> 00:46:57.109
that's a piece of [ __ ] [ __ ] I think a

00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:58.399
lot of the alt-right stuff is like

00:46:58.399 --> 00:47:01.699
dealing with racism in a real weird way

00:47:01.699 --> 00:47:03.319
where like you're just making a joke out

00:47:03.319 --> 00:47:04.549
of it where that's what happens in a lot

00:47:04.549 --> 00:47:05.959
of people when they're like like when

00:47:05.959 --> 00:47:07.159
you do the Alex Jones boys you know I

00:47:07.159 --> 00:47:08.749
got a [ __ ] like hey come here but

00:47:08.749 --> 00:47:10.579
it's funny but it's a thing that people

00:47:10.579 --> 00:47:12.229
are processing on a weird level and the

00:47:12.229 --> 00:47:14.029
a lot of the left people process it by

00:47:14.029 --> 00:47:16.699
just being like he's racist me a racist

00:47:16.699 --> 00:47:19.099
look at them they're bad so is it

00:47:19.099 --> 00:47:20.509
something interesting I thought of yeah

00:47:20.509 --> 00:47:21.769
it's the all right spilling it's not

00:47:21.769 --> 00:47:23.929
that big a deal it's funny you know

00:47:23.929 --> 00:47:26.929
that's like you do it I don't do it

00:47:26.929 --> 00:47:29.449
exactly the exactly everyone's placing

00:47:29.449 --> 00:47:30.799
blame somewhere exactly then there's

00:47:30.799 --> 00:47:32.659
some people who are sliding in this

00:47:32.659 --> 00:47:36.019
being like no I really do like this get

00:47:36.019 --> 00:47:36.440
out of you

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:38.839
well that's that's the New Zealand dude

00:47:38.839 --> 00:47:41.329
yeah he's like a [ __ ] reddit 4chan

00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:43.130

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:46.250

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:52.400
it how many views I didn't watch it if I

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.960
took it down pretty quick yeah that was

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:55.640

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:06.680
corner I think a ton of people huddled

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:10.910
in a corner but Jay was telling me yeah

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:13.069
probably the [ __ ] he asked for

00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:14.569

when something big goes on Facebook live

00:48:19.819 --> 00:48:21.290
in his screen then you just like he sees

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:23.720

another anti being against Jewish people

00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:58.369

because it's like yeah there is some

00:54:45.569 --> 00:54:47.849
truth to it and it was also viral too so

00:54:47.849 --> 00:54:49.650
you got to still stay viral and you're

00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:51.029

it's like yeah obviously nobody's Ingrid

00:55:10.529 --> 00:55:12.269
Breitbart photoshopped the [ __ ] uh

00:55:12.269 --> 00:55:14.430
like the dude American massacre was just

00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:15.990
like a bunch of George Washington pet

00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:18.599
copy and paste like yeah you could tell

00:55:18.599 --> 00:55:23.880
me about a massacre in you know any

00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:25.680
African country right now and I'd be

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:28.230

00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:57.269
I mean it's a [ __ ] therapy and based

00:55:57.269 --> 00:55:59.339
country so it's like yeah if there's a

00:55:59.339 --> 00:56:00.119
massacre

00:56:00.119 --> 00:56:01.920
it gets covered it gets covered if

there's a [ __ ] massacre in the Sudan

00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:06.390
not really that crazy

00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:08.880
well until a person from like you know

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.470
New Zealand or England

00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:11.790

the facebook [ __ ] profiles for like a

00:56:17.369 --> 00:56:20.310
week and they're like this one was this

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:21.030
is a rough one

00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:22.770
what was the Facebook what was the what

00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:24.300
did people do on Facebook to say it like

00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:28.050
to commemorate Africa no no too many

00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:30.530
Facebook they don't know file changes

00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:34.260
then I put like a gun circle slash no

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:39.960
yeah but yeah it's like that was a rough

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:40.170
one

00:56:40.170 --> 00:56:42.570
that was [ __ ] her it's a rough one I

00:56:42.570 --> 00:56:45.150
did again dude I'm not a gun nut it's

00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:46.470
just people are gonna build [ __ ]

00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:49.260
bombs so it's like the Middle East it's

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:51.030
like talk to them about it's a little

00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:53.160
more the least about gun control yeah

00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:54.840
then you [ __ ] build a bomb and just

00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:57.450
blow up an entire building true so it's

00:56:57.450 --> 00:56:59.010
like I mean I don't I might why are your

00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:00.390
one's better than the other but people

00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:01.770
we need to get rid of guns it's like

00:57:01.770 --> 00:57:03.869
they're still a dude out there [ __ ]

00:57:03.869 --> 00:57:06.570
stewing me like I gotta kill as many of

00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:08.910
those people that I can and where

00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:12.240
there's a will you have an end summon or

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:15.660
two yeah you gotta be pretty [ __ ]

00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:17.730
smart pretty savvy you know how to build

00:57:17.730 --> 00:57:21.030
a bomb Joe Joe secretively especially in

00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:23.160
today's society like they'll track if

00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:24.780
you're saying crazy [ __ ] on reddit

00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:26.780
they're gonna be like why is he buying

00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:29.099
800 pounds of manure oh you'll be

00:57:29.099 --> 00:57:31.380
flagged so fast dude don't even get me

00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:33.089
started with my CIA and google it but

00:57:33.089 --> 00:57:35.880
then just to buy a gun true

00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:37.500
well you can buy as many guns really as

00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:39.660
you want until you come up on like a if

00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:42.210
you're like stockpiling hard and you can

00:57:42.210 --> 00:57:44.339
uh it was weird if you even if you start

00:57:44.339 --> 00:57:46.890
like so if I were like I'm some pretty

00:57:46.890 --> 00:57:48.089
[ __ ] hard to be like I'm a collector

00:57:48.089 --> 00:57:50.030
you're just not allowed to have like

00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:53.060
what now bomb stocks and then like I

00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:55.740
forget what it's like clip well I think

00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:58.170
the extended clips and like well there's

00:57:58.170 --> 00:57:59.190
got a beautiful thing where if you start

00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:00.990
buying go into a registry so if you

00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:02.880
start buying a lot they probably start

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:04.740
monitoring you're like dude if you think

00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:06.450
the CIA can zero in on every single

00:58:06.450 --> 00:58:08.099
person in America and it's like see what

00:58:08.099 --> 00:58:09.330
you're up to at any given time your

00:58:09.330 --> 00:58:11.040
computer your [ __ ] your false yeah

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.050
you're wrong you are fake news second is

00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:14.400
dude I was read that book I'm reading

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.960
about it's from a Harvard lady this

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:18.599
other one and basically the CIA watched

00:58:18.599 --> 00:58:20.760
Google and Facebook build and there

00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:23.640
like we'd like this and they just teamed

00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:25.140
up and it's like documented on the

00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:27.000
record and it's like those all that's

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.940
the those things that's like Google

00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:32.010
Facebook the CIA sat back and let

00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:34.080
private industry build just a failing

00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:35.670
state for them and they were just like

00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:37.230
yeah we're gonna plug into that Thanks

00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:39.360
and it just is that way

00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:41.700
so we're fully 100% some rails if you

00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:43.080
start buying weapons and then you go to

00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:44.850
chat rooms like [ __ ] all if they see

00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:46.950
the all-caps could go on your keyboards

00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:48.570
like send them out there [ __ ] these
