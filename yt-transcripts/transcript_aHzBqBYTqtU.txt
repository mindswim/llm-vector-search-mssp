00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.390

its corny yeah well now I know that now

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.740
I know to stay away from any possible

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.570
catchy phrases on a [ __ ] mug or

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.969
t-shirt I mean I've heard I've been

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.380
hearing that phrase for a long time so

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.600
whoever says it is making fun of my band

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.920
and that's why I automatically it's a

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.140
never have you ever heard that phrase no

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.360
my attention you gasp and

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.900
because you guys are not fans whatever

I had yesterday was a positive freak out

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.219
on my girlfriend she was watching the

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:52.780
episode before the finale of Game of

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.419
Thrones and she's on her laptop watching

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.340
it while I play Madden and I'm playing a

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.099
franchise game and uh it's like it's

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.469
almost I'm about to score there's one

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.449
second left I'm on the 3-yard line and

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.430

like I didn't lose yet it's still a

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.419
second she was like okay how many times

and that's how I lose then I'm out of

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:32.949
the playoffs because of that does that

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:37.719

Panthers and he picked it and she's on

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:50.110

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.560
Kuechly

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:58.930

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:42.499
thing you know with uh with when you're

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:44.479
like kind of living together because

video game time I've always kept it away

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.389
from my girlfriends so that was the

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:48.529
first girlfriend she said play game

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:50.419
Madden my dear my laptop watch Game of

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:52.669
Thrones episode and I was like yeah

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:54.139
that's kind of what Christine just gets

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:55.759
in her own yeah she has to do so much

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:57.349
computer work anyway that it's just like

00:06:57.349 --> 00:06:58.370
while she's doing that I could play

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.099
which brings us to this with some casual

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:04.039
lead-in but these two idiots that we've

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:05.629
talked about on the last episodes

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:07.300
Kristina's good point they're soul mates

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.669

00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:46.969
all cut up

00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:48.889
yeah could be a tank top like really cut

00:07:48.889 --> 00:07:50.389
up though like it's barely covering

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:53.599
anything at the bonfire SXM man I wish I

00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:54.800
had a body could wear a shirt like that

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.779
dude can I tell you this is a Robert cut

00:07:56.779 --> 00:07:58.250
off sleeveless t-shirts and I don't even

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.930
I think I look awful in them but like

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.389
imagine feeling good but I only have the

00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:04.339
sleeves cut off if you can cut down the

00:08:04.339 --> 00:08:06.800
BOD a little bit that's a nice look so

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.259
so let's look for a hot day just hold

00:08:09.259 --> 00:08:11.719
off some smoking hot girls that do that

00:08:11.719 --> 00:08:14.689
look Jamie Foxx came to the cellar with

00:08:14.689 --> 00:08:17.089
a girl that was gorgeous and she went

00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:19.339
what like two years ago

00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:22.969
Wow and legitimately was like she had

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:24.889
nothing on she had a cut-off shirt you

00:08:24.889 --> 00:08:26.719
could see the side boob and then her

00:08:26.719 --> 00:08:27.199
ribs

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:29.300
I mean marina Franklin and I were

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.009
questioning if she had her boobs taped

00:08:31.009 --> 00:08:32.419
athlete did you think her boot her

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:33.800
nipples were taped to generally that's

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.569
what they'll do yeah because after all

00:08:35.569 --> 00:08:37.459
some of these East Village pigs I see

00:08:37.459 --> 00:08:38.240

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.520
saying that girl at the cellar who is

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.709
with Jamie Foxx had I think it was

00:08:45.709 --> 00:08:48.140
attached to the shirt yeah because it

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.240

00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:46.239
coming a thousand directions sure we had

00:15:46.239 --> 00:15:47.739
a guy waited giants guys sitting in our

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:49.989

do is take you pictures it's not good

01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:34.520
for her brand to be and that's really

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.890
him laying it out there with taking like

01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:38.300
making out there in the videos and stuff

01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:39.980
that's ruining whatever this is trying

01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:42.520
to do I think it's trying to make like

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:44.540
lonely guys feel like you have a

01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:45.680
girlfriend like that you're running

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:48.950
along the beach yeah

01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:50.300
you guys don't feel that way if there's

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:51.860
a lot of first-person than that but then

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:53.240
when they show him making out there it's

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:55.220
like it looks like exactly like this

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:56.990
insanely hot girl for some reason was

01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:58.460
dragging you on a run along the beach

01:07:58.460 --> 01:07:59.900
and then she makes out with a really hot

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:07.780
guy while you watch her head whatever

01:08:07.810 --> 01:08:11.320
whatever you say say this is extra brain

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:15.830
flower now yeah she has like the

01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:18.049
conversations you have to have with her

01:08:18.049 --> 01:08:20.270
that's why Roman is her soul mate

01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:24.200
because she has she says she is [ __ ]

01:20:23.010 --> 01:20:26.110
mean for some reason we two black holes

01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:28.570

Romans more afraid of a transcending to

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:00.020

fear is just dying and people die I know

01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:21.650

01:25:21.650 --> 01:25:23.930
my biggest fear but like my mom says

01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:31.850

about it you know what why am I wasting

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:47.690

01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:14.770
against your enemies

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:24.100
and then her biggest fear is being late

01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:25.900

yeah we get it yeah it's very very weird

01:28:36.370 --> 01:28:40.080
well let's see what sports that plane

01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:47.170
freaked out now I love to think about

01:28:47.170 --> 01:28:47.620
dying

01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:48.910
I don't mean to be superstitious but

01:28:48.910 --> 01:28:50.020
we've talked about death and that's how

01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:51.880
every final destination movie starts and

01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:53.680
I'm just really wigging out right now

01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:55.990
mama sky set it off to worry about it

01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:58.060
so I'm thinking I think what are the

01:28:58.060 --> 01:29:00.130
things I think one more thing a piece of

01:29:00.130 --> 01:29:04.110
man bun no I got badass Don Johnson hair

01:29:04.410 --> 01:29:30.190
90s Don Johnson hair I mean really

01:29:30.190 --> 01:29:46.510
you're capable of Jacob you're stepping

01:29:46.510 --> 01:29:48.100
in we're running at a time so I would go

01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:50.950
to the end we're at 17 what was his

01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:52.360
sport yeah this is important to my

01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:58.960
theory dude what his sport is I also was

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:04.660
in cheer it was super fun and Romans

01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:08.310

01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:11.910
I'm blackballed black belt karate

01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:23.130
holy Wow just debunked my theory oh no

01:30:23.130 --> 01:30:26.250
[ __ ] way that sounds like a super

01:30:26.250 --> 01:30:28.470
made-up thing that you make up at every

01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:32.360
trigger pressed kids you don't know you

01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:35.010
just move here in Canada what's your

01:30:35.010 --> 01:30:55.110
story goes I'll say my stories when I

01:30:55.110 --> 01:30:58.230
first moved here there was probably mean

01:30:58.230 --> 01:31:00.330
group dues you're picking on me but then

01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:02.130

weapon the reason death bums me out so

01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:13.050
much is cuz I brought so much into the

01:31:13.050 --> 01:31:13.980
world

Thailand because I murdered a man there

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:18.420
I'm afraid to go back there and face the

01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:21.060
charges the charges are not trial by a

01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:24.830
