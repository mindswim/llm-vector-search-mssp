club you it's or it could be Sadie

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:06.540
Hawkins strippers ask the guys at the

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.069
club and be like hey next week we're

00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:11.220
having prom will you be my date that's

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.170
pretty nice I think the exciting part is

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.649
hanging out outside of the venue yeah

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:18.059
there's always an after-party after prom

00:10:18.059 --> 00:10:20.730
you know that's the venue would be at a

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.499
dance hall you just take the strippers

00:10:22.499 --> 00:10:24.959
actually ran out like a fire hall or

00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:28.470
something cherry cover band

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.809
oh dude now you're talking I don't know

00:10:30.809 --> 00:10:32.970
the less formal the better to me I think

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.929
just a kind of cash party yeah parties

00:10:36.929 --> 00:10:38.790
at a house party after the you know yeah

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:44.790
you can't usually make it while I was on

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.259
stage I would get off stage if I could

00:10:46.259 --> 00:10:50.939
tell me hey maybe one to last night that

00:10:50.939 --> 00:10:53.189
was last night one three percent of the

00:10:53.189 --> 00:10:56.610
time why I was just well that's the

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.529
thing is she was when when you feel

00:10:58.529 --> 00:10:59.910
shitty

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.700
from drinking you can your face with

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.340
that crossroads of like I just pack it

up and go home yeah or just keep

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.360
drinking I don't have that in me once I

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.970
dropped off yeah although there's some

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.170
strippers that have it in them to like

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.880

girl yeah it's rough it's rough all

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:33.090
because greedy little Chris needed to

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:35.400
lube up for a stripper party you just

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.320
trash this guy's life and then you move

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.000
on to the next town

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.570
look I I took I took care of my part of

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:50.850
the deal you know to get him to get him

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.970

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.890
able to see you at a stripper pole oh my

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:59.970

don't have to try to be like casual yeah

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:08.820
but I would probably keep it under

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.470
control no you want it you would if we

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.520
went to the strip party you would have

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.740
got hammered and we probably within an

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.930
hour probably before people started

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.400
showing up you would have already

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.560
cornered a girl and then like I'll give

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:24.390

quick and then well here's your self

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.990
back together here's the question

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:21.180
pervert this is what I want to know how

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:26.190
long has this obsession been what sex me

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:29.940
yeah typically it's only recently TIFF

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.040
exactly notice Thomson I never noticed

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.660
it in him until this year when he

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:37.590
started procuring I never noticed that

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:40.110
was that was that yeah but that was that

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:42.000
was like a couple months I think it's a

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.160
little over typically there's a voicing

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.810
sex we've crossed with sex addiction

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.440
there's usually avoid a lack of fuel

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.240
yeah total lack of feeling and sex is

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.400
the only tangible totally feeling route

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.140
I'm not shaming you I did the same thing

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.780
I was in a sexless marriage yeah I was

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:02.280
bad well it's like how do you think you

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.600
would have responded a stripper party

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.430
during that oh dude I would have been

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:07.230
[ __ ] like I would have been thinking

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:10.230
about it still I do I'm telling you man

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:13.290
I was the dog I was the dog of dogs dude

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:15.600
so I'm not judging anyone right when you

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.990
follow that path dude when your dicks

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:21.740
your conference dude

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:25.580
bad areas bad situations yes somehow

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:30.110
cement around you and become your yeah I

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:32.000
mean it's definitely worried about it

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.470
turning into a thing but like I don't

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:35.110
know I haven't I haven't done i'm

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:37.370
procured hit a long time yeah that's

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:39.530
good yeah so I'm off that that was it

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:41.210
that was again a little yes it's a

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.310
jojo's that can be overcome well it's a

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:45.200
weird thing because like you said you

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.670
like dip your toes in that world and

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:49.420
then like it feels like a lot like

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:52.850
getting ahead no it's just it's it's

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:56.630
good yeah well it's not like it's so

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:59.540
much easier than you then I thought it

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.190
was it's you know it felt like buying

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:02.840
weed in like high school or something

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.120
exciting there's an address like yeah

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.410
yeah but it's also you're like oh like

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:08.090
kind of everyone there's like there's

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:10.010
like there's a lot of this going around

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:14.420
but not as difficult to find as I

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.830
thought it would be then you go on stage

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:16.940
you know like how many you guys get

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:20.590
hookers literally no one in the room

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.790
nobody bro I've coming from someone

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:27.230
who's tried hooker jokes on people

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:29.330
nobody works people to is just like

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:32.630

pretty much get hooker stuff a crowds

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.130
and dude guys are just like it's that

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:52.190

percent that's pretty good

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.780

Thailand is doing pretty good Thailand

00:29:15.919 --> 00:29:17.780
only has a high estimate there is no low

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:22.370
estimate 75% 75% that's like there's no

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:26.450
way it could be 75% in Thailand but like

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:28.309

too pleased yeah dude yeah and then you

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.700

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.080
the pet they should set up a penalty for

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.570
that in comedy when I give you on

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:07.580
accident like clown on [ __ ] dude

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:10.760
they shouldn't make him they should make

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.610
him go up and like you give him like 15

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:16.850
true he would across [ __ ] so funny

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:18.320
that's the thing too you got to be

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.660
grateful that like people who are fully

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:22.450
[ __ ] aren't in cuz they just smash

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:26.200
they grow around there and they wish it

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.869
was mastered they decided to they're

00:37:28.869 --> 00:37:30.339
like gods in the comedy world if they

00:37:30.339 --> 00:37:32.200
decided to bless the stages like you

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.119
know pack it up bro yeah I mean all

00:37:34.119 --> 00:37:35.980
right this is a very inappropriate thing

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:38.530
to say but they are like a fart embodied

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:40.510
like the matter where or when it is it's

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:42.099
like oh that's great dude if they got

00:37:42.099 --> 00:37:44.500
the mic you started talking I would be

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.839
in stitches dude I would be in stitches

00:37:46.839 --> 00:37:49.240
but like I felt horrible and then I did

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:51.040
the you know you imagined that my

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.530
material is about like there's like a

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:57.010
Special Olympics joke would you do while

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:59.290
I did it I saw the lady cuz all I could

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:00.819
see was the front of their table which

00:38:00.819 --> 00:38:02.650
were the women that were like there was

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:06.130
a whole table there yes yeah and like I

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:07.720
saw her during that joke and she was

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.990
like no she's looking like stop [ __ ] so

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:12.430

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:15.490
I stopped it Midway oh you bailed on it

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:18.010
kind of there was a there was a I just

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:19.660
stopped at a certain point I didn't like

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:21.549
it didn't seem like I cut a joke off I'm

00:38:21.549 --> 00:38:23.349
still I'm still stoked on the idea of

00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:26.140
like you know [ __ ] people realizing

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:28.660
their powers invading comedy and then

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.430
like all the comics just being like

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:45.250
goddamn [ __ ] came down here just

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:49.349
smashing dude I don't know I could be

00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:54.369
meeting afterwards and then after I got

00:38:54.369 --> 00:38:55.930
offstage and I still couldn't see the

00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:58.869
whole table so then I came back out when

00:38:58.869 --> 00:39:00.190
the lights were on in the show room to

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:03.430
check and I was like oh yeah whole table

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:05.650
it was like a field trip whole table

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:08.170
you're saying like Special Olympians

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:09.520
they they but they had the boss there

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.859
the boys were there and then after I

00:39:11.859 --> 00:39:13.930
went and went I went and found the lady

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:15.400
cuz I saw that she was upset and I

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.260
didn't want to sure you know I like I

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:18.819
did genuinely feel bad I didn't mean to

00:39:18.819 --> 00:39:21.130
like hurt their feelings but also how

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:22.150
did they like to show though they

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:23.530
laughing she literally yeah they were

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:25.180
laughing the whole time until the very

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:25.630
end

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:27.730
oh so I was making fun of like Jews and

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:29.980

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:50.710
but like I you know that's the logic

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:52.450
behind it it's like you can't you can't

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:53.950

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.940

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:54.460
life for the parent yeah instantly that

comedy show some [ __ ] up there make

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:04.300
it fun especially our

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.950
they probably genuinely in their life

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:07.690
run into people who are like actual

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:10.300
[ __ ] know how that's pretty rare

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:13.720
like I think you run into kids exactly

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:15.550
that's what you run into is young one

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:18.130
teenagers young kids that see or you

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:19.330
know see somebody that's mentally

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:22.140
handicapped and you just instantly like

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:26.830
yeah or idiot those little kids that's

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:28.510
dying out it's problem they probably do

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:29.860
see it the kids the most and they're

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:31.090
like don't worry when you grew up there

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:32.530
won't be any more adults like that let's

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:37.000
go to this comedy show yeah it is a

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.280
funny joke though that jokes more about

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.140
the concept of starting it rather you're

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:43.720
not doing like what do they call how I

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.790
got into it would you get into it

00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:47.080

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:50.080

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:05.680
good weekend

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:09.610
I wondered - how like cuz it's like a as

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:11.560
a fine line the intelligence stuff as a

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.450
fine line of like making fun of it

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:15.580
if someone just bones up beginning final

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:16.780
one but there's like a cut-off there's

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.340
like an IQ cutoff where it's like yo bro

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:20.920
that's off-limits [ __ ] you dude yeah I

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.230
guess I mean it's kind of wretched to

00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:25.510
think about your boy you come into this

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:27.040
world and it's just like buy some

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:29.530
genetic thing you're just kind of like I

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:30.640
just wonder I want to know what the

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:33.070
level of consciousness is it's pretty I

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:35.680
mean I I know people what people down

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.410
syndrome can be like relatively

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:40.990
intelligent yeah yeah like it's not like

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:42.580
they're like aware of their situation

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:45.160
yeah I hate it that's what I want to

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:47.050
know yeah is it like that or is it kind

00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:49.030
of more just like you know I there's

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:50.860
everyday party grows there's a there's

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:52.630
like a documentary but there's a point

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:54.250
you can they can dip deep enough where

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:56.140
every day is Mari girl sure I guess

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:57.370
which is a path it's right it's just

00:45:57.370 --> 00:45:58.990
probably they probably are like a very

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:08.740
binary good and evil path you trying to

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:10.300
[ __ ] draw a circle keep me out I'm

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:11.680
with draw a bigger circle and include

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:13.790
you dude that's how I am

00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:16.700
I love you hear stuff like that's the

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:21.350
type of stuff I yeah says stuff like

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:23.750
that brightens you up that's just some

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:27.410
dark cloud in the hotel room every day I

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:32.330
was this close to a stripper party smear

00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:40.160
on our record Prince Andrew dude father

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.740
I was all you may have ran into someone

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:45.950
you know I let the sides down uncouth

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:49.250
fellows the bar and Timonium and they

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:58.250
led me to a party I did no no she was my

00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:04.550
biggest problem is still I mean dude if

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:06.320
you think about it I'm not gonna say

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.630
this guy's DUI was good for you it was

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:11.900
but in a way there were there's 18 year

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.030
old strippers or also might be wayward

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:16.430
17 year old exact wannabe strippers and

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:18.380
hang out with their older cousin you

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:19.700
just got to avoid that type of party oh

00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:22.310
yeah I've never been to a party like

00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:24.890
I've never been I've never been to a

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:26.690
party like that is not hang out with 18

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:29.690
year olds in a sexual way there's no

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:31.460
guarantee that the other people there

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:33.440
would be 18 his girlfriend was 18 I mean

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.700
the best-case scenario is that you're

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.290
hanging out with 32 year old strippers a

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:40.820
whole other night safe yes but best case

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:42.050
is not a fun party

00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:46.670
best-case is 19 yeah yeah either way

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:49.100
that's a nightmare of a party that would

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:52.160
suck we've got to ask yourself dude what

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.300
else did you want to hang out what else

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:54.710
would you like to do with them you know

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:59.260
what it's it's like yeah I feel like

00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:01.760
yeah for the most part that's that's

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.680
what winds up like this what is this

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.630
helping your hangover right now just

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:10.400
unpack the party last for six months no

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:14.660
no no I think terrorists are killing

00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:22.160
themselves for that exam get to DUI on

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:25.830
sorry oh my god dude I just got some

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:28.490
very juicy information about Yahweh

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:31.860
well yeah dude part of the Orion group

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:34.260
evil entity basically tricked mankind

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:36.540
for thousands of years sorry guys

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:39.030
wait Yahweh Yahweh you got to fill me in

00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:41.370
on you know I did yeah [ __ ] the the

00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:45.600
guy you [ __ ] disobey constantly why'd

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.160
you say it was such a hard jail

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:51.480
what do you mean the Jew God you go down

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:55.530
that's the Jews apparently Elohim it was

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:58.730
Elohim at first and obviously Adonai and

00:48:58.730 --> 00:49:01.380
Yahweh was this later thing that popped

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:02.790
in the Bible it was they called it two

00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:04.710
different things now no where was y'all

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:06.450
way and if you look at they won't like

00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:09.060
the Old Testaments like Yahweh's rules

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.740
kind of sucked it like it is

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:12.120
he was a [ __ ] [ __ ] that's what

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:13.170
everyone always talks about the Old

00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:14.940
Testament New Testament God Yahweh was a

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:17.010
[ __ ] dick and he's part of the Orion

00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:19.050
group yeah right yeah the Orion group

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:20.730
people who choose the path of self and

00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:23.970
then skip into the fourth density but

00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:25.200
you have to view yes don't worry you

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:27.600
have to be 95 percent polarized towards

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:29.070
self service which neither of you guys

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:31.430
aren't even anywhere close to that

00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:33.450
historical figures you're talking

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:35.940
Genghis Khan Rasputin you say the fourth

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:39.180
density yeah dude yeah obviously the

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:41.310
fourth density whole rocks the first

00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:44.550
like the rock yeah the rock like rock

00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:47.130
like material like rocks off its first

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:49.110
density okay once an animal can move

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:50.430
about and like look around that's a

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:52.260
second density once an animal becomes

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.460
self-conscious that's a third density

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:55.680
and then once an animal the third

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:57.330
density is easily the hardest density

00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:59.070
but once you choose in the whole point

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:00.120
of the third density is to choose

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.220
between service itself and service of

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:04.410
others and then if you choose several of

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:06.570
them you do go to the fourth density but

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:08.160
it's very much it's a lot harder if you

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.450
do service itself to go to the fourth

00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:11.490
density and then you join a so stream

00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:16.500
social memory complex but but they're

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:19.020
talking about how Yahweh was there I'm

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:22.320
service your service to Saul Chris when

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.570
Chris was down and down and out today I

00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:26.370
started popping among your service to

00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:27.690
others and yesterday I was giving you

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:30.060
pep talks yeah yeah I saw Chris hit rock

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:33.750
bottom and I was like come on man well

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:35.310
just makes sense cause if you do sir

00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:38.460
others that naturally grows quicker if

00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:39.990
you do service itself the only way you

00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:42.120
can do it is just by holding people to

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:51.210
your you have to like subdue them either

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:56.880
subduing coerce which again they're

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.200
saying that's what the ten commandments

00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:00.630
were more of a thing that were tell it

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:02.190
was it was like an easy thing to set up

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:04.590
those kind of like structures guide it

00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:07.050
by [ __ ] Yahweh and then Jesus Christ

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:09.120
is a seventh density person who asked to

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.380
go back down to the third dance and he

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:12.270
was like I'm gonna fix this [ __ ] because

00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:14.760
the Bible's basically two totally

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:17.370
separate gods in one doing two totally

00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:19.320
different things yeah it's really

00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:22.740
Stewart jealous [ __ ] yes yeah who's kind

00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:24.540
of boys with the devil in the early

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:26.610
Bible God's boys with together like

00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:29.580
they're like gambling one [ __ ] job

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:32.130
yeah yeah Christ was the answer to Jobe

00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:34.230
that's a hole so what is the bet on Joe

00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:36.150
like I bet you I can make him turn on

00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:37.830
you yeah they're like God was like no

00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:39.510
way and then they just [ __ ] his life

00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:47.670
up finally Joe was like well do you have

00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:50.970
it at the end of Jobe doesn't God come

00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:53.700
down and be like thanks like no we were

00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:54.420
just [ __ ] around

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:56.670
no he find out it was a bet so what

00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:59.250
happens is you I from what I read he

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:00.990
does this like once and he's just like

00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:02.700
all right dude [ __ ] whatever I'm

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:04.890
still not squelching on you but then he

00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:06.510
like catches a glimpse of God and sees

00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:07.800
that God's it's like we're done

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:12.050
conscious being and it's like oh [ __ ]

00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:15.000
and then notice estimate God's

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.860
unconscious I think the Dizon the devil

00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:18.300
talked to Joe and was like come on man

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:20.760
do it like he's [ __ ] with you so much

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:23.130
my job's whole family's together in like

00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:24.830
a house collapses and kills them all

00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:27.420
like yeah and then he gets words on his

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:29.490
body yeah everything horrible happens to

00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:31.830
this dude and then he's like he's like

00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:33.690
God what gives

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:35.340
and then Kozik what the [ __ ] is your

00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:37.020
problem with do you mean what have you

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.930
every piece of [ __ ] it's like that's

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:41.850
what he just goes all right dude [ __ ]

00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:44.580
find just ask him and I think that

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:46.080
that's a turning point in the Bible when

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:47.070
they're like

00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:49.140
yeah we are separating this we got to

00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:50.760
sell something else but yeah they say

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:52.340
that was imagine the dudes writing that

00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:54.750
there was chairs just writing a story

00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:57.480
yeah yeah what happens what I think

00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:59.250
happens next you know

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:01.290
yeah dude or were the what the [ __ ] are

00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:02.400
they basing that and what were they

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:03.869
trying to convey to be like yeah dude

00:53:03.869 --> 00:53:05.940
well the devil's making a bet with a guy

00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:07.500
it's like it's [ __ ] crazy it's just a

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:08.070
story

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:09.480
dude I was watching the West Watson

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:11.400
videos so [ __ ] funny can you sum up

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.950
being segregated in like isolation he's

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:15.600
like dude I read the Bible three times

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.310
back to front and he's like dude a lot

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:18.420
of people gonna mad at me for saying

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:20.190
this but I think the point of the Bible

00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:21.450
is there's like at least I used to think

00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:23.070
this back then it's just something you

00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:24.900
read that confuses you so much that you

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:29.430
just forget about my problem that's how

00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:30.720
[ __ ] up I was at the time I thought

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.340
I'm like yeah I'm just [ __ ] confusing

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:39.960
myself I don't think it's not too far

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.369
from the truth I mean that whole story

00:53:41.369 --> 00:53:43.740
with Jobe is like no matter how shitty

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.420
your life gets you should still believe

00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:47.490
in God because it's just the devil

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:50.160
trying to [ __ ] with you but yeah but if

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.840
you if you're a serious biblical scholar

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:57.420
slash you know person like me they're

00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:58.859
saying the whole meaning of that was

00:53:58.859 --> 00:54:00.150
like they were that was humanity

00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:01.830
realizing that the God they were serving

00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:03.330
was largely unconscious and then it was

00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:05.520
like it kind of kind of evolved like

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.350
thousands of years into a more forgiving

00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:08.700
person who was like no no I care about

00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:10.619
so there's almost they had changed the

00:54:10.619 --> 00:54:13.109
product a little bit today no no no no

00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:14.850
he's here God's here now he cares about

00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:18.420
you right but there is still that thing

00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.280
where like because with so in the Jobe

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.380
story God starts yelling at him like

00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:23.550
look at all this [ __ ] I'll do the

00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:25.350
Thunderbolts and lightning like [ __ ] you

00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:28.200
dude frightening yeah dude sense Thunder

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:31.020
down my bad I know you can [ __ ] win I

00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:34.290
know you can beat me chill yeah alright

00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:36.390
then yeah I proved my point

00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:42.690
God is female broad as a social memory

00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:44.960
complex in the Orion group of course

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:47.490
yeah Ryan groups health social memory

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:49.520
complex

00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:53.380
I'll hold your hand to do every social

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:55.599
memory so I feel like your

00:54:55.599 --> 00:54:59.140
mind/body/spirit complex I would say you

00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:02.109
know yeah you're my bison an insult

00:55:02.109 --> 00:55:04.059
no that's everybody I'm body spirit

00:55:04.059 --> 00:55:05.529
complex and then on the third density

00:55:05.529 --> 00:55:07.119
you choose between service to self

00:55:07.119 --> 00:55:08.829
service to others and then once you

00:55:08.829 --> 00:55:10.200
choose service to others

00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:12.849
there's no everyone starts to mind-meld

00:55:12.849 --> 00:55:14.349
which is weirdly happening on the

00:55:14.349 --> 00:55:15.339
internet which we're like the

00:55:15.339 --> 00:55:16.930
consciousness kind of melds into one and

00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:18.849
that would be a social memory complex so

00:55:18.849 --> 00:55:19.960
after where everyone gets from the

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:22.059
fourth to the fifth no third to the

00:55:22.059 --> 00:55:23.680
fourth and fourth to the fifth this is

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:26.140
just like an agreed upon reality sort of

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:27.670
thing yeah once you shed your chemical

00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:29.319
body you would just become the white

00:55:29.319 --> 00:55:30.670
matter that you were before and then you

00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:33.279
would form a social memory complex duh

00:55:33.279 --> 00:55:35.710
which makes sense if we somehow merge

00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:37.329
with technology we most likely would

00:55:37.329 --> 00:55:39.489
exist on like a photon level and we

00:55:39.489 --> 00:55:40.630
would become like a social memory

00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:45.160
complex stored somewhere hmm I guess

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:47.049
aren't we sort of already that that's

00:55:47.049 --> 00:55:48.160
what the internet started it's the

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:50.109
painful process of us kind of total mind

00:55:50.109 --> 00:55:51.489
merging there's not gonna be secrets and

00:55:51.489 --> 00:55:52.630
[ __ ] well what I mean what is the

00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:53.859
years what's the difference between the

00:55:53.859 --> 00:55:55.329
way that like a brain functions or a

00:55:55.329 --> 00:56:01.690
computer functions Larry's not biases

00:56:01.690 --> 00:56:03.700
but yeah but a brain is not binary if

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:04.900
you're talking to analog computation

00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:08.910
then I'll be man isn't isn't isn't a

00:56:09.329 --> 00:56:11.920
brain is it sort of binary in the same

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:13.779
way isn't it just like stimulus or no

00:56:13.779 --> 00:56:16.390
stimulus yeah I could see that no I hear

00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:18.220
you're saying but apparently the brain

00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:20.200
like they mapped brains out and they

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:23.019
look very similar to like galaxies

00:56:23.019 --> 00:56:25.239
matter I mean you're getting a microcosm

00:56:25.239 --> 00:56:27.730
a cargo guys don't want that what's your

00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:29.069
problem

00:56:29.069 --> 00:56:31.210
the Orion groups channeling you right

00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:36.039
now that's the Orion group channeling

00:56:36.039 --> 00:56:37.630
they take it at any moment of weakness

00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:39.940
dude every morning when I when I like to

00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:41.410
think to pull my phone out and look at

00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:43.569
it in bed I literally like get off me

00:56:43.569 --> 00:56:45.849
demon I pop out of my bed and go nah I

00:56:45.849 --> 00:56:47.799
do service to others dude right away I

00:56:47.799 --> 00:56:50.049
don't let humble about it

00:56:50.049 --> 00:56:52.269
yeah I'm just teaching I'm just teaching

00:56:52.269 --> 00:56:54.339
the law of one be very humble about your

00:56:54.339 --> 00:56:56.359
writings coming in about rejecting

00:56:56.359 --> 00:56:58.609
she's coming after because he knows

00:56:58.609 --> 00:57:00.049
you're about to crack the code the Orion

00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:13.099
groups on its yes don't rise I'm

00:57:13.099 --> 00:57:15.499
channeling right now if you're if you're

00:57:15.499 --> 00:57:18.470
using service be humble about it don't

00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:25.150
brag about it on a podcast protect me

00:57:27.350 --> 00:57:31.400
[Laughter]

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:48.739
Yahweh yeah yeah I'm on Raw I'm on rock

00:57:48.739 --> 00:57:50.869
yeah gypsy Sun God because the Egyptians

00:57:50.869 --> 00:57:52.759
were set up their their society was

00:57:52.759 --> 00:57:55.400
ready for the law of one ours is a lot

00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:56.989
of distortions go how can we doing so

00:57:56.989 --> 00:57:58.450
much better than the Egyptians and

00:57:58.450 --> 00:58:06.799
defined better I bet they had stripper

00:58:06.799 --> 00:58:08.539
parties yeah probably

00:58:08.539 --> 00:58:12.410
oh no doubt no doubt my bad hell yeah so

00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:13.220
what else is going on

00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:18.980
no I like it any time have a negative

00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:20.329
thought did I sing about the Orion group

00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:22.640
I'm like it it's on site if I even focus

00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:24.529
perceive the Orion group dude outside

00:58:24.529 --> 00:58:26.749
for sure that's the dark goblin X what I

00:58:26.749 --> 00:58:28.309
meant to talk about big dork Goblin has

00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:30.380
been named that's the dark island I name

00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:32.450
the dark Goblin shall be van read his

00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:33.710
name out loud yep

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:35.599
dark album was vanished for me this

00:58:35.599 --> 00:58:38.180
weekend good weekend the Goblin didn't

00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:40.099
appear so the Goblin tends to disappear

00:58:40.099 --> 00:58:42.289
around times of merriment and then as

00:58:42.289 --> 00:58:43.910
soon as the merriment goes away it

00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:46.369
[ __ ] pops in the corner yeah ghastly

00:58:46.369 --> 00:58:48.529
figure be gone yeah but you have to

00:58:48.529 --> 00:58:50.390
[ __ ] give it perfect [ __ ] you have to

00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:52.519
look at it if you like I know this is

00:58:52.519 --> 00:58:54.019
not you have nothing against I stared

00:58:54.019 --> 00:58:56.059
down to goblin well yeah dark dark

00:58:56.059 --> 00:58:57.349
dementia so if your negatively polarized

00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:59.930
there's you put so much strength into

00:58:59.930 --> 00:59:02.420
being what does it polarize toward

00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:03.890
service of the self it's really hard to

00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:06.019
do that so if you're confronted anyway

00:59:06.019 --> 00:59:07.400
with positive energy you like

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:09.230
and you have to get away from me so

00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:10.700
that's all you gotta do and the dark

00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:13.640
Goblin is also part of the Orien you met

00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:17.150
him Darwin was a change summoned the

00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:19.210
dark table it was the dark Alan was

00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:21.589
whenever you basically would stand up

00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:23.839
you'd have a bad set yeah the dark I'll

00:59:23.839 --> 00:59:26.750
come visit you laying in bed at night

00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:28.789
there's just rough times the God every

00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:30.500
time I smoked weed the Goblin would just

00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:34.039
jump in bed with me yeah that's the dark

00:59:34.039 --> 00:59:35.720
goblin and you three o'clock in the

00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:37.369
morning you wake up and you just take an

00:59:37.369 --> 00:59:39.109
honest assessment of your life and

00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:42.559
you're like make it stop yeah and any

00:59:42.559 --> 00:59:44.089
retreats sometimes you can keep him at

00:59:44.089 --> 00:59:46.160
bay and have a good time and be happy

00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:50.599
the Goblin will come back oh yeah it's

00:59:50.599 --> 00:59:52.670
good to have around everyone goblin was

00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:54.380
at bay for me for a year and then the

00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:56.900
Goblin reared his head and you know the

00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:59.539
darkest way possible just bought [ __ ]

00:59:59.539 --> 01:00:02.150
me true pop dog came back that was that

01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:03.920
clip you post it was so [ __ ] funny

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:07.059
hey check this guy out

01:00:12.010 --> 01:00:14.180
they tried to be like hey what do you

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:15.380
think of this guy and everyone was like

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:22.039
dude I will say though don't eating the

01:00:22.039 --> 01:00:24.500
Goblin is the the most that's the

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.420
journey of life the most important thing

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.369
in life is to confront confront the

01:00:28.369 --> 01:00:30.020
Goblin and even rest see you for what

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.940
you are exactly and even recognizing the

01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:34.220
Goblin will either well even if even the

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:35.720
Goblin will eventually have to choose

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:38.029
the path of light but you can only get

01:00:38.029 --> 01:00:39.440
so far and service itself before you

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.940
gets like the fifth density and then

01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:42.740
it's like you have no choice do you want

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:44.329
you through the six and when you die the

01:00:44.329 --> 01:00:46.970
Goblin does so don't worry no goblins

01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:48.349
gonna die with he's out there your

01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:51.380
goblin who me my goblin will die when I

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:54.349
die there's there's so many that's no

01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:55.700
way what are you talking about you're

01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:57.410
talking about your individual goblin the

01:00:57.410 --> 01:01:00.410
interim no the interdimensional entity

01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:02.420
dude they're here before you bro when I

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:04.010
die yeah exactly

01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:07.369
I'm gone the goblins gone with me peace

01:01:07.369 --> 01:01:11.990
all my problems are gone goblins gone to

01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:15.650
herds gone no it depends how familiar

01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:17.839
other people are with your goblin I

01:01:17.839 --> 01:01:19.490
think

01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:22.100
you say now well it's like you know if

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:26.210
if Shane describes his dark goblin just

01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:28.430
to me or to someone like then you carry

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:29.750
that goblin with you

01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:31.610
true they they are very shareable

01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:34.580
they're very shareable yeah I don't like

01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:36.860
what would what would they be anxious

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:39.380
about I can read JC as a negative

01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:48.650
thought he goes I supported you and your

01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:52.970
dog is down look so sad Oh Connie

01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:54.410
there's nothing worse than a sad Oh

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:56.930
Connie dude tough to look at it's tough

01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:58.369
especially in the realm of stand-up if

01:01:58.369 --> 01:01:59.720
your does anywhere else and you're

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.640

saying the n-word wait how's he doing

01:23:01.770 --> 01:23:09.030

01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:13.860
sick to knock it on SNL and then

01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:16.250
immediately

01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:18.810
Wow that would have taken you even if

01:23:18.810 --> 01:23:20.940
the even if it went terribly it would be

01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:23.219
the funniest thing yeah I don't know if

01:23:23.219 --> 01:23:24.540
I could stay in the pocket though and

01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:26.790
make fun of it I would have I would like

01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:28.440
try to get into it and it would be

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:56.159
[ __ ] unbelievably bad this on him he

01:23:56.159 --> 01:24:07.110
was practicing I saw that line at 3 in

01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:11.210
the morning last night and I stuck with

01:24:44.719 --> 01:24:47.250
MTV programming is pretty bleak pretty

01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:50.070

that shows she was pretty bad insane I

01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:54.420
think the thing that I was bothered out

01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:56.219
but not necessarily people perform it

01:24:56.219 --> 01:24:57.599
the people in the audience are like yeah

01:24:57.599 --> 01:25:00.000

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:48.610
where he kills like five guards while

01:29:48.610 --> 01:29:49.330
he's handcuffed

01:29:49.330 --> 01:29:51.520

01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:54.510
yeah yeah

01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:59.190
that's what's up sorry I just spaced out

01:29:59.190 --> 01:30:01.990
