kind of like I wouldn't be able to do it

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.289

like an idiot they were four there were

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:12.780
four of you were wearing a helmet like

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.310
VR goggles and I was sitting at the

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:15.960
sitting at the front of the boat while

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.490
we were driving and other boats would go

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:18.750
by and definitely be like that guy is

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.690

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:24.180
wearing VR on the front

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.220
I thought your via virtual reality on

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.190
the lake yeah activity good move to go

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:31.260
to a lake you go to like a nice like

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.900
area and this VR out it might be the

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.640
sickest move you can possibly do

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.020
yeah going on vacation and staying

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.340
inside and playing video games the whole

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.740
time it's actually the coolest thing you

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.650
can do area like have somebody yeah like

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:45.240
if your parents are rich they buy like a

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:45.840
nice place

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.580
you just sit inside and play video games

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.190
that's the move you are King the video

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:52.230
game at the beach is Power Move I have a

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.790
cousin who did that constantly it would

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:55.080
like really you'd all go to the beach

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.970
and he would just sit in front of the PS

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:58.260
and chill and they got what we doing

00:23:58.260 --> 00:23:59.820
right you know why

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.530
sick-ass move I don't know why when I

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:03.810
was a kid I never even I couldn't even

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:07.040
fathom taking the system out of my house

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.540

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.360
ever moved at console once yeah I didn't

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.420
think people had that idea back then

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.680
Nintendo you you didn't want to jostle a

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.330
thing or other Nintendo can jostle it

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:20.010
yeah I think state you want to drill

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:21.000
that thing like it's safe into the

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.230
ground dude it's like soon as that me

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.210

did tell you this but I didn't tell you

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.160
the full tale sprang into action last

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.890

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:41.880

were like bringing stuff out to the car

00:42:51.099 --> 00:42:52.900
and I for the next 20 minutes while

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:57.059
packing I was livid

00:42:59.289 --> 00:43:00.609
I'll get this in the back for you it's

00:43:00.609 --> 00:43:02.529

00:43:02.529 --> 00:43:05.289
like I just took me back to like going

00:43:05.289 --> 00:43:06.789

00:43:06.789 --> 00:43:08.019
when you get packing and like somebody

00:43:08.019 --> 00:43:10.269
just like five minutes left the packing

00:43:10.269 --> 00:43:15.640
is honkers doesn't show up grab the

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.910
birds out in the move was a good move

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:20.859
I'll give her that she but it was if she

00:43:20.859 --> 00:43:23.559
claimed it and I you know I had to come

00:43:23.559 --> 00:43:25.100
to terms with

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.550
it was a real torment I was it's

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:30.230
confusing cuz they're part of me is like

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:32.810
I should I should be sitting there and

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:34.540
then the other part of me was like

00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:38.480
you're an adult yeah this is it's weird

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.520
for you to be upset about who's sitting

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.680
where where did you end up grappling

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.330
with those two I set directly behind her

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:46.310
and just [ __ ] any kind of seat

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:48.650
giverny I made the [ __ ] stood are you

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:50.780
kidding me it was like it was it was

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:52.940
like what someone reclines on a train or

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:57.340
an airplane I was [ __ ] the whole time

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:02.900
[Laughter]

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:22.040
with the Frankenstein yeah I was [ __ ]

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:24.050
I'd like actually double slaps the sides

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:40.610
of our lair like I I don't know though I

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:42.970
think I'm right on this I mean it's a

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:45.080
that's a toughie I mean again I think

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.580
the only thing you can do only the

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:48.590
O'Connor gonna do is feel ashamed just

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:50.900
shame in that he did a shame it's just

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.250
kind of like damn this is wrong

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:55.730
he saw me see her put her book bag in

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:59.080
the front seat and heard me laugh

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:02.600
I'd be dogged I hate I'd hate to be in

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.150
that position that's a tough one cuz and

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:08.360
she's yeah she's nice and smart enough

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:11.660
like if you were like sit in the back

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:14.360
she'd be like what are you [ __ ] 12

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:17.810
I mean like are you sexist no are you 11

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:19.430
like walk in the back she'd hit you with

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:22.370
the sexism yeah yeah I am in the back

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:25.370
this is one of the last true American

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:27.410
sexism zwi are allowed to still have

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:31.200
women sit in the back when there's men

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:34.109

really yes she sat in the front I was in

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:39.890
the back I was like I should be up there

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:44.180
that's true I say you need to get up

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:46.799
who's Rosa I'm trying to decide for

00:45:46.799 --> 00:45:48.329
who's Rosa Parks in this scenario right

00:45:48.329 --> 00:45:50.490
now she used Rosa Parks she said I

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:52.650

00:45:56.099 --> 00:45:57.950
what's she [ __ ] doing up there

00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:02.030
this is defying societal roles oh my god

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:05.430
but yeah so that was all day that was

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:07.500
and then you know O'Connor's car is a

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.630
piece of [ __ ] that has no like the odd

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:11.099
the audio is destroyed you can only

00:46:11.099 --> 00:46:13.530
listen to the radio how they how they

00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:15.020
deal with it

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:18.089
shoot some questions early on about the

00:46:18.089 --> 00:46:20.760
sound system thanks bro

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.230

but she's a good baby I hear but it was

00:46:27.329 --> 00:46:30.720
uh but you know I mean that's something

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.280
we got an indica it's a tough call I

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.049
mean all you mentally need to seat the

00:46:34.049 --> 00:46:34.500
whole time

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:36.390
making the most uncomfortable ride I

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:38.339
need to see for the first for longer

00:46:38.339 --> 00:46:39.030
than I should have

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:40.859
did you for a while and then I realized

00:46:40.859 --> 00:46:47.549
I don't think it was doing anything yes

00:46:47.549 --> 00:46:49.589
I was doing that did she say anything

00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:52.490
didn't say a word

00:46:53.839 --> 00:46:56.099
there's no ID even knew that there was a

00:46:56.099 --> 00:47:03.510
battle going on but there was and then I

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:05.220
spent probably we've spent a good like

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.260
45 minutes of me talking about how sick

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:09.900
Trump was both of them so you're doing a

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.059
PSYOP say you're doing a fly off going

00:47:12.059 --> 00:47:14.340
on getting after whatever I could

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:21.320
[Laughter]

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.809
honestly like the last knee to the back

00:47:27.809 --> 00:47:29.160
you mean like a [ __ ] and sitting and

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.230
being like I think Trump's handling

00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:35.030
close that one-minute break of like

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:36.510
what's next

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:38.690
[Laughter]

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:41.130
horrible stuff I was texting

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:43.410
Mullen and Mullen was giving me the

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:44.940
rundown I was like you know I'm fighting

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:47.430
with [ __ ] gay-ass liberal people tell

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:49.500
me what to say cuz he knows what to say

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.599
yeah I'm an idiot I can't back it up

00:47:51.599 --> 00:47:55.050
O'Connor O'Connor's tough to debate in

00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:56.369
this cuz he follows it but he only

00:47:56.369 --> 00:47:58.560
follows like extremely Democrat news

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:01.140
he's very like I'm like what did Trump

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:04.140
dude it's bad he's like he fired the you

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:07.230
know the pandemic response team that we

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:11.400
need and I was like we need it but oh it

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:14.540
started under Obama how do we make it

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:17.280
how did we do it as a country ed we get

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.420
the whole way to Obama without a

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:21.210
pandemic response team oh hey - just

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:23.220
[ __ ] sit there maybe I'm paranoid it

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:25.260
seems strange that you know all of a

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:26.339
sudden there's this pandemic response

00:48:26.339 --> 00:48:29.700
team started last election I was trying

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:33.270
to Google uh like cuz it's every four

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:34.560
years is there like some sort of

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.240
catastrophe that happens right dude the

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.770
fact this is what every year there's one

00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:40.589
over year it out oh yeah this is like

00:48:40.589 --> 00:48:43.020
for this to happen right now not there's

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:44.400
obviously not there's there's nothing

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.920
this big every year but there is you

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:48.750
could every year every two or three

00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:52.020
years there's like a swine flu Oh avian

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:56.339
flu yes just you know sorry

00:48:56.339 --> 00:49:03.260
MERS Sarsgaard SARS SARS no soccer stars

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:05.730
what are they gonna do when it comes out

00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:10.260
to the fact that of it China they China

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:14.849
China China what are they gonna do and

00:49:14.849 --> 00:49:16.339
they don't get the numbers they wanted

00:49:16.339 --> 00:49:18.569
when they don't get the fatalities they

00:49:18.569 --> 00:49:20.670
needed to be right yeah the left will

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:22.890
now this is Mullen put this in my head

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:25.950
today so I'm it is correct yeah if he

00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:27.810
says something like about politics is

00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:29.310
unlike that's totally true

00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:32.579
he's learned it I think he he's he's an

00:49:32.579 --> 00:49:40.319
autistic great white as well duh yeah he

00:49:40.319 --> 00:49:43.050
was just he was just you know like

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:44.280
because they said I guess the

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.750
projections the DES projections are

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:48.690
getting lowered to like 60,000 total or

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:50.579
like by August which is when it's

00:49:50.579 --> 00:49:51.750
supposed to be kind of winding down and

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:54.150
it's like those numbers are flu that's

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:56.339
flu number four four times lower than

00:49:56.339 --> 00:49:58.860
what everybody was freaking out and

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:01.770
acting even with social distancing so

00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:04.070
basically what the left will do is

00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:06.840
pretend that this [ __ ] didn't hat like

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:09.720
the reason that it we only had low

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:12.240
numbers was because of them if they

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.560
wouldn't a stepped in and helped Trump

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:15.270
would have killed a million people so if

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:17.640
it wasn't for people being like so we

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.640
got to wear mast and it wasn't for

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.250
up-speak we all would be dead yeah if it

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:27.690
wasn't for condescending [ __ ] who

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:28.680
else saves the day other than

00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.960
condescending [ __ ] that's all we are

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:31.380
now

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:33.330
yeah it's true well that's dude I'm

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:34.470
telling you man we hit

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:36.510
so we're projected to hit flu numbers

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:38.430
and they're in big wells because we

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:40.470
stayed inside otherwise we did what we

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:43.050
did it's like now dude that's we always

00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:44.840
food shoppers we didn't look at Sweden

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:46.680
yeah what's up with that

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:49.950
Sweden they just didn't do [ __ ] they're

00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:52.050
like look we trust our citizens to like

00:50:52.050 --> 00:50:55.260
use precaution just they kept bars open

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:57.660
they kept everything open and they're

00:50:57.660 --> 00:50:59.580
fine and they're doing just as good as

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:02.160
anybody else I mean there's no real

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.870
difference I think I said this before

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:05.310
imagine being in another country and

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:06.900
we're like people are banded together

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:10.200
over like everyone who's already kind of

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:13.350
jacked up getting sick and dying it's

00:51:13.350 --> 00:51:16.830
like yeah dude yeah like this is killing

00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:19.140
our eighty-five year olds with stage 4

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:20.370
cancer and it's like other countries

00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:25.590
like what you have 85 year olds what we

00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:27.750
have 85 year olds

00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:29.750
[Laughter]

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:32.640
yeah I just don't get it

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:35.130
if you know you guys fine even make any

00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:41.850
sense and then uh well you could say

00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:47.520
they're killing 85 year old yeah and

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.770
then it's like if you are you show the

00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:51.270
symptoms and you're not like super old

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:54.690
they tell you like no no no we don't we

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:56.700
don't we don't need to test you it's

00:51:56.700 --> 00:52:00.930
like what gives I don't know man I'm

00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:02.820
just glad today's the first day I felt

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:05.040
like I this thing's gay and it's over

00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:07.290
yeah and then like this is gonna be the

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:10.080
worst week bro I'm at my mommy and

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:11.790
daddy's eating steak is

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:14.130
as bad you tell me if this is bad cuz

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:16.050
right now kovetz treating me pretty well

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:18.510
yeah dude certainly and I made certain

00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:22.980
our pox you know I'm on Fox true all the

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:25.470
stand up stand up is hurting a lot but

00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:27.540
you know that's most of my it's a good

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:31.110
chunk of my revenue there whatever oh

00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:33.870
yeah man it's uh some [ __ ] dude I

00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:37.230
think in more than I'd say not for eight

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:38.820
years from now to elections from now

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:42.420
after Trump maybe two elections after

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:45.060
Trump I think second term oh yeah I mean

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:47.880
the Trump dynasty I think there is going

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:51.030
to be a party like almost like a tea

00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:53.880
party that is going to actively platform

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:57.980
on wrangling pedophiles adrenochrome

00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:02.430
there's gonna be like a yeah wonderful

00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:04.110
party the queueing on people are gonna

00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:07.080
grow up yeah I do think that's gonna be

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:09.030
like a real political force coming up of

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:11.850
like the deep states that's not gonna go

00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:14.130
away that's the future of the Republican

00:53:14.130 --> 00:53:16.220
Party I like battling the deep state

00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:19.110
which is pretty tight yeah that's a

00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:21.330
tough party for me to decline and say no

00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:23.460
to cuz that's a sick political party I'm

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:25.620
joining that political party 100% as

00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:27.960
soon as release that the like we're just

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.030
our main goal is to round up pedophiles

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:33.300
and you know make sure corporations

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:36.090
don't control our personal data oh man

00:53:36.090 --> 00:53:38.640
dude like ours we got to get rid of

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.410
those they spent they sent a documentary

00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:41.850
around you see a documentary one around

00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:44.160
the group chat of the no I didn't watch

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.780
it it's not man who went rogue and

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:47.520
started investigating all the freaks in

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:50.370
Hollywood it was wrong it's pretty good

00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:54.450
they they go into how like Disney used

00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:56.130
to do like Disney did trade up war

00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:58.040
propaganda and the question is is like

00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:01.080
you think they stopped when do you think

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:03.480
they stopped doing that and why and it's

00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:05.160
like I don't think they did dude it's

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:08.400
like if you don't even look theory so so

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.930
Disney would they have like things from

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:12.150
the 40s of Disney doing like you know I

00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:14.490
think it was like taxes destroy the axis

00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:16.920
the axes power whatever so they were

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.390
doing things like there was

00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:19.980
entertainment that was specifically

00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:21.750
supposed to rile people up for civic

00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:23.070
causes and it's like the question is

00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:25.170
like has that ever stopped I don't think

00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:25.710
it has

00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:27.359
but then when people get weird about the

00:54:27.359 --> 00:54:29.190
conspiracy stuff it's like what are the

00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:31.470
things that they have done since that I

00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:32.880
think like the black like the timing of

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:34.500
like Black Hawk Down movies stuff like

00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:36.720
that like when it's time to rally the

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.220
troops it's like all of a sudden there's

00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:40.559
these you know and I I think that's case

00:54:40.559 --> 00:54:42.059
I think that does happen I think there's

00:54:42.059 --> 00:54:43.319
probably don't yeah I don't even think

00:54:43.319 --> 00:54:44.490
that's a conspiracy

00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:46.500
that's just like hey I think we can make

00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:47.970
some money there's a lot of patriotism

00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:50.220
right now after you know [ __ ] 9/11

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:53.099
let's let's put that out flight 93 well

00:54:53.099 --> 00:54:54.480
it's not even the conspiracy is that

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:57.359
there is people other than purely profit

00:54:57.359 --> 00:55:00.270
driven filmmakers who get to say who get

00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:01.619
the green light what like you get to say

00:55:01.619 --> 00:55:03.240
like you know slide a script down like

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:05.220
say there's somebody in the CIA who gets

00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:07.230
to talk to like a Harvey Weinstein he's

00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:09.630
probably compromised and be like no we

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:11.010
need this one way you think the CIA is

00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:12.720
in cahoots with the tightwads

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:16.289
yes so to speak in a fit in so many

00:55:16.289 --> 00:55:18.480
words yes in terms of I I do believe

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:19.829
that it's like they could be like you

00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:21.329
know we need this this movie to come out

00:55:21.329 --> 00:55:25.170
now but the and again that's my dude we

00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:30.930
need Nicolas Cage to be in 9/11 we need

00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:33.119
Nicolas Cage to find the stuff at the

00:55:33.119 --> 00:55:36.510
Liberty bill get it yes but the this is

00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:38.549
this is my with the conspiracy stuff

00:55:38.549 --> 00:55:43.109
it's like so we get to rule the world on

00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:46.200
overt strength and military force which

00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:47.670
at the end of the day you need to kill

00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:51.000
people in order to rule so the people

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.789
who are the best at killing for some

00:55:53.789 --> 00:55:54.990
reason people don't think they would

00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:56.700
like manipulate minds and propagandize

00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:58.020
it doesn't make sense to me why that

00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:00.240
it's like one thing that will totally go

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:01.710
and devastate a country for oil but

00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:04.020
we're not gonna lie and propagandize i

00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:05.819
don't even think it's i don't even know

00:56:05.819 --> 00:56:07.140
if it's lying i think it's just a

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:08.730
hundred percent what is i don't even

00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:10.799
think that's a conspiracy dude I think

00:56:10.799 --> 00:56:12.690
it's just wood I don't think there's

00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:13.980
anything conspiratorial about that I

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:16.140
think it's just like it's nighttime

00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:17.670
saying it's not but if you if you're you

00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:18.900
know if you were to take let's say Oh

00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:20.670
Connie he'd be like nah dude we're in a

00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:21.990
total democracy we vote we have the

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:23.460
Senate and the Senate has the house and

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:25.289
the house vetoes the things and sends

00:56:25.289 --> 00:56:26.520
them back and if everybody agrees it's

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:29.400
like to do Chris Koos Chris is a punk

00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:32.069

best killing stuff rule

00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:42.630
wins every yes chills when you say like

00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:44.730
all these are people who kill to

00:56:44.730 --> 00:56:46.380
maintain power you don't think they lie

00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:48.240

thing that would make me like him more

00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:05.640
is if he joined the incredible tandem of

00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:09.260
you know Vince Vaughn and Mel Gibson

00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:12.540

yeah [ __ ] that [ __ ] I started I so I

01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:33.730
have another audio book I started dude

01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:36.080
might be the best thing I've ever ever

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.510
[ __ ] put my eyes on it's called the

01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:41.840
shallows yeah it's about I I think it's

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:43.190
about it what I thought it was when I

01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:44.360
downloaded they haven't even talked

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.170
about it yet

01:07:45.170 --> 01:07:46.430
how the Internet is changing our brain

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:47.839
and how like you know computers are

01:07:47.839 --> 01:07:49.880
changing our brain and they go all the

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:51.890
way back I think I told you before about

01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:54.260
when they went back to like a like

01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:55.880
clocks and [ __ ] when like clocks got

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:57.740
invented and all that yeah like how

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.960
there was just like wasn't time really

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.220
and all of a sudden their people were

01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:02.839
like they were just ding bells make it

01:08:02.839 --> 01:08:04.160
come on come on you guys keep it moving

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.410
with the fire and how so that was like a

01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:08.359
technology that can't like a clock came

01:08:08.359 --> 01:08:10.849
out people like [ __ ] man now I gotta be

01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:12.349
at this plate like you know yeah you

01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:14.089
were late that was a crime against God

01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:15.589
because it was the Christian monks were

01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:17.509
the ones who started clocks so it was

01:08:17.509 --> 01:08:19.489
worth a year who made like I guess who

01:08:19.489 --> 01:08:20.960
like organized society around them or

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.420
whatever like mechanics so that was why

01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:24.620
like if you're late and people Scalla

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:26.509
you back then you were being a scalawag

01:08:26.509 --> 01:08:27.710
dude it's like dude you're a sinner

01:08:27.710 --> 01:08:28.880
you're sinning right now

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:31.730
God gave us time and you're not honoring

01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:33.350
it which is there's a funny life

01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:34.660
arrangers they go through Harold's

01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:37.160
pretty tight they go through all that

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:40.520
and then they get to books which is

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.739
writing in books and it's the funniest

01:08:42.739 --> 01:08:44.480
[ __ ] things I talk about ancient

01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:47.480
Greece and so you know back you know

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:49.880
like the oral tradition was like no one

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:51.020
wrote anything it was just like whatever

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:53.029
as much stuff as you can store in your

01:08:53.029 --> 01:08:55.790
head that's how sick you were so I was

01:08:55.790 --> 01:08:57.140
like if you could just memorize a ton of

01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:59.000
[ __ ] you were the man that was all you

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.339
could hope to do and then people started

01:09:01.339 --> 01:09:02.600
writing stuff down and like they were

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.630
just like I think Socrates was just like

01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:07.520
so [ __ ] lame dude I can talk for like

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.529
six hours dude why would I say anything

01:09:09.529 --> 01:09:12.980
that's like how I feel about tinder like

01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:15.859
oh you're funny and text please that's

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:18.589
how it was charming through gifts [ __ ]

01:09:18.589 --> 01:09:20.960
you dude that's how it was with with

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:23.299
writing itself it was a plato was like

01:09:23.299 --> 01:09:25.549
Socrates pupil was like oh no Socrates

01:09:25.549 --> 01:09:27.380
writings pretty [ __ ] sick dude I can

01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:29.690
like record these saw thoughts that I

01:09:29.690 --> 01:09:31.580
forget I can like look at him again he

01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:33.679
was like pish-posh dude I'll never write

01:09:33.679 --> 01:09:38.299
anything though they they went into like

01:09:38.299 --> 01:09:40.880
support that the [ __ ] writing right 200

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:43.219
percent support the who was it Socrates

01:09:43.219 --> 01:09:45.199
yes Socrates dude he was just like this

01:09:45.199 --> 01:09:47.029
is and it was like it was kind of like

01:09:47.029 --> 01:09:49.339
pissed people off because like right

01:09:49.339 --> 01:09:50.929
again writing was something that changed

01:09:50.929 --> 01:09:52.160
the way our brains work because it was

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:55.000
like there was no like the idea of

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.750
interacting with another person's

01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:58.280
thoughts like that was nobody did it

01:09:58.280 --> 01:09:58.790
everyone

01:09:58.790 --> 01:10:00.350
like here's all the [ __ ] you memorize

01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:02.450
everyone's the same cool I'm glad we're

01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:03.470
on this so you can't remember stuff

01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:05.900
you're [ __ ] dumb you go farm I get to

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:07.520
sitting outside and like a toga and just

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:10.490
all day just be like and then so then

01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:12.500
they started doing a like writing on

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:15.200
paper and like books and they had at

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.400
first they had you know people would

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:18.380
just pick up like we do now it was like

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:19.640
the first writing was just like you

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:21.560
finally a broken piece of a clay pot and

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.060
you were just like like all right I have

01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:24.560
nine goats and you would like store that

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.730
somewhere that was like the first

01:10:25.730 --> 01:10:27.440
writing and then they started doing I

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.330
think app IRA scrolls where it would be

01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:32.540
like you would you take like the vine or

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:34.190
the the thread of papyrus whatever the

01:10:34.190 --> 01:10:36.470
[ __ ] it is yeah in Egypt yeah yeah right

01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:37.760
near now you're right and you'd heat

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.620
press it like a rosin press basically

01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:41.870
that would gave original scrolls and

01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:43.820
then you know so that all you could have

01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:45.200
was the [ __ ] long scrolls and then

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:48.380
they did wax tablets were like the Codex

01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:50.240
where you would have a wax thing you

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.740
would scratch stuff in then you flip it

01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:53.060
over that was the first book was just

01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:55.970
like yeah wax tablets was that desperate

01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:57.590
no naughty this was this is pretty

01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:59.480
Gutenberg pre-press it's pretty print

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:01.700
press dude when writing first came out

01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:04.040
it was in a wax tablet and there was no

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:06.410
space between the words so it was just

01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:08.930
like it was just a block of text that

01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:12.290
nobody read everybody read aloud so you

01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:13.790
would get a book and just be like by

01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:18.980
yourself like once upon a time so they

01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:22.670
had so then yes that that's how and then

01:11:22.670 --> 01:11:24.920
so everything was like block text where

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:26.300
you'd have to sit there and try to like

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:28.340
decipher what the [ __ ] it said and then

01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:29.780
eventually they started spacing the

01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:32.120
words and doing all those like Thomas

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.040
Aquinas saw a guy reading silently

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.020
and was like what's this guy's [ __ ]

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:38.540
problem what a weird yeah I thought it's

01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:39.830
pretty [ __ ] crazy man yeah I mean

01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:41.510
it's also funny to see people figure out

01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:44.090
how to spell like even if you look at

01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:46.400
[ __ ] from a hundred years ago more than

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:49.160
that but like you look at like Civil War

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:51.320
like anything from back then people were

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.090
still guessing words oh it's all

01:11:53.090 --> 01:11:54.320
phonetic hundred percent

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.420
it was just like dude imagine no

01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:58.220
autocorrect and you have a [ __ ] stone

01:11:58.220 --> 01:11:59.720
tablet you got to write something in -

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:03.800
dude just it's it's over being like

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:08.030
carving like ooh I read it out loud and

01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:09.950
what the [ __ ] is it saying that was

01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:11.510
cracking me up - people sitting and

01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:12.690
reading books out loud -

01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:14.790
selves in their apartment and only like

01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:16.290
it'll be like the only the sickest dudes

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:16.890
could read

01:12:16.890 --> 01:12:19.430
so just be a guy just like and then

01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:25.830
there one guy had a cat that's wild man

01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:27.600
but yeah that's it I'm a that always

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:30.630
makes me feel better about like you know

01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:34.560
being a Luddite if you will like people

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.600
that are like the Internet's of you

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.489
[ __ ] ruining us it's like well that

01:12:38.489 --> 01:12:39.900
has literally has happened with every

01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:42.180
single change technologically every

01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:44.460
technological advance in human history

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:45.900
people have been upset about

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:48.360
yeah like well this is gonna ruin it no

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.310
that's it almost always helps well

01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:52.170
here's here's my beef of the Internet

01:12:52.170 --> 01:12:53.699
and it's like yeah writing was a sick

01:12:53.699 --> 01:12:55.440
chew and it was like the even reading

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:57.780
changed the way that's why I think we

01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:59.550
have to memorize [ __ ] and like in grade

01:12:59.550 --> 01:13:01.500
school I think that the oral tradition

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:02.910
stuck with our grade school that's why

01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:04.350
we really we're forced to memorize all

01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:06.750
this [ __ ] it's [ __ ] dumb but

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:09.210
anyway on who did you want to fill big

01:13:09.210 --> 01:13:13.290
fill thought what's he want there he is

01:13:13.290 --> 01:13:18.540

01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:21.210

everyone and good luck getting through

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.080
the coronavirus during these challenging

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:37.350
times will only be stronger when we're

my family was kings dude up there and

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:26.780

try to toss me into the scoot anyway Tom

01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:43.940

01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:45.590
Titanic dude I'd go straight to the

01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.950

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:10.860
it's like Herbert Hoover you might have

01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:13.440

on the page whatever happens happens

01:23:59.550 --> 01:24:01.710
dude it's [ __ ] dark and twisted

01:24:01.710 --> 01:24:05.100
include actually seem kind of ashamed of

01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:09.780
your family's murderous past as an

01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:15.030
artist - dude what's worse is actually

01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:17.190
their doorman saw you drop some babies

01:24:17.190 --> 01:24:19.620

fast you like fish a phone out of the

01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:39.330

probably it's this dude you're acting

01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:48.600
like this is the Colorado dude whose

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:50.940

I traveled as Google as a kid a lot that

01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:11.430

great-grandma was definite

01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:21.580
murder corners you call her a snail uh

01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:25.910

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:33.920
worse a genuine I was holding my baby on

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:35.770

and somebody fell off and you can't find

01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:55.160

habit like that point he stopped me on

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:03.980
that my head my body was ready to move

01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:05.330
