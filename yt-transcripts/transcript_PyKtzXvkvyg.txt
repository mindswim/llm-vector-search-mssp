00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.070
humongous level with people beating this

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.300
[ __ ] out but it still is [ __ ]

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.710
annoying because I'm in this weird

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.840
upside-down world where I'm like there's

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.340
people trying to kick me out who say hi

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.260
to me and there's people like it's just

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.790
dude it makes things so bizarre to

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.440
navigate where you're like what the [ __ ]

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.940
are you guys doing and it's like it

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.830
sounds so trite but it's like do you

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.360
guys have anything going on for yourself

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.160
you have anything to do with your life

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.290
other than being like I'm gonna get this

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.060
guy's last name so I can YouTube them

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.170
which first of all is like dude really

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.030
yeah you can't get the link off someone

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.290
others people disseminating that's the

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.220
other [ __ ] with the YouTube things

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.990
there's people disseminating links in my

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.490
school they're gonna hit me with a hot

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.590
cash I told him to Google gay or the

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.670
nicest well the thing is I don't think

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.410
the guy would be like off-put by the

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.640
material he'd probably be like laughing

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.740
and [ __ ] but it's still like dude just

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.450
get the [ __ ] out of my face of this [ __ ]

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.390
and dude the teacher today start sorry

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.040
this is I try not to drone on about oh

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.940
no the teacher today [ __ ] uh there

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.250
was this long drawn-out example of like

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.020
some some dude was bringing it doing a

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.090
case presentation about a guy who was

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.830
like kind of being like there's an old

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.810
dude talking about like kind of talking

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.040
about like crushing [ __ ] and the guy

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.870
wanted to like distance himself from

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.880
that being like how do i disavow or even

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.290
say disavow but he's like how can I let

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.489
him know that I'm not okay with that

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.780
kind of language when in reality you're

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.979
supposed to devoting all your attention

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.600
to like being with this person despite

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.220
what you know whatever they're saying

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.530
was standing he was like how do I do

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.000
that the whole discussion was this guy

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.070
kind of bashing a client being like he's

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.750
so he thinks this and the girls are

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.270
laughing it was kind of like okay so

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.530
then afterwards I like don't say

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.270
anything class anymore and then after a

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.980
while towards the end it was I was just

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.930
asking like why is it even necessary for

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.670
you to tell that guy you're not okay

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.720
with that kind of behavior it's not

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.250
about you at all it's about that person

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.780
that's all I'm asking the teachers like

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.420
it's not disavowing it's like like what

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.890
if someone were to say like and you know

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.630
she did three examples and finally ended

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.100
on and this person was sitting in on

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.390
like the thing deciding if I could stay

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.100
in school or not it's like what if a

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.480
client was like all Chinese people

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.150
should die I'm sitting here like lady

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.370
are you [ __ ] serious right now all

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.560
Chinese people should die she said uses

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.690
that as an example and I'm in this world

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.620
were like I don't know who knows what

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.570
about what and I'm like it's at the

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.070
extrapolation they're making that was

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.990
said that dude it's just like it's

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.190
[ __ ] crazy

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.410
yeah or whatever he said Chinese food is

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.940
dishonest dude I was just sitting here

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.620
like and then she does that makes sense

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.930
I was like no I was like I gotta go and

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.160
the dude was like literally let me get

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.390
the YouTube Bozek go ask one of the

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.710
little [ __ ] 23 year old girls that

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:32.790

die all Chinese people should I I don't

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.460
agree with she's like I don't personally

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.840

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:45.550
like yeah I lost I won but then they

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.440
they all called me a [ __ ] so I guess I

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.449
lost it for sure what were the funny so

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:51.400
this guy was dealing with a child he was

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.990
doing well it's funny now you can just

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.580
say small you can just say small and

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.830
losing how they did you smoke this guy

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.229
and the therapist was gay so he got

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:08.020
called a [ __ ] he lost he lost the game

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.060
he was doing something with a kid and he

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.169
was like the kids like let's play this

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:12.610
game I talked about before there's kind

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.610
of funny the the kid he was like let's

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:16.719
play this game the therapy is like

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:17.919
that's kind of hard for a kid your age

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:20.139
it's a cool let's play and then the kid

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:22.539
lost school as soon as as soon as a

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:25.379
therapist cross the last piece the kid

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:27.639
was like oh actually you wrote like

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:29.319
4,000 words like that kids a [ __ ]

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:34.180
really but now I've been examining all

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.159
of my my colleagues and the oh that's

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:37.719
hilarious dude it's so funny and the

00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:39.009
articles really you read it's like

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:40.330
that's pretty [ __ ] good

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.319
the I've been examining my colleagues

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:46.150
under the big and winning and maybe big

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:47.710
and winning looks like going to all

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.750
female cohort and being like this what

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.430
this guy thinks about women and I'm not

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.050
for it it's like why is that the Pacific

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:54.699
thing you chose to pick out of this

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:56.860
person's background the report on are

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.479
you big and winning right now bro are

00:07:58.479 --> 00:07:59.590
you big and win are you trying to big

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:00.849
and win right now and that's what I've

00:08:00.849 --> 00:08:02.229
been examining the classroom I try to

00:08:02.229 --> 00:08:04.990
point out dude people [ __ ] don't like

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.029
that I'll tell you what well and I do it

00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:09.099
subtly - I don't be like oh yeah showing

00:08:09.099 --> 00:08:10.930
off for [ __ ] girls out but no exactly

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.699
there's no way to articulate it when

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:13.960
someone's big and winning like that the

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.650
only way to articulate it is a team like

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:20.050
that's the exact answer to it but you

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:25.629
were sitting at your desk just like like

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:27.129
I don't know we should be bringing

00:08:27.129 --> 00:08:28.629
people out and like pushing them around

00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:30.190
as oddities when really these are people

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.389
who need help and we should be exerting

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.279
stop trying you're late yeah it was like

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:38.620
[ __ ] man big and winning small losing

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.029
dichotomy is one of my favorite things

00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:41.979
right now and how present that is in

00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:43.810
everybody's lives at all doing it I

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:47.560
[ __ ] hate the intellectual it's like

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:55.120
we already had haves and have-nots we've

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.100
already done this a million times

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.630
shrill and nobody talked about the

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.570
hatred of the have-nots there's a real

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.220
hatred of the have-nots yeah they always

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.570
talk about the hatred of the haves and

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.880
have-nots or some pretty nasty

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.150

asking if a client is bringing up

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.630
something as horrendous as bragging

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.190

hung up on politics they can't meet

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.310
people where they're at I shouldn't be

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:57.660

like total racist scumbag when I'm in

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.230

well they've said that I know there's

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.710
people coming against me saying that I

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.140
have articulated sentiments that support

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:15.900
slavery I'm like what heard that bro

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.950
yeah but either way sorry I didn't mean

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:19.180
I don't like to hog it all of this stuff

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.060
this was heavy it was heavy on behind -

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.010
don't let the you're letting the reddit

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:25.360
comments hit you on that one don't let

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.040
them do I just want to make sure I want

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.120
this to be fun for everybody actually

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.010
that's true up Kanye now bro I'm not in

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:31.720
I'm not here to entertain anyone anymore

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.820
so come all about my CSC and that's it

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.290
dude my Christian scorecard I'm not here

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.950
for anyone's entertainment mm-hmm is

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:39.520
that crazy

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.830
but his article his point is pretty good

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:44.380
where he's like worrying about being

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.170
small and losing overtime makes you then

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.000
eventually just start hating it

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.650
eventually you start seeing gay people

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:53.260
as like [ __ ] that they embody small and

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.510
losing you and distance themself give

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.920
them a quick charley horse you're like

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.260
yes oh really

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.250
that's kind of what he says eventually

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:01.720
there's a logical leap in adulthood

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.160
where you like just hate gay people I

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.750
guess yeah I mean I'm sure that's where

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.690
actual homophobia comes from yeah look

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.680
at them they're weak I'm strong

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:15.340
let's jerk off together I'm gonna beat

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.420
you up and kick you out of my pickup

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.010
truck that jerk-off in my basement with

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:31.690
my friends and just be like I mean

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:32.920
there's a big difference between small

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:39.610
and losing and hard and coming well that

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.620
goes into the other Freudian stuff of

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.440
like how people want to identify with

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.090
like what they say the word was so funny

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.970
it was like a strong agentic penis

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:51.160
what's like your penis has agent and

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:56.650
like agentic member dude as if - become

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.630
more agentive you need an agent member

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.370
is [ __ ] he's a free agent

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:01.300
you know whatever the [ __ ] he wants

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.839
whenever you need to be chillin he just

00:13:04.839 --> 00:13:06.220

the middle of the atlantic ocean ocean

you don't have to give too much

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.270
historical knowledge did you ruin

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:23.790

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:28.900
maybe not the best no there's really no

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.580

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:38.620
of like a tempest

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:46.059
I check my [ __ ] oceanic geographies

00:19:46.059 --> 00:19:47.470
no that is pretty funny sorry you were

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:49.090
already treading on a very uncomfortable

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:51.280
topic and I made it was funny to me so

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.510
she told me a story I just sort of

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:53.830
laughing so it's so funny I'm like

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.300
that's just the funniest [ __ ] yeah

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.070
we're all learning how to swim and like

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.600
we all destroy I mean that's like the

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.160
equivalent of like yeah my white family

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.809
we took dance lessons and we all rolled

00:20:01.809 --> 00:20:05.980
our ankles exactly that is something

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.390
I've talked about before people about

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:10.450
the origin of I would say genuinely

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:11.920
white people being uncomfortable with

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.320
music mmm because we had that is

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.700
something that is kind of weird I wonder

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.380
where that comes from our inability to

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.150
like authentically dance and like have

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:19.900
you ever been to like an all-black

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.550
wedding and everyone's just [ __ ]

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:23.650
crushing it and cheering each other on

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:25.809
dancing lies whereas like it one of my

00:20:25.809 --> 00:20:27.220
weddings there was like everyone has to

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.929
do one of our weddings you have to get

00:20:28.929 --> 00:20:31.660
hammered got to get hammered to dance in

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.220
front of your uncle's people they're

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.840
like scold you for not dancing it's like

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.309
it's the opposite if you're a tall black

00:20:36.309 --> 00:20:37.480
wedding you know I think said that said

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.740
this they think you're kind of gay white

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:45.940
wedding seriously I've gotten lady at

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.440
the table I'd tell you when I danced

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.660
with Britney's grandma no and I was a

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.540
little too drunk I was like they'd

00:20:52.540 --> 00:21:01.030
separate you got rowdy cherry poppin

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:07.960
daddies we did like a music therapy

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:19.420
thing where every dance absolute

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.130
accident cream pie due to like Jamaican

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:25.570
stabbing go ahead say you were I was

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.280
just being like chided to dance and I

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.809
was like the lady asked me to dance like

00:21:28.809 --> 00:21:30.700
no I'm cool and ever like what the [ __ ]

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:31.900
you're gonna turn down our grand mom and

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.429
I was like you guys want me to dance to

00:21:33.429 --> 00:21:34.420
your [ __ ] ground with all these

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.520
things then I got hammered and I was so

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.840
[ __ ] stoned and I was just like

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.850
alright let's get out there and I was

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:46.059
just like you think I can't stand that

00:21:46.059 --> 00:21:48.220
yeah my brother's wedding you know they

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.690
had this like line up and then they

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:50.950
would like play music and then you'd

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:51.960
walk out

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:57.300
and dance I refuse to dance whoa I think

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.310
that's horrible for us there should be

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:01.470
totally rejoicing in song and dance it'd

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:04.020
be good for us no because I think the

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.940
reason I don't like it is because for

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:09.060
for white people it feels like a lot of

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.060
the dancing is you're laughing at the

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.070
person exactly it's it's not just but

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:15.600
that's not the right way too because

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.030
then you're like tacitly admitting that

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:19.680
this looks ridiculous so now I'm

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.900
supposed to get out there and like grind

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.690
my hips like [ __ ] grandmas right

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:26.760
there this is funny so you're saying

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.550
that and this is also undone thing cuz

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:32.370
you're right it's like oh I know yeah

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.410
and it's it's I so you're saying that we

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:37.140
kind of through the cultural melting pot

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.000
white people have been pushed into an

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.950
uncomfortable expectation of dancing

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:42.630
abilities and we need to take it back to

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:44.370
just like hinging on the elbows and

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:47.000
spinning around in circles for no no

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.560
really I think we've been taken out of

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:50.940
our depth I think we need to like slow

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:57.150
yeah the Irish exactly we did Swedish

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:58.230
slow it down I think we've been just

00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:59.550
pushed out of our depth I think that's

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:01.560
our problem I think we just need to like

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.850
shoulders you have to move your

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:04.800
shoulders I'm all shoulders I get made

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.270
fun of I don't do my hips that's the

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.490
problem I need I'm always getting made

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:10.110
fun of for not moving my hips properly

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:13.680
really yeah so dude we did a music

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.060
therapy thing where a lady came in and

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.900
just did like and everyone had a copy it

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.340
and instantly sinks the room up

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.900
everyone's on the same page it was so

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.240
[ __ ] nice and she was like my name is

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.690
that what it is or and people were like

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:30.180
John no one would do it do to hit me it

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.670
hit me I was like Matthew I hit a loud

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:34.850
one dude everyone was just like

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:36.870
everyone's like what the [ __ ] but I'm

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:38.850
like watching that student it is true if

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:39.780
you're in a room full of people when you

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.550
start tapping the desk in the same

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:43.590
rhythm it has this weird binding effect

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:45.120
where everyone's just kind of relaxes

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.340
everyone synced up all the [ __ ]

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.990
stops and then everyone's kind of

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:50.370
laughing and [ __ ] around it's fun and

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:51.420
then it was over and everyone's back

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:55.230
like people what did all these people

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:57.600
were all in like so and so into all this

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.100
stuff like yeah that's just like the way

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.780
they do it is it's like dude that's

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.370
weird we're literally doing like it was

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:03.990
like a that's what comedy is so nice

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.650

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:07.080
at the same time exactly we roma

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.270

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:11.790
exactly together yeah this thing

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:13.950
bypassing the left brain into the right

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:15.960
brain dude a little back door that's

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:16.710
what I'm talking about

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:18.390
but yeah everyone you would think all

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:19.830
these people would be all into the music

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.870
and dance dude we were doing like like a

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:23.340
chorus thing where a lady was singing a

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.810
line then we had to repeat like a row

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:26.520
row row dude it was the most fun I've

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.190
had in a room full of [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:31.530
in the longest time I was having such a

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.600
blast and I'm like damn this is such a

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.160
simple thing people could do and it's so

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.870
fun and yet we should start doing that

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:38.610
before the cast so I'm saying dude

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.200
especially when we have a [ __ ] wet

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:49.710
rag of a guest like this one you might

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:51.780
be the most the most hands-down

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.790
in-demand guest of all time yeah easy

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:55.890
always love you then easily everybody

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:58.080
loves you it's well that's about to come

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.610
to an end because it's I have been a wet

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:04.680
rag today this is every time every time

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.020
you leave thinking it was bad you cry

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:08.850
every time and people wanted you on here

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.620
again you'd you they need you inside I'd

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:11.850
literally woke up from a nap to do the

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:16.340
podcast and what yes thank God Steve pie

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:25.470
it was like because there was something

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:26.760
where was like accidental cream pie er

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.710
that was like the type of porn and it

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:31.740
like really it it actually upset me

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.570
until I it was clearly it was like bad

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:35.640
acting but II thought she really got

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.410
actually yeah yeah yeah cuz it was like

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:40.140
back when gonzo porn was kind of true

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.850
and you couldn't detect you like this

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.240
feels real like the bangbus felt like

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:48.270
true Sonia this she was also squirt

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:49.440
that's why the moment you're like

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.760
squirting and acts a little cream pies

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.690
that was my first posting back to him

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.460
what about on her this was before butts

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.530
were in mmm-hmm true she was ahead of

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:01.200
her time yeah before the honkies got hip

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.760
to the butt yeah how do you think they

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.960
got them women getting thick pots yeah I

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:10.710
would imagine the rise of hip hop into

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:12.000
pop culture had something to do with

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.040
yeah everyone all of a sudden being like

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.620
you know what the ass was

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.740
that's what I love true also the fact

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.059
that now they're all wearing like

00:26:20.059 --> 00:26:21.559
spandex so there's probably some like

00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:23.390
there's probably some big fat white

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:25.070
butts lurking that before it was like a

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:28.520
flannel and jeans the tight now the

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.280
tight pants have been around jeans like

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.500
the show bottoms [ __ ] like that true but

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.770
I think the rise of the yoga pants came

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:38.960
at the same time as fat BOTS and women

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.730
wanting to show off their fat ass it's

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:42.559
all lady in Walmart the other day it was

00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:48.530
cries of the yoga pants lady and Walmart

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:50.540
the other day just like she would see

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:51.950
someone Walmart is completely blown out

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:53.059
you look in their eyes and it's just

00:26:53.059 --> 00:26:54.380
like they might as well just be in two

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:55.580
different directions they're just gonna

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.500
like and I'm looking at this lady and

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.690
she just had this huge ass in spandex

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:01.850
and like some ridiculous shirt and I'm

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:04.490
like that's it that's like this lady has

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:06.860
a humongous butt and she is just cashing

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.700
that thing in hmm is that wrong

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:13.429
but I mean the rest of it was I was just

00:27:13.429 --> 00:27:15.200
like that's crazy just like yeah well I

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.640

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:56.300
know he's in constant chaos he's in

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:59.330
constantly like dealing and [ __ ] and

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:02.600
just like I understand I'm like I said

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.400
in you're right curbs that is a thing I

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.110
have because I'm very much in terms of

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:09.170
personality and like skeletons in the

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:11.240
closet very much like just let it out so

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.980
I your porn thing the more I think about

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.470
it I'm like that would be nice if we

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:20.450
could get to that sorry I'm really yeah

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:21.590
that's the thing I've been trying to get

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:23.330
out of is being on idea teams and just

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:25.760
not being like well automatically answer

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.280
like this because it's so hard but I

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.960
think that was really interesting about

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.820
the Kissinger book - it's like okay well

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.740
what's the counter and now I didn't even

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:36.290
know counter-arguments - I was if you

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:38.060
would say monopolies I'd be like they're

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.860
terrible but there are a

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.410
counter-argument to it and yeah

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:44.620
like I'm not saying that I'm I don't

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.150
necessarily think that the

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:48.350
counter-arguments are correct but I want

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:49.910
to be able to know them and articulate

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:52.070
them and abort yeah yeah I'm very

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:53.720
impressed by that steel Manning things

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.580
like Glenn Lowry can do we can just

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:59.930
rattle off in a succinct paragraph real

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:02.750
demonstration of the other argument yeah

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:05.620
that you're clearly familiar with it and

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.640
is that what steel Manning is me you're

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.620
like well somebody inclined to believe

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.480
this might say do you watch alas you

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.880
build up the counter-argument that what

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.560
you build up what you're arguing against

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.600
to you try and make it as good as

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.200
possible

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.190
yeah and you let them know you

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:20.510
understand what they're saying rather

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:25.850
than stroll Manny did you watch the last

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:28.250
Glenn Lowry Lowry with John McWhorter on

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:30.500
in like the heart importance of being an

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.990
individual part of it dude they you get

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:34.520
into the people just wanting to feel the

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:35.780
warmth of the crowd and all that stuff

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:39.020

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:41.330
know the types that would have my boys

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:42.950
head they're talking about how it's not

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:44.660
really coming from you have to be

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:45.860
patient with the fact that it's not

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:47.660
coming from a super logical place these

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:49.070
are just people who are lonely who were

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:50.510
just strictly trying to feel the warmth

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:52.280
of the crowd oh now that we're on the

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.050

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:49.580
scurried off he tweeted that out I saw

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:52.130
that actually I did and then deleted it

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:55.070
and was like I made a mistake i I didn't

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:56.450
corroborate the story correctly

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:58.970

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.480
patronizing way it's like i don't use

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.380
all right be like mid to early 20s and

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:18.110

water hit me with that yesterday I don't

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.560

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:33.490

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:36.980
well I know somebody tell me about the

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.540
[ __ ] are you gonna stop for it oh well

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.610
when you know your whole brouhaha was

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:43.700
going down this guy that I had he'd gone

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.250
to UPenn and he had done comedy at the

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:48.230
time and now he's an attorney but he

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:50.330
contacted me he's like I know that guy

00:33:50.330 --> 00:34:07.750
we I know that guy I guess

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.370
Shane Gillis his lawyer silences me

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:13.700
about it but but he so given the fact

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:15.230
that he knows and I would put that age

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:18.260
around like 33 oh really

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.030
yeah well no maybe that guy was older

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:21.679
when he did the Mike's with him oh no

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.240
they went to Penn together yeah yeah

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:27.550
Seth went to Penn good for him wow

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:29.630

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.520
League boy taken down nice you know just

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:36.260
a lowly state school Korea makes sense

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:37.610
he's a little older because you know

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:39.230
he's like he's been writing he's a

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:40.580
freelance right it takes a while to get

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.950
the kind of like he wrote for us lately

00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:44.600
yeah I don't want to do any like

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.580
research or anything into this guy no I

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.490
also like it days nice to know it was

00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:52.850
funny to see that tweet last night that

I saw that today somebody told me about

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:57.050
I don't look it up somebody told me like

00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:58.910
this is what he tweeted out and then he

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:02.180
deleted it because it's also funny to

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:05.240
act like he like he claimed he misheard

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.710
two different parts of the podcast like

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:08.090
because of one part of the podcast I was

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:09.770
talking about how when people DME

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:12.620
shitty things like [ __ ] you although if

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.110

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:17.180
emoji face is usually what it is sure

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:19.310

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:21.200
just [ __ ] around like sorry like very

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.730

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.430
your lesson like something like that

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:29.540
something once they stop yeah and he was

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:32.030
like I miss I combined two those two

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:34.760
stories because I thought the lady at

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:38.540
SNL apologized to Shane he said that she

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.490
apologized which somebody I was at the

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:43.010
bar with said he was there and she did

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:45.680
in Nepal that's journalism I'm drunk

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.000
right now and here's what happened I'm

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.560
drunk at a bar right now with somebody

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.900
who was like I was [ __ ] there it's

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.610
like dude you're in New York and you're

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:55.100
telling me you were in the earshot of

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:57.650
this conversation and now you're just

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.900
out of bar telling someone this and

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:01.850
that's that's what you're gonna tweet

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:04.220
out also what do they [ __ ] what do we do

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:07.730
in bro why why must this guy continue to

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:09.620
pop his like presents up it's like dude

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:11.930
I don't know I it's one of those things

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:13.820
that like I hear and I'm like you don't

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.320
even want to talk about it because it's

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.480
like just let this dude fade out into

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.070
the ether of whatever he didn't hit back

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:20.780
into his world of whatever the food's up

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:22.460
to but do when you get into the mortar

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.410
stuff of these people like wanting to

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:25.820
feel the warmth of that crowd and it's

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.370
like what are they willing to burn to

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:29.840
feel that who are they willing to

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:32.180
sacrifice to be like yeah yeah oh yeah

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:35.240
yeah a hundred were you likes on a tweet

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:38.930
yeah man it's [ __ ] up but I also think

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:41.300
he's in a spot where he has to be like

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.070
because there were enough people that

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:45.500
told him like hey [ __ ] you for this on

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.050
Twitter sure just you know random people

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:49.430
but I think he's at a point where he has

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:52.130
to be like no this guy is bad right so

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:54.080
he just has to keep constantly Beedrill

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.150
see he's bad I told you he was bad I

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:58.520
wasn't wrong he's bad but he's gonna

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.920
always be that's fine I don't care he

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.390
would never go on the record and like do

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:04.760
like a mentalize you which is like get

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.140
into your head and like well maybe this

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.480
and that it's just like bad I'm good and

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.740
that that's I'm telling you it's like

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:11.840
infantile thinking of like it's the good

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.840
guys the bad guys I can see some good in

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.460
him I'm sure there's some good there's

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.380
no way like I can't because people talk

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:19.820
to me about it and be like nah he's just

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.800
this [ __ ] dude [ __ ] him he's a [ __ ]

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.240
[ __ ] and it's like I don't know

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.610
I bet he's got some good things you know

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:27.740
I mean he's a journalist I respect

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.500
independent journalists like know

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:31.940
something else but I don't yeah but it's

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.430
also like I don't know I don't I tend

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:36.380
not to see people as just bad true

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:38.300
what's he doing out of child because

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.340
that's that's infant that's child is

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:41.840
thinking it'd be like good guys bad guys

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.450
of course I'm on the good team yeah

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:45.530
also too if the if there was a

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:47.000
discernible answer at any of this stuff

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.020
don't you think we would have [ __ ]

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:48.980
come across it by now

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.500
what do you mean of like how did Annette

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.300
how to run a country what's good what's

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.130
bad we've done all this [ __ ] in science

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:56.000
and don't you think we would have if

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.090
there was an actual answers yeah I don't

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:00.590
there's not I makes the thing I don't

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:02.000
know if he's trying to run a country

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.680
with it I think he's just trying to [ __ ]

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.030
it I know that's like you say exactly

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.610
but like yeah I don't I mean even

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:09.230
talking about it makes me feel weird cuz

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:11.510
then he's gonna [ __ ] be like me and

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:28.160
probably the M word Amazon Mike yeah yo

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.170
getting in Steve's head is the easiest I

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:31.880
called him an agoraphobe an hour later

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:38.420

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:45.109
are if you say it yes saying like a mean

00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:51.200
way no I'm done with it it was crazy it

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.450
was funny to see you last night I'm a

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:54.890
journalist I heard a guy's name this

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:56.750
just in I'm drunk right now and some

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:58.580
other drunk idiot said this and I'm

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.440

it's I'm living Lowrey kind of

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:07.640
interesting how this ends up playing out

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:11.210
because if like if the put the head down

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:16.760
and be funny thing and then at a certain

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:20.810
point if that that just doesn't hold any

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:23.869
weight what he's doing yeah it's just

00:39:23.869 --> 00:39:25.550
it's just a really interesting he'll

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:27.530
adapt in more fit whatever wouldn't know

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:29.330
whatever else becomes in fashion he'll

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:30.980
adapt it morph himself to that and then

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.320
does embody that whatever it is the you

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:36.250

exhausting yeah that was that was

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:35.050

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.980
person just talking [ __ ] on you not like

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:01.910

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:04.970
that I'm spazzing I'm [ __ ] spiking I

00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:06.980

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:10.790
you on that

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:13.250

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:15.590
take this week off geez that's great and

00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:18.410

just a short clip of Mulaney I don't

00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:29.810
know how true it is but like once you

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:32.240
black out enough it gets easier to black

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.460
out when you're drinking make sense like

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:35.900
after a while your brain just gets used

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.360
to blacking out huh so like now if I

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.430
have like five beers I'll start to get

00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:43.670
like I don't remember much of what we

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:46.780
talked about good yeah no it's not great

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:50.960
what do you think about that I'm trying

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.520
to cut back but also it's been the same

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:53.900
thing I do the same thing every single

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:55.520
day well you're also every day I'm doing

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:56.990

night true gub chill go do stand-up at

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:01.280
night like so it's been that no but it

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.350
is definitely definitely robs you of

00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:05.320
getting deep REM sleep

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.970

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:09.680

I can't really struggle to get past like

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:20.400
it's not too much but it's like two to

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.800
three a night and if you once it starts

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.450

00:51:38.319 --> 00:51:42.099
society I made a joke on a podcast you

00:51:42.099 --> 00:51:44.049
[ __ ] psychos yeah that's crazy

00:51:44.049 --> 00:51:46.809
this is wild also again I soon as I saw

00:51:46.809 --> 00:51:48.339
them all standing up to applaud Roman

00:51:48.339 --> 00:51:58.510
Polanski I'm like he ran and they were

00:51:58.510 --> 00:51:59.980
like yeah but he's good at what he does

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:02.200

drape now I think she was clapping I

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:11.079
could be wrong but I think she was

00:52:11.079 --> 00:52:12.309
standing amongst all those people

00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:13.539
clapping for Roman Polanski

00:52:13.539 --> 00:52:15.250

00:52:16.869 --> 00:52:18.700
and they're just like mmhmm right again

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:19.869
I don't know them all personally but

00:52:19.869 --> 00:52:22.539
that's that's a impression I get did you

00:52:22.539 --> 00:52:24.160
hear about the book catch and kill by

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.020
roan ronan fair he's the one that broke

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:28.690
the Weinstein story no and so he just

00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:32.289
wrote it in a book and he damned

00:52:32.289 --> 00:52:33.730
Weinstein how to assess Simon's that

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:37.480
wrote a book I get like a bad tweet and

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:38.680
I'm like this sucks

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:40.690
Weinstein had a [ __ ] New York Times

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:43.619
bestseller on his

00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:48.290
this brought him down what you think why

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:51.440
seems hot no this guy Ronan Farrow he's

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:53.120
a chat I'm not because they Ronan Farrow

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.640
yeah a hot dude that destroyed Harvey's

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:58.100
yeah he is gay Ronan Farrow is gay

00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:05.960
damn so yeah but he so he had the story

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:07.700
he took it to NBC News and the

00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:09.800
executives kept being like it's not

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.450
enough here he's like not enough here

00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:14.180
and so then later it came out that the

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.490
executives were in Koontz with Harvey

00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:17.720
who was even though it's like I'm gonna

00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.000
talk about Lau or if you sue then then

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.930
Weinstein hired people to follow Harvey

00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:25.640
was like I'm gonna talk about Lauer guys

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:32.270
released this guy yeah huge we all have

00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:33.800
rape guys dude don't give me I'm not

00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:37.520
going down for this turn so Harvey then

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:39.050
hires privatised to like follow this

00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:40.970
road and guy around you know and like

00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:42.380
intimidate him put with the one guys

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.720
from the Ukraine and starts to be like

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:47.540
turned because he's like the whole point

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:49.310
of America is that we don't intimidate

00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:52.430
journalists and so then he flips and

00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:54.800
starts given information around and then

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.840
they both the Private Eye yeah yeah and

00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.610
then they go to The New Yorker they took

00:53:58.610 --> 00:53:59.930
the story in New Yorker and that's who

00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:01.610
published it and he won the Pulitzer for

00:54:01.610 --> 00:54:04.490
it they have they barely added anything

00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:06.050
to it they had the whole [ __ ] story

00:54:06.050 --> 00:54:08.150
it's the same way that that lady was

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:10.490
called on the hot mic for ABC News I saw

00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:13.670
that I've seen that nobody wants to run

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:16.310
it and that comes Prince Andrew ain't no

00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:17.870
real family shut that down they're like

00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:19.850
dude and what's so fascinating about

00:54:19.850 --> 00:54:22.370
your case here is like and john was

00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:23.630
talking about this somebody needs to put

00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:27.110
together a montage of all the things

00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:28.970
that you say that are so counter what

00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:31.220
everybody believes this narrative you

00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:32.540
know whoa I mean do you remember that

00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:36.140
you had an anti-racist reading list you

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:37.640
know this was like from your earlier

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:39.320
podcast I don't know that was funny we

00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.480
did have never read but it was a whole

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:43.430
it was a series of books how to talk

00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:46.970
people off the edge was like now you

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:48.380
know it's still played in there and this

00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:50.090
second to like you kept like walking

00:54:50.090 --> 00:54:51.860
people back to her than they could

00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:54.560
handle so it's like all clips like that

00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:57.110
and yet you have executives at this

00:54:57.110 --> 00:54:57.560
level

00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:02.590
actively killing stories about rape yeah

00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:05.870
exactly exactly that's the thing is it's

00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:07.970
insane and then they have the full power

00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:10.220
to change people's opinion of you on

00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:12.200
what I need is Weinstein to come to one

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.760
of my comedy shows so I can publicly

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:19.610
[ __ ] crush him dude he was a comedy

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:23.090
show some [ __ ] I think fundraiser I

00:55:23.090 --> 00:55:25.370
don't know but like these girls that

00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:29.510
were on stage that tattooed mom no you

00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:32.930
gotta see these girls like [ __ ] props

00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:34.460
to them like started talking [ __ ] on

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:36.290
which had to be kind of [ __ ] that

00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:38.180
would be tough yeah I got a room full of

00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:41.030
rich people that were like shut up do

00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:42.860
comedy and she was like no Harvey

00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:45.800
Weinstein's he's a rapist yeah I really

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:48.230
was that was pretty impressive talking

00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:50.300
about dreams and this relates I had a

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:51.980
dream that like my gift Thanksgiving my

00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:54.500
cousin came in with a gun and like my

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.150
first move like I went in the bathroom

00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:58.280
for a second and I was like in the

00:55:58.280 --> 00:55:59.630
bathroom hiding and then I was like

00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:01.310
kidding get out there get out there and

00:56:01.310 --> 00:56:02.900
there was like this big hesitation and

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:04.250
he pointing at my cat and then I went to

00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:09.140
my cat was there nevertheless this well

00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:10.880
I think if I was at that show and I was

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:12.590
that girl you would have just done

00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:14.570
comedy I think I may have now you got a

00:56:14.570 --> 00:56:16.520
you got a you brought down Weinstein I

00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:19.190
would have been like like I would I

00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:20.870
think I would have talked about cuz I

00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:22.480
think it's funny imagining Harvey

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:26.780
thinking he was just a ladies man like I

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:28.430
think it's a funny angle for him to be

00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:31.580
like what what all this [ __ ] came out

00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:35.570
just like what this is crazy this vidas

00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:37.850
misread that pickup artists he spread

00:56:37.850 --> 00:56:39.710
the game all these girls loved me all

00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:42.410
these all these incredibly hot actresses

00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:44.950
loved me this is crazy

00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:47.690
he's like I you know I'm sure I bribed

00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:49.550
him with parts and movies and made them

00:56:49.550 --> 00:56:52.190
watch jerk off on it like a fern right I

00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:56.420
thought that was dating that's too funny

00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:58.850
yeah yeah the dream shit's Wyles you've

00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:09.859
had this is a while back you had okay

00:57:09.859 --> 00:57:12.890
yeah that's what dude that's actually

00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:14.089
pretty timely to use it's about to be

00:57:14.089 --> 00:57:17.209
Thanksgiving the UH and I've noticed in

00:57:17.209 --> 00:57:20.089
my dreams I've somehow weirdly have had

00:57:20.089 --> 00:57:24.160
I've started having more control over my

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.229
what I'm doing in dreams which is weird

00:57:27.229 --> 00:57:29.239
but it's also because I've been like

00:57:29.239 --> 00:57:31.609
hyper aware of every single decision

00:57:31.609 --> 00:57:33.410
that I make lately I've been really

00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:35.390
every single thing I'm about to do I

00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:37.459
think about it I'm like not not like you

00:57:37.459 --> 00:57:38.539
know when I'm talking to people until I

00:57:38.539 --> 00:57:40.190
don't but it when I'm like about to go

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:41.450
get something about to buy something I

00:57:41.450 --> 00:57:44.269
really stop and I'm like where what kind

00:57:44.269 --> 00:57:46.609
of life at path is this decision like

00:57:46.609 --> 00:57:48.950
might what might this be kind of leading

00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:50.660
me towards I've been doing that a lot

00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:51.769
and then dude I had a dream the other

00:57:51.769 --> 00:57:53.329
day I was in a like a double-decker bus

00:57:53.329 --> 00:57:55.489
but I was like fifty feet up in the air

00:57:55.489 --> 00:57:56.930
on this thing sitting next to lady

00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:58.700
somehow was driving it from the very top

00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:01.489
and we were just [ __ ] nailing tree

00:58:01.489 --> 00:58:04.130
branches just boom boom hitting them and

00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:05.690
then we hit another one and the boss

00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:08.390
just goes like it's about to fall and

00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:10.069
the dream I just closed my eyes and was

00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:13.009
like the bus won't fall I know the bus

00:58:13.009 --> 00:58:17.299
won't fall I didn't [ __ ] fall and I

00:58:17.299 --> 00:58:19.309
had that I was like I'm having a weird

00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:20.930
sex dream where a lady offered to have

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:22.309
sex with me and I didn't because I

00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:23.930
didn't want to cheat in a dream which is

00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:26.869
like yeah yeah crazy

00:58:26.869 --> 00:58:28.549
that ain't a dream like on a

00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:31.430
subconscious level I was like nah that

00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:33.739
but then why that that has to feel a

00:58:33.739 --> 00:58:35.420
little bit good because they did I was

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:36.769

00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:58.549
too much well I mean it was real not

00:58:58.549 --> 00:59:02.269
heroic which is we wanna be but in your

00:59:02.269 --> 00:59:03.650
dream you know you did this thing you

00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:05.959
know it's been a recent development and

00:59:05.959 --> 00:59:07.789
I didn't do anything I just like ya

00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:10.039
wasn't scared in my dream which is weird

00:59:10.039 --> 00:59:12.410
and that's after I would dream talking

00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:16.549
dream talking I've literally I know it's

00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:19.699
weird dream I turned it down I turned

00:59:19.699 --> 00:59:21.090
down sex in a dream I was like that

00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:23.070
do that that's nice it's pretty it was

00:59:23.070 --> 00:59:24.300
crazy and then I was again I was telling

00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:25.620
Gerber's I was on a but a double-decker

00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:27.120
bus that was like 40 feet in the air and

00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:29.190
it almost was about to topple and I was

00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:31.860
just kind of like I'm confident topples

00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:33.390
I'm confident like Molin yeah it was

00:59:33.390 --> 00:59:35.130
kind of like I'm confident it won't if

00:59:35.130 --> 00:59:37.290
it does it does in a dream and that's

00:59:37.290 --> 00:59:38.400
because I've been doing a lot of stuff

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.630
for myself where I've been really

00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:41.460
crushing kind of weird fears and phobias

00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:43.260
so that's weird how they translate I

00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:45.000
know that dreams were like I'm dying and

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.830

00:59:46.830 --> 00:59:47.730

this on the other side I mean I'm not

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.170
worried it's it's whatever see that

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:58.250
catch I can just keep that's what's like

01:01:58.250 --> 01:02:00.840
when you start to get notoriety or

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:03.210
whatever people there's gonna be you're

01:02:03.210 --> 01:02:04.770
gonna have some sass Simon's you're

01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:06.480
gonna have some of these absolutely just

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.370
non-stop on your dick like trying to be

01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:09.660

he [ __ ] up okay I just have to keep

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:14.580
moving and try to ignore that and and

01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:16.860
also try to come to terms with there

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:18.990
will never be justice like there will

01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:20.580
never be that guy will never have any

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:23.190
reckoning where he has to face anything

01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:25.280
I don't think final day no he won't

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.080
internally internally and also I I've

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.090
also come to peace with internally I

01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:31.440
don't think he thinks he's wrong and I

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.450
don't think he ever will I really don't

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:35.520
think he ever will and that's okay cuz

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.670
yeah he might he might you know what if

01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:39.960
I don't ever think I'm wrong I guess

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.250
you're right cuz again I would be

01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:43.290
disgusted in myself if that's what I was

01:02:43.290 --> 01:02:44.760
doing from day to day just following

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.020
we'll never do that he'll never do

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:50.060
following another man around the world

01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:53.910
yeah and he's probably in a circle of

01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:55.890
people that are like wow that's really

01:02:55.890 --> 01:03:00.840
impressive thank you unimaginable that's

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:01.380
wild

01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:03.180
yeah but that's you know there are

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:05.430
people out there it is true that [ __ ]

01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:05.700
lies

01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:07.290
that's scary for me to think about how

01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:11.130
in their heads it's like we're just

01:03:11.130 --> 01:03:13.500
total [ __ ] [ __ ] hatemonger types

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.660
doing nothing of value and they're the

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:18.660
ones like writing the ship and Shah Baba

01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:20.130
it's kind of weird to think about

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:21.600
yeah well that's exactly what they think

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.630
yeah I mean I've talked to I've talked

01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:25.950
on the phone with some of them yeah

01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:27.900
that's exactly how I feel yeah it's

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:29.730
crazy and it's like that while we felt

01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:31.650
it was our duty to speak out against you

01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:33.300
so you didn't have to [ __ ] say

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:35.190
anything even then why are this again

01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:37.290
this is this is my glitch why are they

01:03:37.290 --> 01:03:38.900
coming up to you and being like hey

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:42.300
sorry you're okay blah blah blah they're

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.670
not as there's no been no one to kind of

01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:48.240
like backpedal a little oh yes some

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:48.940
people and I think

01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:51.160
more to come too I think yeah well

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.140
that's just gonna happen so it's like

01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:55.540
well also dude the only clip these

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:57.520
people have ever seen if it was me

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.200
sitting here being man let the [ __ ]

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.000
chinks live there I wish I had done it

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.890
stronger it wasn't even that strong

01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:10.500
impression bro that's the more strong

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.060
also they misquoted it and it was like

01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:15.160
some wire there sire there's so many

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:18.790
effing yeah where did this come from

01:04:18.790 --> 01:04:20.020
that's the thing they're able to run

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:21.690
with that and then build this whole

01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:24.069
straw man as gary said they're like this

01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:25.839
resurfaced and it's like it was like a

01:04:25.839 --> 01:04:27.790
private conversation where I wasn't

01:04:27.790 --> 01:04:30.099
speaking into a microphone and putting

01:04:30.099 --> 01:04:33.579
it on YouTube again I think I don't know

01:04:33.579 --> 01:04:35.140
we don't need to dwell on that no but we

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:36.550
should be talking about is the fact that

01:04:36.550 --> 01:04:38.410
we do need to come to terms with there

01:04:38.410 --> 01:04:41.369
will probably never be justice as far as

01:04:41.369 --> 01:04:44.859
people being like oh [ __ ] I was wrong

01:04:44.859 --> 01:04:46.420
well hold they have to do is just sit

01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:48.339
you down and be like do you believe in

01:04:48.339 --> 01:04:49.660
the white ethno state and you're like no

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:51.069
okay cool just making sure

01:04:51.069 --> 01:04:53.020
otherwise you'd be like yes [ __ ] yeah

01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:54.400
yeah yeah yeah like these are people

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.839
secretly walking and then they're like

01:04:55.839 --> 01:04:58.060
are we gonna start policing like the

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.980
dark matter in people's hearts now but

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.630
well I think this guy's really about

01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:03.099
this even though he says this and does

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:04.810
this I think he's really about this and

01:05:04.810 --> 01:05:07.599
it's like what is that what we're gonna

01:05:07.599 --> 01:05:08.770
do now what the [ __ ] you go that's

01:05:08.770 --> 01:05:11.500
insane yeah I mean but granted it was

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.089
like popped out on a pot of gas but it

01:05:13.089 --> 01:05:15.550
so it's like if you're like now really

01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:16.930
I'm not that's not my thing it's like

01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:18.369
okay cool making sure yeah that could

01:05:18.369 --> 01:05:24.520
have been it I [ __ ] man I was laughing

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.470
thing in the other day about like having

01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:28.359
this bet we're like somebody has to

01:05:28.359 --> 01:05:30.069
throw on a KKK robe and take a picture

01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:31.510
and just imagine people having that

01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:35.920
picture mmm that would be crazy you had

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:45.730
a picture of somebody in a robe what I

01:05:45.730 --> 01:05:46.930
was saying about be funny if you're like

01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:48.490
no real I'm not and they puss it out a

01:05:48.490 --> 01:05:57.190
picture you're like oh yeah so that's it

01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:58.750
has been you gotta you gotta come to

01:05:58.750 --> 01:06:01.150
terms with that that that's how it is

01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:02.240
and then

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.580
hopefully just keep doing stand-up and

01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:07.290
that's all I can do and and but you're

01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:09.060
doing sand up yeah I'll do stand-up

01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:10.860
every yeah this to the stand I'll be

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:11.850
doing stand-up every I mean that's

01:06:11.850 --> 01:06:13.890
clearly going great it's going well yeah

01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:17.160
and this has been like what two months

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.690
not even two months yeah this whole

01:06:18.690 --> 01:06:21.390
thing a bit so close to when that

01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:23.670
happened and yeah it was like well this

01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:26.250
is what I'll say it's I think that is

01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:29.910
true but I also think there is a way to

01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:31.290
shake people out of this weird

01:06:31.290 --> 01:06:34.560
us-and-them mindset I think it's I think

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.930
Italy is just by doing stand-up

01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:38.670
I'm talking about I'm talking about

01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:40.320
humanity I'm all about yeah yeah yeah

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:42.180
but I'm very easy I'm about what I can

01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:45.540
control no no there's nothing wrong to

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:47.070
me that dude I'm telling you there's

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:48.630
nothing wrong with that I celebrate yeah

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:51.480
I'm I want to try to undergird the herb

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.500
not an undergrad I want to try to

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:55.110
obliterate this weird like the people

01:06:55.110 --> 01:06:56.480
that people almost have like a

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.620
middle-aged you know people obviously we

01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.450
don't believe like the Sun revolves

01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:02.370
around the earth yeah that's what I used

01:07:02.370 --> 01:07:03.750
to be like the Sun revolves around the

01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:05.520
earth that was a crazy to believe in

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.020
that vehemently or whatever but now it's

01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:10.530
like the idea to believe you're right I

01:07:10.530 --> 01:07:12.150
think in a couple hundred years will be

01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:14.280
as ridiculous as people being like Sun

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.810
revolves around the earth God loves us

01:07:15.810 --> 01:07:17.820
and I am right about what I think we

01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:20.520
have a beautiful understanding of like

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:23.100
our reality be yes concreted you guys

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:25.350
revolve around my opinion exactly

01:07:25.350 --> 01:07:27.090
exactly as I'm saying I think that'll be

01:07:27.090 --> 01:07:28.260
something that people will come to grips

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:29.550
with and that I think that can help

01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:31.650
maybe push people out of this like weird

01:07:31.650 --> 01:07:33.840
crazy [ __ ] yeah was it always like

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:37.260
this or are we just getting like has it

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:39.240
always been like this for everyone like

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:42.780
other this weird [ __ ] world that we live

01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:45.000
in right now I thought you'd say I was a

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.650
[ __ ] for a long time you know III that

01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:51.720
sort of feeling of like yeah I gotta

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:54.330
have the right idea yeah this this whole

01:07:54.330 --> 01:07:56.400
like really seeking out the opposite

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.780
argument even if I don't this is like a

01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:59.940
fresh thing for me that I don't really

01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:01.530
ever do you know no one ever did who you

01:08:01.530 --> 01:08:02.880
all see all we used to be

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:05.700
I like all mostly United in like our big

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:07.440
ideas I do that we got hit with

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.030
post-modernism and that kind it's not

01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:11.130
even a bad thing but now it's like is

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:12.750
that even real this is just our

01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:14.640
country's take on this thing and this is

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.170
just a story but they

01:08:16.170 --> 01:08:17.370
all the stuff they say is like what this

01:08:17.370 --> 01:08:18.630
this shit's factor whatever I don't know

01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:20.520
but yeah I don't know I that's what I've

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:21.870
been getting out of like when I catch

01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:23.219
myself making those statements like well

01:08:23.219 --> 01:08:25.020
this is just what it is I'm like well

01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:26.400
that's that's what I think it is excuse

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:29.400
me because I don't [ __ ] know no idea

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:31.620
yeah what I'm really interested in to

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:33.029
see is like you know and again I don't

01:08:33.029 --> 01:08:35.489
mean that seems like what you're going

01:08:35.489 --> 01:08:36.719
through is just pure entertainment for

01:08:36.719 --> 01:08:43.890
me but dude if it was any other penny of

01:08:43.890 --> 01:08:45.509
you guys I'd be like this the phone

01:08:45.509 --> 01:08:53.219
calls phone calls my friends group well

01:08:53.219 --> 01:08:55.199
this was going down with you remember

01:08:55.199 --> 01:08:56.910
like Adam the guy who came in yeah yeah

01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:59.040
yeah he said everybody wanted

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.529
information and so then I was in a group

01:09:01.529 --> 01:09:04.290
chat with like John and Chris and so I'd

01:09:04.290 --> 01:09:06.779
get in there and I'm like so like what's

01:09:06.779 --> 01:09:09.120
going on they give you information that

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.910
I call out like you [ __ ] idiot begged

01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:18.630
me it's like just to see because you

01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:19.969
know I thought you brought this point up

01:09:19.969 --> 01:09:22.830
that it's not like there was a body of

01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:25.140
work when this happened yeah so [ __ ]

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:27.089
me so it's gonna be very interesting to

01:09:27.089 --> 01:09:31.140
see as the comedy becomes undeniable of

01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:33.120
what you know you can't phoenix that

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:36.210
rise from the ashes yeah you know it's

01:09:36.210 --> 01:09:39.000
like you can't not want to include that

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.589
if you're like wait we're supposed to be

01:09:40.589 --> 01:09:43.739
the top comedy show and you know at a

01:09:43.739 --> 01:09:46.350
certain point when that starts to enough

01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:49.080
people start to realize that they just

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:52.350
have to they can't play this game

01:09:52.350 --> 01:09:53.279
because yeah

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:54.449
thank God the Internet's in place

01:09:54.449 --> 01:09:56.400
because again it would be video you can

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.390
put out your own you can't get

01:09:57.390 --> 01:09:58.770
blackballed anymore so it's like you can

01:09:58.770 --> 01:10:01.100
put out your own [ __ ] you can monetarily

01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:04.980
for sure which is the only thing that

01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:09.570
that's a problem for now we'll see yep

01:10:09.570 --> 01:10:11.040
yes you're big in here you can do

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.380
anything is like that was worth like

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:16.710
like Michael Richards also I was saying

01:10:16.710 --> 01:10:18.780
about Chris Brown the other day how the

01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:20.610
[ __ ] did he beat the [ __ ] out of Rihanna

01:10:20.610 --> 01:10:22.980
and he just kept dropping hits dude and

01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:27.170
people people will like drop hits

01:10:28.890 --> 01:10:31.780
I'm a [ __ ] r.kelly this thing I heard

01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:33.730
you Michael Jackson I heard that just

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:36.040
gotta keep dropping his he made that one

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.960
like him redoing that Michael Jackson

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.430
song and it was just kind of everyone

01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:46.720
was just kind of like he just he just

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:49.450
just like I've never liked with all this

01:10:49.450 --> 01:10:50.620
stuff I guess he was a little early on

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:53.080
it but it's like and I think also I

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.000
think being black helps evade some of

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.680
their like the critical judgment with

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.390
this kind of stuff I just really think

01:10:58.390 --> 01:11:00.430
it does like in terms of beating your

01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:04.300
girlfriend and everyone like yeah whoa

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:06.700
and so that's what's accidently that's

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:08.110
what sucks about this cuz what the

01:11:08.110 --> 01:11:11.190
comment you're making there is

01:11:11.190 --> 01:11:14.410
recognizing liberal racism yeah you know

01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:15.880
what I mean you're recognizing that the

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:17.950
reason it helps to be black in that

01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:19.600
situation is because the dumb

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:21.670
gatekeepers that are white shitty white

01:11:21.670 --> 01:11:23.560
people look at that and like well that's

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:26.170
what they do as we know any romance yeah

01:11:26.170 --> 01:11:29.140
so like yeah black people hit people so

01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:31.270
who cares who cares he just skating if

01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:32.620
he was white we would hold them to a

01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:34.990
higher accountability so dude like

01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:35.950
saying something like that you're

01:11:35.950 --> 01:11:37.600
pointing out the hypocrisy and the races

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:39.760
in that yeah but you know but exactly

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.650
and he and again me personally I was

01:11:41.650 --> 01:11:43.270
like I just like his [ __ ] music so

01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:45.250
whatever he's got cool dance moves he

01:11:45.250 --> 01:11:47.410
does a backflip on one foot he's pretty

01:11:47.410 --> 01:11:49.390
[ __ ] sick he's pretty entertaining he

01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:51.340
has a hog from when I've had it they

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:54.490
call good fake [ __ ] hog saw every

01:11:54.490 --> 01:11:56.260

he did it again this is a Chris Brown

01:11:57.610 --> 01:12:00.520
this is great see breezy but yeah it is

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.570
one of those things where yeah he

01:12:01.570 --> 01:12:02.980
completely what they're like she's

01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:08.440
beating Rihanna definitely he had some

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.270
weird thing to where he had war right

01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:16.720

01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:44.469
eight minutes when he's like just

01:14:44.469 --> 01:14:46.540
talking about his experiences it's

01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:51.010

01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:06.970
so so dia yeah but season 2 of The Wire

01:15:06.970 --> 01:15:10.270
it's like when you like they of doing

01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:13.360
very accurate portrayal of at least the

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:16.270
way that it's being described as to how

01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:19.360
you know this guy functioned this in the

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.640
prison system being a gang leader yeah

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:23.560
and how he's able to you know manipulate

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:26.860
everybody and do that and it's good

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:28.900
I just love season two I typically when

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:30.880
I saw that and I do love season two

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:33.160
because the whites I think that there's

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:38.830
a cast a shame type Ziggy they cast as

01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:41.200
like a little guys like and then his

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:42.910
cousin feels like the need to look out

01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:45.280
for him but he's too much of like like

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:48.310
