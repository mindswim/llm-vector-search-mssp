that's I got a line there and then like

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.169
a month later he's like Donald Trump

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.370

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.800
these guys are all [ __ ] yeah dude he

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.660

his Bay oh yeah he got his baby Trump

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.450

and I'm from Texas and down here you

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.270
don't cross lines like that and then

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.979
literally again a month later he was on

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.780
TV that was like one of the first things

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.010
where they were like I don't think

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.290
Trump's gonna survive this yeah after

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.880
someone's wife if he decked Trump he

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.100
might have been the president of 2020 if

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.840
you've been like it's on site and like

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.210
walked up get shot though

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.740
you can't happen it's on site with the

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.000
president otherwise you're terrorists

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.080
that would be if he caught Ted Cruz

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.360
should have called for a duel he could

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.370
have under Texas laws at what a check

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.600

it great again bro let's take it back to

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.539
the presidents with dual people I think

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.690
- I mean they both miss for a half hour

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.050
[Laughter]

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.660
slapping duel to watch Cruz and Trump

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.830
wrestle on stage would be I saw your boy

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.010
Bernie last night boys you guys are

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.800
Bernie bros staying true to 1776

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.060
Christie dude you're just now I watched

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.160
some of Bernie his demo last night he

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.080
was on you know he says a bunch of good

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.450
stuff that I like he also was like

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:23.039
Castro's the man he was like Fidel

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:25.710
Castro said you know he'd write when he

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.560
took power he sent out book brigades and

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.690
taught everyone how to learn so that was

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.430
a good thing yeah he's like that's just

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.620
the truth it's a good thing not the

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.610
greatest name

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.759
it sounds better it's also funny big

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:40.050
well that was a good thing you can't

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.400
take that good thing away well that's

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.750
what he did that's what he was saying

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.889
it's like well you could do that with

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:47.009
any sure horrible leader Isis that's

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:48.509
when like a New York Times like Isis has

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:50.310
really been whipping these towns into

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.479
shape say what you will about the

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:53.939
policies a lot of discipline going on in

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:56.460
there guys today they were like they

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.719
were like Cuba has like 99.9% literacy

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:03.629
and like 0% homeless you're like yeah

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:11.370
just like just like Iran has zero yeah

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.599
so funny like and they also have a

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:14.250
hundred percent approval rate of the

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.870
president so it's like after Katrina

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.490
when everyone's in the Superdome it's

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:27.509
like homelessness is dropped Bernie was

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:30.210
like somebody asked him which was kind

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:31.289
of a [ __ ] up question they were like

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:33.330
you just had a heart attack are you

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.250
gonna name a vice president cuz you know

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.469
you could [ __ ] die during the thing

00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:40.889
and he was like ok alright and he was

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:42.960
like we will name vice president values

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.449
like we will name a vice president soon

00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:49.259
but I can assure you it won't be an old

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:54.479
white man and the crowd was like yeah I

00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:56.460
also have the same heart surgeon as Dick

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:06.599
Cheney so but it was like it's the same

00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:09.750
thing it's like selective to you you're

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.689
an old white like what are you talking

00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:14.520
about you're gonna go on stage big I

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.050
guarantee it's not gonna be an old white

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.000
guy and it's like that's a weird thing

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.740
it's the same thing it's almost like

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.469
with comedy or like with anything where

00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:23.699
it's like a bunch of old what like the

00:08:23.699 --> 00:08:26.580
people booking shows yeah like on TV

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.589
they're all old white guys and they're

00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:31.289
like wow we actually need diversity why

00:08:31.289 --> 00:08:34.469
don't you diversify you [ __ ] weirdos

00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:35.669
true enough

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.019
I don't know true enough and you can

00:08:37.019 --> 00:08:38.849
also be like shouldn't she be president

00:08:38.849 --> 00:08:42.349
Mr Sanders I mean to be fair any bit

00:08:42.349 --> 00:08:44.520
once you start playing those games it's

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.930
like someone's gonna outwork you and

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.840
you're just gonna be like yeah

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.820
the execs need diversity on screen

big Shane that's enough TV man but uh

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:44.010
the scene I saw was like a black lesbian

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.800
couple were the Nazi hunters as well as

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.620
Asian dude and you know that's the crack

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.510
squad they put together in the 70s I

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.710
think well sorry you had the white

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.030
version of history dude where they left

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.860
out all the black lesbians to attack and

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.140
all the ways place in the seventies yeah

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.630
yeah all the bad guys are clearly uh you

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.910
know obviously white guys it's a now

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.340
I'll give him that one but like they're

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.490
like sadistic weirdo like the one scene

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.800
I saw was just a black family tied up at

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.780
their dinner table and a Nazi going

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.670
around being like you know flamingos are

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.310
actually pure white it's the food they

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:19.070
ingest that makes them colored and like

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.960
walking around and he's like shooting a

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.690
tied-up black family yeah yeah good lord

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:29.000
did the Nazis in hiding out there this

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.900
audition we we've had Russians and

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.150
Middle Eastern bad guys for a while now

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:36.680
it's just that's just what it is old

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.690
white guys are the National like yeah

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:40.280
toast of ARCA you know they're like the

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.170
fear thing yeah so it's like we're the

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.810
bad guys and funny it also sounds like

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.570
something like a Nazi would never say

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:55.850
yeah the Flamingo thing actually they

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:57.320
had candy back then but did you know

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.540
flamingos like they cut to the chase

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:04.880
yeah yeah some weird metaphor the it is

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.500
a weak writing point did you actually

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.610
know yeah

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:09.920
then the there's a lesbian couple

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.650
they're in bed and the ones talking

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:15.350
about how German the story Hansel and

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:17.930
Gretel was about actually the witch was

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.390
a Jew and the kids threw her in an oven

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:23.060
and took her house was like all these

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.220
we've always they just wanted the witch

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.210
just want to live in the woods

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:33.110
peacefully sounds like a bit she was

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.480
like these stories affect culture and

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.770
make everybody think they're the bad

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.930
guys and I was like what the [ __ ]

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:41.810
show her you want your show is that

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.180
story no right now is a bunch of

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.040
diversity like we got to kill these

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.200
white it's like all right oh is it all

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.520
is that fact because I always thought

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.500
Hansel and Gretel is a which try to eat

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.550
the kids I thought it was yeah I thought

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.380
it was like a mother who like did too

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.910
much and suck their kick fattened up

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:57.470
their kids and you know basically your

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:59.590
mother would gobble you up I don't think

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:02.180
we've got lost in the woods and a witch

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.120
found him so they're saying the story

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.760
that represents a Jew yeah who that was

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.000
trying to eat Christian babies it's not

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.630
okay

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:15.410
it's debunked sorry anyway snow snow is

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:16.100
like well

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.680
yeah I was I was back in Mechanicsburg I

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.829
had my full white guy hat on TV just

00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:23.329
like why is the white guy always dumb in

00:13:23.329 --> 00:13:30.649
every commercial recharged recharge I

00:13:30.649 --> 00:13:32.360

him talking [ __ ] I fell asleep to him

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.279
talking [ __ ] and in the morning at like

00:14:04.279 --> 00:14:06.470
7:30 the more he was like time to wake

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.630
up

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.800
you might start recording when you sleep

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.410
this is CBS so [ __ ] dude if it was

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:14.660
like what was that movie paranormal

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.310
activity oh it's like you're sleeping

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:20.019
you watch it a but he's just like Posse

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:25.560
[Laughter]

00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:45.170
to wake up to him it's just so funny

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:46.730
it's nice to know there's someone out in

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:48.800
the world who it just has full dominion

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.800
over won't even think about it before

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.540
just giving you a bunch of [ __ ] it's

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.610
like so [ __ ] funny yeah lay on the

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:57.709
couch ID honestly I woke up to him going

00:14:57.709 --> 00:15:00.170
with that tone that [ __ ] you better

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:04.180
hear you're gonna have to change careers

00:15:08.589 --> 00:15:13.069
which is you're playing the XFL that

00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:16.430
should be my boy these kids so XFL isn't

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:17.509
the vince mcmahon thing anymore

00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:20.029
i think it is he's probably attached to

00:15:20.029 --> 00:15:22.550
it somewhere yeah so it's back yeah so

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.550
there's another viable option now for ya

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.519
college athletes yes I would love to see

00:15:28.519 --> 00:15:29.960
the research that they did

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.870
to feel like this is plausible again

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.660
like how's your tank all that draftkings

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.180
and online gambling is more that's what

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:42.200
it did for sure gambling on XFL yeah

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.339
yeah definitely it's so fixable - yeah

00:15:46.339 --> 00:15:48.170
yeah I just had to watch the Mexican

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:50.630

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:57.140
that music put the golf on actual pros

00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:09.200
playing yeah it wasn't you are racist

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.640
Lee you think so definitely

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.940
why proofs in the pudding and you're

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:19.520
racist reel-to-reel rap probably not yes

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:27.350
go caddy you're thinking jockeys lads

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:30.860

business within the cartel

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.060

getting work it's like the cartel

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.510
leaders yeah stop because the women

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.160
doesn't mean it's okay have a hard time

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.500
buying that one of the cartel bosses big

stupid to understand what the women were

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.610
doing okay so they were like these

00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:28.130

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:22.650

sorry it's high school oh I got there

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.190

I was like oh [ __ ] just give them an

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.300
Enzo and forget the hoop just like if

you can dribble down and they fall they

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.210
all fall so easily

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.860
everyone just falling on the court the

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:47.940
whole time but uh it should just it

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.530
became like hack-a-shaq at the end

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:50.820
because none of them could make free

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.620
throws so they just sort of found each

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.800
other

00:19:55.149 --> 00:19:59.469
there's a war of attrition I'm cheering

00:20:25.869 --> 00:20:27.849
laying on the couch well Phil's target

00:20:27.849 --> 00:20:29.979

final score this one went into overtime

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.960
it was a thrilling game I think it was

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.789
like 41 40 somebody hit a buzzer beater

00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:11.349

something Johnny they're looking at a

00:27:47.369 --> 00:27:49.080
perfect God but obviously subconsciously

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.429
you know the vengeful Christ came

00:27:50.429 --> 00:27:52.529
through him just like John was just he

00:27:52.529 --> 00:27:54.990

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.190

apparently he just like and he's like

00:28:11.369 --> 00:28:12.659
and I had a weird dream last night where

00:28:12.659 --> 00:28:15.840
God came down and crushed us all look

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.450
you got nothing that's not gonna happen

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:20.100
for a long long sauce to sit at the end

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:23.340
of the book reading the Bible for the

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.600
first time and then you get to the end

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.389
like what but the New Testaments all

00:28:27.389 --> 00:28:28.889
like this nice good stuff and then you

00:28:28.889 --> 00:28:34.350
get to the last book geez yeah Easter's

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:37.259
I'm telling you uh answer to Joe by

00:28:37.259 --> 00:28:38.549
young it's pretty just deals with that

00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:40.730
whole thing oh why it

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:42.320
started like nasty Old Testament God

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.960
kind of got nice God's trying to become

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.429
a human the whole time during a Bible

00:28:46.429 --> 00:28:49.190
becomes a human murders himself it's

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:51.470
weird and then at the end of Jesus comes

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:53.120
back he's like Jesus here he's like with

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.919
a hammer not a hammer over the sickle

00:28:54.919 --> 00:28:57.260

reading I have to read it again so much

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.570
of it goes over my head but like you

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:19.220

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.230

the Bible of course you don't yeah

00:29:27.049 --> 00:29:30.860
process probably wass Protestant

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.750
Catholic it's it's very Catholic to know

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:34.940
nothing that's like the most Catholic

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.010

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:51.830
desk you were in Sunday school yeah up

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:53.299
until fifth grade I went to public

00:29:53.299 --> 00:29:55.790

00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:03.740
Catholic sports so like they were all my

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.150
teenager so I would [ __ ] with their

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:11.059
desks I was which a pencil case I used

00:30:11.059 --> 00:30:12.710
to keep favored blastic goldfish in my

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:14.690

out but no don't even get me started on

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.760
the [ __ ] meta pattern of spheres in

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.539
general dude the meta pattern of spheres

00:36:16.539 --> 00:36:19.640
man I feel like you you collect jar you

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:28.789
are a magnet for spheres are one of them

00:36:28.789 --> 00:36:31.069
spheres rods cones there's so many up

00:36:31.069 --> 00:36:36.470
dude it's if you think about a planet if

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:39.020
you think about it so the Sun what makes

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.910
the Sun a body it's it's like what a

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:41.660
nuclear fusion

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:43.460
there's outside forces that condense it

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:44.329
to the point where it can no longer

00:36:44.329 --> 00:36:46.460
condense that's what creates a sphere

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:49.130
the moon gravity condenses matter to the

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:50.329
point where it can't convince anymore

00:36:50.329 --> 00:36:51.770
a baseball what shapes a baseball

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:54.109
outside forces rules of the sport shape

00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:57.680
the diameter size I mean this way ant

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.510
digs in the dirt what she pops out man

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:02.150
takes an anthill anthill a sphere it's

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:05.440
just don't there's a lot of spheres wait

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:10.270
so you've gathered that there are Spears

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:14.750
like a book yes star from condensing

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:16.250
anymore is just there's not it's not

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:17.869
there's not enough matter it's still

00:37:17.869 --> 00:37:28.339
pulling in but why just keeps condensing

00:37:28.339 --> 00:37:30.349
the dead star you want to talk you know

00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:31.819
about the black hole head would you know

00:37:31.819 --> 00:37:34.240
about stars

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:38.049
look at Chris if you're if you know

00:37:38.049 --> 00:37:40.430
remotely anything about this you're

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:42.259
gonna win no I'm gonna hit you with

00:37:42.259 --> 00:37:44.359
jargon that's all he's got no one talks

00:37:44.359 --> 00:37:48.619
face talk I'll talk space off a black

00:37:48.619 --> 00:37:50.719
hole is just a more dense star it's a

00:37:50.719 --> 00:37:53.140
dead star dude I don't know if it's dead

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:55.910
first of all it has to suck in what size

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:58.400
star has to be not every dead star it

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.479
becomes a black hole it has to be a

00:37:59.479 --> 00:38:01.700
certain size of the star yeah yeah but

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.190
if it's like come on just say red red

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.759
giant

00:38:04.759 --> 00:38:08.029
that's one say white dwarf right but

00:38:08.029 --> 00:38:11.450
eventually we're all gonna get laid

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:12.920
white dwarfs I don't think become black

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.630
holes like we're getting suckers towards

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:16.519
a black hole right now I have a theory

00:38:16.519 --> 00:38:19.309
that black holes are why we spin around

00:38:19.309 --> 00:38:20.359
in the orbit we do

00:38:20.359 --> 00:38:22.009
that's no I think black holes are sound

00:38:22.009 --> 00:38:24.069
gravity it's not your theory that's it

00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:29.950
well I'll co-author whoever else I think

00:38:30.369 --> 00:38:33.229
just black holes right like any like the

00:38:33.229 --> 00:38:35.299
the process of starting that spin is the

00:38:35.299 --> 00:38:37.299
same as like a tornado or a hurricane

00:38:37.299 --> 00:38:40.549
like the you applying earth science to

00:38:40.549 --> 00:38:46.039
outer space it's all the same you

00:38:46.039 --> 00:38:49.339
applying nature to nature people forget

00:38:49.339 --> 00:38:50.900
that space is just nature I heard that

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:52.880
but I'm all man yeah I heard that please

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.099
spews anything you think matters

00:38:55.099 --> 00:39:01.369
conscious yep I think it depends on the

00:39:01.369 --> 00:39:04.309
matter right what like we're we're made

00:39:04.309 --> 00:39:06.049
up of matter we're a conscious system

00:39:06.049 --> 00:39:09.469
right yeah but I don't think like well I

00:39:09.469 --> 00:39:10.999
don't think like this is conscious I

00:39:10.999 --> 00:39:12.440
don't think this tables like feeling

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:19.699
stuff tables that's the thing that [ __ ]

00:39:19.699 --> 00:39:22.249
up signs like rationalist scientific

00:39:22.249 --> 00:39:24.259
people it's like well if matters all it

00:39:24.259 --> 00:39:26.390
is how science is open to the idea that

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:27.920
a table could be conscious but there's

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:32.259
no talking tables bro talking star stuff

00:39:32.259 --> 00:39:34.309
atoms what you think tables are made of

00:39:34.309 --> 00:39:35.509
atoms they're made up we're made out of

00:39:35.509 --> 00:39:36.829
the same stuff that it's just different

00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:37.999
order no tables are made out of star

00:39:37.999 --> 00:39:39.949
stuff you know there's tables actually a

00:39:39.949 --> 00:39:41.569
bunch of spheres presenting as the

00:39:41.569 --> 00:39:44.690
illusion of a table excuse me what this

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:46.670
table is made up on a fundamental atomic

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:47.720
level of spheres

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:51.280
yeah well it's mostly in I don't space

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:53.780
I'm sorry I was a diversion

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:58.070
I'm hype right now because I did it last

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:02.450
night last night so you know I have my

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:04.130
deep dives right right do you like good

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:10.730
stunts moderate amount of THC whoa

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:12.830
Spears are everywhere how does that not

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:15.380
induce an anxiety attack after it

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:24.890
doesn't our dude I've already

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:27.020
transcended tons of my social anxieties

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.480
my tip might I typically dissociate I

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.970
didn't know that I learned that I'm own

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:34.430
like a semi dissociated state like for

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:36.560
50% of the time I'll be like in a class

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:37.760
people are doing stuff and I just go

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.710
like rant and check out and I'll beg

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:41.960
[ __ ] like come back into it not like a

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.550
boredom dissociation like a discomfort

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:45.200
dissociation but that's whole nother

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.270
like not daydreaming it's nothing else

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:49.190
it's a protective mechanism where it's

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:50.930
just kind of like like I realized when I

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:52.220
talk to my parents I'm like semi

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:54.470
dissociated I'll like sit down with them

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:56.060
and I'm like man I'm with my parents now

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.710
I'm thinking about the fact that I'm

00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:58.910
thinking about what being your

00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:59.660
code-switching

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:01.250
for your sort of not but it's

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:03.020
associating just a dual consciousness so

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:04.339
it'd be like rather than like Sydney are

00:41:04.339 --> 00:41:06.260
all talking if I were talking but

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:07.940
sitting here kind of shrunk back in and

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:09.260
myself thinking about the fact that

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.630
we're talking to be like that's when you

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:15.490
dissociate that oh that just seems like

00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:19.339
normal human interaction right like if

00:41:19.339 --> 00:41:20.660
I'm around my parents I'm gonna talk

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.220
with them about different stuff than I

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:23.780
would talk with you it's different

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:25.670
that's that's just that's just

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:27.020
monitoring your speech I'm talking about

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.000
disassociating it's hard to explain I

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.400
just get it or not Matt McCusker when

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.170
you're talking your parents know like so

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:34.940
a job interview is a better example I

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:36.290
would sit in a job interview and the

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:37.550
person would be talking to me and I'm

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:40.010
I'm listening to them but I can't hear a

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:41.420
word they're saying because I'm hearing

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:47.180
myself it's girlfriend stories that's

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.320
what it's called

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.950
oh it's a girlfriend story dude true so

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:56.100
I'm doing you can't help I've tried so

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.320
hard did not fall into the disassociated

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:01.140
State but when a girl this girl story

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:03.870
starts it's just like start strategizing

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:06.030
it's like how can I end this story and

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:07.980
also keep you happy look is there a way

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:11.010
is there a thing I could say to collapse

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:15.150
this do you think that's what happens to

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:23.820
female comics not their fault it's just

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:26.490
everybody's trained to have Girl Talk so

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:28.290
one's Girl Talk starts everyone's just

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:46.050
like a protective trauma mechanism so I

00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:48.570
started doing the the deep dive is when

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:50.460
you go pure silence like quiet

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:53.160
meditative music I did the opposite last

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.080
night I'm like let's mix it up and I

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:58.830
listen I google intense dubstep and got

00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:01.110
stoned and put the headphones on that's

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:01.970
wild

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:04.710
that's [ __ ] that was that was the

00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:06.270
warhead challenge dude of like sitting

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:07.980
there for like [ __ ] to it listen to

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:11.850
an entire like intense dubstep song it's

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:14.090
like it changes like every forces yes

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:17.550
that was [ __ ] no I don't censor yo

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:19.080
how do you do that I would have just

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.000
thought about how [ __ ] corny the guy

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.630
who made it it's a protective mechanism

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:26.160
you guys are doing this is to it this is

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.020
[ __ ] dubstep drop is way too brutal

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:30.570
for me right now I'm saying I'm like

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:32.340
what was this guy like what is this guy

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.460
trying to do to me I wanted he make this

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.800
I got the feeling of social anxiety also

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.210
listening to dubstep last night it was

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:43.080
just like [ __ ] I want to go I can't

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:44.430
handle the world this is what it is

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:47.130
yeah dude dubstep is if you get a stone

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:48.480
as you can I don't this is just for fun

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.490
and giggles it's like a [ __ ] roller

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:52.860
coaster dude yeah close your eyes to get

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.960
as high as you can and then it's [ __ ]

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.490
listen to some dubstep it's like dude

00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:59.640
who they'll [ __ ] listens this is crazy

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:02.820
yeah what is this it's like robot heavy

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:03.150
metal

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:04.980
today's [ __ ] it's weird I feel that

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:06.420
way when I watch like a movie if I'm

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:07.230
like too high

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:08.370
I'm just I think about all the people

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:10.350
who went into making that movie and like

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:12.240
whether I can ever be someone to like

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.610
organize that group of people unless I

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:16.320
don't have I don't have that I start

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.880
directing the movie yeah yeah just

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:21.680
people chiming in with we should do this

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:25.710
yeah yeah the thing would fall in pieces

00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:26.850
like whenever I see a movie that's

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:28.830
totally disorganized like I'm like

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:32.160
that's what I would have made just

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.320
letting anyone just bully me into their

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.230
idea yeah yeah that's dissociating that

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:38.850
would be when you know in your head this

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:39.930
is not what I want to do and you're like

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:44.700
okay good idea well I also have that

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:45.840
thing where like sometimes someone will

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.400
suggest something and it's like I can't

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:52.050
I can't explain perfectly why that's a

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:54.120
bad idea right now but I just know that

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:57.540
it is yeah they may have a good argument

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.260
yourself like ego death but you're you

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:14.550

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:00.210
people getting killed around the

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:02.130

billions of dollars lot yeah it's be

00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:18.630
hard die hard to imagine that there

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:20.430
isn't some surprise Bernie's not gonna

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:23.100

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:24.540
trying to take a lot of money from a lot

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:29.130
of people allegedly someone tastes well

00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:30.570
they're all they're all they will also

00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:32.490
try to propaganda they can propagandize

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:33.510
their way out of it and they're probably

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:34.530
trying to do that first

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:36.600
and then if that doesn't work it's like

00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.130
yeah dude well here's the thing he's

00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:39.690
gonna be pitching these ideas to

00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:43.950
Congress and you know he's gonna need

00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:49.470
millionaire's approvals to tax I think

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:51.570
once we finally I think so it will have

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:53.520
socialism at some point the meantime

try to like yeah he started to be like

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:22.160
it was almost I almost felt like it was

00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:23.540
a little bit competitive at a point he's

00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:24.800
like oh and he was like well there's

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:26.390
it's not really a comedy city is it

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:27.620
he started be like where do you even do

00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:29.330
that it's not really a doctor city is it

00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:30.350
bro yeah dude

00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:31.880
but y'all heard hanaman just closed down

00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:36.350
all the good doctors are at Hopkins but

00:55:36.350 --> 00:55:39.170
I guess this scenes alright it was weird

00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:40.850
it was I was like what and I was about

00:55:40.850 --> 00:55:42.500
to instinctively be like actually I have

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:45.140
a pot and I was like yeah man not a big

00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:46.730
comedy town this kind of sucks being me

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:48.830
so uh yeah I'll just let that one live

00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:50.690
don't Google it last thing I need is my

00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:52.490
doctor to have it out for me bro I feel

00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:53.360
like it would be good to have your

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:55.520
doctor like listening to some of this

00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:57.920
why just get a good look in your life

00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:00.050
see what you're doing yeah [ __ ] my

00:56:00.050 --> 00:56:02.330
you think so yeah I feel like doctors

00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:03.410
where they know the better they feel

00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:04.760
like their snitches for health insurance

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.260
companies they're just trying to take

00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:08.150
negative they're like dude you're there

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:09.170
anymore and they're like do you [ __ ]

00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:12.140
guys like what if you only [ __ ] women

00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:14.800
the past 10 years I'm like chevre

00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:16.670
worried about they asked like weird

00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:18.590
risky questions so that you would say

00:56:18.590 --> 00:56:20.210
yes and then they jack up it'd be nice

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:22.490
if they like said that you were fat a

00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:24.860
nicer way yeah I mean like the BM I

00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:26.270
think if he actually came in it was like

00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:27.740
well it says on this chart that you

00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:28.760
could definitely hit a bunch of home

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:32.180
runs thank you yeah they should think so

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:33.260
what are you about to turn that all in a

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:35.120
muscle or what's going on here yeah they

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.140
should be they should be a little more

00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:38.630
sensitive about that yeah that was like

00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:40.010
it dude first of all I was why do you

00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:40.940
say it exactly

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:43.310
he was like BMI it's uh that's nothing

00:56:43.310 --> 00:56:45.020
to be worried about but it's up there a

00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:46.880
