00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.760
few weeks ago it was a comedian that was

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.320
on the tour anyway it doesn't matter

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.180

Matthew Schecter everybody thank you the

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.590
most interesting about thing about me is

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:40.480
that I was a intern for the Southampton

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.460
press which meant that I bumped into

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:44.710
people and I was working there one day

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.420
and my editor said go outside because

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.940
Don Hewitt wants to talk to someone and

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.410
for those of you who don't know he's the

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:51.960
creator of 60 minutes the most

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.760
successful show in all broadcast history

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.390
and no one wanted to talk to him and I

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.160
was like wow okay yeah sure I'll talk to

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.020
him I go out and he's like well normally

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.480
I talk to the publisher but oh okay and

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.250
I was like well what is it mr. Donahue

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:10.510
and he said well there's a car that got

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.250
broken into and I think I might have a

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:16.290
lead and I thought wow this guy

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:18.730
organized interviews with Saddam Hussein

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.910
and now he's on the case of the car

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:25.140
that's broken into

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:32.100
so for for me it was amazing and for him

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.080
it was humiliating to talk to an 18 year

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:44.220
old yeah okay Matthew Schechter yes sir

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:26.420
Maddy moe

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:30.450
so my girlfriend just recently did a

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:33.150
study abroad program in Greece and

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:35.220
basically this means that she got to go

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:37.770
on a very very expensive vacation for

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:40.710
about a month and definitely didn't

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:42.830
cheat on me while I was there

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.480
and while she was there we thought we

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.340
would obviously talk about how much how

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.470
much we miss each other and whatnot

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:52.680
so one day my mom comes into my

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.320
apartment and she says Chelsea really

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:59.040

miss you tonight I always wondered I

00:31:24.019 --> 00:31:26.039
always wondered what it would look like

00:31:26.039 --> 00:31:28.890
if Edward Norton and Eli Manning had a

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:31.309

your girlfriend cheating on you is

00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:59.760

hear anything specific but I just

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:37.980
thought I heard whispering I don't know

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.690
I just point out some and blamed it on

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:43.470
us it's okay let's figure out exactly

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:45.659
what the [ __ ] you wanted to say up here

00:32:45.659 --> 00:32:50.490
Matty so so your girls study abroad and

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:53.399
she cheated on you right no it was a

00:32:53.399 --> 00:32:56.130

right because I was so nervous that's

00:33:06.269 --> 00:33:07.679
that's what I was getting at I said

00:33:07.679 --> 00:33:09.779

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:10.540
day

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.030
I guess so especially if you come inside

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:16.570
of whatever your [ __ ] did you know

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:18.190

Gio Perez so you guys know that the rain

00:59:05.299 --> 00:59:06.650
forest has been burning it down in

00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:08.989
Brazil for like three months and nobody

00:59:08.989 --> 00:59:10.849
in this country has done [ __ ] about it

00:59:10.849 --> 00:59:14.239
except for pornhub now it's a fact look

00:59:14.239 --> 00:59:16.789
it up right they plan on planting a tree

00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:19.309
for every view that their website gets

00:59:19.309 --> 00:59:21.890
so sight every time point up gives me

00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:23.650
wood that gets them back to the planet

00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:44.239

don't want anything for Christmas I just

01:00:01.999 --> 01:00:03.999
want your mommy to live together again

01:00:03.999 --> 01:00:06.380

01:00:14.130 --> 01:00:16.200
oh that should be it that should be the

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.510
end of the joke oh that's destiny

01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:20.040
telling you right where to end that

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.930

snowboard in a tank top why do you think

01:17:08.169 --> 01:17:09.729
she wanted to lock you down so hard

01:17:09.729 --> 01:17:13.300
after three weeks yeah what you want to

01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:15.519
know this is Dyke lon

01:17:15.519 --> 01:17:18.459
where's that name from it was supposed

01:17:18.459 --> 01:17:19.389
to be dialogue

01:17:19.389 --> 01:17:20.919
my friends call me dialogue my name is

01:17:20.919 --> 01:17:23.219
Dylan

01:17:26.409 --> 01:17:28.670
that's supposed to be Annie that third

01:17:28.670 --> 01:17:31.159
letter yeah yeah you forgot the little

01:17:31.159 --> 01:17:34.790
loop part surprised how many people

01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:38.659
don't write their name down well for

01:17:38.659 --> 01:17:39.949
that's the only thing that's gonna be

01:17:39.949 --> 01:17:41.840
read but maybe that one you go with some

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:45.440
real good old-fashioned print literally

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:47.510
I never really talked about it because I

01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:49.190
don't ever want to be a broken record on

01:17:49.190 --> 01:17:51.380
this show so I really never bring it up

01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:54.610
but a fun fact is that really just about

01:17:54.610 --> 01:17:57.730
70% of these are really unreadable

01:17:57.730 --> 01:18:00.469
really always proud of myself most of

01:18:00.469 --> 01:18:02.000
the time when I read them and someone

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.420
stands up I'm like yes he has to read

01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:06.980
your name and you're signing like you're

01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:09.170
signing a check at a [ __ ] Apple

01:18:09.170 --> 01:18:12.850
Bannister's like sure whatever it says

01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:15.320
also but I think Dylan deserves some

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:17.210
credit for just going with daikon for a

01:18:17.210 --> 01:18:20.060
while I think it's it stems letting that

01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:22.850
go I've seen enough of other that was

01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:24.110
like the name of your wizard in the

01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:25.940
world of warcraft or something

01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:31.010
I am Dyke lon when you say other words

01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:34.489
strangely like are you on a date and you

01:18:34.489 --> 01:18:36.560
ask the woman do you want to try a now

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:42.679
later tonight if I'm paying for filete

01:18:42.679 --> 01:18:47.750
Magnon you best believe we are your

01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:49.909
parents have weird jobs or weird lives

01:18:49.909 --> 01:18:52.340

01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:55.310
accountant mom stayed home anything any

01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:56.960
fun facts that I feel like we're missing
