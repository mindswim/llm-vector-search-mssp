00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.910
patreon episode 141 point four five six

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.510
seven eight nine what up y'all I'm here

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.660
I'm shameless I'm shameless or about a

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.170
month

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.599
damn yeah I'm here we said the kid in

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.980
but early I wanted them to reprise their

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.170
roles why I get a lot of stuff to talk

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.189
to him about but I want it just to talk

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.689
to them about the stink tank and just

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.050
just have people understand exactly what

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.460
happened because I failed I should have

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.800
captured that on video that was my best

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.200
my eternal bed but I don't know what

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.670
else do you think would help well you

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.320
know what I'm gonna this is actually me

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.790
and bees are kind of brainstorm this you

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.200
know that going forward how we're gonna

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.270
film the stink tank everyone wears

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.610
GoPros on bicycle helmets and everyone's

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.890
film with each other as talks and show

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.020
me a four-way split screen on the PIO

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.840
everyone's POV it's gonna be awesome you

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.610
should get one of those 360 cams with

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.050
these for like Facebook for Google Maps

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.840
see pictures leave it up to them they

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.579
could just scroll around I think that's

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.299
true oh my god I think four or three or

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.460
four GoPros dueling will be the funniest

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.750
thing in the world yeah I think watching

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.119
watching three or four GoPros even if

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.619
you're sober would put you in a trippy

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.960
state like like a screen of four people

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.090
talking and interact but also both

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.250
GoPros would hit the person talking so

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.390
whoever you know they have those like

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.430
software's where it's like whenever they

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.049
talk it switches that person the people

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.090
would naturally turn their heads so the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.470
cameras would work to whoever's talking

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.939
and then will there be one camera

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.409
dislike like I looked at but early the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.400
whole time I was looking at your

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.829
sunglasses laughing to myself the entire

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.530
time I just wanted like I don't think

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.960
anyone understands how [ __ ] up

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.610
everything I was that [ __ ] up or if I

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.049
wasn't wearing sunglasses I thought like

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.869
I was just gonna fall apart

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.740
yeah I had to hide you did it well the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.320
shades you were behind the shades yeah I

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.310
looked up for you I'm like well but

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.079
Early's got it together playing the cool

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.899
hand i was i was [ __ ] up when i went

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.299
to work the next day yeah man how was

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.729
that this is sick that's pretty sick for

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.310
sure next day bonus oh yeah well I had a

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.849
I was fine ish I definitely took it to

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.200
the road yeah hit

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.660
international waters pretty hard and uh

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.410
dude again you can't go wrong with just

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.720
like if you're too high to drive just

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.410
mindlessly obey all signs if you want to

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.269
be extra safe put your hazards on for a

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.170
second I thought you're gonna say if

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.430
you're too high to drive don't do it

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.040
well you know I I was too high to drive

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.410
but again my dilemma was a tough one

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.849
being that I'd have to like tell my

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.590
girlfriend like hey I'm being

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.450
responsible and I'm too high to drive so

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.360
I'm gonna leave lose-lose situation well

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.940
I won because I drove home safely I want

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.329

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.810
man be safe out there dude I know how it

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.030
is yeah I just Porto Rican lady cop

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.130
pulled me over for a taillight or

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.609
something and she was like she's good

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:15.690
you know I pulled you over I was like

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.780
tail light isn't it just it was more

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.880
expensive of a repair than I expected

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.320
and she was just like I was gonna warn

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.310
you this time I was like

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.880
well I've learned you're supposed to

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.949
turn your interior light on so when a

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:31.300
cop pulls you over at night time

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.889
especially turn your interior light on

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.360
and that puts them at ease because

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.530
they're like they can see you the whole

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.599
time so they're coming up a little at

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.280
ease and then when you come me just like

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.139
I always like no I pulled you over I

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.050
used to be like no I used to clearly

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.090
blow a red light there know why I didn't

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.520
put do anything so now I'm like yeah man

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.080
I just let him like he got me dude I'm

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.330
like my bed and then I was like usually

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.889
they're pretty cool about that I've

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.440
encountered almost entirely cool cops in

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.210
my driving experience

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.550
I got caught it blown a red light in my

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.810
neighborhood one time it like 4:00 in

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.550
the morning we're on our way from on our

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.630
way home from a wedding and we were

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.780
fighting and I like didn't mean to blow

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.280
this red light but I missed I'm the

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.620
yellow light and I cop pulled me over

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.300
and he just drove up next week I was

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.590
like you know you blew that red light

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.960
and he could see that we were just like

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.069
in the middle of screaming at each other

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:20.500
it was like yeah I'm sorry about that

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.150
I was probably drunk at the time too he

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.840
was like don't stop it and he drove away

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.099
well he saw that did you so you guys are

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.229
arguing they are they are very if

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.120
there's one thing they can understand

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.740
it's fighting with their spouse because

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.630
that's all they do cops and cheaters

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.969
cops are cheaters or beaters mmm it's

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:38.289
one of the other so they probably get

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:39.960
home and kick your ass or just [ __ ]

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.310
do you probably go too hard that he

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.840
would have given you a [ __ ] fire

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.460
escort to go home and like beat your

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.639
wife

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:47.289
you gotta get you homes you can beat her

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:49.780
in the safety of your own house is one

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.639
of those states where you agree to fight

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:57.699
in front of a cop where do you view if a

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:59.770
cop comes and you're like you're having

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.150
an argument and you're like I want to

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.949
fight I would like to fight him and he's

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:04.270
like I accept that fight

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.099
you can duel still yeah but if you if it

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.849
goes to the ground they break it up

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:10.960
standing yes all right come alive so you

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.190
can standing duel yeah any like spinning

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.310
back for anything off the table I mean

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.370
super knuckle brawl dawg what can you

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.590
dip what do you mean in glass like

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:29.199
bloodsport that's a real loss actually

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:31.389
bring it over to you that's a real law

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:33.969
yeah there's a few there's a few states

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:36.400
that have it principally you ever seen a

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.020
YouTube video the black soup

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.360
dude who all he would do was like catch

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.340
people being rude to like bouncers and

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.930
then challenge them the mutual combat in

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.849
front of a cop no yeah he's like an MMA

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:47.080
fighter you just beat the [ __ ] up

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.569
eunuchs Jones oh yeah

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:51.250
[ __ ] man I'm not gonna pretend I didn't

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.539
know his name at some point yeah I know

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:55.240
I was like yeah he's doing this damn

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.789
dude let's [ __ ] you know I'm gonna start

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:05.560
challenging people ya know what's like

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.629
the what's the protocol is there like

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:10.449
how many paces apart do you start you

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:11.500
know what I mean then you start in

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.130
classic greco-roman position one

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.960
Handelman lats one finger up there but

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.909
the cops do they do like the classic

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:28.990
like a microphone microphone then they

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.169
grab there he calls her backup they form

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:34.110
a circle with the squad car

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.599
that's all cops should do yeah just go

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:39.310
around police and fights yeah it is

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.729
going on - anyone want to fight with

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:43.389
each other

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:46.060
there's a dude the dude Glenn Lowry I

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:46.599
watch

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:49.120
he's a proponent of letting

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.940
neighborhoods elect their own cops

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.800
so keeping cops is like a local

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.849
neighborhood thing so you would still

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:57.279
have like a city like patrol basically

00:07:57.279 --> 00:07:59.080
to make sure that doesn't like go in to

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.060
like kind of clannish oh no he's never

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.860
been to a white neighborhood but that's

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.380
basically what they do well pretty much

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.060
straddle the line between nerd and

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.870
alcoholic your cop nobody's saying you

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.370
wouldn't like in Philadelphia because in

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:13.479
Philadelphia it's the opposite you're

00:08:13.479 --> 00:08:15.849
not allowed to patrol the area you live

00:08:15.849 --> 00:08:17.949
so they'll find out where you live and

00:08:17.949 --> 00:08:19.330
send you on the other side of the city

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.310
but they're saying is like if everyone

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.380
so say like in any neighborhood there

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.599
was like local cops so that like your

00:08:25.599 --> 00:08:27.190
dad was basically a cop into every

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.389
single neighborhood we're like you would

00:08:28.389 --> 00:08:30.009
go out there dad and like learn like how

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:31.479
to do that with him and then you know

00:08:31.479 --> 00:08:32.800
you could just elect someone else if

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.180
someone started to suck you'd be like

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.130
yeah dude you're done a lot you're done

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.599
fired and someone else would be elected

00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:39.940
it kind of be like yeah - sheriff

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.380
corruption is that what you're about to

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.220
say cuz I come from I feel like it

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.899
familiarity would breed that corruption

00:08:46.899 --> 00:08:48.250
because where I come from I feel like

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.610
corruption would would be the Stan

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.589
like you become the cop because you want

00:08:53.589 --> 00:08:58.329
it you what the power you got to become

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:01.959
a cop you know the mind of yeah son

00:09:01.959 --> 00:09:06.449
what could you imagine the sheriff Kenzi

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.610
yeah III was thinking about that too

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.490
because it would be so easy to you know

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.920
but I'd also be really peaceful everyone

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.420
came every block would be like quietly

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.370
corrupt because it doesn't doesn't stop

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.110
corruption and a centralized like police

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.449
if you like decentralized police yeah

00:09:22.449 --> 00:09:23.920
they're probably a lot of cruft you know

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.749
it also be a big mob will be very quiet

00:09:25.749 --> 00:09:27.279
you wouldn't have a lot of murders

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:29.019
because that would peak the federal

00:09:29.019 --> 00:09:30.430
authorities big what's going on here and

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:31.689
they'd start looking into him that yeah

00:09:31.689 --> 00:09:34.660
dude everyone [ __ ] out of here I

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.129
imagine them all is like Old South

00:09:36.129 --> 00:09:38.410
mayor's here any mean just walking

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.269
around twirling like oh I'm sure it's

00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:48.490
gonna be wild west real quick yeah come

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:58.990
over here face social threat of like the

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.550
worst part it would just be the block

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.769
captain's would be cops yes never

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:04.209
interact with block captain's and that's

00:10:04.209 --> 00:10:05.709
like yeah you and I with a brutal trust

00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:07.870
them yeah they're brutal yeah dude I

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.339
there's a dude in my neighborhood who

00:10:09.339 --> 00:10:11.259
has his trash cans labeled with block

00:10:11.259 --> 00:10:15.790
captain that guy would kill you with

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:16.300
impunity

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.250
yeah he's basically the fat guy in the

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:22.120
favelas like you know bring up fresh

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.029
fruits every day yeah I mean I I do kind

00:10:25.029 --> 00:10:26.500
of like the idea of like people being

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.730
able to patrol their own neighborhoods

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:28.899
because it would cut out a lot of the

00:10:28.899 --> 00:10:30.610
[ __ ] you got caught in like pet

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.500
harassing they would just kill you so

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.480
it'd be like it would be but again it

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.339
kind of devolves into like third-world

00:10:36.339 --> 00:10:38.769
clannish kind of behavior but you're

00:10:38.769 --> 00:10:40.269
saying the suburbs is it is pretty

00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:41.920
similar we're like you just you can just

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.600
live in that area and it's like buzz

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.160
around as a cop well even if you came in

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.329
the air they just move out of the area

00:10:46.329 --> 00:10:48.970
and they police yeah I think

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:49.899
neighborhoods are kind of like that

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.519
because the community I grew up and I

00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:54.309
grew up in so it was in a town called

00:10:54.309 --> 00:10:55.839
path sound but they were like project

00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:58.829
housing within that community so

00:10:58.829 --> 00:11:02.740
basically it came to a point where cops

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.040
were afraid to come into that

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.770
yeah they were robbing policemen they

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.990
were on robbing mailmen they were

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:12.020
robbing like I said like we had to walk

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.930
we all we had to walk as we report but

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.400
people had to go to the post office to

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.950
get their mail oh because they wouldn't

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:20.900
you just like grew up hearing the ice

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:31.280
cream truck in the distance robbing the

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.890
ice cream truck will be awesome I'm good

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.080
Rab yeah that's a gummy there's

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.270
guaranteed a ton of cash in there also

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.250
those guys guaranteed to have guns yeah

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:41.810
but you're also robbing your community

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:46.280
of ice cream crimes pretty evil yeah

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.560
it's pretty evil yeah I don't know how I

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.390
feel about ID Glenn Larry I like

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:51.830
everything he says so I insulin was like

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.450
good idea but I was like that could

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:55.190
breed real quick corruption where it's

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.380
like your brother's a drug dealer you

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.690
become a cop everyone's peaceful but at

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:01.220
the same time yeah I guess them the

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.840
bodies would be stacking up you're like

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.600
but then again if it could be like local

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.100
police and still detectives so the

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.420
detectives would always be circling

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:10.040
seeing what's going on in like pitting

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.860
like informers get to it would be yeah

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:27.770
it could be clear basically like three

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:29.750
different families of cops do me like

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.450
that force McCusker the force but early

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:33.710
in life I mean this is the Mafia

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:35.450
basically yeah

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.760
it would just become the Mafia did Y all

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.500
accidentally get super high before this

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:47.240
one - no system that will be tight

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.610
though if so I would have run for City

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:54.470
Council and pitch feudalism oh yeah I

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.960
didn't tell you man I'm uh I've now

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.510
taken up the mantle of investigative

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:01.130
journalist hell yeah I'm an

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:02.750

almost there but tell me about really

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.230
yeah

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:08.030
H is coming well I mean as soon as I

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:09.560
heard about basically how anyone could

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.120
be a cop now and Glenn Lowry where I'm

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.650

transition because there's like a

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.510
there's an accepted gruffness to them

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.700
you know what I mean it's like that like

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.950
that gruff transition like PPA people

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.870
around you next to be like light-skinned

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.820
chicks you think they'll come in next

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.990
they think they're just waiting to see

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.790
if the coast is clear basically well

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:54.149
mailman's one of those jobs that like

00:14:54.149 --> 00:14:57.279
people come in and shoot the work it's

00:14:57.279 --> 00:14:58.810
not like all the time it'll like that it

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.670
happened a lot it has happened

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:01.990
traditionally now there's actually a ton

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:03.279
of jobs with that a lot of factories

00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:04.779
that happens did I actually part of

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:05.980
being an investigative journalist I've

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.690
been looking into mass shootings yeah

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:09.100
dude well that's that's not my firt

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.649
that's like down the road my first prize

00:15:11.649 --> 00:15:13.899
right now is I'm starting local yeah so

00:15:13.899 --> 00:15:14.800
I'm starting the Philadelphia Parking

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.449
Authority nice so I started an

00:15:16.449 --> 00:15:18.970
investigation today dude it's the most

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:22.209
honest thing in the world dude to start

00:15:22.209 --> 00:15:23.980
an investigation because when you call

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:27.339
so I like my whole my beef was that I am

00:15:27.339 --> 00:15:29.380
I think I talked about this before but

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:30.380
it was Tom

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.610
the governor could declared a state of

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:33.680
emergency yeah two years ago in the

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.690
winter it was icy he's like stay off the

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:37.580
roads as a citizen I was like yes sir

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.350
I will stay off the roads Tom Wolfe I

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:40.880
get a ticket from the Philadelphia

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.590
Parking Authority and I was like what

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:45.200
the [ __ ] I was ordered by my governor to

holy [ __ ] so you have to fill out a few

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.510
you can go get your belongings out of

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.069
your car but you have to write what

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:20.990
you're getting out of there so like I

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:25.250

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:26.420
time I went in there I wrote in like a

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:29.060
large double-ended dildo and then I put

news sources so I called said I call it

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:07.300
affiliate was closed but then I called a

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.980
councilman David oh I did some more

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.340
research David oh he's been beefing with

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:16.630
the PPA forever and he basically guy he

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:18.490
was the one to get them to be audited

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:20.260
because they thought there was 80

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.610
million dollars that was missing for the

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.440
PBA supposed to give all the leftover

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.600
money to Philadelphia and there was 80

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.980
million that came time to pay to the

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.930
schools they end up giving 1 million

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:31.600
instead of 80 and they're like so David

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.790
owes Ben beef in the farm I'm not

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:34.930
connecting the dots I was putting out

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.580
the facts David Oh was stabbed two years

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:40.300
ago oh yeah dude this guy's an enemy of

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.530
the parking authority so he was saying

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:42.880
the part his beef of the parking

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:47.080
authority is that they in 2011 the that

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.700
used to be a city run organization the

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.860
state came in was like we get to appoint

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.540
members of the board as well so there's

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:53.080
a coup

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.270
well now the state appoints their people

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.300
and then uses that money to fund

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.590
Republicans in the state whereas

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.630
Philadelphia sorry a democratic City and

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.490
David owes a Republican but he's David

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.350
oh [ __ ] hates corruption so he was

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.030
just like yeah this is [ __ ] we got

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.710
to audit the PPA so there David people

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:09.940
David knows people are gonna send me

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.440
like an hour-long presentation on what

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.090
they dug up on the parking authority so

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:14.230
who do you think it wasn't tried to kill

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:16.450

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:18.130

now they put out and they're out they

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.890
were audited internally so they put out

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:46.630

journalist Tuesday is only operate I'm

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:55.179

send you everything I did they

00:25:07.809 --> 00:25:09.070
apparently from when I was reading

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:10.480
there's an article in Billy Penn about

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.950
the PPA and how David O has been

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:13.630
battling them for years apparently

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:15.610
there's like a ton of like nepotism and

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:17.679
like they I don't know how I'm gonna get

00:25:17.679 --> 00:25:19.029
that presentation but apparently it's

00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:21.399
like they're using the PPA money to

00:25:21.399 --> 00:25:23.019
funnel it back up to the state in the

00:25:23.019 --> 00:25:25.179
Republican Party to finance campaigns

00:25:25.179 --> 00:25:27.279
well like you say go gotta be ready for

00:25:27.279 --> 00:25:29.740
a little bit of corruption of course who

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.899
they're following your plan oh so it

00:25:31.899 --> 00:25:34.600
wasn't this is basic lesson collusion it

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.440
was PPA collusion yeah dude Donald Trump

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.289
got elected because of the PPA taking it

00:25:41.289 --> 00:25:43.179
all well they were against him at first

00:25:43.179 --> 00:25:45.010
now they love him now the Republicans

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.830
mercier money though PPA money Jeb Bush

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.149
was supposed to win with like people

00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:50.590
we're like even like four local people's

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:51.940
you want to get local people went in at

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.490
a local level but yeah it's it was used

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:56.230
for like campaign they're using the PPA

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.110
revenue for campaign money this I mean

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:00.399
there's been like zillions of scandals

00:26:00.399 --> 00:26:01.840
with this stuff it's totally [ __ ]

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.190
corrupt it is it's like are you gonna

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.019
get video if you like pestering I'm

00:26:05.019 --> 00:26:06.519
gonna go to see facial I'm gonna see

00:26:06.519 --> 00:26:09.909
from their car for the first thing is to

00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:11.830
get lay of the land and then it's gonna

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:14.049
be I'm gonna start targeting different

00:26:14.049 --> 00:26:15.490

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:16.690
whole board to you I'm gonna get the

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:18.220

Authority and investigate them one by

00:26:19.779 --> 00:26:21.130
one it's gonna be like a [ __ ] six

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:22.450
hours in the movies when they show you

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:26.139
counterfeiting your press pass laminated

00:26:26.139 --> 00:26:28.120
letters that's gonna be so sick yeah I

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.889
think I could probably get a press pass

00:26:29.889 --> 00:26:30.500
you

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.600
yeah you buy ones like 25 bucks okay

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.480
nice yeah what no no really hold on I'm

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.140
sorry that's for like conventions yeah

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.580
you can get a press pass so you need to

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.220
seek out comic-con yeah well if I have

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.710
any LLC I'm gonna start an LLC so I

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:47.360
think if I have an LLC I can get him you

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.560
seem like the type of person who already

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.600
has a couple LLC I've done what they've

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.630
stank okay i-i've had a couple LLC's you

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:54.830
have to give them back when they're oh

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:56.240
the thing it sucks no they just dissolve

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.580
just so they dissolve and it's like so I

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:00.380
had LLC's before and they just failed to

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.060
make any money so you just let them go

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.520
and they dissolve in fed well I've had

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.860
multiple LLC's dude what do you mean you

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.570
just let him go and they dissolve æther

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:10.340
nothing goes away no there's already a

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.170
person says nothing nothing just goes

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:13.670

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:15.710
names of my LLC's but they've literally

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:18.110
all definitely goes away but no if you

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:19.760
don't pay the there's like a thing you

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.840
have to pay to keep it up and if you

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.580
don't pay and like it's your name is up

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.230
for grabs again so someone can get it or

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:26.600
it just goes away yeah my LLC's are

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:31.880

00:30:03.259 --> 00:30:05.269
mine I had a lot of guilt about that for

00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:07.009
a long time like when I was doing comedy

00:30:07.009 --> 00:30:10.730

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:12.799
enjoyed her job it's just like like

00:30:12.799 --> 00:30:14.570
knowing that it's always in the back of

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:16.009
their mind like I'm happy I'm not having

00:30:16.009 --> 00:30:16.279

yeah there's no way she's completely

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.750
enjoying that I mean in my experience no

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.480
that's been a hard no for me whether

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.399
I'll be like I have to go do this and

00:30:25.399 --> 00:30:27.039
like come on that doesn't even count

00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:30.830
it's like yeah yeah that counts yeah I

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:32.870
had years of unnecessary turns out she

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:36.799
really really does love her job so I was

00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:39.289
just wasting waiting we all guilt yeah

00:30:39.289 --> 00:30:41.210

hasn't worked in ten years how you feel

00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:47.570
and I work every day I don't know five

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:49.460
days yeah I think that's kind of nice

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.950
you ever hold it over her head

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:56.110
no no why because do you ever be like

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:57.350

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.360
you'll come home and be like really you

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.100
sat around you really you ever boss her

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.090
a little bit where you come home and

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:04.190
you're like I thought about that or

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:05.799
she's creepy

00:31:05.799 --> 00:31:08.690
she's such a [ __ ] lunatic that I have

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:10.910
to like play everything like knowing

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:13.820
like I have to like constantly remind

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.320
her like I'm down I get it I know that

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:19.730
you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] you know I let

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:21.679
her know that I love her and that it's

00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:25.070
okay that she's [ __ ] yeah and so I it

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:26.419
would be pretty uncool because we have

00:31:26.419 --> 00:31:28.130
three kids that's the that's why she

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:29.240
doesn't work she's been for sure our

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.549
children cheaper than daycare dick move

00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:33.559
well yeah especially when you're as

00:31:33.559 --> 00:31:35.539
[ __ ] broke and uneducated as we were

00:31:35.539 --> 00:31:36.440
when we started

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.409
yeah so I'm yeah I would be way out of

00:31:39.409 --> 00:31:40.850
line if I came home I was like paying

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:43.429
you for all day but I do say that I say

00:31:43.429 --> 00:31:44.809
that laughing she is completely

00:31:44.809 --> 00:31:45.320
different

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.710
that's hilarious well do you ever like

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:52.460
trying to think I I get I get into like

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.950
little [ __ ] what the hell was I saying I

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:57.530
don't know why I got I get a little beef

00:31:57.530 --> 00:31:59.480
swear it's like because I wonder I think

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.640
a lot of it's a good thing for babe to

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.289
say home and I think they've been kind

00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:05.870
of sigh opt to be like no I'm gonna find

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:07.880
my ultimate meaning in a career all

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.010
right and it's like yeah jobs strict

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:12.650
minute it's how it was like the old lawn

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:13.940
mowing thing my dad's like I was like

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:15.110
dad can I please my lawn he's like

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:16.669
alright and then forever I had a moan

00:32:16.669 --> 00:32:17.690
along I'm like this sucks

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:19.549
it's [ __ ] blows I don't want to do

00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:22.210
this Oh what I was going to say is the

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:26.539
2d I don't so the day care thing is you

00:32:26.539 --> 00:32:27.830
know obviously people have to do that

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:30.039
but from like an attachment perspective

00:32:30.039 --> 00:32:32.570
those like first six years are really

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:34.850
crucial so it's really good that they're

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:36.919
at home with a primary caregiver yeah

00:32:36.919 --> 00:32:38.809
kids are adapted really strongly about

00:32:38.809 --> 00:32:39.950
this I don't want to bite too hard on

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:41.330
you saying it because I'll never shut up

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:43.789
about it but I'm trying to say anything

00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:45.710
about it because that could be just talk

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:47.780
I'm like I'm a very primal dad well dude

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:49.820
this is a bad is I try not to bring this

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.140
up around people if some people get like

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.460
[ __ ] fired up about this but I'm like

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.470
if you there's a whole body of

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:55.669
literature in psychology called

00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:57.770
attachment theory it's ages like

00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:00.669
basically 0 to 6 and there's it's like

00:33:00.669 --> 00:33:03.470
dude I mean you're just hoping at

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:04.970
daycare that they're not just ignoring

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:07.159
your kid that's Fox kids that's the

00:33:07.159 --> 00:33:08.960
best-case scenario sometimes you

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.320
yeah yeah which I mean it's shitty like

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.000
not ever gonna have it you know I get it

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.490
but it almost makes sense like the fact

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:20.179
that people outsource that blows my mind

00:33:20.179 --> 00:33:23.690
where dude what the [ __ ] you like you're

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:26.179
gonna go make 50 grand a year stay the

00:33:26.179 --> 00:33:28.340
[ __ ] home dude it is not something that

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.260
you just be like like how is anything

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:31.309
more important than that

00:33:31.309 --> 00:33:33.679
yeah or more fulfilling and like I don't

00:33:33.679 --> 00:33:35.860
know but I this is all horrible thought

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.690
I think one of the worst things that

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:41.390
they can show on the news like well that

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:42.740
they can like get away with like the

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:46.399
darkest [ __ ] is when those like fat

00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:48.260
daycare workers offer cut a kid and they

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.820
do a backflip like that's the most

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.620
horrific thing that they'll air wait

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:52.250
what do they do

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:54.230
like there's constant like security

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:55.610
camera footage from daycares of like

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:59.510
that's me I'm getting that footage every

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.580
time you hear about like a daycare it's

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.470
always like some fat lady hitting a kid

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:04.909
in the head and the kid does like a OH

00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:06.799
Power Rangers would punish the weak bad

00:34:06.799 --> 00:34:08.240
guys and they do like a backflip off the

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:08.510
slide

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:11.210
well Jersey uh Matilda yeah it's like

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:12.530
that what's the teacher's name the

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:14.389
trench pole Miss Trunchbull did mr. on

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:16.879
dude watch Matilda again it's a lady

00:34:16.879 --> 00:34:18.589
who's basically in Nazis where they're

00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:20.750
getting out beating the [ __ ] out of

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:22.580
little kids I think you funny the kid at

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.020
one point yes you've roofs up she grabs

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.520
him by their pigtails and like throws

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.990
them over a fence it's the funniest

00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:29.389
medieval torture devices she has the

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:31.429
Chokey which I mean I was looking into

00:34:31.429 --> 00:34:33.830
it like that's the gas chamber nothing's

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:35.000
ever looked as good on film as that

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.780
chocolate cake that if you watch that

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.940
movie now they took a lady who's kind of

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:43.220
a not so I get it from a Nazi family and

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:44.599
when kids are bad she puts them in

00:34:44.599 --> 00:34:47.089
basically a gas chamber yeah she's a

00:34:47.089 --> 00:34:49.849
Nazi running a school yeah the tilde is

00:34:49.849 --> 00:34:56.869
a [ __ ] up movie dude here's the thing

00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:59.030
I don't like either I mean it's like to

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:01.190
a lesser degree but still you see these

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:03.920
same daycare videos and I have like a

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.750
dude for some reason that they can't

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:08.270
even know why he's there yeah just

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:15.560
crossing kids up don't be you know

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.510
crossing my kiddo without his dad there

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:19.770
to be on our defensive advice

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:22.440
you're an adult you need God out there

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.620
with proper advice for this kid like

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:28.170
nobody's [ __ ] up do it on camera to be

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:33.510
crossing your kid and then post is being

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:35.580
like like I've played basketball against

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:37.770
little kids and I've I observe the ratio

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:39.600
where like I don't like [ __ ] I'll

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.610
block maybe 1 out of every 5 shots I'll

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:44.280
send it in the [ __ ] stands but I'm

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.870
not gonna be like crossing them up and

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:48.180
like no that's [ __ ] up my hitting them

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.310
with like that the the crossover has

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:51.900
like the hesitation first and then a

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:56.870
heart make them a little head whip yeah

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:00.960
it's [ __ ] up yeah there's a whole body

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.210
of literature that's kind of like how

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:05.700
it's like the one of the most important

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.500
things like personality to finding thing

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.740
to like build a strong bond and like be

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:12.750
there and like be there alt and it you

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:14.100
can't outsource it like grandmother's

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.080
can do it or other people can do it but

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.750
the it's a one-to-one thing dude you

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:20.820
can't it's not a 1 to 5 operation where

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:22.530
you're just like I talked to posting all

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:24.150
these babies I took my shirt off in the

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:25.410
hospital when our youngest was born

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:27.600
because the skin to skin to skin yeah

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.450
it's real I was like I'll do this

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:32.190
because I don't care it either way sure

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.260
this is the only one that like really is

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.720
attached to me really other two we're

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.690
always just [ __ ] scrambling to get to

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:43.140
mommy but this [ __ ] my dog Fritz you

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:44.730
once Candis Cayne I went to skin to skin

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:48.230
and the dude is like my number one wow

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:50.790
that's pretty tight yeah we went to we

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:53.430
went to a birth center for first which

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:56.040
it's basically where you have to do

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.800
money to have your kid in a hospital but

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.550
you have them in like a facility yeah I

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:05.130
know it's like natural birth oh but it's

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:09.210
uh so everything's kind of I wouldn't

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:11.210
say they're the reason we did

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:13.170
skin-to-skin contact but they're like

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:14.430
they tell you when this baby comes out

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:17.550
everybody's got the shirt off yeah I

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:20.780
don't get them all these out Nick Baker

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:25.470
former comedian now LA denizen Nick

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:28.620
Baker did a whole business life remember

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:30.770
that

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:34.260
it was shirts for dads that you could

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.720
just open and then put your babies like

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.860
breastfeeding Wow

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:42.450
he launched this thing where is like you

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:44.070
could open your shirt and then it still

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:45.540
looked kind of cool look like good

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:46.470
that's what happens when you just sit

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:51.060
around making LC something my thing

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.490
right now is that's what I left Facebook

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:55.440
shortly after that yeah I got a beef

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.480
with him one time why because it was

00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.540
like he was on Facebook he started wait

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:03.000
waitering he was a waiter and he was

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.680

do things waiters don't want to hear ten

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:06.120
things myself for someone else I can't

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.640
think of a more skilless job than a

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.740
[ __ ] barista dude if you can do the

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:12.990
Leafs and [ __ ] and a coffee thing cool

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:15.180
enough hell yeah but all I will say

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.490
that's a big waste of time you could do

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:18.750
something else you know I ain't a latte

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:21.270
art you know how to feign a lot really I

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:22.860
don't like something it's the truest

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:29.760
expression Sydney's a man who

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.350
appreciates beauty in all forms

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:34.560
I hate latte art I hate baristas I don't

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.540
like a job this is what I used to tell

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.250
people but this was not a well received

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:39.390
I just didn't stand out but it was not

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:40.680
well-received because typically is in

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.120
comedy clubs where's all waiters in

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:44.010
there who I liked but I'd be like dude

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:45.039
there's a reason you get

00:39:45.039 --> 00:39:47.109
two dollars an hour the state values

00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:49.739
your labor at $2 an hour

00:39:49.739 --> 00:39:52.150
banks on everyone pitying your skill

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:54.910
lessness and giving you alms that's what

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:56.679
a way I mean there's a reason you get $2

00:39:56.679 --> 00:39:57.189
an hour

00:39:57.189 --> 00:39:58.959
you still tip though right I tip them

00:39:58.959 --> 00:40:02.769
I'm a generous tipper yeah what year I

00:40:02.769 --> 00:40:05.019
sneer upon the servants that's it bring

00:40:05.019 --> 00:40:08.559

00:40:09.999 --> 00:40:12.489
ever said anything back to waiters yeah

00:40:12.489 --> 00:40:14.499
know what I've done before is like if

00:40:14.499 --> 00:40:16.539
I've gotten like real bad service or

00:40:16.539 --> 00:40:17.140
attitude

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.640
we're like the people were like dropping

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.199
the ball I will just like I'll ask like

00:40:20.199 --> 00:40:21.519
someone else which is annoying out like

00:40:21.519 --> 00:40:22.689
they have other tables when hey can you

00:40:22.689 --> 00:40:24.009
get me this and like I'll have them

00:40:24.009 --> 00:40:25.390
bring me a couple things and at the end

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.400
I'll go up and give that other person

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.169
I'm like I'm giving your tip because you

00:40:29.169 --> 00:40:29.919

00:40:29.919 --> 00:40:31.989
that's devious to you amen dude I've got

00:40:31.989 --> 00:40:34.689
was an inner turmoil - yeah okay because

00:40:34.689 --> 00:40:37.299
that person really should give the tip

00:40:37.299 --> 00:40:39.160
to the person whose table it was what

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.140
they strew they [ __ ] the bed yeah I've

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:42.309

00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:48.369
everybody done I mean dude I'm all about

00:40:48.369 --> 00:40:50.109
being a waiter for like a quick pop of

00:40:50.109 --> 00:40:51.609
money you're figuring things out but

00:40:51.609 --> 00:40:52.959
like when people are like they talk

00:40:52.959 --> 00:40:54.819
about it like the industry when they're

00:40:54.819 --> 00:40:56.589
like oh dude yeah I've been in trust me

00:40:56.589 --> 00:40:57.549
I know how it is I've been in the

00:40:57.549 --> 00:40:59.049
industry they try to talk about it like

00:40:59.049 --> 00:41:00.459
it's [ __ ] Vietnam and it's like dude

00:41:00.459 --> 00:41:03.939
you were serving you were servant an

00:41:03.939 --> 00:41:08.349
overpaid fattened servant I just do die

00:41:08.349 --> 00:41:10.119
I can't dude and right now you're my

00:41:10.119 --> 00:41:13.239
servant no get my mozzarella I'm nice

00:41:13.239 --> 00:41:15.369
I'm nice to waiters I I just when they

00:41:15.369 --> 00:41:17.289
try to give me attitude about heart I

00:41:17.289 --> 00:41:19.119
grew up doing construction so I hear a

00:41:19.119 --> 00:41:20.769
waiter tried to tell me how you don't

00:41:20.769 --> 00:41:22.539
understand man I'm like yeah I think I

00:41:22.539 --> 00:41:24.569
do I think I understand how hard it is

00:41:24.569 --> 00:41:27.609
this is the way I relate to this in this

00:41:27.609 --> 00:41:29.769
way there are people that were bullied

00:41:29.769 --> 00:41:32.829
in high school and they say um I got the

00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:34.599
worst type of bullying because I wasn't

00:41:34.599 --> 00:41:37.659
if I get physically I was emotionally

00:41:37.659 --> 00:41:44.559
bullied I think that's not worse there's

00:41:44.559 --> 00:41:46.509
a comedian well it depends what depends

00:41:46.509 --> 00:41:48.729
where they're going Greg Greg Greg Lynn

00:41:48.729 --> 00:41:51.699
yeah he hates me because one time after

00:41:51.699 --> 00:41:52.569
his show

00:41:52.569 --> 00:41:54.189
we were we were all sitting outside

00:41:54.189 --> 00:41:55.839
talking was a show in Conshohocken I'm

00:41:55.839 --> 00:41:57.140
not my show but a different chair

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.940
and we were all sitting outside talking

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:01.670
he started talking about how he had to

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:03.890
survive the worst type of bullying and I

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:06.799
was like he looks like a kid that would

00:42:06.799 --> 00:42:08.869
be bullying I'm like holy [ __ ] like do

00:42:08.869 --> 00:42:10.460
tell that's boys that might be the worst

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:12.589
kind of bully like you do look like

00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:17.119
someone who'd be bullied I guess he's

00:42:17.119 --> 00:42:19.760
carrying had been bullied in life with

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.140
him dude though that's something people

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:22.910
forget about that's something like how

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:24.980
much that's being carried around you

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:27.890
guys get bullied at all I was I was a

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:31.549
bully fighter boy yeah looks like like

00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:33.619
if somebody came to a situation where I

00:42:33.619 --> 00:42:37.130
was in and started bullying any one

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:39.410
person I would get so terrified that it

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:40.970
was gonna happen to me that I would just

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:44.569
attack him just like you don't mean yeah

00:42:44.569 --> 00:42:46.339
you probably don't carry about Jude I

00:42:46.339 --> 00:42:48.260
feel like as a kid I was definitely in

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:51.500
the bullying zone but I also lived in a

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.900
place where like there wasn't like much

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:55.690
targeted bullying people were just like

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:58.039
relentlessly awful of each other all the

00:42:58.039 --> 00:43:00.529
time I'm free for that makes sense well

00:43:00.529 --> 00:43:02.509
my I didn't know clear pecking order at

00:43:02.509 --> 00:43:04.910
most times it was okay always one or two

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:07.220
that kind of get a different level of

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.869
bullying or they get they get something

00:43:08.869 --> 00:43:10.670
that's different words like people are

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:14.000
actually practicing hate and venom on

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.099
this person I mean we were pretty brutal

00:43:16.099 --> 00:43:17.720
my grade school if anyone was like kind

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.460
of weird we would unanimously kind of

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:21.410
bully them in torturing them and that's

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:23.480
the one I'm talking about yeah

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.039
gets a little mean well I remember

00:43:25.039 --> 00:43:26.750
that's like preconscious levels I member

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:28.039
like someone who was like kind of [ __ ]

00:43:28.039 --> 00:43:30.309
up I'd be like I'm gonna pinch his arm

00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:33.200
being fat enough to be bullied and like

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.640
even thing like well I gotta figure

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.170
something out for they really certainly

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:38.269
but they were like there were enough

00:43:38.269 --> 00:43:40.579
kids fatter than me thank God that it

00:43:40.579 --> 00:43:42.799
like I I was usually under the radar

00:43:42.799 --> 00:43:44.690
dude that's pretty tight yeah I didn't I

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:47.299
got like bullied by my brother's pretty

00:43:47.299 --> 00:43:48.950
brutally but at least bought my brothers

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:50.240
so it wasn't like it doesn't count

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:52.369
yeah exactly count brothers they

00:43:52.369 --> 00:43:54.500
physically beat the [ __ ] out of you

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.839
until yeah you're just big enough to

00:43:56.839 --> 00:43:58.880
like fight back I mean I remember the

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.380
day I fought why I would get like I'd be

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:01.579
like sitting on a couch and they picked

00:44:01.579 --> 00:44:03.380
me up and like dangku submerge my head

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:06.000
in the toilet an egg later and Lee

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.589
I'm Everest being like [ __ ] but that is

00:44:08.589 --> 00:44:10.059
different than going I don't know I like

00:44:10.059 --> 00:44:11.349
because they're and they're like my

00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:13.270
older life igloo it's a classic Bullock

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:15.520
classic in house swirl he did when I was

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.440
18 I started doing jujitsu and I arm

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:18.790
bard my older brother and we haven't

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:21.280
even played fought it's like we don't

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.900
mess around physically since did he beat

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:24.910
you up on your oh my god they beat the

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:26.020
[ __ ] out of me got in the boat ground

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:30.849
pool him with his buddies would take my

00:44:30.849 --> 00:44:32.470
[ __ ] and swimsuit off and throw it on

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:34.809
the roof and it was above-ground pool

00:44:34.809 --> 00:44:36.339
with a ladder and said I had to climb

00:44:36.339 --> 00:44:38.050
out of the far side of the pool walk all

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:49.000
the way around pose bird oh that's like

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.099
that's borderline sexual abuse but it

00:44:51.099 --> 00:44:53.109
doesn't count pretty so yeah Larry when

00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:54.190
it's in the house it doesn't really

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:56.349
count but it's got to be a sibling now

00:44:56.349 --> 00:44:57.670
if your dad beats you up and throws you

00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:58.900
outside naked eye then that's like

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.010
you're gone you're gonna live in

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:02.079
somewhere else you're living with an old

00:45:02.079 --> 00:45:05.290
fat lady with cats dude yeah man that's

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:07.869
like that's I got but I don't know if

00:45:07.869 --> 00:45:09.250
it's worse in your house because it's

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:11.079
like I don't know if you like in your

00:45:11.079 --> 00:45:13.210
house it makes it seem at worst but then

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:14.710
you normalize that to where you have

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:16.690
like this crazy [ __ ] brain with all

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:18.099
that like I would still catch myself

00:45:18.099 --> 00:45:20.589
thinking about doing something and like

00:45:20.589 --> 00:45:22.630
like already hearing my brothers being

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:29.140
like [ __ ] we were having trip one time

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.690
and two of my brothers were sitting with

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:33.280
me in a tent and they were just making

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:37.569
fun of the size of my head for there was

00:45:37.569 --> 00:45:40.270
nothing to do it was a rainy day laying

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:41.829
into the other size of my head and to

00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:43.270
this day I don't care about that I have

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:44.980
a big head but on cons I just have

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:46.599
mental images like wow I have a [ __ ]

00:45:46.599 --> 00:45:49.900
huge edge we fight him I come from a big

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:52.569
head family but you can make you can go

00:45:52.569 --> 00:45:54.849

00:45:54.849 --> 00:45:56.380
friends who's a bully his little brother

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:57.790
because his brother you would be like

00:45:57.790 --> 00:46:06.910
he's got a big body but a tiny man I

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:08.920
have ever crying to my dad and telling

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:10.030
them that my brothers are calling me

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:13.270
Pumpkinhead yeah and I the I guess the

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:15.339
feel the way I remember now is like him

00:46:15.339 --> 00:46:16.630
just trying to work up the energy to

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:17.819
give a [ __ ]

00:46:17.819 --> 00:46:19.640
stupid loser dad have a big head

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:22.559
probably I don't know my fellow my whole

00:46:22.559 --> 00:46:25.199
family has big-ass heads dude I feel

00:46:25.199 --> 00:46:26.789
like you get like your head comes out in

00:46:26.789 --> 00:46:28.709
near-final sighs way before the rest of

00:46:28.709 --> 00:46:31.920
your body I grew into it I may be my

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.229
girlfriend will pretty like shamelessly

00:46:34.229 --> 00:46:36.539
be like God you have such a big face and

00:46:36.539 --> 00:46:39.749
I'm like thanks girls are [ __ ] mean

00:46:39.749 --> 00:46:41.849
man yeah at least maybe who I date man

00:46:41.849 --> 00:46:44.489
they're they've like constantly deriding

00:46:44.489 --> 00:46:46.259
me and being like man you have like a

00:46:46.259 --> 00:46:52.619
really big looking for yeah my mom one

00:46:52.619 --> 00:46:54.959
of our brothers recently ruined all of

00:46:54.959 --> 00:46:57.449
the the hardcore poking fun at each

00:46:57.449 --> 00:46:59.130
other so he's a pilot

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:01.890
right okay and we were talking about the

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:05.009
Coriolis effect was that when basically

00:47:05.009 --> 00:47:07.199
swirling when [ __ ] swirls in the

00:47:07.199 --> 00:47:09.329
direction and we were talking about

00:47:09.329 --> 00:47:25.109
whether or not it was only because we

00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:26.489
were talking about whether or not it was

00:47:26.489 --> 00:47:28.319
strong enough to change the direction of

00:47:28.319 --> 00:47:29.880
the toilet bowl on the different sides

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:31.499
of the earth right because that's what

00:47:31.499 --> 00:47:33.930
that you know so if you uh if you flush

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:35.640
the toilet bowl on the northern

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:37.349
hemisphere it goes clockwise stop if

00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:50.309
your magnets so if you North Pole South

00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:51.719
Pole you're talking it affects the way

00:47:51.719 --> 00:47:53.519
toilets whirl yeah because of the things

00:47:53.519 --> 00:47:54.749
affected I thought that was just a flush

00:47:54.749 --> 00:47:56.219
mechanism when it fell it swirled like

00:47:56.219 --> 00:47:57.690
counter clockwise so that's actually

00:47:57.690 --> 00:48:00.630
what it is it's literally when water

00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:04.380
falls it swirls yeah well when how come

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:05.940
if I run around the perimeter of a pool

00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:09.299
I can create the career or that's a

00:48:09.299 --> 00:48:10.680
[ __ ] sick move you're somewhat you

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:11.940
had an above-ground pool you guys must

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:24.539
be like twister came out just oh so you

00:48:24.539 --> 00:48:25.709
guys were discussing the court but

00:48:25.709 --> 00:48:27.180
you're saying on the Northern Hemisphere

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:28.680
it swirls one way on the south and it's

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:30.449
a learned hemisphere it swirls the other

00:48:30.449 --> 00:48:31.030
way

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:33.310
but that's about the equator just drops

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:35.290
flat we'll see it's like an airplane

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:38.260
it's like a lot so there's this guy

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:41.380
that's on like in like one of these

00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:43.390
equator areas yeah you can like beyond

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:47.500
so he's uh he he takes a tub and he

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.050
drains it on one side of the equator and

00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:51.970
then he picks it up takes it to the

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:53.710
other side and drains it and it you can

00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:55.390
see it spin the different directions and

00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:56.680
it's just touristy things and people

00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:58.810
throw money in a hat and are impressed

00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:00.970
but it's a tricky trick there's a little

00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:04.030
scam he does so it's not even just a

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:06.490
myth this guy on the equator scamming

00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:09.990
people out of money by flushing toilet

00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:13.030
[ __ ] every single time when he's down

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:14.200
the equators you're I'm bringing you a

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:35.770
toilet so I see [ __ ] coming out of an

00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:39.810
ass close-up way too often

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:43.600
my girls didn't want to [ __ ] at all like

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:45.940
they had they they each had they eat

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.100
gently when I started eating solid foods

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:50.170
yeah each had a difficulty [ __ ] that

00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:53.350
made them not for me so they would

00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:55.300
squeeze hold it and their stomachs would

00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:56.560
be heard in and they'd be in a corner

00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.550
hiding on so we would have to like like

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:02.320
like lay them down on their back and

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:08.440
like like coax there are muscles right

00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:15.520
next to the butthole person they're

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:18.180
muscles that you use to squeeze in the

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:21.040
like holding the poop like you like yes

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:23.050
and we would just like just put your

00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:25.000
thumbs on them to eliminate their

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.100
ability party does right the squatty

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:28.980
potty releases the sphincter muscle but

00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:30.760
squatty potty's than I do

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.470
nothing's touching the muscles in my

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:34.450
butthole true well apparently when you

00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:36.670
put your raise your feet up it like

00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:38.980
releases a wanting one of your many

00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:41.280
singers and we wouldn't get that deep

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.600
giggles have you squat if you're sitting

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:44.410
if

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:46.240
when you like kind of squat and balance

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:47.590
yourself at your butt holes just like

00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:50.860
gaped ya know this would be like this

00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:52.030
would be like if you press the right

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:53.950
buttons this is like CPR for the

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:57.220
intestine basically I got you you push

00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:58.780
[ __ ] out of your dog so you were there

00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:00.730
yeah and you would just like see it

00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:02.470
coming at you in like 3d it's pretty

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:04.210
wild it's pretty ridiculous yeah me and

00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:05.500
my friends did a thing for a while we

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:06.820

face while they're doing it and just

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:19.360
evolve of somebody just going like total

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:23.190
POV it's like everyone stopped by guys

00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:29.230
you really haven't video yourself

00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:31.240
[ __ ] is one of the funniest things

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:32.670
you say to frenzy

00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:34.870

of standing and like hold it the whole

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.810
thing down or really just hold the balls

00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:54.010
and hold from the bottom and then just

00:51:54.010 --> 00:52:04.180
move the phone out of the way one of

00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:05.500

00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:29.050
citizens arresting a public death Gator

so I hope you can mutually combat just

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:34.930
fight a [ __ ] that's a they should do

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:36.400
they should forget about localized

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:38.110
police and let it in your area they'll

00:52:38.110 --> 00:52:39.670
pay you like 15 bucks an hour to walk

00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:41.680
around in a bee suit as a tackle dude

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:48.940
shitty you stop right there citizen do

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.790
that would that would be like well how

00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:53.140
do you think if somebody if you were

sitting outside and somebody's to tattoo

00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:56.410
do you think you'd be more ready to

00:52:56.410 --> 00:52:58.240
fight or less least vulnerable

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.790
position yes you did why dogs look you

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:02.110
in the eye if you have a dog when it's

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:04.810
[ __ ] it keeps contact with you they

00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:06.280
trust that you're like watching their

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:08.530
six yeah so if you watch the dog [ __ ] he

00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:09.640
looks you right in the eye and they're

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:12.760
like me cool yeah or like my one friends

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.560
dog it know what that's leaders it

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.030
bothered that you're watching them no

00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:17.920
they look for that eye contact you look

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:19.720
at them they're just like fully looking

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:21.369
at you like am I good that's a

00:53:21.369 --> 00:53:23.590
vulnerable spot for a dog take it don't

00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:25.619
be ready to get thrashed

00:53:25.619 --> 00:53:27.520
they don't have to wipe their ass I

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:28.840
wonder how they get away with a clean

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:30.730
break every time most times

00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:33.520
well they also clean their [ __ ] with

00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:37.980
their tongue that's true nature's bidet

00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:40.210
yeah I thought your dog's tongue I guess

00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:41.410
would your dog you think your dog will

00:53:41.410 --> 00:53:42.340
clean your [ __ ]

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:44.430
most definitely ever [ __ ] in the ocean

00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:47.380
no but I've been in a Bay where somebody

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:50.700
[ __ ] that I was talking to an attorney

00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:53.350
floating in the ocean is the most

00:53:53.350 --> 00:53:55.869
freeing experience it's guys where

00:53:55.869 --> 00:54:01.180
you're supposed to take dumps dude back

00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:03.010
in the day before there were toilets and

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:04.390
plumbing people if they lived near a

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:06.160
body of water that was like hold up I'm

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:06.910
gonna take a dump

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:08.080
there's the closest I've ever felt to

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:11.619
flying and I'm but I was I was deep

00:54:11.619 --> 00:54:13.359
enough in like murky water that I could

00:54:13.359 --> 00:54:16.510
just drop trou and fully like I was like

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:18.850
full Vitruvian Man pose no water to just

00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:21.670
like spread out and let go and it was I

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:24.820
honestly a solid turd oh my god you know

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:27.400
what it reminded me of the sensation of

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:28.720
a member and the matrix when they first

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:30.040
pulled the thing out of the back of his

00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:34.660
head like someone pulled me out of the

00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:37.480
matrix damn weird how do you swim away

00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:38.170
from the turd

00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:39.580
were you getting away from it just like

00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:41.680
a full Wildwood water I wasn't seeing

00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:44.109
true Terry get eaten immediately by a

00:54:44.109 --> 00:54:46.869
fish I used to swim around down the

00:54:46.869 --> 00:54:48.490
beach in like the murky New Jersey

00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:50.590
waters and like swim around and pinch

00:54:50.590 --> 00:54:52.240
people's ankles and swim underwater away

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.920
real far there's fun it you would have

00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.840
people watch on land or someone like

00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:57.250
why'd you beg hold on I'm gonna go do it

00:54:57.250 --> 00:54:59.290
like watch this guy and he flows it's to

00:54:59.290 --> 00:55:01.210
the water so dirty that you can float

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:02.859
and no one can see you and you just give

00:55:02.859 --> 00:55:04.510
him a hard pinch and you dude it's so

00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:07.630
funny watching people jump it scream and

00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:09.250
then you swim like 20 feet away to

00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:10.690
surface up and they never they're just

00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:11.740

00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:39.420
to you guys about interracial weddings

00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:42.730

00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:43.930

00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:45.850
yeah I'm just like why I didn't [ __ ]

00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:48.609
get married yeah thanks with life have

00:56:48.609 --> 00:56:51.490
you been to an original initial part no

00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:55.290
interracial wedding have you been to one

00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:58.930
yeah I don't I don't I don't really [ __ ]

00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:01.330
what other interracial couples that's

00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:02.530
true I don't like when I see another

00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:06.220
interracial have a wedding no but

00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:07.510
they're like interracial couples are

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:08.770
really [ __ ] annoying because they

00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:11.109
they make it they try to do this thing

00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:12.910
where they they act like them being

00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:14.710
together kind of makes them know more

00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:16.600
about each other's race somehow yeah

00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.000
it's a they make it's like them be an

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.760
interracial is like a thing yeah I feel

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.800
kind of uh whenever I hold hands with my

00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:25.240
girlfriend in public I feel like I'm

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:25.750
like

00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:28.390
teaching society a lesson you know it

00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:29.980
like I feel like I'm looking like I'm

00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:31.900
trying to teach society a lesson where

00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:33.700
I'm kind of like like we were in Alabama

00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:34.780
when you're not to lunch and like dude

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:36.940
people are not down with [ __ ] as they

00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:38.650
say on tinder of this world which I

00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:43.150
don't like that term they're not too

00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:44.650
many interracial couples out there were

00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:46.930
where somebody's more conservative

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:49.059
leaning either so I feel like a lot of

00:57:49.059 --> 00:57:51.270
interracial couples when we're together

00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:54.039
they do a whole lot of light you know

00:57:54.039 --> 00:57:57.970
what I'm saying like in there sighs yeah

00:57:57.970 --> 00:58:00.670
you know I think in their minds blown

00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:02.079
it's like put you guys are there's a

00:58:02.079 --> 00:58:03.880
dearth of good conservative interracial

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:06.640
couples you want the wedding's wedding

00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.470
in my experiences they didn't I talked

00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:09.730
about this on the last Cassatt is they

00:58:09.730 --> 00:58:13.329
devolve into dance-offs yeah everyone's

00:58:13.329 --> 00:58:16.660
I've never really family interracial

00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:17.980
weddings they devolve in a dance-off

00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:20.859
both times one was mine the end of was

00:58:20.859 --> 00:58:22.510
some like corny white guy doing like

00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:24.069
shitty moves but all the black people go

00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:26.500
off like ironically Adam well the one I

00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.710
was this one I was at it was no there

00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:32.200
wasn't a lot of support and it was it

00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:33.490
was pretty fun I want i watched

00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:36.369
literally I watched black people watch

00:58:36.369 --> 00:58:38.140
white people do the chicken dance and

00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:39.630
like people got up and left

00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:43.720
it was offensive they didn't they were

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.910
walk the black people walk to flag they

00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:47.410
were like hitting me like what is this

00:58:47.410 --> 00:58:49.029
I'm like it's chicken dance and I like

00:58:49.029 --> 00:58:51.460
same way dude I hate weddings I hate

00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:54.970
everything but black people are not

00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:56.440
allowed bad fun when you dance that's

00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:58.270
that's what's super that's what was

00:58:58.270 --> 00:58:59.650
happening well the chicken dance is just

00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:03.880
a good time it's not about a matter of

00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:06.430
chicken dance proponent yeah but I'm

00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:08.410
just saying the reason why it doesn't

00:59:08.410 --> 00:59:11.289
jive with with the black community is

00:59:11.289 --> 00:59:13.089
because it's just it's only for fun

00:59:13.089 --> 00:59:14.529
it's a coordination thing actually a

00:59:14.529 --> 00:59:16.240
chicken dance is just like that's the

00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:18.039
most coordinates ate and coordinated

00:59:18.039 --> 00:59:20.130
thing all your fat ants can do with

00:59:20.130 --> 00:59:22.270
certainly here they're like trying to go

00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:24.000
perform like they put on their war paint

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.589
it's the electric slide for white people

00:59:26.589 --> 00:59:28.510
yeah it was definitely well the cupid

00:59:28.510 --> 00:59:29.859
shuffle electric slide that's something

00:59:29.859 --> 00:59:31.779
like everybody can do the chicken dance

00:59:31.779 --> 00:59:35.020
was like unanimously like no not doing

00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:36.520
it everyone sat down but yeah it was

00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:39.029
funny watching

00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:41.510
it was funny watching white people and

00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:42.920
black people dancing and watching them

00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:44.660
react to each other and having like

00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:46.099
usually on a dance floor

00:59:46.099 --> 00:59:48.200
white people are a little bit like tight

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:50.630
and timid mm-hmm and a little like kind

00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:52.099
of like just throwing themselves around

00:59:52.099 --> 00:59:53.329
but yeah I thought it would be kind of

00:59:53.329 --> 00:59:55.670
like a you know a big old like you were

00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:56.480
like you were saying it would end up

00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.170
with people being like yeah actually

01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:05.059
that did have convinced that that didn't

01:00:05.059 --> 01:00:06.890
happen I will say I'm not gonna lie I

01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:08.420
was being goaded to dance the entire

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:10.339
time and I was just like a race against

01:00:10.339 --> 01:00:11.299
time we kept getting drunker and drunker

01:00:11.299 --> 01:00:12.829
and I kind of like doing this and then

01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:14.809
someone's ants met excuse me someone's

01:00:14.809 --> 01:00:17.299
auntie snatched me up made me go dance

01:00:17.299 --> 01:00:18.950
with her and then there was like I had a

01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:20.839
break a solo our whole table was like

01:00:20.839 --> 01:00:24.349
okay okay oh my god like refusing food

01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:26.299
in an Italian house it was dude it was

01:00:26.299 --> 01:00:27.890
like refusing it was perceived and I was

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:29.210
like I'm cool I think they don't like

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:30.500

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.089

more than that yeah well you can you can

01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:39.589
decline but if she's like even partially

01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:41.059
on the dance floor which is you know she

01:00:41.059 --> 01:00:42.589
wasn't she wasn't on the dance floor see

01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:44.059

01:00:44.059 --> 01:00:46.220
dance and I was like course I danced and

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:47.299
she was like your dance right now I was

01:00:47.299 --> 01:00:50.510
like no you can't yeah I know I [ __ ]

01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:52.490
up you broke protocol

01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:54.230

01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:56.349
whether you want to dance or not that's

01:00:56.349 --> 01:00:58.430
yeah but I was like I don't feel like it

01:00:58.430 --> 01:01:00.589
right now there was oh I should say this

01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:03.559
nobody was dancing oh yeah it's nobody

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:05.750

with you she want the Footloose with me

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:08.839
which I should have yeah I was like

01:01:08.839 --> 01:01:09.770
you're too comfortable in your

01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:11.119
relationship you should have been like I

01:01:11.119 --> 01:01:12.230
better get out there and start the bar

01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:16.579
how it was funny is I was like no no I

01:01:16.579 --> 01:01:18.530
don't want to do that right now do you

01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:25.720
typically enjoy weddings no no yeah no I

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.530
resent the fact that I have to go to

01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:29.809
them but then it's like I don't know I

01:01:29.809 --> 01:01:31.160
don't like you know I typically sneer at

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.780
everything i watch and I'm like this is

01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:34.819
dumb this was like a high Christian cult

01:01:34.819 --> 01:01:38.030
- which was like real weird but the no I

01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:40.040
typically any wedding I can get out of

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:41.720
I'm pretty happy about that yeah but

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.369

accidentally because I my sleep schedule

01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:18.829
got a little bit wonky at first you stay

01:11:18.829 --> 01:11:20.869
up later right yeah and I woke up in the

01:11:20.869 --> 01:11:22.309
middle of the night and when I fell back

01:11:22.309 --> 01:11:22.940
asleep

01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:26.030
I had a lucid dream and immediately

01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:28.249
first thing you do is I can I fly every

01:11:28.249 --> 01:11:31.400
single time for sure and then I always

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.599
mean to replace that though with like I

01:11:32.599 --> 01:11:34.400
need to come fast I gotta come see I go

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.559
funny I never get it right and I'm

01:11:36.559 --> 01:11:38.030
always like all right I can fly all

01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:41.800
right let's work on I wake up like [ __ ]

01:11:43.329 --> 01:11:44.960
careful dude you might have someone

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:48.170
following on your balls dude I'm not

01:11:48.170 --> 01:11:50.239

01:11:53.929 --> 01:11:55.789
I'm dreaming clearly I'm not in control

01:11:55.789 --> 01:11:59.030
at all I'm gonna get to the point where

01:11:59.030 --> 01:12:00.590
I can slide in the matrix for acts of

01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:03.499
all the guns I'm always trying to do I'm

01:12:03.499 --> 01:12:05.809
like I I've been losing treatment for a

01:12:05.809 --> 01:12:07.219
while I've been flying for quite some

01:12:07.219 --> 01:12:11.150
time but I think now I'm trying to like

01:12:11.150 --> 01:12:13.249
create like fight scenes and fight

01:12:13.249 --> 01:12:15.860
situations and like every [ __ ] time

01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:17.210
GG black bear

01:12:17.210 --> 01:12:21.679
nah I'm season 1 of the new season no

01:12:21.679 --> 01:12:23.570

01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:27.139

01:12:27.139 --> 01:12:29.119
your fight thing yeah it's kind of like

01:12:29.119 --> 01:12:31.489
that well it doesn't it doesn't really

01:12:31.489 --> 01:12:33.920
happen because I keep I keep creating a

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:35.659
person that scares the [ __ ] out of me

01:12:35.659 --> 01:12:37.699
like it kind of scares me out of that it

01:12:37.699 --> 01:12:39.229
must be a demon if I try to conjure up

01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:40.760
anything to lose a dream it's all demons

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:43.699
and I wake up like it could be but I say

01:12:43.699 --> 01:12:46.639
I get scared back into life regular

01:12:46.639 --> 01:12:48.110
don't we wouldn't you have slow punch

01:12:52.249 --> 01:12:52.860
kicked

01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:56.610

01:12:58.949 --> 01:13:14.330

episode but the one before that I

01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:44.760
thought a lot of the episodes were tight

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:45.900
and then it just went down like this

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.969
weird rabbit hole where I like to check

well that didn't they intensify each

01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:50.719

all like oh the reason I keep getting

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:55.730
upset when you every much is like I want

01:16:55.730 --> 01:16:57.409
to film it is because I ate a cinnamon

01:16:57.409 --> 01:16:59.750

01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:01.820
was squatting in a cave yeah the whole

01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:07.280
thing got eaten yeah the film will be so

01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:09.110
[ __ ] funny to watch people I was

01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:12.429
wearing sunglasses eating a cinnamon

01:17:12.679 --> 01:17:15.650
I mean I I just I wish I mean if people

01:17:15.650 --> 01:17:17.389
could spectate on that that would just

01:17:17.389 --> 01:17:19.729
be unfunny believe my drive home by the

01:17:19.729 --> 01:17:22.939
way it was beauty how the [ __ ] yes so I

01:17:22.939 --> 01:17:24.709
was having this weird experience where I

01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:28.159
was I felt like the car was becoming an

01:17:28.159 --> 01:17:30.619
extension of me and then like the tides

01:17:30.619 --> 01:17:33.349
right in my body parts so I could feel

01:17:33.349 --> 01:17:35.420
the texture of my body parts like on the

01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:36.889
road like I felt like I could feel me

01:17:36.889 --> 01:17:39.590
turning and stuff it was gay it was like

01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:42.619
the safest I've ever felt driving like

01:17:42.619 --> 01:17:49.239
glued to the road just like oh god be

01:17:49.239 --> 01:17:50.449

it was a mix between that and I guess

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:34.390
what they are in Pacific Rim how they

01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:36.760
did they feel the robot that they're

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.469
never caught Pacific Rim but I could I

01:19:38.469 --> 01:19:40.300
could honestly I'm hoping I've driven

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:41.530
high enough where I know what you're

01:19:41.530 --> 01:19:43.390
talking about yeah yeah yeah for sure

01:19:43.390 --> 01:19:45.550

you'll become a woman

01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:48.400
anything is sick like when you're high

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:50.170

01:19:50.170 --> 01:19:52.239
the couch I've gotta know

01:19:52.239 --> 01:19:53.800
sunken into the couch on mushrooms that

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:56.050
was not a good experience becoming one

01:19:56.050 --> 01:19:58.840
with that you have the couch or I was

01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:04.960
being sucked into the couch I love

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:06.850
sleeping like I love sleeping on a couch

01:20:06.850 --> 01:20:08.590
and just digging into the corner of it

01:20:08.590 --> 01:20:11.219
you already mean oh yeah whole body

01:20:11.219 --> 01:20:14.110

01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:39.969
wall so jealous my bed's [ __ ]

01:20:39.969 --> 01:20:40.660
freestanding

01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:45.160
but I have a sleep tent you have a big

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:46.930
blackout board so I blacked it out dude

01:20:46.930 --> 01:20:48.850

01:20:48.850 --> 01:20:50.500
to sleep outside yet did you try that

01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:52.150
again tried it was too cold at one time

01:20:52.150 --> 01:20:53.800

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:55.420
gonna hit a nice one in the fall like a

01:20:55.420 --> 01:20:57.760
September outside sleep that's pretty

01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:59.560
sick I set my sleep tent up outside with

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:01.870
an air mattress block out the light Oh

01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:04.150
that'd be nice may I have my sleep ten

01:21:04.150 --> 01:21:05.320
now where I opened it up and I have a

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.060
little fan that clips to the bed it

01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:09.730
blows right on me in my sleep tent dude

01:21:09.730 --> 01:21:11.680
it's like sleeping in pure darkness

01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:13.510
isn't by my favorite thing I don't get

01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:14.590
to do it as my girlfriend doesn't wanna

01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:16.719
sleep in the sleep time with me every

01:21:16.719 --> 01:21:23.350
night dude when I get in there my dogs

01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:24.130
know what it is

01:21:24.130 --> 01:21:25.750
they [ __ ] jump up in the bed with me

01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:27.430
we kill the lights pitch black turd and

01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:29.320
they just like we all we took like a two

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:31.060
and a half hour nap the other day it's

01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:32.050
so wonderful

01:21:32.050 --> 01:21:33.459
man that sounds incredible

01:21:33.459 --> 01:21:35.110
god is awesome like sensory-deprivation

01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:37.389
almost it's close yeah if I could

01:21:37.389 --> 01:21:39.369
somehow get a tub of water and sleep in

01:21:39.369 --> 01:21:42.610
there the awesome but it's pretty much

01:21:42.610 --> 01:21:43.900
is though because it's like in sensory

01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:45.130
deprivation you're not really falling

01:21:45.130 --> 01:21:46.479
asleep you're kind of like awake and

01:21:46.479 --> 01:21:48.610
you're like weird yeah this is just like

01:21:48.610 --> 01:21:50.619
pure blackout ambient noise from the

01:21:50.619 --> 01:21:54.340
fans going when you just go fall out

01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:55.599
you ever try to look deep into the

01:21:55.599 --> 01:22:00.670
darkness and lose your balance no I

01:22:00.670 --> 01:22:02.860
usually run through the dark hallway to

01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:06.550
the bed terrified that not even I mean

01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:08.199
when you're laying down and pitch-black

01:22:08.199 --> 01:22:11.320
darkness right and try to like focus is

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:14.650
deeply into as far as you can just focus

01:22:14.650 --> 01:22:15.789
as far as you can

01:22:15.789 --> 01:22:17.170
yeah I started like seeing things yeah

01:22:17.170 --> 01:22:18.639
so you know like you can lose your

01:22:18.639 --> 01:22:30.760
balance - yeah I do that when I in my

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:31.809
sleep 10:00 at night time especially

01:22:31.809 --> 01:22:34.269
it's pure pitch darkness - where like

01:22:34.269 --> 01:22:35.860
you do the open eye closed side to eye

01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:37.659
test and it's not like you can't tell ya

01:22:37.659 --> 01:22:39.729
which is which is when you do it like

01:22:39.729 --> 01:22:41.439
open your eyes and pitch darkness when

01:22:41.439 --> 01:22:43.479
there's no difference besides and just

01:22:43.479 --> 01:22:45.670
try to focus as deeply as am dude it my

01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:47.439
dream prophesized this moment last night

01:22:47.439 --> 01:22:48.849
I was in the laser tag arena and what I

01:22:48.849 --> 01:22:50.709
was in pure pitch darkness and I was

01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:53.229
walking into it I was like yeah good

01:22:53.229 --> 01:22:56.619
deeper gotta go into the void man I'm

01:22:56.619 --> 01:22:59.050
such a [ __ ] on the [ __ ] I [ __ ]

01:22:59.050 --> 01:23:01.289
live in the void man that's like I

01:23:01.289 --> 01:23:04.510
browses know Gerry asleep rouses oh yeah

01:23:04.510 --> 01:23:06.699
yeah when I can hear seriously press the

01:23:06.699 --> 01:23:08.409
[ __ ] wild man and I get it it's like

01:23:08.409 --> 01:23:10.989
I might try to go into it it's [ __ ]

01:23:10.989 --> 01:23:12.519
terrifying dude when I was a kid I

01:23:12.519 --> 01:23:15.039
explained it to my dad and so we have a

01:23:15.039 --> 01:23:16.749
spiral staircase in our living room and

01:23:16.749 --> 01:23:18.639
the couch typically when I was a kid

01:23:18.639 --> 01:23:22.900
height directly under it so it's

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:25.539
basically like this pretty sleep on the

01:23:25.539 --> 01:23:27.489
couch under the steps you're looking up

01:23:27.489 --> 01:23:29.679
at like an extended ceiling your enemies

01:23:29.679 --> 01:23:32.289
like this stairwell basically so one

01:23:32.289 --> 01:23:34.920
night I was sleeping on it and I woke up

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:37.539
could not move my body and looking up

01:23:37.539 --> 01:23:39.939
all I could see was like this fake

01:23:39.939 --> 01:23:41.800
shadow that I was conjuring coming down

01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:45.189
toward me and I was like firstly

01:23:45.189 --> 01:23:46.800
paralysis ever

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:50.040
it was like the 90s the most internet we

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:51.659
had was like AOL so I couldn't like

01:23:51.659 --> 01:23:53.670
easily look it up Ghostbusters I told my

01:23:53.670 --> 01:23:55.710
dad about it it turns out he experienced

01:23:55.710 --> 01:23:57.239
sleep paralysis too and didn't know what

01:23:57.239 --> 01:24:00.090
it was and he thought it was a ghost man

01:24:00.090 --> 01:24:04.050
my dad who never had time to like do

01:24:04.050 --> 01:24:05.849
anything except work and like he didn't

01:24:05.849 --> 01:24:07.980
have time for any [ __ ] ever so he

01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:09.119
was like yeah me before there was a

01:24:09.119 --> 01:24:15.840
ghost on my bed when'd you research it I

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:17.550
think I like happened upon it on the

01:24:17.550 --> 01:24:19.889
internet in like the early 2000s yeah

01:24:19.889 --> 01:24:21.119
that's what I had and I instantly

01:24:21.119 --> 01:24:22.530
started I was like this is crazy that

01:24:22.530 --> 01:24:23.849
Google everyone probably the same

01:24:23.849 --> 01:24:25.170
reaction to like when someone explained

01:24:25.170 --> 01:24:26.820
what zebra sleep paralysis is you're

01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:28.710
like no not that it was and you read it

01:24:28.710 --> 01:24:30.030
you're like oh yeah it was dead my

01:24:30.030 --> 01:24:32.040
friend called me up as like pure ghost

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:33.420
sightings that I saw a ghost and I'm

01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:34.980
like what happened he explained in my

01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:37.260
gastly browsers bro yeah I felt someone

01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:39.060
pushing me down in my bed this is what I

01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:40.770
had an apartment bunny well by the way I

01:24:40.770 --> 01:24:43.110
woke up and I saw a lady in a dress

01:24:43.110 --> 01:24:45.270
sitting on the end of my bed and she was

01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:47.429
old and he like described as scary and

01:24:47.429 --> 01:24:49.110
then at the ending is like this is 100%

01:24:49.110 --> 01:24:52.280
serious it's the best explanation I have

01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:56.190
what you saw was a ghost yeah yeah

01:24:56.190 --> 01:24:57.989
that's wild no no no one I don't think

01:24:57.989 --> 01:24:59.489
it really had it besides me maybe my

01:24:59.489 --> 01:25:01.290
brother my little brother yeah sleep

01:25:01.290 --> 01:25:03.030
paralysis is it's tight I haven't gotten

01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:04.800
it in a while I'm fine with it now it's

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.570
almost so routine that I'm slaying it I

01:25:06.570 --> 01:25:08.280
try to like breathe hard enough to

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:10.590
jostle my body now I go into it I like

01:25:10.590 --> 01:25:12.239
to fully go into it and it's you getting

01:25:12.239 --> 01:25:13.920
the vibrations and I was like yeah I

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:15.780
haven't hallucinatin anything in a long

01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:17.280
time with it though see I will what

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:19.440
happens to me when I go into it I wake

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:20.849
up and I'm in my room but I'm dreaming

01:25:20.849 --> 01:25:22.949
every single time or I start floating

01:25:22.949 --> 01:25:24.329
around or I get like in the inception

01:25:24.329 --> 01:25:26.159
cycle where I wake up go to bed wake up

01:25:26.159 --> 01:25:27.690
go to bed wake up wake up finally I go

01:25:27.690 --> 01:25:32.280
oh my god yeah no III think I when I was

01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:33.810
here when I was about the car is the kid

01:25:33.810 --> 01:25:36.840
I spent like seven months in the

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.719
hospital damn just by myself sleeping I

01:25:39.719 --> 01:25:41.219
would have roommates every now and again

01:25:41.219 --> 01:25:43.920
but they typically didn't last long so I

01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:45.719
was mostly there by myself so I would

01:25:45.719 --> 01:25:47.900
just

01:25:52.019 --> 01:25:57.239
I'm sorry my patient Rovers tied

01:25:57.239 --> 01:26:02.849
backwards and okay what yeah but no I

01:26:02.849 --> 01:26:04.110
would that's what I would do all my

01:26:04.110 --> 01:26:06.719
experimentation with like like sleeping

01:26:06.719 --> 01:26:08.639
like lucid dreaming like being deep in

01:26:08.639 --> 01:26:10.679
my mind all these [ __ ] pain medicine

01:26:10.679 --> 01:26:14.190
yeah you have nothing else to do and

01:26:14.190 --> 01:26:15.420
your little kids there's a little kid

01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:17.219
brain which is like open and doing

01:26:17.219 --> 01:26:20.460
whenever yeah it was it was nice Jedi

01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:22.409
training a whole brain it was the summer

01:26:22.409 --> 01:26:24.030
between fourth and fifth grade

01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:27.619
mm-hmm it's perfect so then I missed

01:26:27.619 --> 01:26:29.880
some between third and fourth grade in a

01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:32.849
missed fourth grade damn yeah I could

01:26:32.849 --> 01:26:36.150
have skipped fourth grade yeah first and

01:26:36.150 --> 01:26:37.679
second probably actually I was like

01:26:37.679 --> 01:26:39.989
really good at first grade do you mean

01:26:39.989 --> 01:26:41.760
by merit you could have skipped it they

01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:44.789
could have like done with math I should

01:26:44.789 --> 01:26:46.170
have stayed behind for like seven years

01:26:46.170 --> 01:26:48.300
sure they should never I don't know how

01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:50.309
I [ __ ] graduated algebra I'd never

01:26:50.309 --> 01:26:52.980
learned it I should have failed algebra

01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:56.760
every single time I had undiagnosed mono

01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:58.619
in high school one year and I like

01:26:58.619 --> 01:27:00.239
belonged a bunch of classes because I

01:27:00.239 --> 01:27:07.860
was just asleep we know a doctor is

01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:09.300
[ __ ] up I just let me fail all my

01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:10.619
classes and they're like we better do

01:27:10.619 --> 01:27:12.239
something about this none of the

01:27:12.239 --> 01:27:13.949
teachers could fix it it was crazy

01:27:13.949 --> 01:27:17.880
what'd you do how'd you get rid of mono

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:21.059
I had an infected spleen yeah I

01:27:21.059 --> 01:27:22.320
developed there's an infection in my

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:25.079
spleen and I was like a terrible fat

01:27:25.079 --> 01:27:26.909
skateboarder at the time so I was

01:27:26.909 --> 01:27:28.949
honestly just almost killing myself by

01:27:28.949 --> 01:27:32.900
falling on the ground with mono yeah

01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:38.999
man with the spleen that's ready to

01:27:38.999 --> 01:27:39.599
explode
