00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.120
of having a weed sponsorship

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.320
uh right when i realized i wouldn't

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.760
become a pro skateboarder i was like

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.199
what are my other options

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.799
i was like birdhouse doesn't seem like

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.720
they're gonna ever sponsor me due to my

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.520
like

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.840
being able to 50 50 stall on a curb dude

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.119
what if people started putting out weed

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.320
tapes like skate tapes

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.000
you gotta bring back dude smoking weed

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.840
in like a very sick way to a cool song

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.880
we gotta make that anyway you probably

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.400
could get sponsored by freeze pipe if

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.799
you started making like sick weed tapes

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.640
i forgot about skate tape we're gonna

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.240
start something yeah

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.759
the black version would be an one mix

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.920
i don't know i feel like this is just

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.680
like instagram live

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.280

weed tapes

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.959
that's such a legit idea that would be

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.040
pretty nasty actually just that'd be

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.560
pretty tough what would you do

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.920
hey what song would you pick what would

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.680
you do wow man um

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.959
you gotta go with like 311 don't stay

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.720
home this time

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.160
damn and

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.080
that's pretty nasty i don't know man

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.319
i'll go with 311 down just be footage of

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.599
me making out and smoking weed

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.000
yeah like i don't know you're doing like

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.160
a handstand and smoking you know what i

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.680
mean you're doing a handstand over a

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.280
bong on the floor and you're smoking it

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.120
and you're like

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.319
now you're setting the bar too high i

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.159
was just trying to like hang out dudes

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.280
trying to hang out like a jeep or

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.200
something well then i was thinking like

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.720
tim's thinking no

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.000
it would start out that way but it would

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.440
only be for so long until some

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.280
innovators came along and really changed

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.959
the game yeah [ __ ]

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.200
my song will be onyx slam

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.640
that would be nasty it's going to be

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.760
like you know who's going to change it

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.280
is like kind of wiggery dudes are going

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.959
to start putting a little bit of swag on

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:23.920
it and then eventually it's just going

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.000
to be outright tricks true you know be

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.480
skateboarding again

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.760
that'd be great

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.560
yeah did you guys skateboard at all oh

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.080
dude i was so bad

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.940
really i was so bad and fat

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.519
[Laughter]

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.480
damn i never i never ever ever grasped

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.799
the concept of even like a

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.640
a regular ollie

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.440
really yeah and i tried so hard for so

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.599
it's maybe my greatest failure in life

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.319
escape skateboarding yeah

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.159
what yeah did you have supported pack of

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:57.439
skater dudes that would hang out with

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:59.280
you and be like oh dude every single one

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.280
of my friends was

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.760
semi-confident at skateboarding i i felt

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.080
like such a [ __ ] loser

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.599
could you at least do like a did you do

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.280
the tail slide all the time

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.959
i mean like not even that couldn't even

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.480
do it taking not even like i don't even

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.479
think i never once successfully grinded

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.639
i mean that's so i mean this this might

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.479
be my darkest secret

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.880
adult dude this is the thing no not

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.960
ollie these are darkest secrets

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.720
i could ollie like i could inconsistent

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.560
like i get lucky and land a kickflip

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.160
once every six weeks oh that's not bad

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.840
then that's not bad no no no no no

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.000
you're talking about trying for hours

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.520
every single day

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.560
how many kickflips did you say you

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.240
landed in your lifetime my lifetime less

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.560
than 10. yeah i'm with you there i i

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.479
could not that was my

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:43.919
i mean i feel comfortable speaking about

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.080
this now that you've come out

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.600
i don't think i've ever landed a

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.680
kickflip per se i landed like one heel

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.040
flip once

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.320
and then kind of like stumbled off the

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.240
board a little bit but i counted it yeah

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.479
it's one of my darkest secrets it's like

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.560
i landed a kickflip did you really yeah

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.120
in my lifetime one kick flip never tried

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.560
probably the first time he tried never

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.720
tried for the second i mean well it

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.919
wasn't the first time i tried but as

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.440
soon as i landed it was like in your

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.080
face [ __ ] it was first damn you know

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.759
that was a big deal that set the tone

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:12.800
for your whole friend squad who was

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.000
landing the most kick flips was

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.160
definitely in charge of everything

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.759
yeah you decided where are you where you

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:18.800
went

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.240
you know dude so i was i was never

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.759
really a tricker on the skateboard like

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.600
the skateboard just like it just

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.720
consumed my neighborhood at one moment

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.520
and

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.520
everybody was doing something and i i

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.880
wasn't gonna be a tricker so i was like

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.560
i'm just gonna be a guy that goes you're

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.800
you're a flow rider what yeah right they

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.320
have they have that now there's like

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.919
tapes of people just like riding really

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.240
smooth i i think it might have failed it

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.160
tried to take off on youtube and people

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.360
were like this

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.720
might suck

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.919
people were like nah dude not

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.600
everything's about like rail slides and

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.000
[ __ ] dude yeah it's about doing 720s on

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.560
a half pipe in the air yeah i i only get

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.800
envious when i see long borders

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.639
you know like cruising around yeah i

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.240
don't i think about how they can't do

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.759
any tricks at all

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.440
so i kind of i see them i'm looking at

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.880
them as a poser to be honest i look at

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.919
them and go

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.199
all right

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:06.560
have you i mean have you ever even tried

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.120
to jump up on a curb have you ever waxed

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.000
a curb

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.240
be like

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.160
i did a million attempted ollies onto

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.080
curbs and then there were like two steps

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.440
and then i'd fix the board with my foot

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.199
and then i'd keep riding but like nailed

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:32.319
it

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:34.080

in the poconos

00:10:06.079 --> 00:10:07.519
god damn that's probably one of those

00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:08.959
did they make them do like mountain

00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:10.800
exercises and stuff

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.399
uh they from what i understand yeah they

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:14.320
did a lot of hiking like dragging like

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.240
logs up the hill and [ __ ]

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.519
that's what i would do

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:19.680
i worked them yeah yeah

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.959
yeah they should have i mean she came

00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:23.040
back dinner she came really yeah did

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.480
they do any kind of like psychological

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.800
games the whole the whole thing is like

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.000
the whole thing is trying to teach you

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.240
how to change your lifestyle so they're

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:30.959
not

00:10:30.959 --> 00:10:32.399
they're tricking you into changing your

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:34.160
lifestyle while you're there

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.760
you know it's pretty hard to like stop

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.839
eating as much as you're already eating

00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:39.440
once you get a taste for a certain level

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.600
of kcals per day anything less than that

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.200
becomes kind of like i wonder what

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.959

00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:47.360
calories i usually have

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.800

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:53.519
stuff like that camp yeah yeah they did

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:54.880

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.800
have to have you have to give them you

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.399
have to give them like one actual cam

00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:01.120
thing it can't just be all you know

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.279

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.760
came home early

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.880

harmless to everyone else and it's your

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:38.959

00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:53.040
bag of gummy sour gummy worms

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.200
at very more than a couple of times

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.740
that's true probably more than that

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.519
[Laughter]

00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:02.399
bedside candy intake is true

00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:04.959
were they ever a secret

00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:06.480
um i mean

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.399
my wife would know but i think if she

00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:10.000

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.600
yeah i laid with a woman who kept a

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.360
bedside candy stash i remember thinking

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.440
like whoa

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.560
whoa

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.399

good night it was just like dude are you

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.920
[ __ ] serious with this

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.959
just drink coke out of a twizzler and go

00:13:34.959 --> 00:13:36.560
to bed

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.480
dude drinking out of twizzlers is the

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.959
[ __ ] [ __ ] oh man i love that i would

00:13:40.959 --> 00:13:42.480

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.360
of a tesla

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.600
where that was your line that's too

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.920
decadent i think

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.360
i think if my parents caught me doing

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.199
that that was when they would be like

00:13:59.199 --> 00:14:01.120

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.199
yeah dude that's too much it might be

00:14:03.199 --> 00:14:04.240
one of the i would say the greatest

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.600
pleasures in life

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.440
biting off each end and then going yup

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.880
i'm getting liquid i think it's far too

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.800
indulgent no then the middle becomes

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.399
kind of soggy then you have to eat it

00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:14.800
and when you eat a soda filled twizzler

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.279
come home man it's delicious and then

00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:19.199
you bite off the news you're a hedonist

00:14:19.199 --> 00:14:20.959
i was i was

00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:22.639
i i partake in these pleasures just to

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:24.560
remember how little i care about them

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.920
yeah wow

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.440
naked next to me yeah he actually did

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.959
none of that stuff that's how righteous

00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:15.519
he was yeah that is i mean dude at the

00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:16.959
time though

00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:19.120
that was acceptable to be like yo

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.800
like they probably came like dude my

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.480

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.800
you're wrong buddy

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.680
i bet you i could

00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:39.199
the stakes yeah what were the stakes in

00:15:39.199 --> 00:15:41.279
the bet

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:43.360
oh man it had opened you're saying if

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.519
you ended up smashing yeah like what do

00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:46.959
you lose

00:15:46.959 --> 00:15:49.360
in that situation it's probably like

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.279
there can't be a punishment bad enough

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:53.759
no it had just been like i lost yeah

00:15:53.759 --> 00:15:54.800
there's probably nothing yeah i don't

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.519
think they wait it's probably a

00:15:55.519 --> 00:15:57.440
gentleman's bet yeah

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.120
just big nah yeah it's a tough one it's

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.040
a tough one yeah yeah or or if he did

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.560
end up having sex with his knees like if

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.519
you if you had the best say uh person a

00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:08.240
has the bet with person b person a has

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.360
denise if person a [ __ ] the knees

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.079
person b also gets the [ __ ] denise

00:16:14.079 --> 00:16:15.440
yeah that mean now we're just describing

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.270
a porno i think

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.839
[Laughter]

00:16:19.839 --> 00:16:22.639
yes for sure i uh dude that must have

00:16:22.639 --> 00:16:23.839
been crazy because there was not that

00:16:23.839 --> 00:16:26.639
long ago i would say in like the 1800s

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:27.759
like if

00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:29.600
your parents told you something it was

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.360
just the truth

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.920
oh for you just be like yeah okay

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.680
your parents like yo

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.880
i just went to church and this is what

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.160
i'm thinking about you'd just be like it

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.920
was it's it was an absolute download

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.199
you'd just be like

00:16:41.199 --> 00:16:42.320
okay

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.399
now that you had there had to be ways to

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:46.000
kind of like rebel against your parents

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.320
back then there had to be there were for

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.399
sure but i'm saying it became like

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:52.079
maybe longer ago that maybe in the 12

00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:54.480
i'm thinking maybe like 1300s okay your

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.000
parents in the 1300s like yo here's

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.160
what's up you'd just be like

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.519
yeah or you might have conflicting

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:01.600
feelings and be like burning with shame

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.959
[ __ ]

00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:04.160
thinking differently than my everyone's

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.240
like covered in mud too you know yeah

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.400
it's kind of an indignant time it wasn't

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.000
dignity as hell

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.120
that must have been tight though back if

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.160
you thought differently than your

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.919
parents just to be like what the [ __ ]

00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:15.199
wrong with me

00:17:15.199 --> 00:17:18.480
yeah i disagree with my father what the

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.039
[ __ ] going on

00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:22.880
i think that's how i think i tell my

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.520
kids for you really yeah

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.720
what do they think what do they disagree

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.839
with you on

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:29.039
i don't know

00:17:29.039 --> 00:17:31.679
they'll just anytime they anytime they

00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:33.200
think something and i like feel like i

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.400
have to like check because you want to

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.559
let them just like figure [ __ ] out

00:17:36.559 --> 00:17:38.320
but anytime i'm like they're they're

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.160
like getting kind of like off you know

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.520
what i mean they're going in a bad

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.640
direction

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.000
with a thought and you kind of want to

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.039
like get in front of it or like an

00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:46.799
opinion

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:48.960
you have to like steer them back

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.679
and

00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:52.080
i think my kids kind of like

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.840
they take the lead dude i mean they

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.360
follow the lead you're observing them

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.720
you're in the mind space that's that's

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.160
what i just got the chills thinking

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.919
about yeah the level to which you now

00:17:59.919 --> 00:18:01.280
have to like

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.080
mentally parent on like a 4d level like

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.840
i just have to prevent from like

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.600
maya from like physically harming

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.720
yourself with this there's no like

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.559
thought games really minimal yeah but

00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:11.679
having to like

00:18:11.679 --> 00:18:13.840
meta strategize like a 12 year old's

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.480
actions seem crazy yeah one really hard

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.480
thing to learn is like how to uh like

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.919
um

00:18:21.919 --> 00:18:24.160
decline something but also not make it

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.280
feel like i don't know

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.000
and

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.720
uh like a weird defensive reaction like

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.520
you don't want to cause a weird

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.440
defensive reaction when you reject like

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.360
something that they wanted you know yeah

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.720
or something that they're thinking like

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.280
you reject one of their ideas

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.640
that's painful really yeah dude [ __ ] it

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.559
has to suck or maybe other people just

00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:45.919
know how to do that but i had to like

00:18:45.919 --> 00:18:47.200
learn

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.200
well it's also the ultimate slam too

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.799
because like you know kids typically

00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:52.080
like their dads

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.000
and parents you could just be like that

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.160
sucks and they're just like yeah like

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.080
you can you can be

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.440
you can be like a 12 year old in their

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.280
life that like is correcting something

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.480
in them and that's

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.919
crazy yeah yeah

00:19:03.919 --> 00:19:05.360
i mean i'm being vague but it's only

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.600
because i'm extremely stoned

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.440
describe the emotional side

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.520
yeah i like having my son talking

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.960
yeah and i talk out with him all the

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.679
logical steps and i kind of like to show

00:19:15.679 --> 00:19:16.720
him

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.160
more

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:18.960
then

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.160
rather than

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.520
it's not as like you said it's not easy

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.960
to keep telling your kid they're wrong

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.160
all the time yeah because they're

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.080
[ __ ] idiots yeah the way they're

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.000
forming their opinions about the world

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.799
is based off of cartoons and [ __ ] really

00:19:30.799 --> 00:19:32.400
i mean it's what they say is like they

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.559
see cartoons mimicking life to a point

00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:36.960
yeah and then they you know transfer

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.559
that on to how they're dealing with

00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:40.000
their lives i think that's healthy

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.760
though i did that yeah yeah i mean we

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.360
all we all did that we all we need a

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.280
frame of reference true right and

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.640
cartoons kind of give you that so it's

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.480
like based off of like the way

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.880
relationship dynamics in cartoons and

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.480
then that's why i'm so mad that when

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.120
they brought animaniacs back it was gay

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.799
really yeah i was just looking forward

00:19:56.799 --> 00:19:58.559
to my kids i was like dude i was a big

00:19:58.559 --> 00:20:00.640
animated i was

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.720
animaniacs created a generation of

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.720
spazzes and i was an animation expats

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.840
for sure yeah so i was just so happy i

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.200
was like check this [ __ ] out and it's

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.600
just the lamest ah it sucks yeah there

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.600
was like 90 characters on animaniacs it

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.360
was that show was overwhelming

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.799
it was overwhelming in the brain were my

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:18.080
favorite it was overwhelming there were

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.360
so many characters i would be like i

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.360
can't handle animaniacs right now yeah

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.360
it was pro it was probably for dorks

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.440
only yeah i don't think so i think it

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.960
was i don't know

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.720
it was too much it was it was like oh i

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.240
saw all the characters come on like that

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.880
it's like this is anime yeah like it's

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.000
too many people all the cultural

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.440
references i was like

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.440
i felt like i was watching late night

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.600
television really all the references i

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.360
was like yeah i basically

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.039
got my finger on the pulse of pop

00:20:43.039 --> 00:20:44.480
culture what were they referencing in

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.919

true but you know

00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:38.159

have you know she wouldn't be so

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.360
rambunctious treats are tough we

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.200
recently got our treats because she had

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.640
to go to the hospital and i ended up

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.720
treating myself a little too hard

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.720

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.880
cracking me up because

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.279
you guys had parents that were like like

00:27:47.279 --> 00:27:49.520
gave a [ __ ] in the right way

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.679
to make to adjust the way that you guys

00:27:51.679 --> 00:27:53.520
perceive these things like eating for

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.279
pleasure is like a guilty thing like i

00:27:55.279 --> 00:27:56.880
was raised by my parents said parents

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.039
gave that to me okay but like but still

00:27:59.039 --> 00:28:01.039
being raised by a single mother who is

00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:02.960
basically living life

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.880
completely as if she was like a teenager

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.159
that got the house to herself for the

00:28:06.159 --> 00:28:08.240
weekend yeah there's a lot of fun eating

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.320

eat for pleasure

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.399
yeah that's also i think a woman thing

00:28:16.399 --> 00:28:18.080
yeah for the most part for the most part

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.760
maybe that's why i don't like it why

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.520
it's a womanly behavior eating for

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.000
pleasure very womanly yeah

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.159
it is very womanly that's why i despise

00:28:26.159 --> 00:28:28.559
myself when i do it yeah i take myself

00:28:28.559 --> 00:28:29.679
in the corner like man what are you

homophobes feel like you know

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.320

it's not even that like that is a

00:29:30.159 --> 00:29:32.080
long-held comedic tradition in the black

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.240
community that is not the vehicle that

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.679
they're using i'm saying that you view

00:29:35.679 --> 00:29:37.760
that i'm reading over and over again oh

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.600
yeah that's that's that's being put out

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.279
by the government to be like see this is

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:43.360
what they want this is what they think

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.120
you know what i mean it's uh it's a

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.480
smoke screen that's a [ __ ] smoke

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.480
screen what's the real

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.320
okay [ __ ] boots on the ground what do

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.559
they really do to you guys

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:53.840
it's just the way that they're make

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.240
they're like teaching homosexuality

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.000
through wokeness but it's going through

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.480
the black community oh wow

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.840
yeah you don't want them to teach

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.440
critical gay theory that's what they're

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.720
doing too

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.480
i hate cgt

you guys are the conduit for it it is

00:30:13.039 --> 00:30:15.279
because like if they can make gay cool

00:30:15.279 --> 00:30:16.960
in the black community

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.320
then the black community can make it

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.000
cool throughout black dudes are fighting

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.440
black dudes are being very respectful

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.279
right now but they're fighting hard like

00:30:23.279 --> 00:30:24.640
they're they're just like a very

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.720
genuinely pause be like

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.159
pause on that falls in that thing yeah i

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:29.679
can't wait till they get enough that

00:30:29.679 --> 00:30:34.440
like wiggers also start being gay

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:40.690
[Laughter]

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.720

i think the power 99 morning show the

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.080
other day and i was like

following that dynamic like i was

00:30:54.399 --> 00:30:55.760
listening them talk about something

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:56.960
where they're like

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.320
yeah you know you wouldn't think a gay

00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.679
guy would do something you think like

00:30:59.679 --> 00:31:01.760
the guy was basically like

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.360
some some rapper and they're like yeah

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.720

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.000
guy and they're like yeah i know that'd

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.919
be crazy he's not really with that stuff

00:31:07.919 --> 00:31:09.039
they can just go

00:31:09.039 --> 00:31:10.240
out of respect i'm respectful about

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.120

this guy is winning me over every day

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.799
winning me over every day it's like okay

00:31:38.799 --> 00:31:40.559
dude i pretty much wrote you off as a

00:31:40.559 --> 00:31:41.840
nuisance

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.120
it's a public nuisance and now you're

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.590
hitting the public with i'm gay tupac

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:47.660
[Laughter]

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.840
yeah i mean i think we're you know

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.080
we're quickly learning how the battle

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.880
has to be fought right because

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.320
as a black man

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.159
i still do have the right i'm like the

00:31:58.159 --> 00:32:01.039
only person left in society that can

00:32:01.039 --> 00:32:02.880
respectfully decline on gayness you

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.880
can't yeah nobody else you're the last

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.159
house

00:32:06.159 --> 00:32:08.159
so so you got to hold on to that you

00:32:08.159 --> 00:32:09.919
don't want to you don't want that to be

00:32:09.919 --> 00:32:11.200
because you can't get it back once it's

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.039
gone exactly yeah yeah

00:32:13.039 --> 00:32:14.880
they're never coming back right

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.039
yeah well

00:32:17.039 --> 00:32:18.240
you

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.840
you know i guess all that's left though

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:20.880
is saying you're not you're the only one

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.120
to say like yo i'm not down with that

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.120
yeah you can say you can say like like

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.440
you know i get in all due respect like

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.919
paul's i'm not down with it

00:32:29.919 --> 00:32:32.000
that's like the last thing you can do

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.600
that's the last way you can be like yeah

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.880
i get it and all that i feel like when

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.480
gay dudes hear that they do kind of like

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.480
knowingly nod you know

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.600
i would say

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.720
that was they said on the radio they're

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.640
like gay tupac

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.000
those two things don't go together and

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.200
everyone's like yeah exactly well

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.000
definitely not yeah oil with water

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.120
we're getting that buzz we're getting

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.220
that buzz

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:54.640

podcasting i was just having a good time

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.000
it'd be great yeah

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
that's so difficult

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.440
we should just take like a 20-minute

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.880
tune break

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.900
we might need a tune

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.519
[Laughter]

00:33:15.519 --> 00:33:18.000
yeah yeah i mean i don't know that was

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.240
sorry

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.760
i know i know you're not trying to get

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.399
my culture

00:33:24.399 --> 00:33:26.159
oh my god that's starting to dissipate a

00:33:26.159 --> 00:33:27.919
little bit yeah it is that would be fun

00:33:27.919 --> 00:33:28.799
though i'm just thinking about imagine

00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:30.159
if there is a guy out there trying to

00:33:30.159 --> 00:33:32.159
make all black dudes gay and be like

00:33:32.159 --> 00:33:34.640
it's working sick

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.640
this my plan has come to fruition the

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.039
little los nozzex was huge for that guy

00:33:39.039 --> 00:33:40.720
yeah that's a big one that guy sent

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.640
little nas x out there and was like got

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.760
him

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.840
true that that took down like i would

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.600
say like three percent it was like it

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.440
was very tricky right because when

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.440
little well little knot x popped when

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.600
was the last time we had a gay bad boy

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.799
you know

00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:56.720
george michael george mike it's been

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.480
that long damn dude that might be like a

00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.679
50-year cycle

00:33:59.679 --> 00:34:01.360
he's an archetype yeah

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.480
he might just be an archetypal figure

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.600
yellow so aloha nazex with old town road

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.919
he tricked you into making like making

00:34:09.919 --> 00:34:11.520
you believe that he was bringing

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.240
black and white culture together

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.800

selling your soul it's like dude

terrible with skateboarding

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.920
if you're a dude your only other option

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.760
is to do nothing like there's no middle

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.720
ground

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.119
you can't be like i kind of cleaned up a

00:40:23.119 --> 00:40:24.960
little bit you know you're either

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:28.319
gelling your hair or you're like

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.680
doing it yeah

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.680

00:40:33.839 --> 00:40:36.079
that gets [ __ ] yeah yeah man a lot of

00:40:36.079 --> 00:40:38.319
these theories are counter applicable

00:40:38.319 --> 00:40:40.079
for the black community yeah i know it's

00:40:40.079 --> 00:40:41.680
wrong yeah it's true

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.319
could you imagine like being a dude that

00:40:44.319 --> 00:40:45.839
wasn't trying to get [ __ ] in the black

00:40:45.839 --> 00:40:47.440
community

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.800
no i'm saying you're trying to get [ __ ]

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.240
but as a white dude you either had to be

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.319
like as grungy as you could get and act

00:40:52.319 --> 00:40:54.240
like you were bad or you had to get

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.480
super cleaned up yeah but super cleaned

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.079
up was kind of the only way in the black

00:40:58.079 --> 00:40:59.440
oh yeah yeah yeah

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.920
yeah yeah if you're not fresh you're not

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.839
trying to get [ __ ] true you're yeah

00:41:03.839 --> 00:41:04.720
it's like the

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.960
chow

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.480
i got too much in my mind right now i'm

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.839
going to abstain from being fresh for

00:41:09.839 --> 00:41:11.359
like three months

00:41:11.359 --> 00:41:12.720
abstaining from being fresh would be

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.560
sick yeah i did i did that you have

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.079
staying from being fresh abstained

00:41:16.079 --> 00:41:17.520
really yeah it was i was more of a

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.079
conscientious projector but yeah yeah i

00:41:20.079 --> 00:41:22.000
did this freshness in general yeah it

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
was too much work it's so much good yeah

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.920
but if you're like dudes if black goes

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.520
black dudes go to the other extreme they

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.280
get twice as much [ __ ]

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:32.000
when they go grungy when they go like

to just generate ideas

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:35.119
how do i generate and speak an idea

00:43:35.119 --> 00:43:36.319
is it legal

00:43:36.319 --> 00:43:39.119
yes as per the farm bill of 2018 hemp

00:43:39.119 --> 00:43:41.520
products are now legal in all 50 states

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:44.079
what exactly does compliant delta 9 mean

00:43:44.079 --> 00:43:45.599
there are small amounts of delta 9 in

00:43:45.599 --> 00:43:46.960
legally grown hemp

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.400
through the process of distillation we

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:49.599
are able to isolate this precious

00:43:49.599 --> 00:43:51.440
cannabinoid then infuse it into our

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.400
products

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.079
as per the farm bill we must keep the

00:43:54.079 --> 00:43:56.319
dry weight of delta 900.3 on a dry

00:43:56.319 --> 00:43:57.440
weight basis

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.040
is it psychoactive

00:43:59.040 --> 00:43:59.839
yes

00:43:59.839 --> 00:44:01.920
it is are you honorable and legit or is

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.440
this some kind of scam

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.680
we are as legit as it gets we are honest

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.599
hemp farmers and cannabinoid alchemists

00:44:07.599 --> 00:44:09.760
there's illegal weeds fully there you go

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.440
but they're usually low dose you know i

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.720
mean you can't hit someone with like a

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.720
50 milligram lollipop yeah you'd have to

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.160
gobble but you could just eat a bunch

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.079
right you could eat a lot of candy you

00:44:18.079 --> 00:44:18.880
could

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.800
yeah but dude i like low-dose

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.200
candy yeah well imagine he's eating like

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.079
a big nice nice big bag of sour candy i

00:44:26.079 --> 00:44:27.440
would love that and it gets you like 10

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.079
milligrams yeah yeah that sounds awesome

00:44:30.079 --> 00:44:31.680
because then you could keep eating them

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.680
i'm a low dose weed yeah i like i like

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.599
10 milligrams and when i get like 50 i

00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:38.079
see these lollipops are 200 milligrams

00:44:38.079 --> 00:44:39.839
i believe you ate an entire one oh no i

00:44:39.839 --> 00:44:41.760
forgot about that yeah i did not like

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:42.960
those because that was like there was

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.880
200 milligrams in it so i would i

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.880
misunderstood your instructions and ate

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.440
probably 150 milligrams yeah and we and

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.760
that was when we went to fogo yeah dude

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:52.880
i i would

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.560
pause i'd pop that in my mouth i would

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:57.040
pop that in my mouth for like

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:59.359
a couple minutes and then pop it out i'd

00:44:59.359 --> 00:45:00.400
always be like hopefully that's not a

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.280
lot

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.440

you told me to suck on it for 30 seconds

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.440
and

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:24.720

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:06.400
of feeling guilty about having a nice

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.960

they don't have the release valve like i

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.920
can get as high as i want and worst case

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.359
scenario i just pull out the fap card

00:49:21.359 --> 00:49:24.000

00:49:40.319 --> 00:49:42.720
antidote then you just [ __ ] you're done

yeah they're saying why are the kids

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.640
sleeping on the couch oh they were

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:51.720
camping

00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:55.480
[Laughter]

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.839
they definitely didn't know there's no

00:52:57.839 --> 00:52:58.960
way they thought that's what was

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:01.839
happening

00:53:01.839 --> 00:53:03.200
like that thought just never crossed

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.119
their mind but they had they had the vcr

00:53:05.119 --> 00:53:06.160
that was the more that was the most

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:08.000
sinister aspect i shouldn't even say

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.640
that but yeah so i was desecrated i was

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:14.280
not in my room

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.200
if i came home my kid was jerking off my

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:20.960
bedroom i'd kill him dude we had it

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:22.480
that lazy boy had he had to feel the

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:23.920
heat on that lazy boy every now and

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.070
again just be like yo

00:53:25.070 --> 00:53:27.440
[Laughter]

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:30.160
we had a vhs camcorder

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:31.760
and that like you could connect it to a

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:34.079
tv to play back your tapes so that was

00:53:34.079 --> 00:53:35.599
like that was always ending up in a

00:53:35.599 --> 00:53:38.640
different room in the house

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.720
who got their [ __ ] grubby mitts on so

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:42.800
you're gonna oh you guys are watching tv

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:44.400
down here i'm gonna i'm gonna go watch

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.400
ladybugs upstairs where did you have to

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:47.680
watch it through the hole or could you

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.160
no play on the tv

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.640
oh you could run it like a vco yeah yeah

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.160
but then like i guess everybody would

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:55.760
get kind of suspicious because it re

00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.680
rewinding and fast forwarding on it it

00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:58.880
sounded like

00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:00.880
i i don't know it sounded like a

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.880
transformer screaming

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.800
[Laughter]

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.559
it was like it would it'd be engaging

00:54:06.559 --> 00:54:08.240
like motors and [ __ ] like any vcr was

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:10.960
out but this camcorder

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:17.119
yeah so if as like as you develop more

00:54:17.119 --> 00:54:19.440
and more specific

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:21.280
yeah replay requests you know what i

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:22.400
mean yeah

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:25.280
it got harder and harder to find

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:27.119
waiting for a tape to rewind and like

00:54:27.119 --> 00:54:29.200
pausing your masturbation

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:33.920
[Laughter]

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.440

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:37.680

for a certain amount of time maybe maybe

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.520

her that this was actually happening she

00:56:45.839 --> 00:56:47.839

00:56:47.839 --> 00:56:50.319
ploy for just more sex yeah you know but

00:56:50.319 --> 00:56:52.640

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:04.720

[ __ ] [ __ ] bratting doesn't work i've

00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:17.359

when he had to transition away from like

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.480
the boys into that yeah if you if you

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.240

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.920
oh yeah that's why bachelor parties are

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.520

01:05:07.039 --> 01:05:08.480

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:21.839
it's just like a bunch of dudes in a

01:05:21.839 --> 01:05:22.960
mountain house but you guys want to know

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.480

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.480
fun time we had to go on yeah

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.400
that's a pretty sick thing then again i

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.839
take everything i just said back

01:05:29.839 --> 01:05:31.599
bachelor parties always start awkward

01:05:31.599 --> 01:05:33.280
and then they're [ __ ] ripping by like

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:34.720
oh yeah i didn't say they're bad i said

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.160
they're becoming womanly and then they

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:37.839
go so hard once all they do to get

01:05:37.839 --> 01:05:39.599
together it falls apart

01:05:39.599 --> 01:05:40.559
you remember how hard it was to go

01:05:40.559 --> 01:05:42.960
paintballing at yours it was like yo

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.799
hard to get everyone to go well that's

01:05:44.799 --> 01:05:46.720
because like planning like fun

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.480
activities like that like the planning

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:50.160
part is a very womanly activity yeah

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:51.520
yeah there should be women that are

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.440
appointed to figure out bachelors like

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.839
bachelor party planners yeah

01:05:55.839 --> 01:05:56.960
yeah oh that's an entrepreneur like you

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.720
should have to madam though yeah you get

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.079
a stripper though and just be like you

01:06:00.079 --> 01:06:02.240
gotta chaperone us all weekend no you

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.319
need a map yeah but then you'd have to

01:06:04.319 --> 01:06:06.480
be like almost like a travel agent you

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:08.319
didn't have to pay them yeah you could

01:06:08.319 --> 01:06:09.119
probably

01:06:09.119 --> 01:06:10.640
take money that's vertical integration

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:12.799
right if you called like a business plan

01:06:12.799 --> 01:06:14.079
if you called delilah's they probably

01:06:14.079 --> 01:06:15.520
have these people

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:19.480
like partner chicks

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.240
if you're like flying into philadelphia

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.760
or whatever like like a strip club

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.680
concierge yeah where they're like okay

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:31.200
during the day you know the girls are

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.640
going to come home and [ __ ] beat the

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.079
shuttle bus here yeah your shuttle bus

01:06:34.079 --> 01:06:36.160
will take you to golf come on back

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:37.680
you're paying cash when you get there

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.520
there's no [ __ ] like what's your is

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.280
this you is this your venmo you know

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.640
that kind of [ __ ] that's a good idea i

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:46.160
think we're describing epstein's island

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.079
maybe the ultimate version of it

01:06:48.079 --> 01:06:50.160
but we need the realistic version

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.359
the whole thing might have just started

01:06:51.359 --> 01:06:53.119
from like travel planning yeah this is

01:06:53.119 --> 01:06:55.440
annoying is it going in island can we

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.280
can we drop the number on these girls i

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.559
feel like there has to be a way that you

01:06:58.559 --> 01:07:01.920
can like create an app you know and then

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:03.839
the one fours kind of like franchise

01:07:03.839 --> 01:07:05.680
that out to strip clubs to let them do

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.599
that oh yeah almost like the cash

01:07:07.599 --> 01:07:09.599
register software yeah dude yeah yeah

01:07:09.599 --> 01:07:10.880

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.039
chick

01:07:17.039 --> 01:07:18.640
you should start getting airbnb's and

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:20.559
hiring like

01:07:20.559 --> 01:07:22.079

property yeah and start putting airbnbs

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.520

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:29.000

[Laughter]

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:40.880

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:29.359
you're talking about sexy realtors i'm

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:30.799
talking about an immersive experience

01:08:30.799 --> 01:08:31.920
this is the process this lady's a

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:34.719
prostitute she'll like she'll do that

01:08:34.719 --> 01:08:35.920
for you you're

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.920
organizing a viewing of the apartment

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:39.520
yeah you're setting up the housing's at

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.120
a premium when people catch on but

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.480
there's ladies that are there and

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:44.239
they'll negotiate for you gotcha and

01:08:44.239 --> 01:08:45.279
then it would be like you know you get

01:08:45.279 --> 01:08:46.640
down you wouldn't really know but you'd

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:48.719
be like then they'd be like look bro

01:08:48.719 --> 01:08:52.920
they'd be like oh it's like a happy meal

01:08:53.679 --> 01:08:55.199
i'm talking like a westworld scenario

01:08:55.199 --> 01:08:56.960
though where you buy like a gated

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.719
community and you put like a soccer mom

01:08:58.719 --> 01:09:00.000
up the street who's like watering her

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.920
lawn

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:04.319
you can go

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:07.319
yeah

01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:12.960
[Laughter]

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:16.799
but i'm saying like it'd be like what

01:09:16.799 --> 01:09:18.400
are they like licensed families like the

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:20.319
bundys

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:22.319
it would be immersive so like they would

01:09:22.319 --> 01:09:24.239
be on the clock and like their husband

01:09:24.239 --> 01:09:25.759
would come out and talk to you

01:09:25.759 --> 01:09:27.759
like a lady in like a marge simpson like

01:09:27.759 --> 01:09:29.120
mascara costume you're talking about

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.640
setting up a fake suburb where you can't

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:35.159
have sex with any of the wife's houses

01:09:40.319 --> 01:09:42.080
it's all actors that way hookers could

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:43.520
have the the dream they could have like

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:44.880
a quote-unquote normal life you know

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:48.920
west road you can't kill anybody

01:09:53.710 --> 01:09:58.100
[Laughter]

01:09:58.719 --> 01:10:00.000
yeah

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.840
so like the entire neighborhood is
