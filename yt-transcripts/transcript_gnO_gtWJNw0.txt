00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:49.039
always sort of juggling um

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:50.960
a bunch of projects at once and it's not

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.360
any different right now i got uh

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.880
just a whole [ __ ] load of different

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.720
video things i'm trying to keep up with

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.160

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.639
i told my fans that i'd be doing a

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:01.360
monthly

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.479
two videos a month which at my level of

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:06.080
like perfectionism and

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.080
like [ __ ] around with stupid uh

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.000
details that nobody notices that's uh

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.520
that's a difficult

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.639
difficult thing to accomplish um in fact

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:16.240
today today's the deadline i'm probably

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.560

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.919
gonna miss the uh the upload but um

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:21.520
just keeping keeping the momentum

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.800
keeping momentum going trying to get

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.000
these uh these [ __ ]

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.240

00:09:19.839 --> 00:09:20.480
a normal

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.920
dude at age 35 or whatever so i just

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.399
i got into it to punish this guy my

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.279
girlfriend was not

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:29.120
happy with me because i i took a little

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.560
detour to

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.320
follow this guy and circle back a few

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.240
times and yell out

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.040

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:37.360

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.200
you gotta punish census workers and

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.640
voter registration people when you see

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.839
them in public you gotta just

00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:43.680
let them have it yeah it's a real bummer

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.519
for that census worker that he ran into

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:45.839
the

00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:48.080
the buzz saw dude just some [ __ ]

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.360
maniac in a truck

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.600
driving around well think about it maybe

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.360
now he'll he'll get his life together i

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.160
mean

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.680
yeah he probably did him a favor i agree

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.519
i hope so i hope so well does he think

00:09:57.519 --> 00:09:58.959
that's like an important task to go

00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:00.480
around and counting people i don't

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.560
why is that like a does he think that's

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.480
like a civic virtue kind of thing

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.000
i think he was just doing it because his

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.440
life was so [ __ ] up that's the only

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.160
thing he could get to

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.120
get to do true

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.440
it's it's inexcusable going around

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.120
taking the census i can't

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.040
i hate uh i hate government stuff

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.800
that's why you're playing on the attack

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.480
that's why we're me and shane

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.279
uh are playing this racist attack no no

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:26.560

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.320
it's madden dude shane designed this

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.360
really cool bomb

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.279

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.959
shane you have the best ideas for bombs

00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:41.040
in public places i think that's so cool

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.800
would you go digital bomb or just like

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.399
fertilizer like just

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:46.480
analog well shane was saying that a nail

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.560
bomb in a synagogue would be the best

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.399
result and i said i don't i'm not like

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:51.839
that like i can't do

00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:53.360
i'm not gonna target someone because of

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.360
their religion like that type of hatred

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.200
but shane was like he was beating his

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.800
chest and like

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.040

one

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.519
one dollar yeah one dollar a month gives

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:16.720
you access to this

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.519
joyful occasion you get blueprints to

00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:21.200
the white house if you give five dollars

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.480
a month

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.959
you get shane's bomb plan for thirty

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.720
i dollars you could download the

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.279
blueprints to the white house

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:32.640
that's a good question do you think

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.079
they'd flag it if you started like no i

00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:35.040
just want to know the prince i want to

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:35.839
know who these knocks are

00:11:35.839 --> 00:11:38.000
i'm for sure yeah i just want to know

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.399
where the ducks are

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:42.480
i'm like a duck guy like historical

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.920
buildings like i want to know how the

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.920
hvac systems work in these historical

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.200
buildings

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.920
and the telecom system where's the

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.120
router

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.240
i was wondering if you can actually

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.560
crawl through the ducts like that

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.079
probably i've seen people i've seen

00:11:56.079 --> 00:11:57.360
movies where they do it so it's got to

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:57.839
be real

00:11:57.839 --> 00:12:00.160
that's true because someone tried that

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.200
in real life and there's just like

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.800
gigantic fans in there that just chop

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.680
you to bits

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.560
mm-hmm yeah you can't go into a duck

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.320
you'll be a lot of dead guys and ducks

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.680
who tried to crawl and didn't make

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.720
guys who saw die hard

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.480
skeletons and ducks yeah man i like

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.480
bombing would be tight i watched i just

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.240
watched richard jewel

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.120
do you guys see that what's that it's a

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.720
fat guy that was working security at the

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.800
atlanta did you watch the clint eastwood

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.519
movie yeah is that out yeah yeah yeah it

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:32.480
was like

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.839
what's funny about it yeah it was all

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:35.440
right it was but they they took some

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.959
liberties to make like

00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:38.800
the female reporter that broke it a

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.720
[ __ ]

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.560
they just totally made that up like they

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.000
made up like a bunch of [ __ ] where she

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.880
was like

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.920
[ __ ] fbi agents to get the story

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.680
she was probably a horror though anyway

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.920
it just added that no it's very funny

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.240
you

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.639
probably did it obsessed with their tits

00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:55.920
the whole time and it was just some fat

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.839
guy that loved

00:12:57.839 --> 00:13:00.880
they were like pinning this bombing on

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.560
well how did how did they find out it is

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.079
funny how did they find out this lady

00:13:04.079 --> 00:13:05.200
wasn't a [ __ ] did they ask her and

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.560
she's like no i didn't do that

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.800
uh well first off i think also i think

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.720
the fbi agent might be dead

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.440
i think they could be dead they just

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.880
trash these people's names

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.800
in a movie that was like about defending

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.160
a guy's name

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.800

what he had to say

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.560
if that's the version of history that he

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.680
wants to paint then that's what i'm

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.399
going with

00:13:34.399 --> 00:13:35.680

whole thing

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.560
yeah eastwood takes liberties i like

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.959
that chris kyle was the [ __ ] man he

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:48.000
left out some wild

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.160
[ __ ] what did you get chris oh i just

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.000
body

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.560
oh what oh yeah he went through like a

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.399
chris kyle had like a real dark ending

00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:32.399

that

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.959
by a marine that could have been chris

00:14:38.959 --> 00:14:40.240
kyle dude

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.839

00:14:52.079 --> 00:14:54.160
seals that died deserve it

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.920

say something like that

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.560

00:15:57.199 --> 00:16:00.240
all his tactical awareness what and he

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:00.720
wasn't

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.040
attacked all his [ __ ] tactical

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.399
training just failed him in the end

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:04.880
there

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.800
what happened his tactical awareness was

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.040
handing a guy with severe ptsd a rifle

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:09.680
yeah yeah

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.880
yeah is that what they teach you in spec

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.759
ops training is handing retards guns

00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:18.160
and then turning your back to him like

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.839
like this i hope he doesn't

00:16:19.839 --> 00:16:22.720
shoot me what the [ __ ] was he doing he

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.079
was just chilling with his boy

00:16:24.079 --> 00:16:26.720
there was a dude that had uh ptsd that

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.360
was like a

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.000
um chris kyle's or the dude's mother

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.639
this this [ __ ] crazy schizo guy

00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:35.680
asked ask chris kyle to uh take take my

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.199
son out to the range and help him

00:16:37.199 --> 00:16:38.320
relieve some stress

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.199
oh and so chris kyle as a favor him and

00:16:41.199 --> 00:16:43.040
his buddy take this guy

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.519
um who had a name he had a murderous

00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:46.720
name like richard p

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.160
roush or something like a name that you

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.519
hear it and you're like oh this guy's a

00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:50.160
murderer

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.360
let me let me look it up hold on a

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.079
second damn

00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:56.240
it's actually really go ahead yeah go

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.440
ahead no matt

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.199
well if you think about it he came at

00:16:59.199 --> 00:17:00.959
jesse the body who was a professional

00:17:00.959 --> 00:17:02.880
wrestler correct

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.880
who has access to more [ __ ] hitmen

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.720
than a professional wrestler

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.160
i think jb got reached out to someone he

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.000
signed a poster for and was like i got a

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.760
job for you

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.600
i think that's a fair theory dude the

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.120
guys the guy's name is eddie ray ruth

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.880
that's the name of the killer and that's

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.720
like obviously this guy's gonna torture

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.400
someone with pliers or kill like

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.760
he's pulling apart animals or something

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.160
eddie ray ruth eddie ray roof sounds

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:28.400
like

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.520
yeah that sounds like he definitely

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.880
killed a civil rights leader

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.480
he shot someone and called him the

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.160
n-word that's his that's

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.720
that's what that name implies to me did

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.200
they

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.799
yeah this guy definitely uh said the

00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:42.640
n-word while killing a civil rights

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.600
leader did he get killed eddie ray ruth

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.480
the american hero

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.000
oh yeah did he get shot in the gun range

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.360
after assassinating

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.840
chris kyle the recently no no he's uh

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.919
he's got life in prison

00:17:57.919 --> 00:17:59.679
oh damn none of the patriots of the

00:17:59.679 --> 00:18:01.600
range turned on him and opened fire

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.520
correct none of the patriots had any

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.679
tactical awareness either

00:18:05.679 --> 00:18:07.360
what you're [ __ ] they all ran dude

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.280
they all ran immediately

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.440
that would be instant reservoir dogs in

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.039
like a gun range like that everyone

00:18:13.039 --> 00:18:14.400
would shoot each other i can't believe

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.039
they didn't turn

00:18:15.039 --> 00:18:18.640
open fire i know that's crazy

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.919
yeah they also might not have heard it

00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:22.480
with their headphones

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.080
true they actually probably kept it

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.320
moving yeah you just hear gunshots

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.799
you're shooting yeah nice trigger

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:30.640
control

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.200
keep it up

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.440
didn't know chris kyle went out i know

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.120
he got selena advice well no i think he

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.840
started i think he started

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.520
a program he was doing that like he was

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.200
taking dudes out to the range that were

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.240
soldiers

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.160
that got hurt like it was like a nice

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.520
yeah it was like a really nice thing i

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.799
don't want a bad mouth chris

00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:52.960
if chris kyle was not a [ __ ] murderer

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.400
of women and chill i haven't read

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.520
anything about him i just know that

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.360
clint eastwood uh

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.120
clint east would co-sign them so i can't

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.880
really i don't want to talk too much

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.000
[ __ ] about a dead

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.039
dead troop let's salute him instead god

00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:06.160
definitely rules

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.080
but uh yeah you gotta if you're if

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.200
you're gonna be tactical if you're going

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.080
to jocko willing

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.160
uh your whole life like that you got to

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.440
you know you got to have the awareness

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.880
not to hand uh

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.559
loaded weapons to guys that are on the

00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:17.919
brink of uh

00:19:17.919 --> 00:19:19.679
[ __ ] losing it sure he probably just

00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:21.360
got up that was his problem he probably

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.039
didn't get up at 4 30 that morning

00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:24.799
yeah that's right well and the thing is

00:19:24.799 --> 00:19:26.559
in the in the wikipedia article it says

00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:27.120
that um

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.760
as they were driving to the range chris

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.240
kyle

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.200
texted his buddy that was i guess

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.640
sitting next to him

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.160
so imagine that first of all you're

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.679
texting somebody that's sitting next to

00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:38.960
you in the truck to avoid

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.520
having the person sitting behind you see

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.080
it

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.000
and he said something like this guy's

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.360
this guy's on the edge or something like

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:45.760
that

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.440
this dude is straight up nuts kyle

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.799

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.280
he said on the way to the range

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.039
did the guy get littlefield too or did

i was afraid you were talking about the

00:21:58.799 --> 00:22:00.080
video game that you

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.840

under wraps or anything that's

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.080
indeed what it is nice sick is making a

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.840
video game about freeing palestine i

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.799
think you said

00:22:10.799 --> 00:22:13.120

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.799
with uh

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:16.720
it's well it's actually yeah it's an

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.240
anti-israel game not say uh

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.679
it's just sci-fi it's just a sci-fi

00:22:19.679 --> 00:22:21.600
video game that's awesome

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.039
it's not it's probably not super

00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:24.880
interesting to delve into a

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.159
delve into it on a podcast but uh it's

00:22:28.159 --> 00:22:30.400
it's what i'm uh it's my holy grail

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.440
project that

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.400
uh gonna be gonna be working on for 10

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.679
years here

00:22:35.679 --> 00:22:37.280
yeah how involved is that i feel like

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.480
that's something people want to do but i

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:38.880
feel like

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.640
it's one of those things that must be

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.559
like insanely involved

00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:46.000
oh yeah well the um you know people

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.360
people always say with game design

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.280
that's the one the biggest

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.880
biggest piece of advice that i've heard

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.039
over and over is keep it small

00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:56.159
and uh ambition ambition kills projects

00:22:56.159 --> 00:22:57.600
and this is the most

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.640
retardedly ambitious uh not not small

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.720
project so um we'll see maybe it'll be a

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.039
total disaster but um it is what i'm to

00:23:07.039 --> 00:23:08.080
be working on for

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.840
for ten years if it's a disaster we'll

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.120
take it me and matt will take you out to

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:11.840
the range

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.280
yeah so if this thing flops as bad as i

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.240
think it might

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.400
we'll take you out get some guns go to

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.600
the range yeah

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.960
actually i don't i didn't mean to say i

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.480
think it's gonna flop i don't i don't

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.520
think that at all

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.760
but we'll go to the range regardless

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.799
afterwards

00:23:26.799 --> 00:23:30.159
yeah we're gonna hand you a gun sammy

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.520
be the only place left for [ __ ]

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.200
cowboys like us do we might have to just

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.520
meet in the video game realm

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.240

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.520
that the only the only way out of this

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.360
[ __ ] nightmare is uh

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.520

crawling around on the floor in stores

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:21.760
people would probably

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.799
you'd have a couple people probably

00:33:22.799 --> 00:33:24.720

in compliance when i go in to get my

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.640

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.039
it

00:33:43.039 --> 00:33:44.720
while driving but when you drive around

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.480

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.400
house we believe

black lives matter women's rights are

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:19.520

love is love kindness is everything

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.000
okay i guess you guys can claim all that

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.599
at once yeah i don't know if you needed

00:35:31.599 --> 00:35:33.040
to let anybody know

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.720
oh there's another one that says water

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.079
there's another one they added on

00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:41.200
water is life okay okay

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.040
i want to make one it's like identical

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.400
but at the end it says

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:51.040
uh kung fu is the only real martial art

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:54.000
some total non-sequitur like ford is the

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:54.640
best

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:58.480
automaker us automaker

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.280
the water water is all right look this

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.560
is i'm going to derail this because that

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.359
was funny

00:36:03.359 --> 00:36:05.839
but water is life it reminded me of the

00:36:05.839 --> 00:36:08.000
first time i saw jewish people

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.599
i was at hershey park yeah and a bunch

00:36:11.599 --> 00:36:13.200
of orthodox jews so they were in the

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.560
full unis

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.640
went on a water horizon it was called

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.480
tidal force it was just it just dropped

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.000
you straight down and you got hit with a

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:20.800
thing of war

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.480
but there was like they were all in this

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.480
one boat there was like 20 of them

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:28.560
they're in the ark and they all started

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:31.280
they started chanting water is wet it

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.720
was the first interaction i've ever had

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:33.359
with jews

00:36:33.359 --> 00:36:34.800
and they were all in the boat all in

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.119
uniform going water is what

00:36:37.119 --> 00:36:40.320
water is like damn jews rule

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.079
that was the first interaction this

00:36:42.079 --> 00:36:43.359
water is another one of your

00:36:43.359 --> 00:36:45.280
anti-semitic stories man

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.000
no it's not it's probatic this sounds

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.440
like one of those stories you use to

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.040
justify your little bombing

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:54.560
plan that you keep bringing up to me

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.960
that's the [ __ ] secret password dude

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.720
that's the code so you're saying it's a

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.160
satanic ritual

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.119
that's like it was just guys having fun

00:37:07.119 --> 00:37:09.200
it was just a bunch of dudes having fun

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.440
but i remember then we had a basketball

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:12.720
game we had a summer league game that

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:13.040
night

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.560
and me and my friends did not stop

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.800
chanting water as wet

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.320
what do you guys think of that pretty

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.720
good hey man you got to get amped up

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.160
that's like the um

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.040
the maori uh kiru dance they do before

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.560
rugby games you know

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.920

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.359
matter you gotta get amped up you say

00:37:29.359 --> 00:37:30.480
whatever

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.240
true you're playing stinky

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.920
i've been uh i've been working out i've

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.760
been doing um pad work

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.800
uh and uh boxing muay thai type stuff

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.079
i've been doing every

00:37:42.079 --> 00:37:46.160
every day for a good good bit of time

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.240
feeling feeling dangerous feeling like i

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.680
feel like a kid you need to knock that

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.160
off dude

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:56.000
you're going to kick a sales worker

00:37:58.079 --> 00:38:00.480
i'm going to rip a sick body shot to tim

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.320
heideker and try to kill him

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.599
with a with a spleen shot a lawyer ask a

00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:07.040
lawyer what the penalty is for just a

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.640
body shot

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.680
kill i'll kill earlier too i'll kill the

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.599
lawyer

00:38:13.599 --> 00:38:15.200
i'll [ __ ] i'm telling you i was i was

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.640
saying that when i was driving around

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.720
today i was saying you know what i would

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.960
obviously go to jail for a long time but

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.560
if i [ __ ] hit one of these regular

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.000
people walking around it would be

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.400
awesome

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.560
leg kick or would you go like just like

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.079
you're saying it's like a liver shot

00:38:32.079 --> 00:38:33.520
i'd start with a leg kick to let them

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.460
know that it's real

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:37.440
[Laughter]

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.440
i should give them a little leg kick

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.119
like yeah this is a professional that

00:38:41.119 --> 00:38:42.240
you're about to get hit by

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:46.160
and then i mean dude if you walked up

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.760
and on someone unsuspectingly hit him

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.520
with a leg kick it would [ __ ] them up so

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.560
and they would never see it

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.960
so that's so funny to think about going

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.480
going up and doing obscure

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:58.079
or like to unexpected techniques

00:38:58.079 --> 00:39:01.839
like a spinning breakfast

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:06.079
spinning backfist to open the fight

00:39:06.079 --> 00:39:09.599
hey this is a wheel kick check it out

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:14.079
yeah nice question mark kick yeah

00:39:14.079 --> 00:39:16.240
well they're like flutters that should

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.599
be that should be a

00:39:17.599 --> 00:39:19.680
law that uh quest you can you can

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.200
question mark kick people

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:24.400
but this is legal at least push kicks i

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:29.839
feel like push kicks are kind of polite

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:33.599
excuse me sir can you back up six feet

00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:36.560
yeah social distancing six feet i'm

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.000
gonna kick you in the chest right now i

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.599
need six feet distance

00:39:39.599 --> 00:39:41.040
yeah that was actually matt that was

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.079
when i knew you and me were going to be

00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:44.000
good friends when you would bring up uh

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.280
there was an old lady that was doing

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.599
stand-up in the scene and anytime

00:39:47.599 --> 00:39:49.440
she would go on stage i could matt would

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.680
inevitably talk about how like

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.440
how easy it would be to kill her with

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.359
just a punch to the chest

00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:58.160
yeah be mortal combat damage dude full

00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.520
bone fracture just one

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.520
punch in the arm you break your arm just

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.800
killing this woman

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.480
dude that's that was my idea for like a

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.000
high-end resort now that now that

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.760
pedophile islands are out we just get

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.920
old people and let billionaires just

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:10.560
beat the

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.400
[ __ ] out of them i think that's what

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.359
they're doing that's what they're doing

00:40:13.359 --> 00:40:14.560
now with kovit i think they

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.440
they're doing this because they want to

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.920
watch old people die yeah probably part

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:18.480
of it

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.400
just giving them the bug yeah man it

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.839
sucks for those people who dug

00:40:21.839 --> 00:40:25.359
mass graves who did for this thing

00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:27.359
uh i remember seeing that in the news a

00:40:27.359 --> 00:40:28.960
bunch that like mass graves were being

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.240
dug for this

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.000
i think it turns out it's just not that

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.640
many people oh really

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.319
damn they probably thought the cemetery

00:40:36.319 --> 00:40:38.400
was popping dude you probably were

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.560
actually cemetery it was definitely

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:41.599
popping

00:40:41.599 --> 00:40:45.119
true but i guess when there was like a

00:40:45.119 --> 00:40:45.920
country

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:49.359
i think it was new york mass graves

00:40:49.359 --> 00:40:51.200
iran needs to have mass graves just on

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.359

for covid coronavirus deaths i don't

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.400
know if that's that means it's true or

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.520
not it might be someone you know

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.079
debunking

00:41:02.079 --> 00:41:05.200

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.000
take take a minute let the dust settle

00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:58.960

and then come back out yeah haters and

00:50:00.559 --> 00:50:02.000
just start what did you say

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.480
i know that article i saw your blog

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.559
seeing how jack sam got is

00:50:06.559 --> 00:50:09.200
it's that's how you gotta overcome

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:09.760
cancel

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.440
cancellation you just gotta get [ __ ]

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:14.640
yolked and you come back dude

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.559
now and it's it's it's applicable to

00:50:16.559 --> 00:50:17.760
everybody you don't just have to be

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:18.800
canceled because this

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.880
this lockdown stuff is so annoying and

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.800
gay that you have to uh

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.319
you have to do something and i think i'm

00:50:24.319 --> 00:50:26.000
in i'm in much better

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.640
physical shape than i've ever been in

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:29.920
just because i know

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.559
knowing that like gyms are closed and

00:50:32.559 --> 00:50:33.920
like going outside is mad

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:37.119
annoying it's like provided it's it's

00:50:37.119 --> 00:50:39.520
given me the choice of either like

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:40.800
getting fatter

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:42.640
or doing the doing the opposite you know

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.720
what i mean and i think that um

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.079
probably probably everybody should be

00:50:46.079 --> 00:50:47.359
doing that you got to figure out some

00:50:47.359 --> 00:50:48.240
ways i don't think this

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:50.079
[ __ ] is uh i think they're gonna they

00:50:50.079 --> 00:50:52.559
would like to try to stretch this out

00:50:52.559 --> 00:50:55.680
forever you know have have ubi

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.520
have people working from home have this

00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:59.280
is the new normal

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:03.119
and uh as as sick uh

00:51:03.119 --> 00:51:05.359
and uh as much as you wanna you the

00:51:05.359 --> 00:51:07.440
instinct is to fight back against that

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.280
politically and believe that that's not

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.960
the case and yeah the

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:13.119
the uh don't step up on the snake guys

00:51:13.119 --> 00:51:14.559

the initial charge

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:32.079
whose horse spazzed because horses would

00:53:32.079 --> 00:53:33.200
spaz and charges

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:36.079

sioux village he was like so all he

00:53:41.359 --> 00:53:42.640
could do all he could do was

00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:45.040
fight it to make it turn left so he just

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:47.040
rode his horse that was spazzing out in

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:48.079
a circle

00:53:48.079 --> 00:53:50.079
throughout the battle so like his boys

00:53:50.079 --> 00:53:51.599
were still fighting and he was just

00:53:51.599 --> 00:53:52.559
circling

00:53:52.559 --> 00:53:54.240
on the outskirts the whole time and then

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.760
eventually he was like this actually

00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:56.559
worked out

00:53:56.559 --> 00:53:58.319
because all this you know everybody got

00:53:58.319 --> 00:54:00.400
[ __ ] murdered this guy was just on a

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.000
runaway horse the whole time and then

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.440
afterwards people were like

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:06.160

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.240
have a term for the samurai i have a

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.599
term for um

00:54:15.599 --> 00:54:17.359

00:54:17.359 --> 00:54:18.880
to the samurai when they were charging

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:19.680

school i've seen chinese people do that

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.839
to get out of stuff

00:54:41.839 --> 00:54:43.359
like that to me i feel like that would

00:54:43.359 --> 00:54:44.720
never work if that was me like if

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:46.240

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:48.960
for me and i was like

00:54:50.319 --> 00:54:52.079

00:54:52.079 --> 00:54:53.520
in high school to get out of like get

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.640
out yeah they could pull it off

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.799
it's believable yes it was believable

00:54:56.799 --> 00:54:58.559

that's a very good

00:54:59.839 --> 00:55:01.680
if you have an asian accent you have to

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.119
have an asian accent to do that

00:55:03.119 --> 00:55:05.890
to get that oh

00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:07.200
[Laughter]

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.319
that's how you that's how you do it for

00:55:08.319 --> 00:55:10.319
real that's how you say face dude with a

00:55:10.319 --> 00:55:11.680
nice tummy ache

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:13.119
there's a bunch of dudes ready to charge

00:55:13.119 --> 00:55:15.440
in the full coolest uniforms

00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:17.920
known to man the samurai [ __ ] helmets

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:19.280

oh just in the back like

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:24.640
because if it was me the only way i

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:25.760
could get out of that thing is if i said

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:27.599
i had an ankle problem

00:55:27.599 --> 00:55:29.520

you look at me and you think that's

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:32.400
that's that is that guy's weak spot is

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.720
his ankles but i would say

00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:38.319

he could have faked a tummy ache you

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.119
could call off a gun range and be like i

00:56:09.119 --> 00:56:09.839

he's typing

00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:55.040

funny you say that because that's what

00:57:29.119 --> 00:57:31.040
eddie ray ruth said the reason for the

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:32.559
killing was was because they weren't

00:57:32.559 --> 00:57:35.280
talking to him

00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.559
so they weren't giving him enough

00:57:36.559 --> 00:57:38.319
attention and thinking that he's cool

00:57:38.319 --> 00:57:42.319
and that's why he capped him damn damn

00:57:42.319 --> 00:57:44.240

you're just a guy with

00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:18.000

chris kyle's cool he thinks it's badass

00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:31.839

they're trying yeah but it's just so

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:51.920
funny to dredge up a story and be like

00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:53.599
trump said you guys soldiers are losers

00:58:53.599 --> 00:58:55.520

00:59:05.839 --> 00:59:07.280
ponds let's see if we can trick those

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:08.640
pawns that we already have

00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:10.960
yeah the guys that should actually works

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:13.040
i the uh this guy that i trained with as

00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:14.319
a um

00:59:14.319 --> 00:59:17.200
uh ex-soldier and we got talking after

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:18.240
and he was like uh

00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.400
yeah trump i'm not into trump he said

00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:22.480
soldiers are losers

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:23.839
and i didn't i didn't get into it with

00:59:23.839 --> 00:59:24.799
him because you know i didn't have half

00:59:24.799 --> 00:59:26.559
an hour to explain to him how the media

00:59:26.559 --> 00:59:28.240
is totally corrupt so i was just like oh

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.520
man that's crazy

00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:31.760

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:34.160
[ __ ] works why not keep dipping into it

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:35.760
all these all these media tactics that

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:38.720
they do over and over that seem so uh

00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:42.160
so simple it's uh [ __ ] [ __ ] works

00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:45.040
you know yes i mean there's a i would

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:45.359
