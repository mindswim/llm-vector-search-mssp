I don't and dog the the I got I think a

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.319
fool so we talked about Bay brains

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.170
before I got a full glimpse into the

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.720
mind of the day first of all it's in the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.030
dog break it's pure chaos bro and I

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.370
figured out why I think I've pinpointed

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.670
the unifying principle that is the dbe's

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.989
dude oh I watch the bees I want power

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.500
dude so I watched bay like when they're

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.879
pregnant they go through

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.099
it's like hellish they go through all

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.829
this wild [ __ ] the pregnancy itself is

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.129
like that like they get their stomachs

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.590
gutted dude like yeah you know if you

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.150
have a c-section they cut you open

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.010
if you don't Lieber sir your vagina it's

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.470
a [ __ ] it's it was the most terrifying

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.439
thing to have ever seen and it wasn't

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:06.639
even happening to me I was just

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:07.689
witnessing it being like this is

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:09.760
terrifying so they do all that they can

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.290
play I'll do the whole time they're just

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.639
like this [ __ ] sucks I'm never doing

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:16.299
this again dude like after like three

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.389
weeks she's like I kind of Miss being

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.239
pregnant and that's when I realized I

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.819
was like holy [ __ ] you guys are built on

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.290
chaos dude like the whole the D B's is

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.780
what is what makes the race continue it

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.639
makes the whole human race go on yeah of

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.590
course if they if they were thinking it

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.239
she if she were to be like let me take a

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.919
logical assessment of my last nine

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.040
months yeah [ __ ] that we've been reading

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.069
a flash in the pan dude true so they're

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:46.959
running on a mindset that allows them to

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.879
go through a near-death experience and

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.159
immediately reenlist it's how much they

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.829
love love like this is you know what

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.870
this is just the best so that's why I've

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.760
been real patient when stuff stops

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.040

hablen dude right after the baby yeah

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:13.810
yeah they're good like I think sometimes

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.180
kill the baby and why that's like

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.360
yourselves and kill the baby typically

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.180
it's to protect the baby from the harsh

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.939
world

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:25.290
really

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.090
yeah that's typically it's not like I

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.920
hate this [ __ ] thing it's like you're

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.570
too pure and innocent for this wicked

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.640
wicked world and therefore the week

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.790
we're there for me take you to the river

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.540

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.360
in neutral

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.940
[Laughter]

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.490
turning off the flame turning on the gas

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.279
[Music]

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.910
I'll do we're talking based on the page

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.940
yeah the page dude is a the page is

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.250
gonna be a serious high dude there's a

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.050
lot going on I alluded to there's a

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.210
secret text floating around

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.600
I actually teared it up because I was

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.650
trying to put what happened was I was

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.030
trying to put the secret text on there

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.100
that's like a gift and then it

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.780
automatically made tears I was like [ __ ]

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.130
and then I couldn't delete them that I

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.170
figured out how to do it and I have it

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:35.430
just $1 $5 $10 $50 and then there's $100

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.530
which I don't recommend 50 or 100

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.090
whatsoever but I put it up there being

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:40.500
like the one the hundred dollar if you

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.120
want fallout if you want to show the

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.620
world that you're a baller dude that's

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.150
$50 like you know if your ball on your

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.220
ball and $100 like I personally don't

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.600
recommend you do this unless you're like

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.250
part of a trust fund and that what comes

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.820
with $100 one is that once a month will

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.440

pulled read it just like huge donkey boy

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:36.300
it's like Shane's a fat [ __ ] content

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.530
here's the content I've been looking for

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:41.260
I laid in bed I was like I wonder what

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.670
it is usually I lay in bed I put in an

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:44.470
audiobook what do I fall asleep pop it

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:45.850
out go to bed I'm like I wonder you know

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:47.410
what cuz I've been reading a lot about

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.770
how if you want to have like dazzling

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.140
insights pop into your mind you have to

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:54.910
do conscious work and then once you

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:56.410
really conscious work is just letting

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:58.390
your unconscious mind toil while you're

00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:59.890
think you're doing something and then

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:00.850
when you take a break that's when

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:03.370
insights and ideas pop into your head so

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.290
I'm like I'm gonna lay in bed and see

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:06.850
what my mind comes up with dude I

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:08.740
fantasize for 45 minutes about

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:10.300
discovering that like someone down the

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.470
street for me as a pedophile and

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:18.220
murdering them go to his house and I'll

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.320
like check him out dude I just like I

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.330
like went through like 20 different ways

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:23.740
of like probably throw him down the

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.360
steps maybe I'd be able to maybe have a

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.890
gun and I'd [ __ ] take it off him

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:28.240
shoot him and I think I'd kill him I

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.590
think my neighborhood was for me I'm

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:30.790
like I wonder it happens if you murder a

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:33.280
pedophile you know he was a pedophile

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.630
and you catch him doing it and you

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:39.250
murder him you have to get off yeah

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:39.910
probably

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:41.980
if someone was like yeah he was he was

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.980
diddling and this guy came in

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.950
him [ __ ] kids yes that guy could have

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.260
you just like you just suspected a

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.030
pedophile and killed him yeah that's

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.309
risky I mean I think Chris Hanson could

00:19:53.309 --> 00:19:56.070
have [ __ ] gut-punched oh you'd

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.450
definitely like jab to one of those

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:58.350
dudes in the face

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:00.330

music over the speaker's still have that

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.160

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.100

how do you suggest we as a society crowd

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:13.730
though I genuinely think that the

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.830
wrestling is the best option catch and

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:16.220
release

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:18.679

00:25:18.679 --> 00:25:20.860
but I've been pitched in all week I

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.360
