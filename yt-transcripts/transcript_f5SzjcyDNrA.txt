day yeah I called you guys an emergency

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.280
meeting I was trying to emergency cast

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.810
did not think that that was a real phone

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.700
call cuz he woke me up from a nap really

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.210
well I was the nap was over but it was a

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.579
really weird phone call that's why I was

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.079
aware of that that must have been

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.899
jarring yeah when you when you just so

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.509
basically I had I went down I did the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.649
float I haven't done the float tank in a

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.869
while so I'm like let me you know we're

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.280
totally talking about doing well what

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.450
was formerly called the stank tank

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.460
forgive me for the [ __ ] that that's

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.600
not what it is obviously it's way more

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.460
important than that I always get

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.200
preparing myself on my dude if we're

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.270
gonna do a live podcast where I'm gonna

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.489
pop out of a float tank after consuming

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.739
edibles I'm like I need to prepare

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.350
myself for the reality of that situation

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.060
because I was I was like that's one

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.620
that's something to talk about but like

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.140
to actually do I was like let me just

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.670
see how last time I made an edible hop

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.020
in a flow tank it kind of freaked out

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.490
and like kind of that was when I felt

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.180
like a when I had like dear body that

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.590
was what how you'd like literally felt

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.210
like a prey animal I was like oh that's

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.680
what prey animals feel like I was

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.120
leading a float tank and like basically

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.000
felt like a deer in the gaze of a lion I

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.770
was just I think hacking actually

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.260
executing that idea could lead to a

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.710
life-altering panic attack bit I already

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.090
had a couple of those do some full live

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.010
life-altering panic attack to my way

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.840
here so it's like yeah what else they I

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.600
feel when people tell me that they get

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.850
you know anxious or paranoid when they

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.340
do drugs I'm like you got to get more

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.230
anxious and paranoid you get through

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.330
deed when you're going through hell

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.140
people don't want to hear it they're

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.930
people on here there's a whole there's a

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:17.910
whole thing called exposure therapy yeah

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.950
people don't want to [ __ ] that is a

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.050
valid form of getting people over their

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.180
anxieties but all right well just double

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.750
down brother get in there yeah it feels

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.070
like you're sitting still on the couch

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.960
while like the end of poltergeist is

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.480
happy like the ghost power moving around

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.450
pretty much because we don't have in our

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.220
culture we don't have an actual right of

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.590
past exactly dude we don't had that's

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.790
the right of past like to be able to

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.470
push through to the other side like push

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.580
through the darkness and get to the

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.990
other side and realize that you're a man

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.580
yeah and they worked perfectly because

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.470
the rites of passage were so intense

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.660
that if you died you just failed yeah so

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.980
anyone who made it through there

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.410
anything wasn't a [ __ ] officially

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.840
wasn't a [ __ ] and had some skills like

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.830
they would send you in the woods for

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.210
like a week and be like good luck dude

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.860
if you smoke the MT and die you're just

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.600
a [ __ ] yeah you lose exactly yeah

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.220
there's people who die of heart attacks

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.900
down like ayahuasca ceremonies you

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.510
imagine being the other people who are

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.820
like it's it's like it's it's because

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.580
people have like cardiac stuff they just

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.830
don't take care of oh you'd like the the

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.419
people that do it as like a vacation

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.560
it's like the dudes who shouldn't ride

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.990
rollercoasters like you don't find a lot

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.139
of those people indeed

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.909
tea cultures no too fat for

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:31.229
rollercoasters doesn't really happen

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.030
sticks into the ocean to eat dinner

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.620
that's a fair point because they're like

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.240
no this stuff's generally harmless and

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.189
it's like you haven't they haven't come

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:42.009
to grips of like American bodies going

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:43.419
down there let me see what this stuff is

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.449
all about yeah if you're physically

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.219
incapable of rollerblading don't go

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:56.710

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.110
heart attacks down to the ayahuasca

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.310
resorts yeah I'm pretty sure down there

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.930
you only die from being like two eyes

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.460
you get eaten a lot sure you get munched

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.110
or you get so wise that you eventually

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.789
just like find a bed of straw and you're

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.479

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:05.860
your instructor dick towers Knicks with

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.150
lines wrapped around their legs and they

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.940
jump off headfirst and like some heads

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.810

softer they get they get hyped they're

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.720
so [ __ ] hyped up on getting through to

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.330
the other side mm-hmm that a death is

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.370
impossible basically you can't die when

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.530
you're when you're that I would say my

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.020
dog's indestructible true I drove into

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.400
the shallow end of a pool one time hit

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.250
my head so I'm basically man basically I

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.560
could see that that was a pretty hard

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.360
knock to the head and I was totally fine

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.740
so yeah I could probably jump 30 feet

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.850
with some vines on my legs and you're

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:51.190
standing up there and you're like dude I

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.870
I would be scared to jump into water

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.380
yeah I died ov through a tube into the

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.820
shallow end and it's like bonk it was

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.070
like [ __ ] forgot wrong end of the pool

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.840
but they don't see that they're always

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.610
always you clear the tube everyone up

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.500
top was like oh yeah you're on the bombs

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.560
by myself I think I jumped in with a oh

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.710
[ __ ] its God I was like demon dam that

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.020
rules yeah man the I I dude I'm telling

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.610

I bug out it's like first of all you're

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.000
probably smoking weed and like going to

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.060
7-eleven which is hell we're just

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.510
watching TV yeah well I guess that's

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:29.950
what I'm trying to do that's the point

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.230
well once you've mastered it is when the

get syndicate and probably on the page

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:01.300

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.010
before you have to kind of get your

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:04.960

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:37.420
even feel because it's one of those

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.620
things where before you do you kind of

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.540
get a little butterflies to this is

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.880
gonna mean anything I'm doing so if

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.320

occur I would have no control over it I

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.220

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.040
there's a bathroom was upstairs yeah so

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.390
you have to do the Texas walk out the

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:37.120
shower the bathroom you do the wet Texan

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:43.720
[Laughter]

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:48.910
you're in it make it so you'd have to

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:56.790
walk out naked just point to a toilet

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.200
yes I was in there and I was like [ __ ]

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.640
dude you don't worry about getting salt

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.190
water in your bird no it's it's Epsom

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.530
salt I don't mean like in your bird yeah

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:08.079
okay oh yeah yeah dude your meatus

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:15.730
pinches off pee you don't take any water

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.709
back when you pee it's like a needle if

00:17:17.709 --> 00:17:19.510
you pay it takes a little back in when

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.550
you stop yeah but it's the vacuum

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:24.130
pressure dilution of salt and the ocean

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:27.670
probably is less concentrated this is

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:29.440
dead sea levels you say yeah you float

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.210
yeah this is dead sea I think you're

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:33.250
okay yeah yeah your bird doesn't hurt

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:35.140
your again if you ever pee in the shower

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.150
then your bird hurts like a bird sucks

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.160
in some of the hot water yeah you don't

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.230
get that okay you like a bird cramp when

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:42.820
you pee in this yeah what why does that

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.510
happen for us because the

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:48.730
good I like the last fluid to pass

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.950
through your penis changes the pH level

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:52.030
to make like when you're when you're

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.650
gonna come the pre comb I think is to

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:57.010
adjust the pH level in like your bird so

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:58.780
that when the semen comes through the

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.270
sperm stays alive and I think that

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:02.620
burning sensation that you're feeling is

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:03.970
like the clash of the pH levels or

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:06.070
something like that so that's that's a

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:07.720
guess based on a couple of things that

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.260
are true

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.299
so you're by always thought of value and

00:18:10.299 --> 00:18:12.340
got pissed pH and you got come pH and

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.660
you can't cross the two because you'll

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.760
kill all your sperm I always thought it

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:21.010
was uh you got shampoo pH yeah yeah I

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:22.900
guess you got a comedian but I think you

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.940
have to pee to activate the pump to suck

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.410
the liquid back into your bird just to

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:30.100
sting it up mmm otherwise every time you

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.770
had a shower would hurt your bird ya

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:35.169
know it's it's pretty closed off like

00:18:35.169 --> 00:18:38.440
camel nostrils there's have you ever get

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.110
it like a bird pain in the ocean no no

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:43.059
no but yeah oh you're saying so this

00:18:43.059 --> 00:18:44.740
salt is so so me I didn't know what kind

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:45.700
of thought it was I didn't know what

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.890
they were doing yes no I so in order for

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:49.540
you to float it has to be like it you're

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.460
right there's a ton of salt yeah so in

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.840
order for you to float you have to have

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.240
a ton of Saul in there but it doesn't if

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.410
you have any like kind of Nick's on you

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:57.190
it'll definitely

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:58.570
it'll sting those up you'll feel that

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:03.090
yeah my my dong has a lot of Nick's yeah

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:07.360
I started getting dry dick around 32

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.540
yeah I mean my my dick is just like

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.880
dripping wet always so really yeah you

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.929
know I guess you don't beat off that

00:19:13.929 --> 00:19:15.940
much I'm hearing there I go through

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.700
spurts I like that I like that I like to

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.490

I don't I don't like when you're jerking

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.540
off consistently like it did the more

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:44.679
consistent when you're drinking off like

00:19:44.679 --> 00:19:46.840
the longer it takes to come it's like

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.850
heroin yes so I like to take long breaks

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.970

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.220
weird if you're like if you have like a

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.360
you start forgetting the last time you

like I Bank things and then that's the

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.020
best way Syd's come origin story was

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:03.710
beating off in the woods routine oh you

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:06.170
said oh you steadily beat a pretty

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:10.190
packed house you know when I was living

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:13.400
with my grandma there is nowhere to beat

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.710
off true it was just who's just you and

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:25.190
gay dad's hot hetero teens dude it's

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.230
kind of a wild mixed you to your prey

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:30.500
out there yeah said the first time that

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.280
like the first time that I really

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.320
remember coming I got jerked off by a

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.160
girl in the woods

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.080
that's her so and then I was like I can

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.880
always go because where we were was a

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.610
pretty secluded spot like I can always

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.960
do that again feels like she could like

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.090
sacred jerking ground basically you

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:48.080
would go back out there and get

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.550
basically big this is where I got jerked

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:51.650
off the first time yeah I guess I mean

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:53.690
it's also like we have pretty good woods

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:58.340
in my hot woods yeah yeah I didn't know

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:02.900
I was a pretty risky jerker I mean I

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.820
didn't realize like once I realized how

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.020
dangerous it was to be jerking off

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:09.820
outside oh my god

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.649
dude yeah never again imagine getting

00:22:11.649 --> 00:22:13.450
found by like a group of hobbyist

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:21.999
paintballers that would be a rite of

00:22:21.999 --> 00:22:24.309
passage to see if I could oh after

00:22:24.309 --> 00:22:27.460
running away they're like dude how many

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.049
how many jerks did you catch in the

00:22:29.049 --> 00:22:34.210
woods if you had to count them I their

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:36.309
their their five that I can specifically

00:22:36.309 --> 00:22:37.570
remember God you like wouldn't like

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.190
that's the first number that came I'm

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.409
pretty sure in terms of like etiquette

00:22:41.409 --> 00:22:44.080
was it like pants down to the ankles Pat

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.320
like were you show an ass like learn

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:51.609
curve I came when breakers a couple

00:22:51.609 --> 00:22:55.149
times Hannah is a you know so but you

00:22:55.149 --> 00:23:04.869
swishing home from end of the bugger

00:23:04.869 --> 00:23:05.710
come off in the woods

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:08.950
I was basically like look a 45-degree

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:12.099
lean up against the tree that's all a

00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:14.340
jerking with the other like a plank oh

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.229
yeah that's all that's pretty cool yeah

00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:18.909
I'm gonna go out into the Norristown

00:23:18.909 --> 00:23:20.470
woods and just rub nylon together and

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:30.940
see if I can attract maybe sake if you

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.619
build a tree house in the woods to beat

00:23:32.619 --> 00:23:35.559
off in a jerk Shack in the treetops

00:23:35.559 --> 00:23:36.970
that's good that's good jerking dude

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:39.190
yeah I mean if I built the treehouse and

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.779
was I would definitely jerk off in it

00:23:40.779 --> 00:23:42.429
yeah I'm kind of pissed cuz I think we

00:23:42.429 --> 00:23:43.809
had a fort I don't think I ever jerked

00:23:43.809 --> 00:23:44.409
off in it

00:23:44.409 --> 00:23:46.149
yeah there's porn there too and I think

00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:48.970
I just checked it out I thought it was

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:50.950
crazy when my friends were telling me

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:52.929
about like them jerking off in her house

00:23:52.929 --> 00:23:55.960
the idea we had so many rooms in the

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.509
house at a living that didn't have doors

00:23:57.509 --> 00:24:00.549
so the idea of jerking off in a room

00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:02.559
anywhere was just like it it was

00:24:02.559 --> 00:24:05.049
terrifying the bathroom was a bit I was

00:24:05.049 --> 00:24:06.970
a heavy jerking off station in my house

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.070
but our bathroom you couldn't be in the

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:10.389
bathroom for more than like two minutes

00:24:10.389 --> 00:24:11.919
before somebody else knocking on the

00:24:11.919 --> 00:24:13.389
door yeah we should pulled it there's a

00:24:13.389 --> 00:24:14.859
drawer near the door and we'd pull the

00:24:14.859 --> 00:24:15.940
drawer out so because people would

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.109
obviously pick the lock every single

00:24:17.109 --> 00:24:18.340
time to try to catch you jerking off

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:19.779
yeah so you'd pull the drawer out and

00:24:19.779 --> 00:24:20.889
the drawer would stop the door from

00:24:20.889 --> 00:24:21.370
opening

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:22.900
then you'd be able to like pick item out

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.640
you get a clean break what the [ __ ] you

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.010
doing then yeah so funny imagine Sid

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:29.200
just like trying to beat off indoors and

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.970
just getting like clip comes true phobic

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.610
not having a bedroom door I was in my

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:37.540
brother's house where I didn't have a

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.010
bedroom door it's a different it's a

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:40.720
different room experience yeah where

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.760
it's like Anytime Anywhere so yeah it's

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.470
tough to catch a beat like that yeah you

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:45.940
you learn a different type of politeness

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.500
when you live in a house with no doors

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.690
trail you get gizelle hearing when

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:52.390
you're beating off you know each

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.970
person's footfall their gait you could

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.160
identify them by distance sound who's

00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:02.080
here I want to do a show like scandal

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.550
but instead of like a hot affairs is a

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:06.850
guy jerking off somewhere so Carrie

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:08.980
Mathison or whatever it's like the

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.570
president he [ __ ] gets to a rumors

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:16.860
like oh [ __ ] oh god mr. president so

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.990
excuse me excuse me for the decoy the

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:22.420
yeah so I called you guys so I'm in the

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:23.559
I'm in the flow tank and I'm sitting

00:25:23.559 --> 00:25:25.480
there and I'm like I'm thinking about

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.309
doing the the show and I'm like damn

00:25:27.309 --> 00:25:29.170
they'll be [ __ ] wild I'm like it is

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:31.360
doable and then I don't know you kind of

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.620
like I've kind of forgot what the [ __ ] I

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.990
was really thinking about but I got real

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:36.940
into the idea of like manipulating real

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.980
that's my thing I'm really into right

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.170
now is the manipulation of reality and

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:42.910
how like if you're not doing that you're

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:44.620
just [ __ ] you're out here floating

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.960
around if you're not consciously at

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.030
least attempting literally preaching to

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:51.520
the choir exactly bro yeah he wasn't

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.190
[ __ ] my talking yeah so I'm sitting

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:57.580
there you know you called exactly so I'm

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.040
sitting there I'm like you have to so

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.020
that first Elaine I'm like damn cuz I I

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:05.650
entered into like literally a I was

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:07.510
thinking about mystical experiences and

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:09.250
how there's scientific literature about

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:11.410
the clinical benefit of mystical

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:12.910
experiences and it's just like a part of

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:14.260
our brain none of us are using right now

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:15.850
that's the stuff with the mushroom

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.550
studies when they say like people stop

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.200
smoking after one experience with

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.510
mushrooms for up to 18 months and it's

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:25.750
like it confounds psychiatric science

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:26.950
it's where it's like no you have to give

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:28.630
people you know you got to alter their

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:30.700
neuro chemicals and it's like now dude

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.230
you can have somebody have like a

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:34.700
mystical experience from a substance and

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:35.930
stop you know they quit smoking they

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:37.160
stopped doing here in blah blah there's

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.650
a bunt and nobody really knows the signs

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:41.090
the scientists right now I have no

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:42.290
[ __ ] clue how that works do you think

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:43.820
any of you any of it could be attributed

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.890
to the fact that the mind isn't fully

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:51.380
understood yet exactly bro are we having

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.440
a mind battle right now Shane I gotta

literally can stand up on we can stand

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:24.560
up to science I can't wait till this

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.210
also turns into a wicker clothing brand

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:33.320
time for the apparent for all of our

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:39.260

need a weed edible hopping a float tank

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.420
and if you've trained yourself not to

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.090
bug out you can literally relax in a

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:06.530
flow tank to the point where like you

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:08.600
literally it feels like you leave your

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:09.770
body it's [ __ ] crazy

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.900
I can't wait it's so it's so [ __ ]

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.820
awesome you guys do the deep dive yeah

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.830
it's like that if you just weren't aware

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:17.270
of your body at all how much did the

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:18.620
deep dive did you explain on here I

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.510
didn't really explain it that much

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:22.340
interesting I talked a little bit about

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.080
it on the Twitter stream but I don't

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.220
know if I actually covered it well I

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.710
I've explained it it's basically you you

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:29.000
know this is a chain call so you just

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.280
get it high it's like sure true sure if

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:35.660
you're gonna be a Western [ __ ] sure

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.430
I'm having a mystical experience but

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:38.870
yeah I'm just [ __ ] high in a flow tag

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.570
you want to be a naysayer fine and we'll

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.630
talk about that but the but yeah it's

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:46.940
really just taking a moderate whatever

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:47.990
is moderate to heavy and

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:50.290
of cannabis is what I call it now

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:52.940
whatever that is to you take that and

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.650
when I ever tell people in like next

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:56.000
time you do it just lay on a couch with

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.290
your eyes closed the entire time and

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:58.430
listening to like some sort of like

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:00.290
music or just whatever not you don't

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:01.240
have to listen to people

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.320
nobody does that where they just like

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.660
stop for two and a half hours and it's

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.940
close their eyes without sleeping yeah

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:12.560
it was like a psychedelic meditation

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.470
exactly dude and it's [ __ ] wild but

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:17.690
it's pretty nuts what it does like in

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:20.030
terms of the [ __ ] you start thinking of

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:22.460
that like literally if I I sit all day

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:23.960
and torture myself trying to think of

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.740
cool stuff usually to no avail so then

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.390
it's like oh I do this and then it's

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:30.590
like and it's not like I'm actively

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:32.030
trying I just I just relax

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.640
all of a sudden dude BAM this think tank

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.310
becomes a sacred Church of dogology

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:38.960
y'all created it I upgraded it I did I

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.010
wasn't even trying dude

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:41.780
you nailed it I literally connected to

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.880
the source dude I when we did the deep

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.040
dive I I created a visual representation

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.010
for what I believed was my lifelong

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:51.920
chronic anxiety it slowly revealed

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.470
itself to me to be a manifestation of

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:56.390
the plant goddess recalled her Santa

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:58.490
Maria of course it was Santa Maria dude

00:29:58.490 --> 00:29:59.900
my anxieties weren't holding me back

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.700
they were it was it was the plant

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.200
goddess let me know that she's gonna

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.510
[ __ ] push me forward it was like dude

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:07.550
I realized this all I went home I tried

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:09.740
to expose my wife I felt like a gigantic

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:10.310
[ __ ]

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:12.620
she was nice about it though know what

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:13.880
you try to eat that's that's the thing

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.020
you haven't even tried

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.370
I'm not even gonna try I try and

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:17.630
Brittany to shakes her head at me but

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:19.850
it's also like was that beneficial to

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:22.100
visualize that no I'm sure and I had a

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:23.600
nice time it was a really nice afternoon

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.750
exactly and it's also like it lets you

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:28.940
feel ideas in a way that we're not

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.310
really used to you can explain it all

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:32.480
you want it doesn't make sense but if

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.430
you feel an idea you're like you almost

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:37.850
bit God family's rule that's you know

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:39.440
that's your once you're internalizing

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.690
everything and like you're it's almost

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:43.370
like your internal monologue turns off

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:45.800
and then you start being able to just

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.130
explore your your feelings just as like

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:50.630
the emotion you don't actually have to

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:53.840
like like I I know this is hard to

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:56.630
explain mm-hmm but I think I think I'm

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:58.640
already pretty close you're you're

00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.990
you're laying there your internal

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:01.130
monologue shuts off

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:02.390
now you're exploring your feelings

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:05.240
without writing a script for your side

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.950
and then like imagining someone else

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:07.820
having the other side of the

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:09.410
conversation you know what I mean

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:11.780
yeah it's just because yeah and the

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:13.880
visual aspect kind of like elevates it

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.870
and we get to see them I always I'll

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:19.310
have like my I when I get into that

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:22.070
state a lot of times I'll you know I'll

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:23.450
just be chilling I'll be like just like

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:24.950
a weird feeling like a separate entity

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:27.260
and I can sit there and like slide out

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.240
my deep bedrock fears and be like what's

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.460
this one it's like have a heart attack I

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:32.660
probably won't have a heart attack put

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.070
that one back in there I can pull out

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:36.440
all these weird not like subconscious

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.180
fears but fears that like affect me on a

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.800
daily level like you were saying you

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.240
interact with them you just like look at

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.650
them and you're like rather than it's

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:44.720
kind of like running on those yeah that

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.550
was my that was my big revelation from

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:47.150
the whole thing

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:49.310
no I ended up having a real a real life

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:51.350
impactful revelation from the whole

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:53.000
experience what was it so yeah I was

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.080
just getting high in the basement of my

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:57.020
boys yeah I'll consider Agent Smith us

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.450
however I realized I had this huge

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:02.630
anxiety about missing out like so now

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:04.430
you know I don't know I don't need to

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:06.680
bring this up but hmm you guys pushes on

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.320
to start the [ __ ] dad meet cast me

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.850
and Rainier firing we're at a hundred

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:12.470
miles an hour here on out no big deal

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:15.860
but uh we're we're kind of running

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:18.800
ourselves ragged like pursuing

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.230
opportunities and goals and [ __ ] like

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.560
that

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.650
and for so that feels really good to get

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:26.180
like returns on all that like we've you

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:29.000
know good responses and [ __ ] but I had a

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.250
new fear that I was like oh no I'm gonna

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:33.140
push too hard for like success and I'm

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:35.120
gonna I'm gonna miss out on like those

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.950
[ __ ] moments I love to collect with

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:42.070
my children mm-hmm I three kids and I I

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:44.960
so I started to I started to spin out I

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.240
went into the [ __ ] anxiety spin out

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.640
on that and then I realize like oh all I

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.890
have to do is commit to just like going

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:53.540
out of my way to create new memories

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:56.480
with the [ __ ] kids mm-hmm it was as

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.680
simple as that I felt better

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.810
I still feel better about it it's that's

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:01.610
one anxiety that can't even touch me

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:03.830
anymore dude that's what I'm saying it's

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:05.480
it's so hard to explain this stuff

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.130
because a lot of this is kind of going

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:09.920
on like you know almost not an ineffable

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.460
but like a an emotional level that it's

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:14.750
hard to put in work it's like be

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:16.670
on kind of our words a little bit not to

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:19.400
make it grandiose but it is weird fears

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.990
that you can't really articulate and

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:22.340
then you can explain those to yourself

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.720
and in a way that makes you feel better

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.400
if anything I'm trying to say that your

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.410
internal monologue trips you up that

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:28.820
because you get so focused on like what

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.490
the verbage and you yeah because it

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:33.950
becomes so since it's in your soul mind

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:37.160
in your mind rather and it feels so real

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.380
and true so if you but if you believe

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:41.510
the validity of something that you give

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:43.220
yourself for example so one of the

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.930
things that I was doing within the Deep

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:46.490
Diver that I came out of feeling better

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:51.440
about you know I noticed so I have a few

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.480
people that like you know when I see him

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:58.970
it's on site yeah right you know but

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:01.400
it's you know I was still giving that to

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:01.970
myself

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:04.220
I don't need to do that and the reason

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:07.070
why that was the case or that then I

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:08.659
feel like I need it needs to be on site

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:10.879
with these people is because they're

00:34:10.879 --> 00:34:12.679
[ __ ] corny well I felt like they

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:14.419
caught me at a time on my hands retired

00:34:14.419 --> 00:34:16.850
and I couldn't put my hands on them yeah

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:18.470
and they were taking advantage of the

00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:19.550
fact that I couldn't put my hands on it

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:21.139
but now I don't have the fears of losing

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:22.870
the things that I could have lost then

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:27.470
so I feel like I have to I can't let

00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:28.610
these people walk around thinking that

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:31.820
they could treat I do one of the people

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:35.120
came came at Ansley really yeah they

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:38.060
said stuff about her damn and it's like

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:42.470
hard to let go and then you know while I

00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:44.149
was in that deep dive I felt like I came

00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:45.530
to terms with that like I don't have to

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:47.570
I mean I have jujitsu know like that's

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:50.090
where I get my edge oh yeah do what I

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:54.260
need to there but so you drop it in on

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.230
sites a big deal

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:58.580
so I don't even know I dropped it and

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:03.650
then but early posted something about

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:05.840
that that involved one of these people

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:09.140
mm-hmm and I saw it and I was like man

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.570
isn't it didn't even move my meter damn

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:12.380
dude

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.060
yeah it was just like whatever I just

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.730
like as a matter of fact I just enjoyed

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:23.330
the fact that I knew he sucked so I I

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:24.860
think it's I think some people should at

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.410
least do it's better than

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:29.330
pretty much anything honestly yeah I I

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:31.010
like when people sit all day and don't

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:32.600
do [ __ ] well that's stupid it's like

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.890
what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] are you

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:36.410
doing try it just try it out no one's

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:37.820
quicker to say that stupid than someone

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:42.020
who's doing absolutely nothing well dude

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:43.580
ask for an alternative when you when

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:44.210
you're talking about something that

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:45.650
someone says that's stupid ask them for

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:48.370
something better they're gonna go oh

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:51.410
dude so that so I'm sitting there so

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:52.400
base that's that's a good way of

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.380
explaining it so when you added the tank

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.600
it's like I'm telling you it's a serious

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.790
[ __ ] it's a good a serious difference

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:01.250
but it also takes with with with weed

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:02.240
it's like you know if you just take

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.890
mushrooms it just hijacks you to the

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:04.850
point where you're not really in control

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:06.380
of it you're just like what the [ __ ]

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.480
going on but a lot of weed you have to

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.130
kind of still use your brain and kind of

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:11.780
like think your way like if you you know

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:12.860
I mean like if you take a ton of

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:16.280
mushrooms you're just like man yeah

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:17.630
calling your wife so that you could

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:20.980
dictate a movie script to or everything

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.380
to so me I'm in the tank I'm sitting

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:25.880
there I'm like damn dude people people

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:26.900
need to start having mystical

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.190
experiences this is [ __ ] that we're

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:30.110
not having them and I was like so I

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:31.340
started thinking about that I'm like

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:34.370
deep I'm doing the show yeah you know we

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:35.480
all come out with flow tanks to a live

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.920
podcast I'm like [ __ ] man this is gonna

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:37.610
be crazy

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:39.740
and then it just literally I just kind

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.570
of relax and let go obviously communing

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:45.110
with Santa Maria and I'm like I started

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:46.340
thinking about the fact that like so

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.690
this is bait now I was like this is what

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:49.280
you have to do you have to be having

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.750
your Vision Quest you have to be having

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:52.400
your mystical experiences you use that

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.870
to basically tell you what you're gonna

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:55.550
do with yourself so then you come up

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:56.930
with a literal vision of like all right

00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:58.280
this is what I want to do based off my

00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.720
mystical experience this is like the

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.580
thing that feels right for me to do it

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.980
feels very right and then you you packet

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:05.150
you figured you take the time you need

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:07.730
to figure that out pretty efficiently or

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:08.960
to the point where like you feel good

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.640
about least starting this and then you

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:14.060
find Bay dude you have to find once you

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.160
want you once you've been enough

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.750
mystical states where you've like been

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:19.700
like this is the thing that I'm going to

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:21.920
do and not be weird and complaining all

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.500
day about like this like you hate you

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.420
can't you can't do that you can't just

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:28.100
be walking around all day complaining

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:30.020
about I'm doing something I don't like

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.730
it's like okay

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:33.230
I'm I feel like I want to complain about

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:34.550
something it just tells me that I have

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:36.170
to adjust something I'm like if I'm if

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:38.150
I'm stuck around something that makes me

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:39.330
complain I got

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:40.980
to adjust my algorithm dude that's every

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:42.510
time I start complaining about Brittany

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:45.030
it's like you're being a [ __ ] dude and

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:46.590
every time I think about it long and

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:48.510
deep enough I'm like [ __ ] I am being a

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:52.050
[ __ ] you [ __ ] [ __ ] that's like Tim

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:53.280
said if it's worth complaining about

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.530
it's worth changing things they exactly

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:57.180
release try that's things will judge you

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.220
for you to say it's like dude first of

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.920
all none of us I would say 99% of us

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.880
aren't gonna starve to death

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.730
so it's like yeah you might lose your

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:07.860
car might be a shittier one like you

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:09.200
know if you start making changes like

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.520
[ __ ] might suck a little bit but like

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.470
you're not gonna [ __ ] die yeah from

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:15.660
desert direct result of it I sometimes

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:18.120
help people start working out you know

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.430
like just work out period and one of the

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:23.070
things that I try to do it for free but

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:24.510
they have to kind of do it my way right

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:26.130
and so one of the things that I tell

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:27.930
them is like you can't complain about

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:30.510
any workout not even jokingly yeah

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:33.000
because it messes with your psyche like

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.890
even if you jokingly complain about how

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:37.500
hard something was it makes you a little

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:40.260
less likely to go hard the next time

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.580
how do they take it when you tell them

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:44.850
no funny business they most of them are

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:47.400
pretty blown away because they

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.130
immediately see how it's going to affect

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:51.960
the way that they work out yeah and then

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:55.230
others have like they once they get into

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.340
the workout and they find themselves

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:59.310
about to complain and they substitute

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:00.630
that that was something positive so I

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:02.580
say you can't joke about how hard it is

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:04.740
which you can joke about is how how

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:06.510
jacks are gonna get or how good you're

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:09.530
gonna look Yeah right

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:11.790
you don't I'm dead serious when I'm

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:16.260
talking I'll Jack them on again don't be

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:19.020
funny about oh my gosh yes I suck at

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:22.260
this well I'm a comedian basically you

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:25.140
know I don't go to the gym and then it's

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:26.490
also like challenge yourself because I

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:28.080
am I am helping communities getting

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.250
shapes like through challenge them

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:30.840

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.610

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:35.850
doing true like entertain like I'm here

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:37.380
to entertain me don't [ __ ] bore me

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:40.950
yeah you know so but it it's you can see

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:42.300
how how it affects people it changes

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:45.240
them immediately and it's and it is to

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.240
not try I'm not trying to double back to

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.700
this but it is almost a mystical

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:53.010
experience for them like it's a spirit

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:54.390
experience with them they're learned

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:57.660
they're almost opened up to a whole new

00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:58.920
because they wrote a narrative about

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.020
themselves like I can't work out I'm fat

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.330
yeah you know and now when they had this

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:05.340
like wait a second if I change my

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:08.730
mindset on working out that's all it is

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:10.200
yeah they're given themselves permission

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:14.550
to like let a part of themselves out I'm

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:16.619
silly exactly dude so that's so I'm in

00:40:16.619 --> 00:40:18.510
the tank literally I'm in the tank and

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:20.730
oh my gosh you have to have mystical

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:22.500
experiences and this is something you

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:23.910
just can do you have him if you're

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:24.869
sitting there like I don't to do with

00:40:24.869 --> 00:40:28.230
myself the edibles the tank whatever you

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:29.700
need to do the volcano Bay pens whatever

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.320
get yourself into a state where you're

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.320
kind of like whoa [ __ ] [ __ ] this is kind

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.720
of scary hit the tank ride it out and

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.190
just literally just shut your mind off

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:40.470
and just just you know tried it just

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:41.580
before you get in there be like I'm

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.750
gonna think about the [ __ ] I'm doing

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:44.850
that I don't like and it's weird how

00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:47.010
your brain just starts to like hitting

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:48.150
you like what about this you're like

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:49.380
what the [ __ ] I've never even considered

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.750
that it just it's crazy so the idea is

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:53.880
then you use the vision you have find

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.980
Bay so if you're hitting tinder dates or

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:57.869
whatever and you're going to you know

00:40:57.869 --> 00:40:59.190
you're growing rather than as being like

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:00.900
I'm on a date and you're like trying to

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.490
be hot I guess for a chick whatever

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:04.350
you're doing you just go and meet her

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:05.880
and you're just like what are you trying

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.350
to do with yourself first of all they

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:15.869
never ever float though the ideas did

00:41:15.869 --> 00:41:17.160
you just [ __ ] it you just totally

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.660
straight man them you just kind of like

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:19.560
so what are you trying to do with

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.970
yourselves usually they're more so in

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:23.010
the seat of being like one of you what

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:25.770
are you doing press me yeah give me a

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:28.290
funny one-liner so if you just hit seem

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:29.190
like what are you trying to do they're

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:30.930
self well and you're like here's my

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:31.680
Vision Quest

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.090
and if they start doing stuff like well

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:34.950
if our visions don't align if we don't

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:36.300
have synergy between our visions and

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:39.930
this isn't going to work I'm telling you

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:44.790
what pimps also collect holy you could

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:47.820
you tell me who is so great in her one

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:52.000
[Laughter]

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:56.670
I'm telling you max otherwise it gets in

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:58.260
this weird power dynamic where it's like

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:00.690
you're showing up they're like what's

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:02.340
this like looking they're just assessing

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.290
you in terms of like you know whatever

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:06.030
the list of stuff is if that makes sense

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:07.700
it's kind of cynical but it's like I

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.960
feel like especially when you're rating

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.670
as you're older absolutely not it's not

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:13.620
cynical it's not cynical to point out

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:15.000
negativity and choose not to participate

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000
in it true that as minut as dude start

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.890
with the smallest negativities in your

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:21.300
life and put your [ __ ] foot down

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.310
truly I'm not [ __ ] participating in

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:25.080
it that's base that's what it is but you

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.580
go all it is do you know what you hit

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:27.630
the date and you're just kind of like

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:29.100
right away you come out and you're not

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:30.810
even being like usually the guys like

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:33.240
well you know I've been trying I'm

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.920
business I make a lot well I big nice

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.600
caught it so I did skip all that you can

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.130
skip all of it obviously if you pull up

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:39.480
and like a [ __ ] up man I mean I got

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:40.770
[ __ ] in a [ __ ] up van but you know

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:45.210
whatever two years it can be done for

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:47.130
sure but if you roll up on a chick and

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:49.170
you're just kind of like what are you

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:50.340
what are you doing with yourself and

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:51.840
like I don't even want to pursue this if

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.190
you don't have a vision that I can align

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:55.650
with this is our our unions pointless

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:57.450
cuz then it just devolves into that

00:42:57.450 --> 00:43:00.510
weird standard relationship of like man

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:02.580
no one knows what either person's

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.870
actually trying to do with themselves

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:05.760
you just start having weird power

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.320
struggles and being like you shouldn't

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:08.790
leave that there and you start fighting

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:10.650
for it just turns into a [ __ ]

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:12.180
[ __ ] that's kind of though when

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:15.390
every woman is looking for like do you

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:17.820
almost can't get denied like you show me

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:20.520
like take me with you a Vision Quest

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.100
yeah fighting over dumb [ __ ] I was like

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.430
don't tell me that like a woman is

00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:30.690
looking for a in America in our you know

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:32.700
in our materialistic society like a

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:35.390
woman is looking for a guy to come and

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:38.250
sweep her out of her mundane existence

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:41.940
into something new and exciting and you

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:43.440
know a Vision Quest in the basement is

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.690
free for sure well it's also like you

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:47.070
know cuz you'd hear people be like you

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:48.030
know you think I'm just sitting I'm

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:49.080
waiting for you it's like even if you

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.370
have a regular ass [ __ ] job and

00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:51.930
you're out like doing the damn thing if

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:53.220
someone comes up and like I'm doing

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:54.360
something sick right now

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.800
they're obviously gonna like this is

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.660
awesome yeah so you know so yeah I do

00:43:57.660 --> 00:43:59.600
agree with you is that you leader and

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.280
say listen I don't [ __ ] with your dumb

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.410
friends that'd be pretty tell you yeah

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:05.210

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:07.160
hit them up and be like what are you

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.600
literally trying to do with yourself

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.190
because then like give it if a chick

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:11.750
gets a tailspin while you're like with

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:13.490
her and they're having like identity

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:25.400
nothing you have to stabilize Bay dude

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.590
if the stabilize Bay with biking joining

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:29.000

in reality just trying to attain the

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.340
vision which is [ __ ] you know crazy oh

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:35.810
it's awesome way to live when you get a

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:37.970
base spinning out and then she goes to

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:39.860
report back to [ __ ] HQ with her

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:41.840
[ __ ] gaggle around her and they're

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.630
all like they want to exacerbate it cuz

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:46.790
that's how that's how lady circles lean

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:49.190
dude they like they they're they're like

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:50.600

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:57.440
cheat on your boy he's now you deserve

00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.030
it things aren't going your way

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:05.120
let's have wine as their life gets worse

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.170
the friends around them are like this

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:09.260
feels good to us temporarily it is your

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:10.190
turn to spin out

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:12.170
that's the darkness bro and you're I

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:13.790
think you're 100% right people don't

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:16.640
want to hear that at all but 100% that's

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:17.630
all you have to let them know right away

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:19.160
that you don't respect your friends

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:21.770
because if see here's here's where a lot

00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:24.680
of guys mess up mmm they try to impress

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:28.190
this girl by showing her how he can be

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:30.020
cool with her friends so now he's

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:32.780
acquiescent to that friend group so that

00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:36.050
friend group to the girl now seems more

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:38.150
powerful because like if he's acquiesce

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:39.920
into it like I guess me going to them

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:40.700
for advice

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:42.710

Bella pink you know it didn't feel like

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.440

it's like a cosmically sexual experience

Sydney definitely didn't know hander

00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:07.250

yeah so it's like you can it's so it's

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:29.089
like the craziest thing it's like almost

00:51:29.089 --> 00:51:31.280
like a kegel thing I guess the best way

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:34.060
to describe it but you can feel like the

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:37.220
it's it's a much like what I'm when I'm

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:39.500
[ __ ] or jerking off like I don't feel

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:42.109
the the things that are pumping out the

00:51:42.109 --> 00:51:54.109
come yeah yeah it's almost like you you

00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.970
mind

00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:58.280
manipulate those whoa yeah something I

00:51:58.280 --> 00:51:59.960
would imagine that like you were started

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:05.240
playing I was the first one to be like

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.160
you can't have nut you can't bust a nut

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.630
without touching your dick I was like

00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:11.180
sorry just doesn't work I was in there

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:13.250
and I you know maybe I was [ __ ] I might

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:14.690
even [ __ ] upwards I might have been

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:21.349
frosted a little I was thrusting to the

00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:23.089
point where you know as much thrust as

00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:24.260
you get from squeezing your butt cheeks

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:25.730
that's all I wasn't I wasn't coming I

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:27.050
was in jackhammering from the bottom

00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:29.270
dude yeah I was just pinching my butt

00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:32.050
cheeks a little bit

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:35.589
[Laughter]

00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:39.650
Ginuwine [ __ ] a space go just meet her

00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:41.060
in the middle bro that's all I was just

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:42.410
being a gentleman didn't meet her in the

00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:44.750
middle yeah dude I'm telling you it

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:46.880
sounds so ridiculous but I the prop the

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:50.000
fact that I got a boner I already try to

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.380
replicate this and I wasn't I wasn't

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.329
visualizing anything it just felt like

00:52:53.329 --> 00:52:55.970
there was like a I get very loosely felt

00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:58.040
like there oh sure it was your bird near

00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:59.990
the surface of the water going in and

00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:01.910
out of the surface like bobbing up and

00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:03.980
down it's possible DJ you were [ __ ]

00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:05.450
you were [ __ ] the surface tension

00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:07.640
yeah that's very possible do that that's

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:11.359
that is a water jerk that's right whoa

00:53:11.359 --> 00:53:13.910
so when I said the reason why I ended up

00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:17.030
even trying it is to go back to what Tim

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:21.440
butterly was saying earlier we were

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:22.190
watching what we're talking about

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:27.319
science first of all the guy dropped the

00:53:27.319 --> 00:53:38.150
Apple [ __ ] a bathtub we're watching a

00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:40.250
real sex was like years ago in common

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:42.920
you know like decades ago and there was

00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:46.069
a woman that was claiming to be able to

00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:49.280
have hands-free orgasms and it was like

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:50.660
the whole entire episode was about that

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:53.569
and it was like if she can do it I can

00:53:53.569 --> 00:53:55.430
do it for sure and I was like you can't

00:53:55.430 --> 00:54:02.380
do that she fought she witness well okay

00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:08.210
first when she watched the first affair

00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:12.650
hold on I needed I needed a witness rail

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:15.710
sure it was it was a challenge that she

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:18.619
issued like I couldn't do it and then

00:54:18.619 --> 00:54:20.599
have her come in the room honor code did

00:54:20.599 --> 00:54:23.390
it true that the first one had to be

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:24.710
seen but I did take that into

00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:26.480
consideration because it was horny as

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:34.130
[ __ ] I probably almost did just now

00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:36.920
I mean dude that's a high it's still

time

00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:07.960
I don't think I wouldn't be shocked if

00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:09.069

was quite a bit of an effort but the

00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:20.170
whole whole thing that I'd love to do

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:21.550
this just like sitting under a waterfall

00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:23.349
letting it like crest over my shoulder

00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:25.839
it's like a small waterfall like just

00:57:25.839 --> 00:57:27.550
letting the water drape over my

00:57:27.550 --> 00:57:29.230
shoulders I'm just hands-free coming

00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:31.359
under it yeah I'll stick with that my

00:57:31.359 --> 00:57:32.859
version of this is I try to give myself

00:57:32.859 --> 00:57:35.290
a clicks and hand job you know clicks in

00:57:35.290 --> 00:57:37.150
no it's like the person who just rubs

00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:38.800
the bottom of the shaft and they dude is

00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:44.380
like and eventually comes yeah yeah well

00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:46.390
not when I met Ansley I was like super

00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:50.859
into basically a college juvenile

00:57:50.859 --> 00:57:52.480
version of the same stuff I'm into now

00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:54.069
but I was really into being able to

00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:56.890
control my mind I manipulate reality so

00:57:56.890 --> 00:58:00.569
and I Ansley to back to verify this I

00:58:00.569 --> 00:58:03.040
swear to God I invented the limp all

00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:05.020
breathing method in college and I was

00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:06.700
trying to get antsy to do what would you

00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:08.829
put specifically mean like a breath yeah

00:58:08.829 --> 00:58:10.089
the the deep breathing to hold the

00:58:10.089 --> 00:58:12.089
breath and like I noticed that it could

00:58:12.089 --> 00:58:14.940
it changed something in me and I could

00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:18.280
raise and lower my body temperature and

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:22.119
like so all of her she lived in a suite

00:58:22.119 --> 00:58:24.849
and you know we're at a college yeah

00:58:24.849 --> 00:58:26.020
we're like everybody was trying to run

00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:27.760
experiments to see if I can actually do

00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:31.210
it so it was like hold ice in both hands

00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:34.569
and have one hand not melt the ice in

00:58:34.569 --> 00:58:36.430
one hand no dude

00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:38.800

00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:04.180

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.660
always whenever I get whacked out of my

01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:42.980
hair what's that stake here and I'm like

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:46.220
I can eat pretty much like ten years I'm

01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:48.020
pretty good like I can I can get food

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:50.420
basically I'm not gonna die yeah so what

01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:52.069
am one of my bug-out oh dude you can you

01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:56.540
can conceive insanity negative [ __ ]

01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:58.280
this funny all the internet speak and

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:01.790
then still live a pretty normal life mmm

01:03:01.790 --> 01:03:05.150
but my every everyday right now is

01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:07.520
dedicated to me not living out the rest

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.230
of my life the way that way cuz I was

01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:10.910
supposed to I'm completely genetically

01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:13.670
and sociologically designed to live a

01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:16.670
[ __ ] internet hater cornball life not

01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:20.089
having to do [ __ ] only those people and

01:03:20.089 --> 01:03:22.220
you know those people only really exist

01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:24.230
because we lack mystical experience

01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:27.349
anymore and that makes people devalue

01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:30.319
human connection right so when there was

01:03:30.319 --> 01:03:31.620
a time I

01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:34.470
and again I'm like I'm projecting okay

01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:36.450
and like we hold on on to Jack Brothers

01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:37.500
we call Alec we're getting I'm getting

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.120
in the writers room I don't know I can't

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.200
happened up in the back this up but I

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.910
think I'm right about this sure so at a

01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:43.680
time when there was there were mystical

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:46.530
experiences like the people that were

01:03:46.530 --> 01:03:48.180
negative like constantly dishing out

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:49.590
negativity they kept that [ __ ] to

01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:51.270
himself and I went into a corner of the

01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:52.530
village you just never [ __ ] with

01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:54.210
anybody there's no yeah no one was

01:03:54.210 --> 01:03:56.160
[ __ ] with that yeah the [ __ ] out

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.170
again we're not doing that and you know

01:03:58.170 --> 01:04:00.450
like do you sound [ __ ] good I feel

01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:02.520
right now don't try to break my spirits

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.410
yeah but now that we have such a

01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:07.230
dilution of human connection those

01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:09.240
people just exist amongst us and they

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.130
trick us into thinking that they're okay

01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:15.320
and worthwhile people as well and so

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:18.870
it's hard in a society where my god

01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:22.020
but we're integrated so but I say we

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:23.640
it's like people who are about a

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.290
mystical experience and people who are

01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:26.810
being negatively where it integrated

01:04:26.810 --> 01:04:30.420
Society yeah and sometimes we have we

01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:31.860
get trained to kind of acquiesce to

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:33.260
these people cuz a lot of times like

01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:35.790
listen there are a lot of good teachers

01:04:35.790 --> 01:04:38.100
out there but a lot of times these

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:40.050
people find themselves in positions like

01:04:40.050 --> 01:04:41.940
teaching because they just they're not

01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:43.650
following a passion they just want to

01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:45.660
get a job real quick so then we get

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:47.970
trained to acquiesce to like negative

01:04:47.970 --> 01:04:51.060
[ __ ] haters yeah you know it's like

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:52.470
what's also funny too because we're not

01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:54.090
at this school I'm working at now I was

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:55.710
like I didn't get a teaching gig and I

01:04:55.710 --> 01:05:02.340
asked a guy teacher he was like no and

01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:04.440
there's a lot of yeah there teachers can

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.300
get pretty [ __ ] nasty miserable just

01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:09.300
terrible also - I remember being 24 and

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:12.060
being on YouTube and I was so [ __ ]

01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:14.520
ruthless dude if I saw anybody doing

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.440
anything about you're the [ __ ] sucks

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:17.850
what the [ __ ] you do and you're [ __ ]

01:05:17.850 --> 01:05:20.310
weird the one guy did call out he was

01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:21.810
being a pervert I stand by that but he

01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:23.280
was doing like tic TOCs and I was like

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:26.310
ticked he was commenting on some sort of

01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:28.260
weird video it was like girls deserve

01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:30.480
funny girls dancing video and he had

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:31.890
everyone's girl who's funny and one guy

01:05:31.890 --> 01:05:34.470
was like can I request another song and

01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:35.820
I like dude you're a [ __ ] pervert but

01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:37.680

would be on there just [ __ ] with

01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:40.830

01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:45.609
Roman

but I was definitely miserable like and

01:05:48.519 --> 01:05:50.049
it's funny too because looking back on

01:05:50.049 --> 01:05:52.450
it now I didn't realize that I was

01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:53.950
miserable I was just like the [ __ ]

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:57.339

01:05:57.339 --> 01:06:00.190
temporary adrenaline boost or like an

01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:03.099
endorphin boost after you really [ __ ] on

01:06:03.099 --> 01:06:04.599

01:06:29.019 --> 01:06:31.569
on the internet but because I you know I

01:06:31.569 --> 01:06:32.890

group before everyone just shredded each

01:06:37.690 --> 01:06:38.650
other every day yeah

01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:40.869
everyone had to share dass everyone was

01:06:40.869 --> 01:06:43.269
just so everyone was like we were like

01:06:43.269 --> 01:06:46.359
the [ __ ] training grounds like we're

01:06:46.359 --> 01:06:47.650
all the good fighters from now like

01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:50.109

01:06:50.109 --> 01:06:51.279

01:06:55.329 --> 01:06:57.220
buying something or I picked it up and I

01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:58.690
was like someone's gonna make fun of me

01:06:58.690 --> 01:06:59.799
for holding this thing I was well I was

01:06:59.799 --> 01:07:01.299

come up me like [ __ ] yeah yeah yeah

01:07:13.299 --> 01:07:14.859
exactly you grew up like that if people

01:07:14.859 --> 01:07:16.359
just constantly shredding you it's like

01:07:16.359 --> 01:07:18.400
it's tight because you become kind of a

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:19.930
Jedi in that level it's true competition

01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:22.359
it's not like backhanded it's not

01:07:22.359 --> 01:07:23.980
passive-aggressive it was outright

01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:26.019
aggression and you had to compete so

01:07:26.019 --> 01:07:27.640
even if you were like a fat kid but you

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:29.619
were like kind of a [ __ ] and could

01:07:29.619 --> 01:07:31.930
be funny and that's a lot of like fat

01:07:31.930 --> 01:07:33.369
[ __ ] on the internet say things

01:07:33.369 --> 01:07:34.989
that make me laugh oh yeah they're also

01:07:34.989 --> 01:07:37.630
poisoning themselves true yeah so do the

01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:38.799
[ __ ] gym kids boy yeah it is a

01:07:38.799 --> 01:07:40.480
poisonous way to go dude so that's

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:41.680
that's basically what I was at I was

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.749
sitting there I was just like damn dude

01:07:43.749 --> 01:07:45.819
weirdoes you know you need to be a neo

01:07:45.819 --> 01:07:48.489
or Agent Smith dude and that's it what a

01:07:48.489 --> 01:07:51.460
great dude doesn't want to be a neo so

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:53.019
you'd be neo agents and it is true

01:07:53.019 --> 01:07:55.839
because it tend to be more Neos there

01:07:55.839 --> 01:07:57.190
tend to be more Agent Smith kicking

01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:57.860
around being

01:07:57.860 --> 01:07:59.330
what are you doing do you make money

01:07:59.330 --> 01:08:04.100
with it yeah it's like bro what the [ __ ]

01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:05.330
does it have to do with you I used to

01:08:05.330 --> 01:08:06.620
try to I used to try to come to an

01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:07.870
understanding with these people though

01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:09.950
that's what frustrates to be the most

01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:13.820
like the time I spent trying to let

01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:15.020
those people know like look I don't have

01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:16.160
a problem with the way you live your

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:16.760
life

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.760
I just think different yeah it do it was

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:22.340
just waste of time I just all that's all

01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:25.040
I really was trying to get across but

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.660
coming back from them was just how do

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:28.400
you not end every argument with I was in

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:39.620
a coma and I can come hands-free now dr.

01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:46.280
Mann hands what also gets into how

01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:48.200
people think we're like super distinct

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:49.460
separate entities but we're way more

01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:51.350
permeable we're like I can just be going

01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:53.180
about my day so I can big [ __ ] and I'm

01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:55.100
like wow God what the [ __ ] is that about

01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:57.020
and it's like people think they're like

01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:58.460
these were these we're like we're like

01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:00.290
totally separate and it's do we kind of

01:09:00.290 --> 01:09:02.390
have for the most part access to each

01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:04.940
other's like nervous system we don't

01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:06.260
appreciate that anymore so I'm saying

01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:08.000
like that that's what having spiritual

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.500
connections make you appreciate about

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.330
each other the fact that there are these

01:09:11.330 --> 01:09:13.340
weird neural connections that can't be

01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:16.550
explained but definitely exists so do

01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:19.190
you think we lost if we if we did have

01:09:19.190 --> 01:09:20.510
it at one point and we've lost it how

01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:35.870
long ago do you think it was 1994 what

01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:37.520
do you say lost what do you love because

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.540
like no one's been doing anything

01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:40.700
mystical for the past you know like

01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:43.460
2,000 years I think when the Catholic

01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:44.780
Church came around and like cut

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:45.950
everyone's heads off he made it all

01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:47.870
super [ __ ] lame they did well

01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:49.550
obviously - he what what do you need the

01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:50.570
Catholic Church for if you're like

01:09:50.570 --> 01:09:52.880
almost meet that some guys like here

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:54.440
give me 10% of your income and he's like

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:55.820
I'll just eat that thing and like bug

01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:56.810
out in the woods for a couple days

01:09:56.810 --> 01:10:01.220
they're like what's that yeah so did the

01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:02.540
Mayans they went around all of the mines

01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:04.610
were the - were into head cut not their

01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:06.260
sack their sacrifice there are some

01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:07.490
people like to say like all they just

01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:08.450
made that you don't know they were

01:10:08.450 --> 01:10:10.340
sacrificing that's that's kind of like

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.330
our quest

01:10:11.330 --> 01:10:15.830
like Angela and I our new quest is to

01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:18.680
bring back spiritual experiences no I

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:20.210
mean like the whole our whole last

01:10:20.210 --> 01:10:21.440
episode of two Jack brothers was

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:24.980
basically like this talk but instead of

01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:26.750
using mystical experiences we were

01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:28.520
talking about bringing back spiritual it

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:32.720
was also [ __ ] but what we figured out a

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:40.100
good reason for to bring now since we're

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:42.140
an Age of Aquarius series it's you can't

01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:44.030
even stop it yeah no I didn't stop it

01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:47.360
it's coming to like water we got to

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:49.640
bring it in it's coming beware the man

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.680
holding water it's like the Christian

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.360
era is over dude I hate to break it to

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:54.650
people you know you still be a Christian

01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:57.020
do your thing but you know you're on the

01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:58.220
end of it you're on the tail end of an

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:00.410
eon dude what do you think what do you

01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:02.360
think the Age of Aquarius then is going

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:04.970
to usher in psychedelics yeah

01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:07.520
psychedelics yeah I think I think people

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.710
will start once they become they're

01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:11.210
already becoming decriminalized and once

01:11:11.210 --> 01:11:13.190
like there's gonna be the next 20 years

01:11:13.190 --> 01:11:14.630
people gonna set up like retreats

01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:16.460
they're gonna combine Western science so

01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:18.320
like they can truly measure they could

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:19.850
take a lot of the anxiety out of it by

01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:21.980
like they could do the test to be like

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:24.980
no you are 100% safe BAM go do the same

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:26.480
yeah I had like a Normie friend post

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:28.270
something about like a psilocybin study

01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:30.680
and I was like yeah it's actually pretty

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:31.970
tight and then I was like oh by the way

01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:33.530
my buddy convinced me to do mushrooms

01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:35.570
every day for two months last year my

01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:37.000
life's never gonna be the same

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.970
I'm Tony dude I I think this is gonna be

01:11:39.970 --> 01:11:43.040
it's the only thing that makes sense in

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:47.120
terms of because like most ideologies

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:49.250
end up getting perverted by people's

01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:52.010
like let's say like they're in impulses

01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:54.170
so you can have like dude I I'm with a

01:11:54.170 --> 01:11:56.090
bunch of social justice warriors their

01:11:56.090 --> 01:11:57.800
whole thing's inclusivity but it's like

01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:00.440
if you try to be if you try to think

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:02.690
you're you have access to an idea that's

01:12:02.690 --> 01:12:05.090
just all good like we're just inclusive

01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:06.280
we're the ones doing the right stuff

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:09.050
what happens is is that like you're just

01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:12.110
subconsciously you're just gonna reenact

01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:13.520
the thing that you're against you don't

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:15.020
I mean like yeah so basically they

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:16.490
they're like we're so good and then

01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:17.780
they'll be like we'll study a theorist

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:19.220
and they're like he's of course he's an

01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:21.500
arrogant white man and you're like yeah

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.930
uh-huh that's weird that's a weird hang

01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:25.250
out this I mean this guy has

01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:26.810
volumes of [ __ ] stuff to talk about

01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:28.940
and do the in literally I'm in a class

01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:31.400
where for 10 solid minutes people are

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:32.900
like well you know how arrogant white

01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:35.060
old men can be and it's like what the

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:37.040
[ __ ] are you guys it's like it's an

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:38.690
uncle table dude I'm like I've been in

01:12:38.690 --> 01:12:40.670
this city I've been here at a

01:12:40.670 --> 01:12:42.590
construction site with a bunch of uncles

01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:43.910
talking about Puerto Ricans and it's the

01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:45.440
same way you talk Porto Ricans there's

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:47.240
someone's like I got a [ __ ] say it

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.890
man and they just go say something about

01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:50.930
them being Puerto Rican you that's the

01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:52.400
same thing I'm just with young white

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.590
chicks so we're like white man that's

01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:55.970
like there's like naive and they don't

01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:57.440
understand that they're they are just

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.720
playing like the b-side of a domination

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:02.030
game yeah that's all history is is just

01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:03.860
like people taking turns dominating and

01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:05.480
now that like they're getting a little

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:07.910
bit of like social say they're getting

01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:09.680
towards the top of like the hierarchy

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:10.940
and when they get to the top picker be

01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:12.590
like oh we're dominating everyone but

01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:15.260
this is actually pretty sick well then

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:16.760
that's the thing if you have an ideology

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:19.370
you can in theory be like this all makes

01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:20.870
sense but when you're like you know

01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:22.820
there's it like it is ego and

01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:24.680
psychoanalysis the it is just your

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:26.750
animal impulses to like tribalism and

01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:28.130
just kind of domination all this stuff

01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:30.830
while you're like yeah we're so we're

01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:32.300
just inclusive or that you have all

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:34.280
these weird impulses we're like you're

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:36.320
now like building hierarchies around

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.730
like who's the biggest social justice

01:13:37.730 --> 01:13:39.650
water like all that human behavior just

01:13:39.650 --> 01:13:41.480
emerges subconsciously and plays out in

01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:43.160
like a really ugly way and that's why

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:44.510
you know you had like communism they're

01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:46.040
all just like oh we're the boss now like

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:48.620
exactly what you said they're like yeah

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:50.780
we're in charge now but we're good and

01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:52.670
we should be in charge and yeah everyone

01:13:52.670 --> 01:13:55.760
who disagrees dies literally it's like

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:57.800
it to me seems inescapable where there's

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.240
there was at one I figured who it was it

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:01.100
was a civil rights guy who was like if

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:03.410
you draw a small circle to keep me out

01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:05.060
of it I'm gonna draw a bigger circle and

01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:06.860
include you and the people I feel like

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.480
I'm with they're like taking that small

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:09.950
circle and being like man we're gonna

01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:14.380
put it on us now it's uh it was like

01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:16.070
articulating this edger as you're

01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:19.970
talking but so you have these people who

01:14:19.970 --> 01:14:22.490
are like these soldiers because they're

01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:25.910
not they're not really inclusive but we

01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:27.410
know that they're not inclusive yeah but

01:14:27.410 --> 01:14:30.380
it's uh I keep talking let me come back

01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:33.560
to this go you know basically oh so this

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.390
is what I was saying so I think

01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:36.620
psychedelics will because like all the

01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:38.550
ideologies kind of fall apart just cuz

01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:39.930
our human nature kind of like gets

01:14:39.930 --> 01:14:41.670
embedded in them and Fox mob which I

01:14:41.670 --> 01:14:43.140
guess could happen I guess it does

01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:44.820
happen but I just feel like there's

01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:46.950
something inherent in people using kind

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:48.450
of psychedelics where like it does kind

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:49.710
of flat and here you go enough to where

01:14:49.710 --> 01:14:51.990
like it's hard to key if you're like in

01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.830
a circus people

01:14:52.830 --> 01:14:55.650
yeah so the human connection that they

01:14:55.650 --> 01:14:59.370
have now is is narrowed right so they're

01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:02.370
losing actual human connection they're

01:15:02.370 --> 01:15:05.220
narrowing it to this like this is anger

01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:07.410
and vitriol towards a thing sure right

01:15:07.410 --> 01:15:11.160
and so it's like I saw something not you

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:14.010
see how you see it you see cuz uh like

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:15.300
like that spiritual connection like

01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:17.010
those they're like spiritual emotions

01:15:17.010 --> 01:15:18.600
right like being impressed by something

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.070
it's kind of like a spiritual experience

01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:23.190
it's moving like once and like I I know

01:15:23.190 --> 01:15:25.530
Tim I know Matt like I I know you guys

01:15:25.530 --> 01:15:28.050
are impressed by small things like

01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:29.550
that's one of the things that I

01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:31.320
appreciate about the two of you it's

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:33.930
like it's like I see em I see it on a

01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:36.270
regular basis especially with butterly

01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:38.160
at jujitsu and being impressed with like

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.860
little kids just doing nothing you know

01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:42.450
which I'm impressed too and I you know

01:15:42.450 --> 01:15:45.060
I'm so tuned in to [ __ ] appreciating

01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:46.620
little things that you could mistake me

01:15:46.620 --> 01:16:10.440
for a [ __ ] person to come back with

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.780
that being said it's like they're just

01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:15.450
creating like you know this lack of a

01:16:15.450 --> 01:16:17.640
spiritual experience and it's creating

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:20.040
hate it's like because you know like

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:22.410
like happiness better than nothing it is

01:16:22.410 --> 01:16:25.200
either an emotional lacunae or you're

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:28.230
mad all the time and shittin yeah yeah

01:16:28.230 --> 01:16:31.020
it's an attachment so here's what I saw

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:33.240
that made me get on how they're not

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:36.120
impressed by anything so what's watching

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:37.530
so stressed is where you're talking on

01:16:37.530 --> 01:16:40.830
something and they mentioned how like

01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:43.080
when slavery was and there or something

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:44.550
anyways like what wasn't that a good

01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:46.650
thing and the guy was like no it wasn't

01:16:46.650 --> 01:16:47.970
a good thing it should have ended sooner

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:50.310
and I say whoa

01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:52.290
not only was that a good thing

01:16:52.290 --> 01:16:54.180
actually kind of impressive like to just

01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:57.150
like go against cultural you know

01:16:57.150 --> 01:16:59.430
ideology and we're [ __ ] ending this

01:16:59.430 --> 01:17:00.510
and we'll fight you for it

01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:03.300
you know it's like come on man I said

01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:04.860
that in my school when people said that

01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:08.760
I support slavery so yeah like you guys

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:10.770
are doing actually we could use a little

01:17:10.770 --> 01:17:13.710
bit more slavery I would say the same

01:17:13.710 --> 01:17:14.820
thing I'm like you guys are thinking

01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:16.500
about slavery in the abstract you guys

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:18.000
are dealing with it now but if you were

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.500
like if one day they were like oh if

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:21.540
you're not a vegan you're akin to a

01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:23.880
slave owner everyone will be like but

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:27.120
everyone [ __ ] I don't know I get ISM

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:32.640
fifteen years ago well no and it's not

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:34.530
obviously well yeah it's obviously not

01:17:34.530 --> 01:17:36.540
the same thing but it's like it's I

01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:38.040
guess it's something that like again

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:39.630
like you're saying it was the cultural

01:17:39.630 --> 01:17:41.310
norm and for people to go against it and

01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:43.020
again the people who are basically

01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:44.790
sucking up the cultural norm at the

01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:46.290
straw to be like we'd be the ones who

01:17:46.290 --> 01:17:48.930
wouldn't do it it's like no they ended

01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:52.590
slavery without the internet true how do

01:17:52.590 --> 01:17:54.390
they there was no way to find the other

01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:55.800
people that you could say no more

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:58.560
slavery to true that you couldn't put up

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.270
an anonymous post anywhere you had to

01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:02.190
[ __ ] like ask a guy to put down a

01:18:02.190 --> 01:18:03.630
tool be like listen to the slavery

01:18:03.630 --> 01:18:08.250
things kind of weird don't shoot you

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:12.930
with like a tennis ball-sized boy your

01:18:12.930 --> 01:18:19.920
bones explode from everything that's a

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:21.120
zoomed out perspective and that's

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:23.760
literally I would argue that it's kind

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:25.170
of a perspective that you know it's a no

01:18:25.170 --> 01:18:26.820
very open-minded perspective to be like

01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:28.920
yeah well like think about what like

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:30.840
that time to be like yeah we're gonna

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.790
stop it's so it's crazily impressive

01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:35.550
well and nobody nobody really people

01:18:35.550 --> 01:18:36.960
think they have an appreciation for the

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:38.280
time period but they don't because they

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.680
take every racial discomfort right and

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:43.010
they look at it through the lens of

01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:47.580
slavery and like this is like three days

01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:49.050
ever talking about we see I don't mean

01:18:49.050 --> 01:18:50.700
it cuz I know some people listen to the

01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:52.620
podcast and I long yeah I'm not trying

01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:54.090
to regurgitate [ __ ] but it's just like

01:18:54.090 --> 01:18:58.200
this isn't floating so but um I thought

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:03.810
what was I just saying I'm like hi about

01:19:03.810 --> 01:19:05.460
how slavery should come back

01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:10.260
exactly so it'll be a situation right so

01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:12.510
what about things that are racially dis

01:19:12.510 --> 01:19:16.890
so if say safe a black an older black

01:19:16.890 --> 01:19:19.950
man yells at four black guys to turn

01:19:19.950 --> 01:19:21.210
down their music uh-huh

01:19:21.210 --> 01:19:23.100
nobody thinks anything of it yeah an

01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:25.170
older white guy yells at four black guys

01:19:25.170 --> 01:19:27.420
to turn down their music now people are

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:28.470
looking at that through the lens of

01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:29.820
slavery they're looking at it through

01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:32.460
the eye that white guy being a master in

01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:34.350
these black guys being a slave unless

01:19:34.350 --> 01:19:38.850
it's Clint Eastwood but yes I agree

01:19:38.850 --> 01:19:41.040
that's that's yeah and it's like it's

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:42.960
not something that's not racist that

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:44.550
guy's not being racist because you're

01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:46.860
uncomfortable with the imagery that

01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:49.110
you're putting in your own mind he's not

01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:50.970
a slave master those kids are slaves

01:19:50.970 --> 01:19:53.760
like that every racially uncomfortable

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:56.460
thing doesn't isn't racist yes just

01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:57.690
they're putting it through the lens

01:19:57.690 --> 01:19:59.580
they're literally put it through the

01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:02.940
lens of well if that guy was a slave

01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:04.380
master knows were slaves that would be a

01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:07.110
really rude thing he just said no it's

01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:08.880
true that something that people I don't

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.590
think are ready to start thinking like

01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:12.330
that for the most part but I think

01:20:12.330 --> 01:20:14.160
you're right now my to Jack come to to

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:18.720
deck bones we're thinking like that it's

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:20.340
Black History Month and I mean I'm in a

01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:23.430
99% black high school and I'm working

01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:25.560
it's like it's for me it's like a

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.450
[ __ ] like haunted hayride right every

01:20:27.450 --> 01:20:28.680
time I turn a corner it'll just be like

01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:30.420
a poster of a black guy drink from

01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:40.530
whites only water fountain take it all

01:20:40.530 --> 01:20:43.320
back take it on back but but yeah

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:47.550
there's uh yeah I mean there's also the

01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:48.870
whole thing of Black History Month is

01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:50.550
it's split because it's like you know

01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:52.620
kids I think are genuinely excited to be

01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:54.420
like like black kids are like yeah this

01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:55.590
is also we get to talk this is stuff

01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:56.670
we're interested in we get to talk about

01:20:56.670 --> 01:20:58.350
then you do get some even who are like

01:20:58.350 --> 01:20:59.520
why the [ __ ] do we have Black History

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:00.750
Month anyway it should just be like a

01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:02.490
normal you should just be integrated

01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:04.980
into all the rest of them say that for

01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:09.300
every class they do though I have a

01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:12.190
calculator what am i doing man

01:21:12.190 --> 01:21:15.790
oh that was me oh yeah you do uh it

01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:17.110
would it would be I think it would be

01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:21.400
helpful not only for black kids but just

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:26.950
for a more honest view of history of

01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:40.110
history there was outside of Christopher

01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:42.130
[Music]

01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:47.290
[Laughter]

01:21:51.970 --> 01:21:56.550
[Laughter]

01:22:04.690 --> 01:22:08.400
[Laughter]

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:13.300
walked out of a bar some guys like holy

01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:15.220
[ __ ] they're like you saw him he had a

01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:34.300
musky yeah I mean that'll be Black

01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:35.800
History Month in thirty years we'll be

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:42.490
looked at kind of like what you know but

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:44.230
again like who's gonna be the one to be

01:22:44.230 --> 01:22:46.870
like I we're done we're not doing it

01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:47.170
this year

01:22:47.170 --> 01:22:49.810
what the [ __ ] in thirty years every

01:22:49.810 --> 01:22:51.370
month gonna be Black History Month well

01:22:51.370 --> 01:22:52.540
they could just teach history because

01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:54.730
there's like critical theory which is

01:22:54.730 --> 01:22:56.110
that's like they're really like you were

01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:58.090
saying it's only looks through things in

01:22:58.090 --> 01:22:59.650
terms of power relationships where it's

01:22:59.650 --> 01:23:02.860
like any racial issue is a legacy of

01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:04.840
slavery like no matter what yeah so it's

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:06.550
like you and then you have like you know

01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:07.990
Catholic grade school history that's

01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:09.430
just like now dude we were actually

01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:12.790
pretty nice to the Indians so you could

01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:14.410
just like merge them all together where

01:23:14.410 --> 01:23:16.270
it just gives you the 360 panoramic view

01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:17.920
where it's like yeah this was kind of

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.750
[ __ ] up this was kind of tight this

01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:21.610
was a [ __ ] up thing that for the time

01:23:21.610 --> 01:23:23.200
if you think about it now really wasn't

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.850
it you know what I mean so it's like it

01:23:24.850 --> 01:23:25.510
could rework

01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:26.710
in a way that just kind of includes

01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:28.090
everything so we're not watching it

01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:29.530
being like these [ __ ] I was

01:23:29.530 --> 01:23:30.700
actually more thinking from the angle

01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:34.600
that like mainstream culture has been

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:37.750
slowly absorbing black culture but the

01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:39.460
pace is like picking up now because of

01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:41.260
like white girls on Twitter and in 30

01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:43.360
years it's it's gonna be like black

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:44.470
people aren't gonna be able to create

01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:46.750
new black culture fast enough to outrun

01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:50.050
mainstream culture Wow we we need so

01:23:50.050 --> 01:23:53.260
black culture is black culture can end

01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:54.790
all of this [ __ ] that's going on

01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:56.620
with like social justice and inclusivity

01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:58.900
and getting rid of Black History Month

01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:00.700
is a step in the right direction hear me

01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:00.970
out

01:24:00.970 --> 01:24:03.220
so the fact that we have Black History

01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:05.740
Month is giving the message especially

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:07.570
to the social justice warriors that

01:24:07.570 --> 01:24:10.840
there still needs to be special spaces

01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:15.070
carved out for certain groups in order

01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:19.120
to be inclusive yeah which is completely

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:23.830
backwards right 100% so like right so I

01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:27.190
just saw this on the way up here I was

01:24:27.190 --> 01:24:34.030
watching this Anthony Brian Logan he's a

01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:37.000
hard black conservative nerd - yes on a

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.100
bashing nerd which I don't even know I'm

01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:40.720
like definitely some I'm definitely more

01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:42.220
moderate but I love saying that I'm a

01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:43.930
black conservative is I'm a white black

01:24:43.930 --> 01:24:49.930
conservative I'm a Leo Dunston guy yeah

01:24:49.930 --> 01:24:50.860
he starts preaching

01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:54.820
oh I'm preaching now so he's covering

01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:56.200
the story of this black girl at the

01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:58.270
University of Virginia she's in a

01:24:58.270 --> 01:25:01.930
multicultural room on campus and she

01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:04.000
stands up and she makes this speech

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.740
about the fact that there are too many

01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:08.350
white people in this multicultural room

01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:11.080
it's making her uncomfortable and they

01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:12.970
should all know that this is the space

01:25:12.970 --> 01:25:15.910
for minorities and as a she caught

01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:19.570
herself a [ __ ] POC you know and it's

01:25:19.570 --> 01:25:22.690
like dude we gotta stop that cuz like

01:25:22.690 --> 01:25:26.170
that didn't look cool at all

01:25:26.170 --> 01:25:27.940
yeah but how I would not be able to

01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:30.220
resist if someone if I again if my

01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:31.870
wheels are spinning I'm like dude I can

01:25:31.870 --> 01:25:33.340
easily get all the way people out here

01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:36.340
right now I gotta try this

01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:39.429
I can't excuse me dude that would be

01:25:39.429 --> 01:25:40.989
hard not to wield that there needs to be

01:25:40.989 --> 01:25:42.550
some honesty around that be sure when I

01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:44.170
was in college like I went to you know

01:25:44.170 --> 01:25:46.360
Lafayette College thing four percent

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:49.809
minorities like two percent black and we

01:25:49.809 --> 01:25:52.479
would definitely you know I was always

01:25:52.479 --> 01:25:54.400
I'm always down with my people but like

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.380
if we're gonna [ __ ] you know get a

01:25:56.380 --> 01:25:58.570
little you know like mischievious like

01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:01.599
I'll [ __ ] do it yeah definitely

01:26:01.599 --> 01:26:03.999
plenty of times like sat around and like

01:26:03.999 --> 01:26:05.650
concocted ways to make white people feel

01:26:05.650 --> 01:26:07.479
uncomfortable for sure you know I don't

01:26:07.479 --> 01:26:08.469
understand how you would not do that

01:26:08.469 --> 01:26:10.539
dude all the time and like there would

01:26:10.539 --> 01:26:11.949
be sometimes I'd be doing it without my

01:26:11.949 --> 01:26:17.559
group there winging it you know why I'm

01:26:17.559 --> 01:26:20.139
doing this but it's fun that's why

01:26:20.139 --> 01:26:28.179
Sydney's really popular well there there

01:26:28.179 --> 01:26:29.920
is something to be said for being

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:32.619
outnumbered by people who don't look

01:26:32.619 --> 01:26:35.079
like you there is something to be like

01:26:35.079 --> 01:26:36.789
whenever I go visit Brittany's family in

01:26:36.789 --> 01:26:39.400
Chicago I'm in Chicago is like deadly

01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:40.989
surgeries like dead segregated where I'm

01:26:40.989 --> 01:26:43.329
literally the only white person around

01:26:43.329 --> 01:26:45.670
you go into like your first experience

01:26:45.670 --> 01:26:47.320
with all-black Walmart where it's like

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:49.420
the guy selling Comcast plans to black

01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:50.769
everyone working there as black every

01:26:50.769 --> 01:26:52.510
customers black yeah I went in there

neighborhood so they some saying at

01:27:01.539 --> 01:27:03.099

01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:12.699
name true that is true but it's also

01:27:12.699 --> 01:27:14.979
like a couple you can go a couple blocks

01:27:14.979 --> 01:27:17.260
over like I could walk to a different

01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:18.999
neighborhood the south side of Chicago

01:27:18.999 --> 01:27:21.820
is like it's like a megalopolis

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:26.530
it's a megalopolis it's like that you'd

01:27:26.530 --> 01:27:29.949
have to like you'd have to ride for like

01:27:29.949 --> 01:27:32.289
10 minutes before you're like oh [ __ ] a

01:27:32.289 --> 01:27:33.760
white person and it's so funny because

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.559
it's like you know I've been in Philly

01:27:35.559 --> 01:27:36.639
I've been in that situation to a mind

01:27:36.639 --> 01:27:37.659
like a bar or I'm the only white person

01:27:37.659 --> 01:27:40.059
Bob louder an area but here the south

01:27:40.059 --> 01:27:41.380
side of Chicago and I'm like I mean

01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:43.179
literally I mean I'm in all-black

01:27:43.179 --> 01:27:45.340
Walmart and then we were actually buying

01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:47.650
kool-aid for a family function yeah so

01:27:47.650 --> 01:27:49.840
now Brittany bought kool-aid in every

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:50.400
aisle

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:53.829
[Laughter]

01:27:53.829 --> 01:28:24.139
the only grab at the register I mean I'm

01:28:24.139 --> 01:28:25.729
like I'm all right and I the whole point

01:28:25.729 --> 01:28:27.530
of this is I was like there is something

01:28:27.530 --> 01:28:29.679
to be said for being like just the only

01:28:29.679 --> 01:28:32.119
person of your skin color in like an

01:28:32.119 --> 01:28:34.099
entire area as far as you can see it's a

01:28:34.099 --> 01:28:35.420
weird of cause people then you're

01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:37.249
getting the mind games they're like that

01:28:37.249 --> 01:28:39.229
guy staring at me am I just being weird

01:28:39.229 --> 01:28:40.639
because I'm the only white person you

01:28:40.639 --> 01:28:42.739
only mean so I don't know I was like for

01:28:42.739 --> 01:28:45.170
me I'm like you know I'm I wasn't really

01:28:45.170 --> 01:28:46.459
uncomfortable like that but that was the

01:28:46.459 --> 01:28:48.079
first time I was like act I was

01:28:48.079 --> 01:28:49.670
physically aware of I'm like I'm being

01:28:49.670 --> 01:28:50.989
weird right now they probably all just

01:28:50.989 --> 01:29:10.909
thought you're a producer and I'm like

01:29:10.909 --> 01:29:13.070
I'm in the drink aisle we're gonna

01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:15.170
kool-aid and we got sugar now and I was

01:29:15.170 --> 01:29:16.729
like what the [ __ ] you need sugar for

01:29:16.729 --> 01:29:18.320
you're getting kool-aid and dude I

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:19.789
literally people were like the whole

01:29:19.789 --> 01:29:24.079
wall she said she just started laughing

01:29:24.079 --> 01:29:25.550
she was like you [ __ ] idiot nerve I

01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:27.499
only ever had the instant kool-aid and

01:29:27.499 --> 01:29:30.349
I'm like I never made like I've had

01:29:30.349 --> 01:29:31.789
instant the stuff at the gas station

01:29:31.789 --> 01:29:33.979
squeeze bottle no she didn't eat sugar

01:29:33.979 --> 01:29:39.610
she need it too much too much sugar

01:29:42.369 --> 01:29:49.969
make a left for the diabetes side but

01:29:49.969 --> 01:29:51.559
yeah there is something to be said for

01:29:51.559 --> 01:29:53.800
that in terms of like being outnumbered

01:29:53.800 --> 01:30:01.550
in terms they all the same phrase like

01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:04.329
boy if you dog

01:30:09.190 --> 01:30:18.040
john malkovich go hey we're not gonna do

01:30:32.110 --> 01:30:34.610
dude if that was agent Smith I'd gladly

01:30:34.610 --> 01:30:38.300
give up my bitchin questions a touch me

01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:42.950
at a game just switch the Oracle just so

01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:54.920
I can walk around like oh no dude yeah

01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:57.350
man I don't even know my point was but

01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:59.660
yeah that is people do need to start

01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:06.260
chilling out and I'm diabetes I'm in a

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:08.420
school with a guy who's it's a picture

01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:10.040
of a guide like smiling in front of a

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:12.980
whites-only in the water but then it's

01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:55.370
like Black History Month and I'm like I

01:31:55.370 --> 01:31:58.490
got a look into the literature and that

01:31:58.490 --> 01:32:00.590
was like I have a theory I have a theory

01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:03.050
that what are the reasons that black

01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:04.430
people don't like drinking water now

01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:06.050
goes back to those water fountains

01:32:06.050 --> 01:32:08.270
really yeah because white people do not

01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:12.050
like drinking water I do not it's crazy

01:32:12.050 --> 01:32:13.730
it's like you know black people love

01:32:13.730 --> 01:32:16.169
being athletes and hatred

01:32:16.169 --> 01:32:19.530
we're serious okay I also think that

01:32:19.530 --> 01:32:20.969
that's why they don't use crosswalks and

01:32:20.969 --> 01:32:22.139
they walk really slow crossing the

01:32:22.139 --> 01:32:23.669
street it's like their first like the

01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:26.639
first like active like disobedience

01:32:26.639 --> 01:32:28.260
against like the structure that they

01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:29.760
learned I thought you're gonna see the

01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:37.409
first I thought you're saying they're so

01:32:37.409 --> 01:32:40.909
dehydrated there's having like a mirage

01:32:43.519 --> 01:32:47.570
I'll be walk with a limp will cramp

01:32:48.949 --> 01:32:51.959
disrupt traffic because it's like you

01:32:51.959 --> 01:32:53.099
know it's the mayor things set up

01:32:53.099 --> 01:32:54.659
against this I'm just gonna [ __ ] do

01:32:54.659 --> 01:32:57.570
this yeah I feel like if you were if you

01:32:57.570 --> 01:33:01.619
were so you know like a white racist do

01:33:01.619 --> 01:33:02.820
do you have that all like you know

01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:04.439
perpetuate yeah that like paint it down

01:33:04.439 --> 01:33:05.820
to you you're gonna walk around you know

01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:07.380
you're just gonna be like I doing [ __ ]

01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:08.699
like [ __ ] you I'm you know that's like

01:33:08.699 --> 01:33:09.840
something got to kind of keep under

01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:11.969
wraps you only if you're like a black

01:33:11.969 --> 01:33:14.010
dude who's being like fully like I'm

01:33:14.010 --> 01:33:16.469
oppressed that's never ended I'm still

01:33:16.469 --> 01:33:17.669
getting [ __ ] ofcourse you see a

01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:19.349
crosswalk you're like what this is just

01:33:19.349 --> 01:33:21.329
mechanism the [ __ ] oppressive machine

01:33:21.329 --> 01:33:27.689
respect [ __ ] this [ __ ] yeah wait white

01:33:27.689 --> 01:33:29.669
people also won't slowly across the

01:33:29.669 --> 01:33:32.149
streets there's a little bit full sprint

01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:34.909
agree without sprint car not excuse me

01:33:34.909 --> 01:33:38.429
sorry I know there's a lot of white guy

01:33:38.429 --> 01:33:40.199
in white chicks that are out there doing

01:33:40.199 --> 01:33:41.489
that but they do it a little bit

01:33:41.489 --> 01:33:43.380
differently and like Tim was saying when

01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:44.880
black people do it it is an act of

01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:46.649
rebellion the energy is definitely going

01:33:46.649 --> 01:33:48.209
towards the people in the car and you

01:33:48.209 --> 01:33:50.159
feel it right when white people do it

01:33:50.159 --> 01:33:52.919
because they it's about it they wanna

01:33:52.919 --> 01:33:54.329
beat they wanna like I don't want to be

01:33:54.329 --> 01:33:55.530
a part of this you know I'm not you know

01:33:55.530 --> 01:33:57.300
the energies going the other way

01:33:57.300 --> 01:33:59.309
black people definitely want you to know

01:33:59.309 --> 01:34:03.749
that they're walking yeah yeah I do

01:34:03.749 --> 01:34:05.989
agree there's also there is a lot of

01:34:05.989 --> 01:34:09.269
especially drechsel's campus dude a lot

01:34:09.269 --> 01:34:11.519
of some reason college kids [ __ ] walk

01:34:11.519 --> 01:34:16.260
across so slow [ __ ] yeah it's a

01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:18.599
rebellious age yeah it's like this is

01:34:18.599 --> 01:34:20.429
this the first time in their life that

01:34:20.429 --> 01:34:21.959
they get the truck they get to really

01:34:21.959 --> 01:34:25.079
actually manipulate their reality true

01:34:25.079 --> 01:34:27.030
because they don't have that their

01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:29.309
freezer in here I remember when I was

01:34:29.309 --> 01:34:29.940
going to Kyle

01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:33.930
I was like man I go to college start

01:34:33.930 --> 01:34:38.790
with the French accent like I was really

01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:50.940
I love damn it from the occasion what's

01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:53.640
for sure is a lot of the on whatever

01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:55.380
however you slice it and whenever you

01:34:55.380 --> 01:34:57.300
know whatever part of the the spectrum

01:34:57.300 --> 01:34:59.220
you're rocking from you start eating

01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:01.770
mushrooms and doing deep dives this [ __ ]

01:35:01.770 --> 01:35:03.570
hits the [ __ ] this [ __ ] falls apart of

01:35:03.570 --> 01:35:05.490
being like umm this and that and but

01:35:05.490 --> 01:35:07.590
like if you get like the burden is

01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:09.540
lifted dude yeah exactly

01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:12.150
that's my personal opinion this [ __ ]

01:35:12.150 --> 01:35:13.140
starts to dissolve

01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:15.000
you know these weird like artificial

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.980
boundaries and stuff well I would

01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:20.070
actually liken it to when we had our

01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:23.160
first child and I was like whoa there's

01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:25.080
so much [ __ ] I don't actually care about

01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:27.150
yeah but then it didn't reduce my stress

01:35:27.150 --> 01:35:29.220
at all I was just like the stuff that

01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:30.810
I'm obligated to do to take care of a

01:35:30.810 --> 01:35:33.090
family now shadows all the dads who hold

01:35:33.090 --> 01:35:34.920
the racism tight while having a kid like

01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:42.720
I got a passivity about me you had this

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:44.550
you're like oh what am i their dad's I

01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:45.530
can go through such an awe-inspiring

01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:51.930
experience and be like I think I want to

01:35:51.930 --> 01:35:53.370
come at you like arguing with like a

01:35:53.370 --> 01:35:55.920
boss or something like that and then I

01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:57.420
really I don't give it there's not a

01:35:57.420 --> 01:35:59.100
boss in the world I could care about

01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:00.990
sure at all I'll go through the motions

01:36:00.990 --> 01:36:04.230
to provide obviously and and then the

01:36:04.230 --> 01:36:06.000
mushrooms thing real it was like that

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.830
times 100 yeah what was that like for

01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:10.530
the queue we all had different setups we

01:36:10.530 --> 01:36:12.570
were in the office doing that yeah I was

01:36:12.570 --> 01:36:14.400
going to work every day how was it it

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:16.190
was great I was more productive

01:36:16.190 --> 01:36:20.550
I did weed mushrooms makes me a better

01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:22.140
dad definitely makes me a better

01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:25.530
employee did people know that people say

01:36:25.530 --> 01:36:26.520
anything like man you can really add up

01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:28.050
epicness there was one guy who caught me

01:36:28.050 --> 01:36:30.510
on weed one day what'd he say well he

01:36:30.510 --> 01:36:32.280
needed help with his

01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:35.950
that's so funny personal job this was

01:36:35.950 --> 01:36:38.140
actually I was I've always been an IT

01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:41.830
guy with a computer thing way too early

01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:43.990
in the morning for the day I had planned

01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:46.840
sure and I remember at one point he said

01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:48.190
something and I had to ask him to repeat

01:36:48.190 --> 01:36:50.320
it and I had I was sitting at his desk

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:51.940
while he was standing across from it and

01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:54.190
I was on his computer and I looked up at

01:36:54.190 --> 01:36:55.840
him and the light was right behind him

01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:58.840
so it was just double crunchy eyeballs

01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:01.750
oh and he was like he gave me a look

01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:03.550
that let me know and he was pretty high

01:37:03.550 --> 01:37:05.620
up in the company and he was it was just

01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:07.390
like I understand that you are partying

01:37:07.390 --> 01:37:09.010
way too hard right now well I think

01:37:09.010 --> 01:37:11.350
there's also a little bit of like go

01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:13.000
ahead young man from him it's kind of

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.050
like that's what you got bro

01:37:14.050 --> 01:37:15.670
I feel like IT guys are under like a

01:37:15.670 --> 01:37:17.440
special protected class we're all

01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:22.150
autistic yeah it's like it's like fat or

01:37:22.150 --> 01:37:23.950
pregnant for women that's like higher

01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:33.250
autistic right I'm sorry I'll never ask

01:37:33.250 --> 01:37:42.850
again never oh my god I asked once yeah

01:37:42.850 --> 01:37:45.760
dude I'm telling you man the spiritual

01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:47.500
experience is being put it's just it's

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:49.240
coming out of everybody dude it is it's

01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:51.340
really and that's dude today I'm sitting

01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:53.110
there so this is a thought I had it

01:37:53.110 --> 01:37:55.120
sounds kind of corny but I don't care it

01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:56.380
was like so I'm walking around I'm

01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:57.730
taking I take my breaks between like I'm

01:37:57.730 --> 01:37:59.290
seeing kids doing therapy and I'm like I

01:37:59.290 --> 01:38:00.730
usually take walks between them because

01:38:00.730 --> 01:38:01.810
it's like sometimes the shits just

01:38:01.810 --> 01:38:04.060
really kind of like ways you wanna be oh

01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:07.120
yes I'm taking a walk and there's out

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:08.980
nowhere I started thinking about same

01:38:08.980 --> 01:38:10.360
thing it's all my mind spiritual

01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:12.310
experiences on my damn dude I people

01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:13.690
just got to get way more explain more

01:38:13.690 --> 01:38:16.390
spiritual so and I don't even know where

01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:17.680
I started thinking about this so I

01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:20.020
started thinking about the concept of

01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:21.040
God like and people say like you know

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:22.900
they believe in God and I'm like it just

01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:25.450
dawned on me to say like well okay

01:38:25.450 --> 01:38:26.980
people say gods everything you know

01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:28.180
right they're like God is everything

01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:31.360
which is in a way if you have a

01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:32.830
relationship with God you just have a

01:38:32.830 --> 01:38:34.450
relationship with everything

01:38:34.450 --> 01:38:36.790
simultaneously which produces all does

01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:37.330
that make sense

01:38:37.330 --> 01:38:39.370
sure so it's like rather than being

01:38:39.370 --> 01:38:41.320
sucked into your own little world of

01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:43.659
like why me yeah you're walking around

01:38:43.659 --> 01:38:46.269
having a relationship with everything

01:38:46.269 --> 01:38:48.909
okay I could say that yeah in a way so

01:38:48.909 --> 01:38:50.530
and then if that's the case and you

01:38:50.530 --> 01:38:51.880
start going okay so it's everything's

01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:53.439
then you start every person you

01:38:53.439 --> 01:38:55.329
encounter you're treating with a certain

01:38:55.329 --> 01:38:57.610
level of respect because you're saying

01:38:57.610 --> 01:38:59.499
like you're not just some [ __ ] you're

01:38:59.499 --> 01:39:02.320
literally part of everything that I'm in

01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:04.449
all of and then treat that's basically a

01:39:04.449 --> 01:39:06.070
Western societies dictated office I

01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:07.479
can't go around killing people because

01:39:07.479 --> 01:39:10.449
they have a divine spark inside them you

01:39:10.449 --> 01:39:12.880
know try it like it I I believe in in

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:14.800
the wisdom of the Ancients right you

01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:17.590
know I get into that stuff yeah it's uh

01:39:17.590 --> 01:39:19.900
you know I've read some mysticism books

01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:21.280
and things like that so I've always been

01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:24.789
trying to reconcile the ancients and

01:39:24.789 --> 01:39:26.559
their wisdom towards the idea of

01:39:26.559 --> 01:39:28.869
blasphemy you know I don't know when the

01:39:28.869 --> 01:39:30.909
word blasphemy or the concept came into

01:39:30.909 --> 01:39:33.729
existence but it seems like it went hand

01:39:33.729 --> 01:39:38.130
in hand with the Bible I learned yeah so

01:39:38.130 --> 01:39:41.019
in like you said like if God is

01:39:41.019 --> 01:39:46.780
everything then we are also gods mm-hmm

01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:48.249
but just like you said like we're all

01:39:48.249 --> 01:39:51.130
part of the everything but you know you

01:39:51.130 --> 01:39:52.479
know you don't want to say we're also

01:39:52.479 --> 01:39:54.699
gods because of the that Lionel

01:39:54.699 --> 01:39:57.130
blasphemy so what what is that like was

01:39:57.130 --> 01:39:59.679
is blasphemy something that we need to

01:39:59.679 --> 01:40:02.289
like rein in ourselves or was that

01:40:02.289 --> 01:40:03.880
something that was put upon us to reign

01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:05.769
us in you know because you can't control

01:40:05.769 --> 01:40:07.539
people you can't convince people that

01:40:07.539 --> 01:40:10.689
they have to you know live a certain way

01:40:10.689 --> 01:40:15.340
if no if I'm a god mm-hmm exactly I'll

01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:16.840
live my way and if it works and I'm not

01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:19.300
hurting people then that's okay like why

01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:21.340
should I have to acquiesce to your

01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:24.340
system yeah so that's more that's

01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:25.780
literally the conscious manipulation of

01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:28.179
reality you're creating your reality

01:40:28.179 --> 01:40:30.099
rather than being a passive acceptor of

01:40:30.099 --> 01:40:31.689
what's it happening yeah that's the

01:40:31.689 --> 01:40:34.719
sacred Church of dogology bro of like

01:40:34.719 --> 01:40:37.269
exactly you're saying like taking part

01:40:37.269 --> 01:40:39.849
in the structuring of the events and

01:40:39.849 --> 01:40:41.199
reality around you rather than being

01:40:41.199 --> 01:40:44.919
like this sucks pizza rules would like

01:40:44.919 --> 01:40:46.719
just or you can just go into the matrix

01:40:46.719 --> 01:40:48.849
of internet culture and you like repeat

01:40:48.849 --> 01:40:51.280
[ __ ] on that you hear and say I feel

01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:54.130
like we all found strange rings in

01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:57.510
different locations and just

01:41:04.230 --> 01:41:06.520
we won't pass each other in the Rings

01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:09.220
glue so what the [ __ ] Tony man and that

01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:11.290
dude that that makes perfect and that's

01:41:11.290 --> 01:41:13.030
literally what mysticism is is saying

01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:14.890
that we are people or gods and

01:41:14.890 --> 01:41:16.270
everything is you know that way like

01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:17.410
that's how you kind of deal with it I

01:41:17.410 --> 01:41:19.780
was on the way here I was saying cause I

01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:22.930

out of your house you're indebted to

01:41:26.710 --> 01:41:29.650
them for life just like a way that I

01:41:29.650 --> 01:41:31.720
feel I can add to people I call my way

01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:33.460

01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:37.210

he helped me move a dishwasher out of a

01:42:04.150 --> 01:42:06.370
house that was being built

01:42:06.370 --> 01:42:08.350
anyways on a level that there weren't

01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:11.730
stairs to so we had to like make a

01:42:11.730 --> 01:42:14.470
makeshift ladder system and like pulley

01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:18.250
system to get this washer down it was

01:42:18.250 --> 01:42:21.130
amazing it was one of my favorite things

01:42:21.130 --> 01:42:22.540
I was so happy to be able to walk in

01:42:22.540 --> 01:42:23.680
there I'm like there's probably a ladder

01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:27.070
in here somewhere big weird complicated

01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:29.830

to the brainstorming straight to the

01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:35.230
action like there was no time to like oh

01:42:35.230 --> 01:42:36.460

realized when I last episode that this

01:43:29.610 --> 01:43:32.130

01:43:32.130 --> 01:43:35.130
