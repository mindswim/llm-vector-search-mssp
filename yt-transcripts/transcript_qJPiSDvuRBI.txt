00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.560
little vignette

so when you die go to heaven does the

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.800
first thing you'll see is uh what's this

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.720
girl's name

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.319
i don't know patricia i wonder if she's

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.400
even jewish i doubt it but i like that

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.680
she's all brute like does the gas

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.360
chamber bruise you up

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.959
and then once you get to heaven you

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.519

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.840
like you know your holocaust bruising

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.760
okay let's look at the next one because

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.560
i think

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.640
okay don't don't jews not believe in

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.319
heaven

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.080
um

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.599
well now that they see this maybe it'll

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.599
turn turn that around yeah they better

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.200
start acting better

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.400
yeah do better

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.400
okay wait i gotta read it out loud again

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.480
god damn it okay

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.840
like i guess they think that it was

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.959
silent film times in uh

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.040
i was in my home making a stew

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.599
and the nazis came and they broke down

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.920
my door

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.760
and started kicking me and beating me

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.560
out of my own home

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.080
they shoved us on a train with a bunch

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.599
of other people from my town

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.680
wait we were all going to the same place

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.040
auschwitz

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.840
we've only heard of one guy

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.400
and we knew we were never coming back i

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.000
think you'd i think historically no you

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.440
didn't i can't imagine how scary that

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.840
would have been

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.439
oh this is the reply someone going i

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:54.720
can't imagine how scary that would have

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.959
been look at this girl's face

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.599
so so okay so this is a great this is

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:00.959
probably uh this should be at the

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.480
holocaust museum like when you put on

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.680
the headphones and look at the exhibit

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.480
like i was in my home making a stew

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.000
a jew stew

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.239
and then the nazis kicked down my door

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.080
now this kid's great i don't think he

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.799
says anything okay but what he's doing

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.639
is lip syncing to bruno mars

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.320
and he incorporates the holocaust into

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.400
it which i think is positive yeah oh

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.530
yeah okay go ahead

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.000
[Music]

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.560
look at this kid

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.650
[Music]

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.170
[Laughter]

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.589
[Music]

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.280
just play it again

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.680
so just he's lip sticking too locked out

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.600
of heaven

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.000
oh by bruno mars i mean this pretty much

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.600
sums up the whole holocaust people are

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.560
just chilling you know

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.840
okay

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.510
[Music]

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.490
[Laughter]

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.160
so you know he should have put get that

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.600
jew on top because it looks like they

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.280
were already just going for a shower and

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.199
then they saw a jew on the way to a

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.360
legitimate challenge

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.440
so i would reverse that yeah it's like

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.440
my high school football team's locker

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.000
room wow these kids would be often

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.840
like yeah everybody would get showers

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.120
and then we'd be in there holy [ __ ]

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.880
there's a jew in here so i was like did

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.880
you guys have showers in your school in

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.800
your high school we did yeah

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.039
we just went right back to class

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:44.880
really what what type of high school was

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.759
it just

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:47.440
was a normal high school

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.960
really i wasn't sure if it was one of

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.440
those the religion thing you were doing

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.039
no it was toms river high school east in

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:54.800
times over new jersey there just wasn't

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.840
i mean jim was like a half hour long

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.680
yeah nobody [ __ ] shout i mean there

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.479
were showers in the gym but i think only

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:04.800
like the football team used them

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.880
jim was yeah we were the football team

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.560
we would [ __ ] there we [ __ ] suck

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.960
but the

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.400
the g yeah everyone's you'd have to

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.039
shower after gym sometimes

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:16.720
you need to wear sweaters too it was

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.720
like i went to a catholic school

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.319
so if you work there if you like ran

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:21.919
around a gym class and then put on like

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.240
a button down and a [ __ ] sweater

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.479
we had no air conditioning obviously so

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:27.840
you just sit there

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.000
it was like auschwitz oh those priests

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.479
must have been coming in their pants

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:33.360
yeah

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.280
oh my god you missed my tick tock act

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.280
out there's

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.440
there's uh my walls are very thin in my

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.120
apartment so like today

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.560
i'm watching my hat like right where my

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.000
bathroom mirror is you just hear the

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.440
other bathroom on the other side so this

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.680
guy on the other side was having a rough

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.080
[ __ ] i mean

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.039
he i mean he literally said god damn but

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:54.720
he actually

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.199
i don't know i honestly i don't know if

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:58.800
he was coming or [ __ ] but it was

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.599
[ __ ] intense

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:03.680
he is a lot of grunting and a goddamn at

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.840
the end so

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.840
yeah that's so funny you know obviously

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.599
you didn't think anybody possibly could

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:11.520
have heard that i want to go are you

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.919
okay congratulations

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:16.479
i wasn't sure

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:18.000
how if you were grunting out of [ __ ] in

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.199
your and then you heard the neighbor

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:21.440
knock on your back

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.599
is everything cool man

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:24.960
i was gonna complain but now i'm just

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.319
concerned about your fiber intake

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.400
that trend

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.960
of tick tock holocaust videos

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.720
yeah that's i like the breeze that's the

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.160
craziest thing

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.919
why it seems like it makes sense tic toc

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:41.360
is like the

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.160
it's like the cut to the chase of

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.759
getting attention so it's like a lot of

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:47.680
kids like um

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.879
i've never looked at my own [ __ ] but

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:51.120
kyle dunnigan who i make those sketches

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.800

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.639
so

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:02.400
and then i see a lot of uh

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.840
you know i'll just watch some boys for

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.960
hours

yeah it's this kid he has his he has

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.879
like billy eilish outfit i just did i'm

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:14.479
like i don't understand what's happening

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:16.479
like i watch it and he's not either he's

00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:18.639
going like this and he combs his hair

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:20.080
and he pulls his pants up and then he

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.000
gives the finger the end that's

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.759
everything i love that

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:26.000
yeah

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.520
it's just like a quick and he and he

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.400
says like i only do this for clout

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.000
so he's not being paid this is just for

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.479
the cloud of it

00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:36.640
is like what's the fastest way to get

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.399
clout

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:39.919
the most valuable currency which is

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.360
clout

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.719
cloud

00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:44.640
imagine though like so for a while it

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.080
was like catching your kid doing a tick

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.440
tock where he's doing like a [ __ ]

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.519
dance and being like god damn this dude

00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:52.000
imagine if you caught your kid making

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.680
and like you had to

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.120
i mean you couldn't even explain why

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.519
that's you can't do that like if i yeah

00:08:57.519 --> 00:08:58.880
if i could keep making that that was

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.720
like a thing that would make me afraid

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.040
to have kids is i don't even know

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.880
you can't even have that conversation

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.640
like i don't know what what he's doing i

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.600
don't know who's watching i don't

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.360
understand what's the motive what's the

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.440
motive it bothers me but i don't have

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.640
anything to do

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.040
it's rough

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.200
it's true art what the [ __ ] are you

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.200
doing like a little guy jerking off or

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.800
do girls like this

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.800
a little little from a little from

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.680
column b probably

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.160
yeah good old tick tock trump was right

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.160
to executive ban it

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.360
yeah that could be the best thing he

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.240
does shane as uh

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.800
as the guy who uh you know clearly under

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.120
the alias kyle rittenhouse was from that

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.640
video

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.279
yeah yeah yeah very shame that's the

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:45.120
part aspect that i haven't seen in the

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.040
news is the very shane gillis

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.560
resemblance

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.200
yeah i got hit with that quite a bit

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.640
you look like a militia boy who will be

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.360
guarding a gas station in kenosha

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.160
yeah i'm actually i'm just glasses away

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.000
from a full militia kid

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
yeah that's why it's like a like if you

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.440
ever wore like one of those duck hunting

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.279
hats

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:07.120
you would legally be charged with a hate

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.880
crime i took a picture i took a picture

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.279
like that like i had this camo

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:13.600
sheets t shirt i used to always wear and

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.279
i took a picture of it like in the

00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:16.880
mirror like

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.880
like joe like obviously dude news

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.880
outlets were using that to when they

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.920
were like

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.680
snl fire's racist and then the picture

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.160

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.399
course that and of course the producers

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:35.040
of my podcast

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.480
because i never

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.240
i never even thought ahead of how my

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.680

one because i only had like one picture

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:51.839

00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:53.279
that to try to find it yeah yeah yeah

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:55.200

uh my family turned on me ferrari this

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.560

me and christine are looking into

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.360
therapy because i've cocked my fist back

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.600
first that's not me switching anything

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.959
that was my beer

00:15:56.959 --> 00:15:58.639
by the way those were both

00:15:58.639 --> 00:16:00.560
how hammered were you

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.160
i was hammered

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.759
and that hurts more everyone's losing

00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:06.079
faith in me and uh

00:16:06.079 --> 00:16:08.000
i don't know i just got to say i now

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.959

into the king of mayhem ari shafir and

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.079
shane

00:16:14.079 --> 00:16:17.040
and then he endorsed us

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.759
and that's why i'm backing lewis

00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:25.600

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.040
hand around the throat no i do this i've

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.720

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.759
you needed to do you both

00:16:59.759 --> 00:17:02.320

just whenever he was drinking that beer

00:17:09.679 --> 00:17:11.199
so how long did he trip like what

00:17:11.199 --> 00:17:12.160
happened

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.120
i think

hours

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:20.559

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.679
crazy thing to do i think it's [ __ ]

00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:32.480
crazy

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.919
with uh yeah

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:35.440
i've done a lot of hallucinations dude

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.640
that's not some [ __ ] that you do that

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.039
it's like [ __ ] stupid and i and i i'm

00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:42.559
like you know and i condemn it

00:17:42.559 --> 00:17:45.760
yeah look i don't i said i can openly

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.240

00:17:53.679 --> 00:17:55.679
with somebody [ __ ] around that way

00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:56.960
because you don't know how someone could

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.640
react to something and uh

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.120

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.000
shit-faced people

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.679
so i mean like you should mention you're

00:18:11.679 --> 00:18:13.520
completely drunk now as a young

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.960
militiaman i'm sure you hold your

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.799
alcohol but what that looks like to me

00:18:16.799 --> 00:18:18.640
is like a big mess

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.200
that was that was a and i think you know

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:21.840
i

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.679
i can't speak ferrari but i think i'm

00:18:23.679 --> 00:18:26.559
pretty sure nobody it wasn't like at jay

00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:29.039
it was just like lewis put acid in the

00:18:29.039 --> 00:18:30.880
beer and the beer

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.960
he deflected it to [ __ ] whoever was

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.799
sitting there

00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:36.320
um it's rough

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.760
it's a rough one

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.240
it was it was fun now all things

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.400
considered that was a lot more dignified

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.840
than the actual

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.000

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.360
i've ever seen in my life

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.600
which was pretty sick and then

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.360
they had an opera singer on the balcony

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.440
of the white house sing for like 20

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.360
minutes really

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.600
it was dude it was

and i mean the dancing was a great show

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.880

a lot of trouble for that

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.200
for what if you do somebody i bet you

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.760
could like go to jail for that

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.840
yeah we may not be able to play most of

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.120
this podcast

yeah you want to start over no i'm going

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.520
to start over

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.440
so because i didn't see an opera thing

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.279

00:23:51.279 --> 00:23:53.919
show bobby

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:00.799
sure man

00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:03.520
oh yeah

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.240
i saw the clip of the kid

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.480
from uh the covington dude

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.520
yeah

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.799
because my friend texts me something

00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:12.640
about um you know like well he didn't

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.480
use any of that money his teeth fixed or

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.080
some [ __ ]

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.400
and um good he shouldn't that's a smart

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.840
move to have that kid on that was a very

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.039
smart move

00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:23.440
in fact not having any celebrities that

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.440
are like the cool celebrities is

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.360
what's gonna help like what's gonna sink

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.120
the democrats is their celebrity

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.840
fixation that stupid thing you just saw

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.840
that [ __ ] like we you think you're at

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.120
the [ __ ] emmys or something like it's

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.000
not a

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.919
it was they did they for real treated it

00:24:37.919 --> 00:24:39.760
like an award show like they even did

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.200
jokes like that like they did like

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.760
monologue jokes with like

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.200
louis dreyfus whatever her name is and

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.320
how are they going to blow this twice

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.600
how's that possible okay go ahead they

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.919
did they did multiple jokes

00:24:51.919 --> 00:24:55.130
everyone's singing okay

00:24:55.130 --> 00:25:05.510
[Music]

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:09.270
[Laughter]

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.200
[Applause]

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.000
oh that's the guy's singing

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.300
fast forward a little bit

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:22.210
[Music]

00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:23.760
all right

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.080
all right you could end it

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.679
so i mean

00:25:27.679 --> 00:25:29.200
you know the irony too is like that's a

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.200
more presidential thing to have

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.039
than the other thing

00:25:33.039 --> 00:25:34.400
yeah true

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.720
then that 60s [ __ ] [ __ ] it's like

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.520
um

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.200
but again i couldn't imagine watching

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.720
any of that [ __ ] i could imagine sitting

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.240
through any of the speeches i would just

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.200
say

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.440
the fact that one side has like

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.360
you know a kid with bad teeth who is

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.840
victimized by the shitty ass media

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.039
versus julia louis versus veep

00:25:53.039 --> 00:25:54.640
uh

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.240
it's like they don't get it they still

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.679
think that this is like we're going to i

00:25:57.679 --> 00:26:00.240
remember i i like remember some of the

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.480
jokes they were so like it

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.880
the the comedy was so [ __ ]

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.919
condescending and [ __ ] and then like

00:26:07.919 --> 00:26:09.440
you know they're doubling down on on

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.440
that they're getting it it's like why

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.360
why are you doing this and then julie

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.720
louie drive history at one point was

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.559
like you gotta text 30101 to

00:26:18.559 --> 00:26:20.240
[ __ ] i don't know register to vote or

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.159
something like that and it was like she

00:26:22.159 --> 00:26:23.600
kept repeating it and like it's a tough

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.440
number to remember but it's actually

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.120
pretty easy because it's actually also

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.360
trump's golf score

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.760
it's like

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.600
what

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.120
they just kept doing jokes like that

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.039
like they were like mike

00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:38.720
oh i'm excited to watch kamala harris

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.600
debate micah ponce

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.679
that's a weird way to say that sounds

00:26:43.679 --> 00:26:44.660
foreign

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.350
[Laughter]

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:48.799
[Music]

00:26:48.799 --> 00:26:50.720
this is gonna hurt okay

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:54.320
seinfeld such a classic show too

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.320
so regularly that he doesn't even need

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.559
tear gas and a bunch of federalized

00:27:00.559 --> 00:27:02.320
troops to help him get there good

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.559

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.080

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.559
night where we will just play michelle

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:21.600

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.320
i uh i first met joe biden when i was

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.960
doing my show veep i played the vice

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.600
president and he was in fact the vice

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.720
president and we hit it off immediately

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.039
soon after i was asked to be on the

00:27:35.039 --> 00:27:38.000
cover of a magazine remember those and i

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.159
was so excited it was like oh what's it

00:27:40.159 --> 00:27:42.559
going to be people or vogue or rolling

00:27:42.559 --> 00:27:44.559
stone

00:27:44.559 --> 00:27:47.760
well it turns out it was for arrive the

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.679
official onboard magazine of amtrak

00:27:51.679 --> 00:27:53.919
which nobody ever reads

00:27:53.919 --> 00:27:56.159
even though it's free

00:27:56.159 --> 00:27:58.000
and the day it came out

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.360
my phone rang

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.200
and it was the vice president

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.919
telling me he loved the cover and the

00:28:03.919 --> 00:28:05.840
whole article and that it was one of the

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:09.039
best issues of arrive he had ever read

00:28:09.039 --> 00:28:11.840
and that is just one of the many reasons

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.320
that i wanted to be here tonight for joe

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.039

00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:21.120
only knows how to read but also he reads

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.399

said that it looks like t like a hotel

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.279
room programming that's what it looks

00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:19.440
like when you're in a hotel room and

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.039

00:29:23.039 --> 00:29:24.720

00:29:26.399 --> 00:29:28.640
what that [ __ ] is all right

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.960
why have andrean come out

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.440
this is what's so gross is like

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.960
the we just got done watching these

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.960
people trash each other

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.760
yeah

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.360
and now we're supposed to all put that

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.799
aside

00:29:40.799 --> 00:29:42.240
like all the very

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.760
valid points they raised about how each

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:44.880
other suck

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.279
and now the same people who just did

00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:48.720
that

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.360
like andrew yang i just watched cnn

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.720
interfering with him being able to

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.480
answer it i just watched him rigging it

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.360
against him now he works for cnn

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.480
does he

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.360
yeah

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.880
i think you're making a joke he works

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.120
for cnn i believe he does i believe he

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.039
he's they use him as a correspondent not

00:30:05.039 --> 00:30:06.720
a correspondent but yeah he works there

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.480
he does a lot of [ __ ] there

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.640
so

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.240

00:31:38.559 --> 00:31:39.600

telling me he's a linebacker from the

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.440
bears and i'm pretty sure he

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.360
think he was [ __ ] on the protests i

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.720
don't know

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.159

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.799
what farp's penis image that's more

00:31:54.799 --> 00:31:56.799
important

00:31:56.799 --> 00:31:58.480
first let's get our clips up for next

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.600
week yeah

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.480
oh

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.519
this is five inches

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.600
it looks like i took that it looks like

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.120
something you know you gotta push down

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.519
the base a little um here's why i'm not

00:32:11.519 --> 00:32:12.960
impressed is because

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.799
he was sending that to a chick he was

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:17.120
trying to impress correct

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.799
yeah it's not a great look

00:32:18.799 --> 00:32:21.919
so you're sending a flaccid

00:32:21.919 --> 00:32:23.840
that's not like okay that's just his

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.440
regular un

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.559
unfilled with blood dick size okay yeah

00:32:28.559 --> 00:32:30.080
so that could be there's no talent it

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.559
could be end up being big but

00:32:32.559 --> 00:32:35.519
that to me looks like he chubbed up

00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:37.039
you know he's like um trying to set it

00:32:37.039 --> 00:32:38.720
up so he had a semi it looked like he

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.399
had a semi and he's faking flaccid

00:32:40.399 --> 00:32:42.320
that's the move that's the exactly

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.559
that's what i'm trying to say

00:32:44.559 --> 00:32:46.559
because that's not incredibly um

00:32:46.559 --> 00:32:48.880

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.000

balcony singing ave maria and then they

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.599
would cut to trump who's like just

00:34:25.599 --> 00:34:27.040
because of the distance of the camera

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.639

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:30.879

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.920
minority of people that are hyped up for

either of these conventions

00:35:19.599 --> 00:35:21.359

a certain contingent of people it's like

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.960
pro wrestling if you if you're like

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.720
hulk hogan defeated the soviet union

you know like

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.760

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.359
trump won everybody was crying i'm like

00:35:43.359 --> 00:35:46.000
you sound like when the wwe

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.320
revealed it was scripted and a guy was

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:51.760
going it's real to me damn it yeah yeah

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.200
that's all these people and i'm like it

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.880
was really easy buddy why did you think

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:57.359
this was real

00:35:57.359 --> 00:35:58.960
like honestly god like there's no one

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.720
you can vote for

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.079
that is going to be against the

00:36:02.079 --> 00:36:03.839
interests of like the following

00:36:03.839 --> 00:36:05.440
companies like

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.040
you know like

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.040
you have a choice but it's got to be

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.480
something that raytheon's comfortable

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.640
with which i like that's like a defense

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.720
contractor that has more say than you or

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.480
you know what i mean so just people

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.920
imagining like this is the most

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.119
important

00:36:19.119 --> 00:36:20.880
this is what blows my mind is to act

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.760
like this is the most important election

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.240
where it's all on the line and if you

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.320
don't [ __ ] like why do you have biden

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.520
as your guy then

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.839
will you put up his um his slogan this

00:36:31.839 --> 00:36:34.240
is okay so this is this is trump the

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.960
greatest threat ever on every level

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.560
that's trump that's what begins with

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.640
trump not the [ __ ] secret courts and

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.800
the [ __ ] spying and all the other

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.440
[ __ ] and the seven [ __ ] wars not that

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.440
trump so here's joe's this was his

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.240
primary slogan no malarkey this is his

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.400
big iowa

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.359
so that's you cut back on the malarkey

00:36:55.359 --> 00:36:57.520
yeah he feels i don't i thought maybe

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.940
trump has an ex-wife named malarkey

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.280
[Laughter]

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.079
um

00:37:02.079 --> 00:37:05.040
like are you [ __ ] me

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.040
you're picking that guy that's the guy

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.599
that you think is your luke skywalker in

00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:12.000
this ultimate battle against evil

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.440
you're sending yeah i can't believe

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.119
that's i can't believe that's all they

00:37:15.119 --> 00:37:17.520
had and then you're gonna have kamala

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.119
harris as the backup

00:37:19.119 --> 00:37:20.400

00:37:21.839 --> 00:37:23.839
any anything especially protesting like

uh uh police brutality or any of that

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.320
joe biden is directly responsible for

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.280
like

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.640
every like everything since the night

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.079
yeah

00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:33.599
i think kamal harris is responsible for

00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:35.440
the other part and you're supposed to go

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.680
what like i'm just so glad she's part

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.359
jamaican part indian that i don't care

00:37:39.359 --> 00:37:41.119
that she's the thing i'm supposedly

00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:42.720
protesting she's

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.720
absolutely part of the problem in a way

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.560
trump could never be

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.560
so so and

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.760
to be fair like as much as she sucks

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.200
who cares about who the vice [ __ ]

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:54.320
president is

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.920
the first time it matters not excited

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.160
about [ __ ] mike i mean i i don't

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.200
there's nobody for me i'm voting

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.839
i have to write in

00:38:02.839 --> 00:38:05.359
fear i'm still hoping ben glebe's

00:38:05.359 --> 00:38:07.760
candidacy works out

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.599
yeah this is here's here's what's going

00:38:09.599 --> 00:38:12.960
to be fun to watch is when if biden wins

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.800
how fox news is going to have to be the

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.040
ones reporting police brutality over and

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.599
over again that's gonna be fun to watch

00:38:19.599 --> 00:38:22.240
whether like see it wasn't our fault

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.280
what do you mean

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.680
so if biden's in office

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.079
fox news will be the ones being like

00:38:28.079 --> 00:38:30.160
look at this police totality over what

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.359
though

00:38:31.359 --> 00:38:33.200
you're saying though

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.280
no no no so i'm saying

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.880
right now when trump's in office the

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:39.119
police brutality gets shown on cnn

00:38:39.119 --> 00:38:41.119
non-stop and they're like

00:38:41.119 --> 00:38:42.880
this is trump

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.880
this has a lot to do with trump

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.800
so then if biden's in office so you're

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.880
saying i would assume that fox is going

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.560
to take over the police brutality role

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:51.920
which is going to be fun to watch if

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.520
biden wins most of these companies are

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.040
going to go out of business because that

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.480
they have nothing without trump i mean

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.160
they literally have nothing

00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.040
true

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.320
they've built their their entire

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.680
business model

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.440
yeah is based around

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.520
24 7 donald trump

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.280
like i'm not kid like we were in seven

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.720
countries like seven i don't know if you

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.240
thought it was just like one or two it's

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.560
seven [ __ ] seven well i didn't know

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.960
that that was news to me no

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.480
you know i knew all about ellen

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.720
degeneres's if she's nice

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.040
i knew all the details of that

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.880
it came as a shock the seven worth day

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.320
so

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.599
trump has been keeping like these

00:39:25.599 --> 00:39:28.000
companies afloat just talking about him

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.280
so once he's done what are they going to

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.880
[ __ ] do

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.880
what are they going to do

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.920
so [ __ ] uh and then biden

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.000
is just like a [ __ ]

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.520
you see the ice cube talking about it

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.320
like okay so he's not trump okay day one

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.440
we've taken care of that problem then

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.280
what are they gonna do can you think of

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.040
anything

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.880
that they're gonna do or that you like

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.119
like here's why i think biden's good

00:39:51.119 --> 00:39:52.400
and i'm just asking i'm not saying it

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.280
crazy

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.880
well see here's the thing i

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.520
i really don't know [ __ ] about politics

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.640
but

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.000
i would like you're not alone dude i

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.599
think it's a lot of people

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:02.560
yeah so

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.400
like when i start to look at i go jesus

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.560
it's so much worse than i thought

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:09.359
it is it's also i mean one thing that

00:40:09.359 --> 00:40:11.359
biden could be good at hopefully is

00:40:11.359 --> 00:40:12.480
getting

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.920
free health not free health care but

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.839
yeah health care would be pretty good i

00:40:15.839 --> 00:40:17.920
think no i don't know the internet so

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.200
every time i bring that

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.720
that's already off the table for some

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.560
time you're aware of that right yeah

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.760
yeah i don't think that would be like

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.599
you get in office and get that done came

00:40:25.599 --> 00:40:27.520
out now and said that he goes oh we're

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.760
gonna have medicare for all he could win

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.359
if he came out tomorrow and just said

00:40:31.359 --> 00:40:33.119
that he would win

00:40:33.119 --> 00:40:34.720
if he just said

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.480
or this jimmy dore said first but he's

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.480
right if he said hey we're going to

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.640
legalize marijuana at the federal level

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.720
and release anybody who's got a charge

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.640
related to marijuana he wins he's better

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.640
than trump that's all he's got to do

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.319
he's never going to do that he's never

00:40:48.319 --> 00:40:49.440
going to do that

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.200
he's going to be worse

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.640
and so people that don't get this

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:54.800
they're only focused on

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.280
trump is bad okay

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.040
why is your candidate good did you get

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.280
any thought to that they're like well he

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:03.920
used to hang out with obama so maybe

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.839
some black rubbed off on him

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.200
they'll say the same thing i just want

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.440
to feel normal again that's every all

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.440
everyone that always boils down to like

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.520
a return to normalcy

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.440
it probably shouldn't return normalcy i

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.640
know like where people is usually rich

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.119
rich [ __ ] comedy actor friends who

00:41:23.119 --> 00:41:24.880
who say this [ __ ] of just wanting to

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.880
feel normal if life was good for you

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.480
[ __ ] it hadn't been that way for

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.560
a whole bunch of people and not just the

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.079
black people and you're going to be

00:41:32.079 --> 00:41:33.599
surprised when black people don't go

00:41:33.599 --> 00:41:34.800
with you

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.319
even with the threat of not being black

00:41:36.319 --> 00:41:37.680
anymore

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.680
you're gonna be [ __ ] surprised

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:40.800
i mean these people are getting blown

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.480
away

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.520
i i don't know how honestly

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.440
i think i'd be relieved if trump lost

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:48.720
because it means

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.400
there won't be that there won't be like

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.760
huge riots

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.160
because if if uh trump wins there's

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.200
gonna be massive right they're already

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.280
setting it up for that now there's gonna

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.720
be massive riots if trump wins

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.319
i promise you're not going to see it

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:03.680
yeah yeah it's good i'm not going to see

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.240
it on by on if biden wins because the

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.240
people that vote and [ __ ] that they have

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.599
property they don't want to destroy

00:42:09.599 --> 00:42:10.960
property

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.160
all the people that are like oh the

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.480
looting's okay and but oh put that dude

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:16.480
the cnn pick this blows my mind this is

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:17.200
like

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:19.440
i i can pinpoint uh i know what this one

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.160
is

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.160
yeah do you put that picture up bobby of

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:22.960
uh

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:26.000
the fire [ __ ] riots yeah yeah yeah

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.240
yeah

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:29.839
it's

00:42:29.839 --> 00:42:32.319
it's so crazy the thing is though also

00:42:32.319 --> 00:42:35.040
if if trump does lose i wonder if there

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:38.720
could be a a a burst of

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.599
right-wing shootings

00:42:41.599 --> 00:42:43.200
there will not be a burst of right-wing

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.880
[ __ ] that's all nonsense no no no no i

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:47.119
just mean like a couple of autistic

00:42:47.119 --> 00:42:51.280
autistic dudes getting a little rowdy

00:42:51.359 --> 00:42:53.680
i don't mean like alone spree yeah yeah

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.359
yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm not gonna happen

00:42:55.359 --> 00:42:57.760
that's that's definitely gonna happen

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.440
that's regardless of trump

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.720
that's just going to yeah that's a

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:04.400
tradition that's an american tradition

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.160
yeah no you can always expect that what

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.760
are you crazy and by the way it's going

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:10.640
to be more more likely now because

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.560
good luck with any gun control [ __ ] at

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.400
this point yeah

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.000
i took somebody from this one million

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.319
moms group on gnome's podcast she was

00:43:18.319 --> 00:43:20.720
nice they just want like reasonable kind

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:21.440
of

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.760
controls you know this [ __ ] didn't sound

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.119
radical to me

00:43:25.119 --> 00:43:27.200
it sounded like the kind of [ __ ] of like

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.280
the clip size and all you know

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.880
i don't know those things even work but

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.119
it didn't sound like uh obama wants to

00:43:33.119 --> 00:43:35.680
steal your guns group but even so i was

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.440
like how are you even still

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.000
trying to sell this that's done yeah

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.119
people bought so many guns there's an

00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:43.280
ammo shortage are you [ __ ] crazy can

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.680
you can 17 year olds

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:47.440
can 17 year olds have

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.960
assault rifles

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.599
sure an assault rifle is a city

00:43:51.599 --> 00:43:53.760
like they're all just right a rifle like

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.560
that's all nonsense but anyway i'm for

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:58.160
now i'm for all of that i i don't know

00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:58.960
you don't know if there's gonna be

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.240
police to protect you or not you better

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.520
have a gun

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.040
like what do you think's gonna happen

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.119
when the when in these cities that you

00:44:05.119 --> 00:44:06.720
and i yeah

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.480
when the people that are at the moment

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.560
just like kind of gang and personal [ __ ]

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.000
what do you think's gonna happen when it

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.079
dawns on them that they can

00:44:14.079 --> 00:44:16.319
people that are like we're only held in

00:44:16.319 --> 00:44:18.079
check by police

00:44:18.079 --> 00:44:20.319
it's gonna be [ __ ] crazy that's how

00:44:20.319 --> 00:44:22.319
we got like the dirty harry movies and

00:44:22.319 --> 00:44:25.119
[ __ ] was because 60s [ __ ]

00:44:25.119 --> 00:44:27.359
liberals and then they the in the 70s

00:44:27.359 --> 00:44:29.119
crime was out of control and then

00:44:29.119 --> 00:44:31.280
everybody wanted fascist cops all the

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.720
movies are a fantasy about a cop who

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.040
doesn't

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:43.920
and

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:45.760
that wasn't just because cops are bad

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:47.920
that everyone wanted that

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.920
because there was crime out of [ __ ]

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.720
control so so what do you think there's

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.079
all these idiots anybody that's like

00:44:54.079 --> 00:44:55.760
burn anything down they know what

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:56.960
they're doing they're trying to just

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.200
destroy everything but that's going to

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.280
lead to if you're afraid of fascism get

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.520
ready for a big healthy dose of the most

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.200
fascism you ever saw

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.640
not and not even fashion people gonna be

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.800
upset they're gonna be asking for it

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.400
because that nobody wants their [ __ ]

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.240
burned down by some [ __ ] punk from

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.440
portland

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.760
okay like like they like shoot them in

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.200
the head that's what i'd like to see

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:18.400
that's what people are going to say

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.079
they're saying it now

00:45:20.079 --> 00:45:21.680
and i bet you that guy that they just

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.280
got uh kyle you know the one that you

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.680
look like

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:28.560
um i'll bet you he gets a pardon from

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.280
trump directly

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.480
so this this is why i say yes way

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.640
so this is on cnn

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.480
i mean this is a meme

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.680
that they might i don't know why this

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:49.040
guy's dressed like he's in fortnight

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.280
because he's in fortnight i mean that's

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.200
true yeah he is

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.359
in a [ __ ] fortnight it's four days in

00:45:55.359 --> 00:45:56.480
warfare

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.560
you better build a barricade real fast

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:02.640
and have a rifle get a good drop

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.560
ire but mostly now why do you think it

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.240
says fiery but mostly peaceful now this

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.319
guy from what i understand this he's

00:46:08.319 --> 00:46:09.760
he's actually supposedly a good reporter

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.599
he's not like a [ __ ] so that's not

00:46:11.599 --> 00:46:14.400
him making this chiron of course

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.480
so but somebody at cnn makes a decision

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.480
put that up why would they put something

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.960
that crazy in front of cars on fire why

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:23.599
would they write that

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.640
because it's propaganda i mean you know

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.319
why they're right because they're like

00:46:28.319 --> 00:46:29.599
we still want to say it's a peaceful

00:46:29.599 --> 00:46:30.640
protest

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:32.800
so so all of the media labors under this

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.040
and all the people the hollywood celebs

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.040
that [ __ ] they all think that they

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.960
create perception you know they're

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:41.040
influencers and all that [ __ ] they all

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:42.400
think that they're

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.319
people you're so stupid and just because

00:46:44.319 --> 00:46:45.920
you look like a [ __ ]

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:47.680
pennsylvania potato person that does not

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:47.940
mean

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.760
[Laughter]

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.440
yes does she look like a guy with a

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:54.240
mouth full of chaw and a head full of

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.920
alt-right ideas of course i'm gonna

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.920
throw a dip in shortly i'm looking at my

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:01.599
my tins sitting over there of course

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.079
my cat's laying on my dip so to answer

00:47:04.079 --> 00:47:05.760
the question why also why they picked

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.520
biden for this very important job

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:10.000
because that's what they think of you

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.920
that's why they picked biden by it's

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:13.440
it's like in kill bill

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:14.800
when when bill's talking about how

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.640
superman created the character of clark

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:19.200
kent superman superman really clark kent

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.880
is what he thinks of humans they're weak

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.960
and bumbling and stupid and they have

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:26.240
bad eyesight that's his i impression of

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:28.400
what human beings are and joking

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.040
is the dnc's impression of what all of

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.480
you are

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.480
[ __ ] idiots that don't know [ __ ]

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.880
about [ __ ] and they kind of remember

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.720
obama and it seemed better when obama

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.480
was there so like oh this guy's he'll

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.640
keep the obama train going

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.240
okay and for a lot of people they're

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:47.119
dead right there's a lot of people

00:47:47.119 --> 00:47:48.480
you just said you didn't [ __ ] know

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.440
any of that [ __ ] so there's a lot of

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:50.839
people right

00:47:50.839 --> 00:47:52.559
however that picture back up

00:47:52.559 --> 00:47:53.920
bobby will you

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:57.040
no matter how stupid you are

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.400
um

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.319
even a stupid person can see through

00:48:00.319 --> 00:48:01.599
this

00:48:01.599 --> 00:48:04.480
okay even a stupid person is going oh i

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.480
i don't think i think a peaceful protest

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:09.839
has no cars on fire at the protest

00:48:09.839 --> 00:48:11.440
you can throw that out

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:13.200
like you don't ask for a ceasefire with

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.280
peaceful protesters so even if you're

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:18.000
for the protests which many people are

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.680
you're not for that [ __ ] and then if

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.599
your [ __ ] gets burned down

00:48:21.599 --> 00:48:23.680
or you see you saw those people came out

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.359
with guns and um

00:48:25.359 --> 00:48:28.240
was it missouri they got arrested

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.000
no i just i didn't see that one what

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.760
happened there you know there was a blm

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.280
march through there [ __ ] they had

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.599
like oh yeah the mccloskeys they spoke

00:48:35.599 --> 00:48:37.359
at the rnc

00:48:37.359 --> 00:48:38.800
that was just from there that's great

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.880
that's a great castle dude

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.800
no that's great that they said that yeah

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.000
i don't know what people think of that

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:44.640
like

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:46.079
some wild you wanna know something wild

00:48:46.079 --> 00:48:47.680
so i've you know obviously i've been

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.680
flipping back and forth between fox and

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:50.800
cnn

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.640
to watch these debates which is are

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:55.119
these conventions which is so funny

00:48:55.119 --> 00:48:56.960
because they're both like like obviously

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.079
it's exactly what you think it is

00:48:58.079 --> 00:49:00.240
they're like man that sucked right like

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.559
every time what's up but uh

00:49:02.559 --> 00:49:04.079
so though so let's say you're watching

00:49:04.079 --> 00:49:05.920
cnn during the republican convention

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.599
they literally had

00:49:07.599 --> 00:49:09.920
coronavirus stats like this big on the

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:11.280
bottom of the screen during trump's

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.839
speech to be like 180 000 people died

00:49:13.839 --> 00:49:15.920
they were fact checking live during his

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:17.520
speech right

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.559
which

00:49:18.559 --> 00:49:20.079
i don't think they usually do for no

00:49:20.079 --> 00:49:21.920
debates which i think is a smart move

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.839
because good move for them

00:49:23.839 --> 00:49:25.680
because it's but ultimately it's not

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:26.800
it's a blood because it makes it look

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.880
like you're hiding [ __ ] and so like

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:30.800
those people with the guns are hiding

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:33.680
they're hiding the problem

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:34.960
those two people with the guns one of

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:36.319
the guns didn't even work it was just

00:49:36.319 --> 00:49:38.240
for show a whole bunch of people broke

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:40.000
in onto their property he gave the one

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.520
that didn't work to his wife that's

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:44.000
funny i hope so it's like handing a it's

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.359
like a hand in the controller that

00:49:45.359 --> 00:49:46.559
doesn't work to your little brother it's

00:49:46.559 --> 00:49:48.720
just a visual [ __ ] deterrent because

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.200
you've already broken into my property a

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.599
mob of people so what am i supposed to

00:49:53.599 --> 00:49:56.400
do hope for the best

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.520
the reason that people weren't attacking

00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.079
kills because they had guns okay so the

00:50:00.079 --> 00:50:01.599
only people that think that like oh

00:50:01.599 --> 00:50:03.119
they're terrible how could they come out

00:50:03.119 --> 00:50:05.359
and have guns at the protesters breaking

00:50:05.359 --> 00:50:06.559
into their [ __ ]

00:50:06.559 --> 00:50:07.760
there's some people like how dare they

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.680
have a gated off

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:10.960
community at all right some people like

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.559
how dare you well if you paid the money

00:50:12.559 --> 00:50:13.920
you get to have that i'm sorry to tell

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.760
you well yeah and it seems like the gate

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:18.240
was probably a good idea considering

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.760
considering mobs of people walk around

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.520
and they want so

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.880
maybe you'd like to discourage people

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:25.040
from destroying your [ __ ] home well

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.640
you're perfectly allowed to do that so

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.000
for political reasons they got

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.160
prosecuted and they

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.400
they [ __ ] changed evidence so i broke

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.680
i dropped my phone

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:35.280
and then

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.480
but of course he's going to have them

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.559
speak that kid from covington that

00:50:38.559 --> 00:50:40.000
didn't do anything that the media tried

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.280
to ruin his i heard he got like 80

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:42.480
million dollar i mean that seems like

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:43.839
yeah kids

00:50:43.839 --> 00:50:44.720
but

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.160
i didn't see that's the thing like i

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:47.520
remember when i didn't get a [ __ ]

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:48.720
penny

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:50.720
when every story came out

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.880
well you said that [ __ ] uh every story

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:54.480

they're committing

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.520
the malarkey was coming from black

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.680
israelites

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:40.000

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.000
but you just if you had any [ __ ]

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.680
sense you'd understand that people

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.760
aren't aren't thrilled with like

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:54.000

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.240
[ __ ] the idea that their [ __ ] can be

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.800
burned down because you're mad about a

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.000
[ __ ] thing that happened in another

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:00.800
state

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.400
keep in mind george floyd this is the

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.200
first

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.960
that i can remember the first shooting

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.400
where everyone was like that cop

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:07.839
murdered him

00:52:07.839 --> 00:52:09.520
yeah everyone including trump was like

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:11.599
that cops guilty and that's the one that

00:52:11.599 --> 00:52:14.640
the rights the one where we all agree

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:15.920
it's a murder

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:18.319
okay so why am i if that should happen

00:52:18.319 --> 00:52:19.599
in uh

00:52:19.599 --> 00:52:21.680
minneapolis and i'm a guy that lives in

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.440
missouri why are you [ __ ] throwing

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:25.599
fire bombs at my [ __ ] or burning my

00:52:25.599 --> 00:52:26.880
[ __ ] business down because of that

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:28.640
what is that one half because you're mad

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.559
about it [ __ ] you

00:52:30.559 --> 00:52:31.359
so

00:52:31.359 --> 00:52:32.880
everybody's mad about that kid oh will

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.000
you play the video so you know about

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.760
this kid

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.200
you've seen the video right of him with

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.760
the rifle go ahead yeah yeah yeah yeah i

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:40.720
have seen

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:42.640
so what i get is people like why was he

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:44.000
there in the first place with a rifle

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.240
why is a militia there because the

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:48.960
police can't defend anybody's stuff

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.960
and if it's your stuff being burned and

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.400
there's no cops are going to help you

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.280
because they don't want to get in

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.040
trouble for helping you i bet you'd be

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.800
pretty [ __ ] grateful that a 17 year

00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.079
old brought a quote-unquote assault

00:52:58.079 --> 00:53:01.200
rifle to defend your stuff i would be

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.040
like if i had an ar-15 and you're coming

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:04.960
to burn my business i'll shoot you

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.800
it's not even a it's a no-brainer it's

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:10.400
not popping above your life yes

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:11.520
i agree with that

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:13.200
if i don't have a business or children

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:15.760
but if i don't thought someone burned my

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:18.559
[ __ ] down are you kidding me

00:53:18.559 --> 00:53:19.520
i don't think you're saying anything

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:23.040
wrong but but it appears if a 17 year

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:26.960
old carrying an ar-15 who's in a militia

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:29.359
he went and then he shot you could be 17

00:53:29.359 --> 00:53:31.440
years old and [ __ ] seinfeld legally so i

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.090
don't have a

00:53:32.090 --> 00:53:34.240
[Laughter]

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:36.079
yeah no they were defending businesses

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:37.520
from people who were making molotov

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:39.119
cocktails by the way

00:53:39.119 --> 00:53:42.319
them driving in from an area that's he

00:53:42.319 --> 00:53:45.520
he's looking for it dude i get it look

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.520
they're looking i know you protect this

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:49.839
better at this than me so whatever i say

00:53:49.839 --> 00:53:52.640
is not going to win but

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.240
i'm joking no

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.240
it's not the same as tr see this is the

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:57.520
[ __ ]

00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:58.800
we're like here's a bunch of people like

00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.960
you're not supposed to go there's nobody

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:03.119
else doing it it's not like the trayvon

00:54:03.119 --> 00:54:04.240
martin thing

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:05.520
i'm not saying it's like the trayvon

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.040
thing so

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.400
that one's a clear one

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.559
um well anyway play the video bobby

00:54:10.559 --> 00:54:12.240
because i haven't seen the first part

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:13.839
that bobby was talking about that he

00:54:13.839 --> 00:54:15.839
found

00:54:15.839 --> 00:54:18.079
of uh kyle rittenhouse

00:54:18.079 --> 00:54:19.599
what you're saying though shane that is

00:54:19.599 --> 00:54:23.280
the the line why is a 17 year old why is

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:25.119
a 17 year old have a gun i don't know

00:54:25.119 --> 00:54:26.640
the same reason one might have a molotov

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:27.839
cocktail

00:54:27.839 --> 00:54:29.440
the police aren't able to do their job

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.280
anymore this is where the liberals are

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.640
[ __ ] by the way i'm saying this as a

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.960
liberal liberals are so [ __ ] stupid

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:38.240
and weak that they they haven't digested

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:40.400
the armageddon happening yet they're

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.079
still in the thing of like no just let

00:54:42.079 --> 00:54:43.599
it burn out it's going to be no it's

00:54:43.599 --> 00:54:45.280
only going to get worse

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.720
that's why you might want to have a gun

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:48.160
when the [ __ ] hits the fan because there

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:49.920
may not be a 17 year old to protect you

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:52.559
when it happens okay

00:54:52.559 --> 00:54:55.280
i thought my anxiety was bad after the

00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:57.760
legion of skanks episode

00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.079
this is a play the thing but i'm glad

00:55:00.079 --> 00:55:02.640
you said that because

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.000
that's what people say they're like

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.400
what's this kid doing when a militia

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:09.040
what are your kids who's talking about

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:11.119
there's nobody to do the job

00:55:11.119 --> 00:55:12.799
were you gonna do the job no you're

00:55:12.799 --> 00:55:14.160
gonna i don't want to get involved in

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:14.880
that

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:17.359
so so if it's it's not your [ __ ] being

00:55:17.359 --> 00:55:19.040
burned down it's easy for you to say

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:21.200
[ __ ] anybody that thinks it's

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.880
cool look we have to understand the

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.960
looting and the rioting and like no i

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:27.200
don't have to understand [ __ ] you

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.640
understand because they didn't come and

00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:30.559
when they come to these people's houses

00:55:30.559 --> 00:55:32.400
which you can see in real time people

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.480
going yeah burn it down then they get to

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:35.839
your house and all of a sudden somebody

00:55:35.839 --> 00:55:38.000
needs to stop these animals that in the

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.200
same breath

00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:40.720
do you see that guy that [ __ ] black

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:42.720
sports caster because this is a

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:45.040
community yeah he's yelling burn it down

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.119
in his twitter feed then they come to

00:55:47.119 --> 00:55:48.640
his [ __ ] neighborhood

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.320
where are the police

00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:52.160
[Laughter]

00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.839
because if you're okay with that if

00:55:53.839 --> 00:55:55.359
you're okay with breaking all that [ __ ]

00:55:55.359 --> 00:55:57.200
that's because it's not your [ __ ] simple

00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.640
as that there's nothing more complex

00:55:58.640 --> 00:55:59.599
than that

00:55:59.599 --> 00:56:01.520
the only people fine with that it's not

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.400
their [ __ ]

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:04.720
it's a lot of black owned businesses not

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:06.160
that i give a [ __ ] if it's black owned

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:07.920
or not but for the record you're not

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.359
helping

00:56:09.359 --> 00:56:11.040
and that's because it's a bunch of

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:13.520

00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:15.520

00:57:38.839 --> 00:57:41.359
wow do you think it would have been

00:57:41.359 --> 00:57:42.720
different if the police had to try to

00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:44.880
stop them from from setting the fire i

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:49.079
feel like there would be a lot more

00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:58.960
it's hard to hear this all right so he

00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:00.640
said ems is not coming they're there to

00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:01.920
protect the thing and provide medical

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:03.119
attention if they need to that's

00:58:03.119 --> 00:58:06.160
basically just what he's saying

00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:08.720
right and then um yeah and then he walks

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:10.960
down the block and he confronts a couple

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:12.400
of kids that were standing there and

00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:13.839
they were saying that he was pointing

00:58:13.839 --> 00:58:15.119
the gun telling him to get out of the

00:58:15.119 --> 00:58:16.240
car

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:18.160

00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:19.760
then i have the first

00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:21.440
the first shooting here

00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:22.799
okay yeah let me see that i don't think

00:58:22.799 --> 00:58:25.440

00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:28.720
[Music]

00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:30.640

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:36.559
they just saw the cocktail between

00:58:36.559 --> 00:58:38.319
i just saw a [ __ ] flaming bottle be

00:58:38.319 --> 00:58:39.920
thrown

00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:41.359

00:58:41.359 --> 00:58:42.319

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:50.599

the other guy had a gun a pun also did

00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:07.440
you see that

00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:10.079
i did i did see that so they were armed

00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:11.839
and they had molotov cocktails and then

00:59:11.839 --> 00:59:12.720
but

00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.319
running this is what's funny is this

00:59:14.319 --> 00:59:16.559
kid's running for his life it's not what

00:59:16.559 --> 00:59:17.920
you just said about going to look for

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:20.960
trouble the video shows him not here's

00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:23.200
he i i look i'm not here's what i'm

00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:24.720
saying when you're when you're sitting

00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:26.799
there you've got your [ __ ] tactical

00:59:26.799 --> 00:59:28.319
[ __ ] and you're using words like

00:59:28.319 --> 00:59:30.480
tactical and [ __ ] these guys are

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:32.559
providing overwatch it's like dude the

00:59:32.559 --> 00:59:35.280
kid obviously has

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.680
[ __ ] dreams of being a navy seal

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:38.880
right now

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:40.240
okay

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.040
look

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:42.720
i just you ever seen an antifa meeting

00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:44.400
what do you think they say there they

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:45.440
say tactical

00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.040
just because i think one of them sucks

00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:48.559
doesn't mean i think that's what i'm

00:59:48.559 --> 00:59:50.400
saying here's what i'm saying i'm more

00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:51.839
on the side of the people that showed up

00:59:51.839 --> 00:59:53.280
to stop the kids with the [ __ ]

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:55.839
molotovs and the two ex-cons that got

00:59:55.839 --> 00:59:58.720
shot i don't give a [ __ ] about them

00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.799
this should have been avoided by having

01:00:00.799 --> 01:00:02.400
national guard

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.280
of course

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:05.200
and why are they not there because of

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.520
course you want to take aid from trump

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.880
and you want to know why because they

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.400
thought politically they should they

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.839
should say it's a fiery but peaceful

01:00:12.839 --> 01:00:14.480
protest right that's what the governor

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.760
did so

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.839
this f this is the fault

01:00:17.839 --> 01:00:19.839
at number one of the governor who didn't

01:00:19.839 --> 01:00:21.359
accept help who came out and made that

01:00:21.359 --> 01:00:22.880
[ __ ] speech

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.480
that we're where uh i don't know who the

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.799
other guy blake that got paralyzed from

01:00:26.799 --> 01:00:29.680
uh being shot okay no we don't have the

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:31.359
whole story and he want to be quick to

01:00:31.359 --> 01:00:33.200
jump on the cops are bad here's the

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.640
problem with all cops are bad okay

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.160
you need cops so that [ __ ] doesn't

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.839
explode around you

01:00:39.839 --> 01:00:41.280
especially when people are angry like

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.520
now so we can't really abolish police in

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:46.799
a time of molotov cocktails

01:00:46.799 --> 01:00:48.880
people from seattle and portland drove

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.240
in on a [ __ ] bus in fact they just

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.440
arrested them they came out a thing

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.280
called the riot grill they could make

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.440
food and bombs for people

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.440
so i don't care that this kid and this

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.640
militia came from another state they're

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.240
coming to protect the property from the

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.240
people that came to destroy it good i

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.319
don't care if they antifa [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:01:04.319 --> 01:01:06.640
it they're the worst [ __ ] people i've

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:09.760
ever [ __ ] seen okay yeah yeah i i'm

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.680
not a big fan so the reason they want

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.520
there you know cops is they can destroy

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:16.000
your [ __ ] with impunity

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.760
and they say it openly they say this is

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.359
justified

01:01:19.359 --> 01:01:21.920
yeah you saw the [ __ ] um

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.520
in dc now this isn't nearly as bad as

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.440
the other thing but but trump's going to

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.359
win because of this

01:01:27.359 --> 01:01:28.720
uh the people go in the restaurant

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.160
demanding you throw up a black power

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.040
fist

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.400
man

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.880
so by the way that's why that kid

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.640
and all the other people with them are

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:38.880
doing overwatch and all that other [ __ ]

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.559
that's why they're doing it plus that

01:01:40.559 --> 01:01:42.240
kid ran away from the people and they're

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.240
attacking him and he shot like it's all

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.240
justified them showing up is totally

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.240
justified i here's the thing are you

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.680
justified

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:53.119
he's legally i think whole walk

01:01:53.119 --> 01:01:54.640
good he should walk i think he should

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:55.680
walk

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:57.520
i i i don't even understand how this is

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.359
a thing except for people that still

01:01:59.359 --> 01:02:01.599
haven't got what's going on yet that

01:02:01.599 --> 01:02:03.440
still go oh it's it's just fiery but

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.200
mostly peaceful protests that's because

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.119
your [ __ ] hasn't gotten blown up stupid

01:02:07.119 --> 01:02:10.319
yeah for sure it's way like there's no

01:02:10.319 --> 01:02:11.920
reason for anyone in portland to be

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.599
doing anything right now

01:02:13.599 --> 01:02:15.359
okay you're not no

01:02:15.359 --> 01:02:17.039
none of you are black

01:02:17.039 --> 01:02:18.240
the george floyd thing happened in

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.720
another state you're like you're a bunch

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.559
of [ __ ] commies and that's what

01:02:22.559 --> 01:02:24.480
they're why they're stomping around and

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.720
they lie they make up they go we try to

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.400
they try to provoke violence this is

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.160
like antifa you can see that guy andy

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.000
know he he catalogues their [ __ ] and

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.480
they that's why they attacked him so

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.000
most of the media

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.839
is is covering up for them all the

01:02:37.839 --> 01:02:38.960
[ __ ] time because they don't like

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:41.760
trump and they mistakenly believe that

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.119
you know these kids are fighting the

01:02:43.119 --> 01:02:44.880
good fight the way the republicans used

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:48.079
to take advantage of religious people

01:02:48.079 --> 01:02:50.640
used to go oh yeah we i go to bob jones

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.319
university to talk to some wingnut who

01:02:52.319 --> 01:02:54.400
thinks [ __ ] uh yeah

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.680
you know interracial marriage should be

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.440
illegal and it's like but they're good

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.640
folks

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.079
this is what the democrats did with

01:03:00.079 --> 01:03:01.359
these [ __ ] people but what they don't

01:03:01.359 --> 01:03:03.680
understand is these people hate them

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.599
more than they hate that kid with the

01:03:05.599 --> 01:03:06.960
rifle even

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.760
yeah you hate regular liberals they hate

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:11.440
you if you're just a liberal they hate

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.359
you and they are gonna give liberals get

01:03:13.359 --> 01:03:15.599
the bullet too is the uh saying that

01:03:15.599 --> 01:03:18.160
goes around and every [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.000
jon stewart era liberal i know has not

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.280
gotten it through their dumb [ __ ]

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.640
head

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.480
because they either get their news from

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:27.119
cnn msnbc one of these places

01:03:27.119 --> 01:03:29.200
and they just want to feel normal again

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:30.880
and they don't get that the thing that

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.640
felt normal for all these years was bad

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:34.480
and there was a reason that a piece of

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.799
[ __ ] like trump came in and he's just

01:03:36.799 --> 01:03:38.319
the symptom he's not it's not going to

01:03:38.319 --> 01:03:40.559
be cool once he's gone shit's not going

01:03:40.559 --> 01:03:42.160
to be cool after that

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:44.000
they're not going to give you medicare

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.680
and they're not going to [ __ ]

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:46.960
relieve your student loan they're not

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.280
going to do any of that [ __ ] so it's

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.039
idiotic to be like we just got to get

01:03:51.039 --> 01:03:52.160
trump out

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.839
because you the the incentive you made

01:03:53.839 --> 01:03:55.520
is now for them to do nothing to help

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.799
you

01:03:56.799 --> 01:03:57.839
like what is it going to do for you to

01:03:57.839 --> 01:03:59.039
get trump out here's what i asked like

01:03:59.039 --> 01:04:00.160
how is it going to help me to get trump

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:02.319
out how's that it would help it would

01:04:02.319 --> 01:04:04.160
probably help me now i'm not going to

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.920
i'm not going to no i'm asking i'm not

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.520
saying this

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:11.119
it would it might help uh

01:04:11.119 --> 01:04:14.079
with the cancel culture [ __ ] chilling

01:04:14.079 --> 01:04:16.000
out a little it might help with that i

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.839
don't believe that for two seconds that

01:04:17.839 --> 01:04:19.119
should happen to me before there was

01:04:19.119 --> 01:04:20.720
cold cancel culture

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.960
yeah so so this is this is what i'm

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.400
talking about this is the coddling

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:27.119
nonsense i don't mean you are caught but

01:04:27.119 --> 01:04:28.880
okay you're not the first dude you

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.079
you're at least the fifth or sixth

01:04:30.079 --> 01:04:32.079
person to say that they think that these

01:04:32.079 --> 01:04:33.280
people are going to calm down when

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:35.599
trump's gone and it's just trump's fault

01:04:35.599 --> 01:04:36.480
no

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:38.000
no no see that's the thing i i don't

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.400
think it's trump's fault i think i i

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.319
know the statistics of the police

01:04:42.319 --> 01:04:44.400
brutality i noticed the police this

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.000
statistic of police brutality under

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.559
obama and under trump right i know that

01:04:48.559 --> 01:04:50.240
i know it's not trump oh i don't know

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.520
this statistic because i mean you know

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.119
more than look you can look them up it's

01:04:53.119 --> 01:04:55.599
it's pretty clear it's magical they're

01:04:55.599 --> 01:04:57.440
comparable and they're the same

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.359
i think they're comparable but also

01:04:59.359 --> 01:05:01.440
declining

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.440
right just time-wise it has nothing to

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.880
do with who the [ __ ] the president is by

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:06.000
the way there's a huge problem with

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.760
police brutality that has been ongoing

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.680
for many years and and this is what's

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:11.359
crazy i don't know anybody that thinks

01:05:11.359 --> 01:05:13.200
that there's not

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.880
okay i don't know anyone

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.880
that thinks there's not a huge problem

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.960
with police brutality that stems from

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:21.440
one their [ __ ] corrupt union and the

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.599
you know covering for your friend

01:05:23.599 --> 01:05:25.200
yeah in the police

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.440
like i'm like sex path sets for yeah

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.599
yeah yeah i'm not a cop

01:05:29.599 --> 01:05:31.359
in the department with somebody that do

01:05:31.359 --> 01:05:32.720
you understand like i don't i see them

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.400
once or twice at a club that's not like

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.680
a

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.520
it's not anything for me to be involved

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:40.079
meanwhile meanwhile if a cop i knew that

01:05:40.079 --> 01:05:41.920
i was if i was a cop and another cop i

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:45.039
knew dated a 15 year old 20 years ago

01:05:45.039 --> 01:05:48.640
i'd be like yeah he can still work yeah

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:51.920
i mean i like i said i i'm not uh

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:54.799
i i don't understand uh how a thing that

01:05:54.799 --> 01:05:56.400
everybody agrees on which is that

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.000
there's a problem and why are the cops

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.599
too brutal because the laws are [ __ ]

01:05:59.599 --> 01:06:01.680
up the laws that they enacted are too

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:03.440
draconian and they're designed to put

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:04.799
people in jail and using this slave

01:06:04.799 --> 01:06:07.200
labor there's no call to fix that i'm

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.240
not hearing

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.520
you know i used to hear people say

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:10.960
abolish prisons and i was like that

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.720
doesn't sound like a good idea but it's

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:15.599
a better idea than abolish police that's

01:06:15.599 --> 01:06:17.440
a really stupid idea

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.839
yeah you know defund the police is a

01:06:19.839 --> 01:06:22.480
very stupid stupid idea there's nothing

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:24.400
good about that idea and if i ask

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:28.000
somebody they go well what it means is

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
that you take the money that was going

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.480
to police and instead use it from

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:34.240
you already lost [ __ ] if you have to

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.920
explain what it means

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.359
it's like explaining a joke it's not

01:06:37.359 --> 01:06:38.799
funny

01:06:38.799 --> 01:06:40.480
if you have to explain that it doesn't

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.400
mean the thing that you just said your

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:45.119
slogan sucks

01:06:45.119 --> 01:06:46.400
know like when believe women came out

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:48.079
and they go it doesn't mean believe all

01:06:48.079 --> 01:06:49.760
women yeah believe it or not get that

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:52.400
out of your stupid [ __ ] mouth and the

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:53.599
fact that

01:06:53.599 --> 01:06:55.039
i'm supposed i'm supposed to suss out

01:06:55.039 --> 01:06:57.119
what it really means because you encoded

01:06:57.119 --> 01:06:59.280
it on purpose to create barriers for

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.280
people yeah so that's what this [ __ ] so

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.039
all the stupid [ __ ] everybody i know

01:07:03.039 --> 01:07:05.359
that's a friends of mine who are not

01:07:05.359 --> 01:07:06.880
they're not even stupid but they're dumb

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:08.720
about this or they got a blind spot

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.240
about it

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.480
is they all think abolish the police

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:14.720
doesn't mean that like no that would be

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.400
crazy what it means is for the police to

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.440
be better

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:17.770
and

01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:18.880
[Music]

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:21.119
yeah and then you can go look up the

01:07:21.119 --> 01:07:22.640
people saying they go no when we say it

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.240
we mean abolish the police they're

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.359
telling you what they mean explicitly

01:07:27.359 --> 01:07:29.200
okay and they just ignore it they ignore

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.559
it they ignore it because i think

01:07:30.559 --> 01:07:32.240
they're having i think they think it's

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.200
cool

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.559
i think

01:07:34.559 --> 01:07:36.160
i know well just the people i know

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.359
there's a lot of people that are like

01:07:37.359 --> 01:07:39.280
half they're they're not real they're

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.119
not real

01:07:41.119 --> 01:07:42.640
they're not really about this life

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.799
they're very much like here's a cool

01:07:44.799 --> 01:07:47.760
propaganda poster of like a panther off

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:50.400
a chain where it says defund the police

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:53.119
and it's fun for me to post as a guy as

01:07:53.119 --> 01:07:55.359
a white guy who lives in brooklyn

01:07:55.359 --> 01:07:57.680
well it's weird i mean

01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:58.720
it's the same

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.400
it's the same exact

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.640
it's the same exact

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.680
mo that leads that kid to be like we got

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:08.240
overwatch great tactical awareness all

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.480
that it's the exact same thing it's it's

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:14.480
it's me i think i'm large

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.799
yeah true those guys are overwatch hey

01:08:16.799 --> 01:08:20.480
nice job on the overwatch gary

01:08:20.719 --> 01:08:22.080
really let him down i don't have an

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:23.679
issue with him people like how dare he

01:08:23.679 --> 01:08:25.199
say that i've been watching for the past

01:08:25.199 --> 01:08:26.719
three years

01:08:26.719 --> 01:08:28.799
antifa people saying the exact same [ __ ]

01:08:28.799 --> 01:08:30.719
and i've been having people for sure i'm

01:08:30.719 --> 01:08:33.359
listening to people playing with them

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:35.359
comrades terrible yeah they sucked when

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:37.359
they said i don't know but but

01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:39.679
so the bottom line is somebody's gonna

01:08:39.679 --> 01:08:41.920
have to do something if it was my shop

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.440
i'd be like yeah go go ahead and have

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.359
overwatch over my store i got no problem

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:46.319
with that yeah i don't care what you

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:47.359
call it

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:48.400
so

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:50.080
that's people like how how could they

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.000
even get involved and [ __ ] also the

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.239
uh the korean rooftop dudes in the

01:08:54.239 --> 01:08:56.880
[ __ ] la rides ruled also

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.799
you remember those guys anybody who

01:08:58.799 --> 01:09:00.400
thinks that

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:02.560
dude honestly like i don't know how i

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.799
mean that is an ammo shortage supposedly

01:09:04.799 --> 01:09:07.040
because so many people bought guns

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:07.839
but

01:09:07.839 --> 01:09:09.040
here's here's what i think is going to

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.480
happen is trump's going to win and it's

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.199
going to be crazy it's going to be crazy

01:09:13.199 --> 01:09:14.560
and you're going to see people driving

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.239
out from the suburbs to

01:09:16.239 --> 01:09:20.080
shoot at antifa people

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:21.440
you're gonna see that yeah yeah you're

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:23.040
gonna see a lot of militias be like it's

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.400
gonna be a lot of those what you just

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:25.679
saw with that problem you know the

01:09:25.679 --> 01:09:28.239
people for uh that were marching on for

01:09:28.239 --> 01:09:29.279
covid and they came out with their

01:09:29.279 --> 01:09:30.719
rifles and they're like look at these

01:09:30.719 --> 01:09:33.199
militia everybody's like oh he's militia

01:09:33.199 --> 01:09:34.960
well i used to say that before i saw

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:37.679
what what the authorities uh just allow

01:09:37.679 --> 01:09:38.960
to happen

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.199
from people who aren't even organized

01:09:41.199 --> 01:09:42.560
that doesn't that's not a good selling

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.560
point like could you like if you're an

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:46.239
antifa could you organize into a militia

01:09:46.239 --> 01:09:47.679
and have some order

01:09:47.679 --> 01:09:49.120
and not just have a bunch of [ __ ]

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:51.040
retards from seattle just do whatever

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.799

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.800
middle of philadelphia

they popped up the exact time as jazz

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.199
and it is definitely like those people

01:10:41.199 --> 01:10:42.719
are they still there

01:10:42.719 --> 01:10:46.480
i believe they are wow

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:49.120
hillary has a slight jazz yeah

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.560
i mean philly

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:52.239
i got news for you philly the entire

01:10:52.239 --> 01:10:54.560
city is a kind of jazz since since i

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.560
went

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.159
i told you my ex-girlfriend her parents

01:10:58.159 --> 01:11:00.719
uh they teach at outside of philly

01:11:00.719 --> 01:11:04.080
uh in a college and now they do active

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:06.640
shooter training at these schools

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:08.560
right in case there's a shooter and yeah

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.400
they told these people flat out all the

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.840
faculty they're like if there's an

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:13.280
active shooter the response time is

going to be about 45 minutes

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:18.400
so we suggest you buy a gun

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:19.840
that's that's their tip from law

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:21.040
enforcement for their active shooter

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:23.120
training in philadelphia because philly

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.719
is not nearly as safe as new york was

01:11:26.719 --> 01:11:28.960
filled with cops all the [ __ ] time

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:31.360
now i was like for example thought stop

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.719
and frisk was like

01:11:32.719 --> 01:11:34.800
absolutely not acceptable like i i don't

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.080
even understand how people could try to

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:38.239
argue for that and i know people that

01:11:38.239 --> 01:11:40.080
did and they're hypocrites because i'm

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:42.080
big on having my rights okay and i don't

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:43.120
care if there's a lot of crime in my

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.719
neighborhood you don't get to randomly

01:11:44.719 --> 01:11:46.880
stop me and [ __ ] my and if that was

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.719
happening to white people this [ __ ]

01:11:48.719 --> 01:11:50.320
would have because white people showed

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.320
up with guns and i'd be for it i'd say

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.920
good threaten the [ __ ] government but

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:55.600
they they can't do this

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:58.000
those guys that marched over the kovid

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.239
quarantine that's the only reason the

01:12:00.239 --> 01:12:02.000
other marches got to happen because

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.600
those people opened the way up because

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.960
they showed up with guns and scared the

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:06.480
government

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:08.640
that's the only way the guns that's

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:10.320
right i know they would have let them

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.600
they would have let them if you say it's

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.920
for black people the government has to

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.280
be like

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:16.880
there's no way a government official

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.480
could shut that down you're not figuring

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:20.880
in the cove at 19. this was like a big

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.480
thing i know but disease after they

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:23.760
brought the ground on that see here's

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:24.880
the bottom line

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:27.600
the the and i don't mean blm the group

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.679
the organization those three chicks

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:31.040
i'm talking about just people that march

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:32.719
with it because a lot of people are like

01:12:32.719 --> 01:12:34.719
i'd like to not be murdered by cops and

01:12:34.719 --> 01:12:36.400
i'm black and i don't want black people

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:38.080
murdered by there's a lot of reasonable

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:39.679
people that are sincere and they're not

01:12:39.679 --> 01:12:41.840
trying to just break [ __ ]

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.840
um

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:46.000
that should be one protest those guys

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.239
those militia people in the that happen

01:12:48.239 --> 01:12:49.840
first and that should all be one because

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.360
it's all the same thing

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.199
it's all the same problem which is the

01:12:53.199 --> 01:12:54.800
government has

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:56.480
stomped down on all your rights to form

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:58.320
police and surveillance state

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.480
and nobody has a slogan about it to like

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:01.600
end

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:05.600
nobody's like end the nsa [ __ ] or like

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.120
it's what they do people aren't even

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.560
aware of what they do and you know why

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.080
you're not aware because if that's part

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.600
of the [ __ ] plan is to have this be a

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:12.960
racial thing

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.480
little shitty groups fight among

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:15.840
themselves

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.679
when they should be on the same side

01:13:17.679 --> 01:13:19.360
because that works for the people who

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.800
are in charge which is

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.880
all the corporations all the politic

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.560
it's it's one big

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:27.040
i know people say deep state and like

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:28.560
it is kind of but it's like this

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:30.640
handshake incest thing of

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.640
oh you used to work for so-and-so's

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:34.239
campaign now you work at our company

01:13:34.239 --> 01:13:35.679
yeah yeah and they just go back and

01:13:35.679 --> 01:13:37.120
forth and back and forth and it's not

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.600
considered bad or

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:40.800
like they don't even see what's wrong

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.880
with that in fact they feel hurt and

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:45.360
attacked that trump who by the way

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:47.440
didn't fix it at all would say anything

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:48.880
about it and make people think that

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.159
because they're like no this is just how

01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:51.199
it works

01:13:51.199 --> 01:13:53.920
and then my kid gets to sit uh on the

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:55.520
foreign energy company for 30 grand a

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.880
month

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.800
people sit on energy boards people

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.400
haven't forgotten that [ __ ] so

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.760
and the people i haven't forgotten are

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:04.080
not stupid kids that don't vote they're

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.000
people that own property

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.320
that's who [ __ ]

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.000
you know like that's who's gonna vote

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.080
and you're gonna see a bunch of people

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.600
lie this is just my prediction i could

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:14.400
be wrong

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.920
and and maybe it's good if i'm wrong

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:17.440
because

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.600
there won't be such crazy riots is what

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.440
i think

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.520
but um i doubt it but i [ __ ] doubt it

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:25.360
i i just think that they've blown it and

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.800
i think that

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.800
anybody watching is not being full only

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.719
idiot only city people

01:14:30.719 --> 01:14:33.120
okay los angeles new york people are in

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.040
this still head space that yeah it's

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:37.440
basically a good protest and it's not

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:38.480
violent

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:40.880
people say that that thing fiery but

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:43.040
mostly peaceful i promise you that's

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:44.640
what what

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:46.320
democratic supporters think in their

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.199
head

01:14:47.199 --> 01:14:49.199
it's fiery but mostly yes some but

01:14:49.199 --> 01:14:50.400
they're angry

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.640
so yes some shit's gonna be broken and

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:53.600
it's okay

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:54.800
they're all the same it's the same as

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:56.560
when we went to iraq it's like yeah some

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.920
people get blown up that didn't do

01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:59.840
anything but it's for the best you can't

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.360
make an omelette without breaking some

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.840
eggs you're gonna make an omelette you

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:04.800
want to know

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.880
break a couple eggs that's they all say

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:07.679
that

01:15:07.679 --> 01:15:09.440
because they they're sure they're not

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.600
going to be the [ __ ] eggs

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:14.000
right it's easy to say that like yeah me

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.840
too anyone who says anything you just

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:17.600
believe them and the person should lose

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:18.719
their entire because somebody said

01:15:18.719 --> 01:15:19.840
something

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:20.880
because they can't imagine it could

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:22.560
happen to them and that's how black

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:25.360
people got victimized repeatedly because

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:27.280
nobody could imagine but now

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:28.880
it is happening to lots of people and

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.400
they're noticing it it's not you know

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:31.679
what i mean

01:15:31.679 --> 01:15:33.600
like and they're also noticing there's

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.840
no [ __ ] omelette coming

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:36.800
this is the

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.400
big lie like okay where's the oh there

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.760

01:15:42.239 --> 01:15:44.560
those people did you want some omelette

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:46.719
oh yeah the omelet's not for you that's

01:15:46.719 --> 01:15:48.719

01:15:48.719 --> 01:15:50.400
the omelets for like yeah you're the

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:52.000

yeah so as long as you're uh uh

01:15:54.239 --> 01:15:55.600
so now so this is what i'm saying like

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:56.800
what are the democrats offering so

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.480
they're not gonna fix every single city

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:00.640
run by democrats is a [ __ ] disaster

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:02.000
there's not a single one that's not a

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.920
disaster okay

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:05.600
and all the people live there i've been

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.199
new york for many years and by now you

01:16:07.199 --> 01:16:09.199
live in stupid [ __ ] la

01:16:09.199 --> 01:16:10.400
people are fleeing la and they're

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.760
fleeing the rich people already knew to

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:12.800
get out

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:13.600
yeah

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.760
barack obama already knows not to not to

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:18.239
donate to joe biden's campaign

01:16:18.239 --> 01:16:20.080
yeah right like obama the obamas have

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:22.239
donated no money to his campaign

01:16:22.239 --> 01:16:24.960
really yeah and also in private obama's

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:27.040
like i don't think he should run

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:29.280
yeah yeah that's all like open reported

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.280
so why is obama not spending any of his

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:34.400
sweet sweet netflix money to help in the

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:37.120
most important election ever all his

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:40.719
cuties money papa obama the good one why

01:16:40.719 --> 01:16:42.320
is he not like this is so important i'm

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:43.920
gonna give joe biden because joe biden

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:45.440
is a [ __ ] fuck-up that's not

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:47.360
qualified to do anything and obama knows

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.440
it and you the idiots at home are

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:51.760
supposed to buy into this [ __ ]

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:53.280
but the bottom line is if it was that

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:55.600
dire the only thing that's dire is uh

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.199
democrats are going to be a bad

01:16:57.199 --> 01:16:58.320
investment

01:16:58.320 --> 01:16:59.679
for rich people from now on because

01:16:59.679 --> 01:17:01.120
they've been the rich people party for

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.400
quite some time

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:04.560
and now all the money that got lost on

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:06.480
hillary all these people lost a lot of

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:08.320
money on [ __ ] yeah

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.480
and now if they lose again guess what

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:12.080
the democrats don't

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:13.920
the donors aren't aren't into them and

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:15.440
they must have lost that was like a two

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:17.840
to one odds bet on hillary though that's

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:19.199
all that's white

01:17:19.199 --> 01:17:21.040
it's not dire for you you're not going

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.360
to get health care either way

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:24.800
yeah you're saying you're not getting

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.080
[ __ ] that's what i love like the most

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.159
vulnerable in our society people can't

01:17:28.159 --> 01:17:29.520
go to the doctor like me is that what

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:31.520
you meant by the most vulnerable yeah or

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:33.360
just the trans teens well i'm still not

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:34.960
clear they won't be able to serve in the

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:37.360
military what is the

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.360
thing at stake for them

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.199
yeah we're gonna need the transiting

01:17:41.199 --> 01:17:43.360
national guard to shut down black lives

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:45.600
matter do the people that i know

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:47.199
personally premium friends and are

01:17:47.199 --> 01:17:48.400
people a lot of my like they're not

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:49.920
people that i'm like calling them names

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:51.120
something yeah they're po they're

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:53.120
tweeting [ __ ] like

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:54.880
oh people when are people gonna wake up

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:57.600
the trump as a con man they know

01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.600
they know trump is a con man they think

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.679
you're an idiot and they hate your side

01:18:01.679 --> 01:18:03.440
and you're a dumb rich [ __ ] you have

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:05.600
no idea what people go through and yet

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.520
you see fit to judge them and call them

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:09.600
names because you happen to get luck

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:10.960
even while you pretend to be some kind

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:13.360
of socialist that's that's why they're

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.520
not fooled just because they're just

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:16.800
cause they're not fooled by trump

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:18.320
doesn't mean they're fooled by you you

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.560
[ __ ] and they literally believe that

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.159
people can't remember

01:18:22.159 --> 01:18:24.640
things that happened five minutes ago

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:25.679
that's why i'm saying smart to have

01:18:25.679 --> 01:18:27.520
nicholas salmon on because i was like i

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:28.800
hope that kid gets a settlement that's

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.560
[ __ ] up what they did to him yeah it

01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:32.080
was good that trump has

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:34.400
people who got crushed who have bad

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:37.280
teeth that's who you want to show

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.120
if you want to win because most of the

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.199
people are the bad teeth people the fat

01:18:41.199 --> 01:18:43.040
ugly people everybody talks bad about on

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.800
the coast you know yeah what's most of

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:45.920
the people

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:47.280
that they've all thrown away that

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:48.320
they're all like well they're just

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.560
garbage i mean most of them are probably

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:52.960
white anyway so [ __ ] them well you can

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:54.320
say that but you can only do it with the

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.000
majority of the population that's going

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:56.800
to

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:59.520
probably have some blowback for you

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:00.640
and that's what's going to happen and

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:02.640
then what happens another thing that

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:04.400
happens especially these celebrities are

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:05.760
like all these people they put out a

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:07.840
tweet condemning those the ugly people

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.280
with bad teeth

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.920
is then they mock their [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:13.600
yeah but you get pat on the back on

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:16.080
twitter like right so yesterday

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.640
yesterday a guy named max kellerman he

01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:21.360
hosts a show on espn he was talking

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:24.159
about how if the sec so that's you know

01:19:24.159 --> 01:19:25.600
the sec

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.679
florida georgia mississippi alabama all

01:19:27.679 --> 01:19:29.520
those if they lose college football

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:31.040
that'll be something that gets their

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:33.440
attention because he basically went on

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.280
to talk about how people from the south

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:37.840
are very easily susceptible to

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:39.199
propaganda

01:19:39.199 --> 01:19:41.040
go along with all this [ __ ] this is

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:42.320
their religion

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.159
that you know basically the guns and

01:19:44.159 --> 01:19:46.480
religion thing obama you know that type

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:49.040
of thing great great idea to say that

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.760
and it's like so but then what happens

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:54.400
is on twitter everybody's like yo max

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:57.440
max calm and keep it at 100 awesome this

01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.199
guy's the best

01:19:59.199 --> 01:20:01.120
and then you see p you see you know the

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:02.080
ugly

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:04.159
[ __ ] up teeth people with their all of

01:20:04.159 --> 01:20:05.840
their [ __ ] profile pictures is them

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:07.040
in their car

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.080
like

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:10.560
they're tweeting like hey [ __ ] you like

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:12.320
it's not that they're all stupid this is

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:13.920
the blows my mind is like do you just

01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:15.280
genuinely think that like these people

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:18.320
are all just stupid and you just because

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:20.000
not a single person i know that's a

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.159
democrat in the last five years has said

01:20:22.159 --> 01:20:23.760
anything smart to me

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:25.920
about any i mean not one thing

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:27.840
every single one of them has said

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:29.280
something that was because they're a

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:31.520
coward and they don't want to lose their

01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:33.120
[ __ ] career

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.400
the most important thing because that's

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:35.920
what lets them be in that class so they

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:37.600
look down on people is their precious

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.440
[ __ ] great so that's all they give a

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:41.199
[ __ ] about and all the rest of it is for

01:20:41.199 --> 01:20:43.280
show and not one and you can tell us for

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:45.199
show because they're hypocrites in a

01:20:45.199 --> 01:20:48.080
dime they will say racist sexist

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.560
all the things they would condemn yeah

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.560
okay in fact all the people that come

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.000
out and condemn this [ __ ] all have a

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.280
record of blackface isn't that

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.760
interesting every [ __ ] comic that

01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:59.520
runs their [ __ ] mouth about some

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:01.679
democratic [ __ ] i've never done [ __ ]

01:21:01.679 --> 01:21:03.600
blackface how did i get through my whole

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:06.560
life in 43 years if yeah

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.800
never even had another comedy you never

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.320
saw the need to do [ __ ] full

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.320
blackface or any blackface how's that

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.480
possible yeah but all these sensitive

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:16.880
[ __ ] are all like oh it starts

01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.960
because they made their money they made

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.960
their blocks of course of course they

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:22.560
want to [ __ ] and that's why they lift

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.000
the blackface ladder

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.520
this is i'll tell you what sickens me

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:28.239
the most is comics who were like made

01:21:28.239 --> 01:21:30.400
their reputation being edgy now

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.800
pretending that they're [ __ ]

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:34.560
and we that's right the comedy has to

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:35.600
stop

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.280
like because you got rich saying

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:38.880
whatever the [ __ ] you wanted [ __ ] face

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:41.600
and you want to shut the door behind you

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:42.960
yeah it doesn't make sense it's fine

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:44.719
doesn't it suits you fine if everybody

01:21:44.719 --> 01:21:46.480
else has to watch what they say from

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:49.040
okay guys it's like uh yeah from now on

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:50.080
time out

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:52.000
i i told you i saw jeffrey at the emmys

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.679
jeffrey tambor when he wanted emmy for

01:21:53.679 --> 01:21:54.560
uh

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:56.480
what's that [ __ ] show no i don't even

01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:58.000
know who that guy is

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.520
what's uh bobby will you put up the

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:01.280
picture of it just a trans america or

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:04.159
something transparent it's transparent

01:22:04.159 --> 01:22:05.520
you're not familiar with oh yeah no i

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:07.600
know yeah yeah from arrested development

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.600
right so he won

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:10.719
got me too

01:22:10.719 --> 01:22:13.440
or something got me tooed by his trans

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:15.040
uh colleagues who said he sexually

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:17.040
harassed them which is a lie which i

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:18.960
promise you never happened he never said

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:20.800
she harassed them he's that was the

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:22.480
thing they made up because they resented

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.320
that he was the star of the show they

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.159
resented it and here's why he was and

01:22:26.159 --> 01:22:28.400
the show's not on anymore because

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:30.480
the only reason anyone was watching it

01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.639
is to see jeffrey tambor play that part

01:22:32.639 --> 01:22:34.159
no one gave a [ __ ] about the rest of

01:22:34.159 --> 01:22:36.239
them except people faking it for like

01:22:36.239 --> 01:22:39.040
any reasons okay yeah

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:41.840
nobody gives a [ __ ] about i promise you

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:43.440
nobody was like oh i heard there's a new

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:45.760
transit except if you're trans possibly

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:46.880
which understandable you want to see

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:49.199
some [ __ ] about your own life fine but

01:22:49.199 --> 01:22:50.480
if there's no way it would have been a

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:51.360
hit

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:53.120
and i didn't even believe it was a hit i

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:54.960
think every what i saw around me at the

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.480
emmys everybody just pretending they saw

01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:57.360
it

01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:58.880
because i didn't watch it nobody i know

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.320
watched it i don't believe anyone that

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:02.000
says they used to watch it

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.080
maybe a few tv execs you know were

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:05.840
people who were trying to analyze why

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:07.840
something got picked up maybe but for

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.760
the most part nobody watched the [ __ ]

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:11.600
and so [ __ ] uh

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.280
uh jeffrey tambor gives a speech and he

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:15.920
goes if i because thank you and he goes

01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:17.360
it's so important you know it's so

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:19.040
important that he plays this part and

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:21.280
tells these stories and he's and he goes

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:24.560
if i were the last cis man ever to play

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:27.199
a trans woman it wouldn't make me sad

01:23:27.199 --> 01:23:29.600
everybody

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:31.920
jeffrey i just remember watching and i

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:33.199
thought to myself

01:23:33.199 --> 01:23:35.040
you coll i just i'm looking around like

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:37.920
you collection of [ __ ] [ __ ] that

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:40.159
didn't even watch this show

01:23:40.159 --> 01:23:42.159
that's it looked like al jolson giving a

01:23:42.159 --> 01:23:44.159
speech this is the at the time before

01:23:44.159 --> 01:23:45.040
this

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:47.280
i go it would be like if al jolson came

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:49.440
out and said if i was the last white man

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:51.520
to do blackface i wouldn't be i wouldn't

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:53.120
be sad

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:55.040
just please now that i've made my

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:57.040
fortune in blackface let me be the last

01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:00.320
man the last question that's that's why

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:03.199
i'll believe

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:06.000
oh my god it between playing a trans or

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.239
a [ __ ] that's the bravest thing

01:24:08.239 --> 01:24:09.760
that i can imagine

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:11.840
hollywood they all did that everybody

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.280
around me and i'm like okay so you're

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:14.960
all i mean it shouldn't be a revelation

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:16.000
that they're all [ __ ] full of [ __ ]

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:16.800
but

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.159
yeah

01:24:18.159 --> 01:24:20.400
and it's funny then he got and so i was

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:21.840
thinking that like that's a weird thing

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:23.120
of him to say

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:24.159
you know

01:24:24.159 --> 01:24:25.920
like i should be the last one but not

01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:27.679
until i'm done and i've done at least a

01:24:27.679 --> 01:24:30.000
few more seasons and gotten my my money

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.520
out of it well it turns out a bunch of

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:33.520
transactions thought what i thought

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:35.360
and that's why they conspired to make a

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:36.880
fake

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:38.639
i don't believe any of them it's

01:24:38.639 --> 01:24:40.080
completely made up and i know their

01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:41.199
motive what would be their motive to

01:24:41.199 --> 01:24:43.040
like to get them off the [ __ ] show

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:45.760
because why aren't i because i mean

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:47.600
these are people that are like i'm the

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:50.560
star these are like the most demented

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:52.000
do you the mindset

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.840
of love of like

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.480
i'm ready for my close up now mister

01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:59.199
what's up

01:24:59.199 --> 01:25:01.440
yeah it's like the worst of a of a woman

01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:05.360
from the 30s and uh and a gay man

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:06.480
you know what i mean that's who these

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:07.920
[ __ ] other performers are they're

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:10.840
like that drag queen nonsense like

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.960
so their narcissism isn't going to

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:15.199
tolerate his narcissism plague and

01:25:15.199 --> 01:25:16.320
they're going to conspire here's the

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.000
thing nobody heard of you [ __ ]

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.199
who gave a [ __ ] they want to see jeffrey

01:25:19.199 --> 01:25:20.880
tambor he's the famous one in fact

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:23.280
that's why these actors that's why john

01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:26.320
wayne played genghis khan even though

01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:28.400
terrible casting because the people who

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:29.679
make movies are like people want to see

01:25:29.679 --> 01:25:31.199
john wayne

01:25:31.199 --> 01:25:34.800
okay and by the way even like that one

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:35.760
this is why i don't believe that

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.760
everybody is that racist that they can't

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:40.880
handle an asian playing genghis khan

01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:43.280
the people at top on hollywood who run

01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:45.040
the [ __ ] they're the ones that made that

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:47.120
up because they look down on everyone

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.880
they call it fly over country and they

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.239
go oh they're so racist they don't want

01:25:50.239 --> 01:25:51.679
to see a black person playing a black

01:25:51.679 --> 01:25:53.520
person and that's what they just want to

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:56.239
see celebs and they mistakenly believe

01:25:56.239 --> 01:25:58.480
everybody worships celebrities

01:25:58.480 --> 01:25:59.840
as much as they do

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.360
so they're going to [ __ ] oh that was

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:04.080
that was quibby's mistake

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:04.880
dude

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:06.239
they were just like yo how about we just

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:09.520
buy it

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:11.280
and everyone's like we don't need to see

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.480
the rock

01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:14.239

her on something but i know she gets

01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:58.880
shoved in people's faces and they're

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:01.199

01:27:01.199 --> 01:27:02.880
fed because we must love john legend

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:04.480
john legend is like

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:06.480
the neil degrasse tyson of music for

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:08.239
certain white people yes

01:27:08.239 --> 01:27:09.199
you know

01:27:09.199 --> 01:27:10.639
he's like oh that's another guy dude i

01:27:10.639 --> 01:27:12.320
was thinking it's like john legend has

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:13.280
like

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.600
no hits

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:18.080
i know he's astroturfed no he has with

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:19.440
upper class

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:22.480
toffs basically yeah he's got a great

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:24.159
voice that's what this is like

01:27:24.159 --> 01:27:25.760
ultimately all this shit's about the

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.760
election it's uh judge smails versus

01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:29.440
rodney dangerfield

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:31.679
not that trump is uh as lovable as

01:27:31.679 --> 01:27:34.800
rodney but it's the same

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:37.280
he's lowering the tone

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:39.679
he's you know this is this is would

01:27:39.679 --> 01:27:42.000
lower the tone of your snls we can't

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.280
true

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:45.679
true it's it's almost like

01:27:45.679 --> 01:27:47.120
now this is a very simple version of it

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.719
but like

01:27:48.719 --> 01:27:49.600
i

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:52.480
my dad for example he likes trump so

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:54.639
like he likes to watch that yeah

01:27:54.639 --> 01:27:56.880
uh he you can you can still get him to

01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:58.880
admit that he thinks trump's like a

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:02.400
[ __ ] or like a guy that's like

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:03.679
because i'm like you know what nobody

01:28:03.679 --> 01:28:05.120
[ __ ] like you know that guy sucks

01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.639
right and he's like yeah that guy sucks

01:28:06.639 --> 01:28:08.000
like he'll still be like yeah that guy

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.760
sucks it's just that they love seeing

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:11.920
the other side so upset yeah that's it

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:14.560
nobody [ __ ]

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.159
they're probably just [ __ ] and leave

01:28:18.159 --> 01:28:19.199
them alone

01:28:19.199 --> 01:28:20.960
yes most of the people

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:23.520
[ __ ] won they hate wokeness

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:24.800
and i don't understand how this isn't

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.880
the clearest thing to everyone

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:28.880
you're never gonna win with woke

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:29.920
[ __ ]

01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:32.000
it's not the new way it's gonna be

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.320
no one's accepting that [ __ ] okay even

01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:36.000
if you have because you're like i said

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.080
liberals are weak and stupid and they

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:39.520
like to feel like they're in the clique

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:41.280
and they're like well john legend is

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:42.800
woke and i mean i want to be on the john

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:44.080
legend side

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:46.159
yes john legend in common i want to go

01:28:46.159 --> 01:28:47.920
to a party and john legend is there and

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:49.280
[ __ ] that's all these [ __ ] people

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:50.480
think is the most important [ __ ] in the

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.000
world

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.280
so that's they all

01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:56.320
it's like they think people are

01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:58.320
influencers that aren't or they they

01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:00.000
misunder and by the way the thing of

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.159
being influenced by celebrity because

01:29:02.159 --> 01:29:04.159
these people are influenced by celebrity

01:29:04.159 --> 01:29:05.600
that's because they're part of the

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:07.280
leisure class

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:08.480
these are a bunch of people that can

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:10.400
afford to give a [ __ ]

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:12.800
about john or go oh that's billy porter

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:13.760
great

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:16.080
that's that's broadway rich people [ __ ]

01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:17.760
okay that's not something billy eilish

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:20.400
did you see billy eilish she gave a

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:22.719
can we see billy eilish's speech bobby i

01:29:22.719 --> 01:29:24.480
would like to see it actually

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:27.440
yeah that's good why well again i'm not

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:29.360
for trump i'm just telling you why he's

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.840
going to [ __ ] them because of this [ __ ]

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:33.760
we put billy eilish i forgot i wanted to

01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:34.960
watch that speech and i didn't get

01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:36.560
around to it it's a good one it's

01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:37.760
powerful it's like the gettysburg

01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:39.760
address level of like

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:42.080
really historic significance it's good

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:44.800
you think it's toonberg powerful

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:47.600
i think there's going to be a statue

01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:50.080
in this haunted haunted forest where she

01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:52.400
delivered this

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.840
three of the democratic convention

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:56.880
happened last night a comment wait i

01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:58.400
[ __ ] hate this [ __ ]

01:29:58.400 --> 01:29:59.840
see these people these are the this is

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:01.280
the class of people that doesn't get it

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:02.960
right there you see you can tell by the

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:04.159
guy's hair

01:30:04.159 --> 01:30:05.679
that's the classic people that have no

01:30:05.679 --> 01:30:07.920
idea about anything

01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:09.360
it's like the billy bush class they're

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:11.920
like wow that was electric thanks john

01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:13.760
legend

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.760
so powerful um

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:17.679
yeah i want to see the actual what billy

01:30:17.679 --> 01:30:19.280
eilish had to say

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:20.719
because in their mind and this is

01:30:20.719 --> 01:30:22.960
because it's they're also like you know

01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:24.400
they're such the party it's because

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:25.840
hollywood so that's why it's the party

01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:27.840
of pedophiles the most although there's

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:29.679
so i don't want to imply there's not a

01:30:29.679 --> 01:30:31.280
ton of pedophiles in the republican

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:32.159
party

01:30:32.159 --> 01:30:33.760
yeah yeah no i don't mean to imply that

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:34.800
but

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:37.760
the worship of youth at all costs

01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:41.440
is um is the hollywood thing

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:44.159
and hating your own nose

01:30:44.159 --> 01:30:45.920
things are a mess

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:48.159

about doing things that they want done

01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:22.719
such as relieving their student loans

01:33:22.719 --> 01:33:24.880
that are making them enraged

you don't have to know

01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:25.040
like here's what i know i'm predicting

01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:26.159

yourself it's gonna be wrong it's

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:34.080
embarrassing

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:35.199
so so

01:34:35.199 --> 01:34:37.199
i don't know i it's it's sad dude again

01:34:37.199 --> 01:34:38.800
i'm just curious when i talk because

01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:40.560
like on especially my podcast i'll talk

01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:42.719
to a bunch of friends like i said i'm

01:34:42.719 --> 01:34:44.719
liberal i'm not

01:34:44.719 --> 01:34:46.639
right-wing everybody i know is a

01:34:46.639 --> 01:34:48.800
new york liberal type person and i'm

01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.639
just it gets frustrating it's very

01:34:50.639 --> 01:34:52.639
frustrating well just i'm curious what

01:34:52.639 --> 01:34:54.639
people think is gonna happen so it's

01:34:54.639 --> 01:34:55.920
it's usually that it makes them

01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:57.199
uncomfortable to think about which i

01:34:57.199 --> 01:34:58.560
can't blame i don't like to watch any of

01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:00.880
this [ __ ] and they just wanted to feel

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:02.480
normal again like when it was obama

01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:04.159
times and then they have pie in the sky

01:35:04.159 --> 01:35:06.719
ideas like and maybe uh once we get them

01:35:06.719 --> 01:35:08.320
out maybe they'll get us uh healthcare

01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:10.480
and then you know maybe all the sjws

01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:13.280
will stop being sjws and and they're

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:15.040
because they've spent all this time

01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:17.119
avoiding what this [ __ ] is

01:35:17.119 --> 01:35:19.360
like just simple realities and america

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:21.360
is like brazil now and it has been for

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:23.760
some time it's like a this is a

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:26.239
shantytown [ __ ]

01:35:26.239 --> 01:35:28.480
banana republic that we've lived in for

01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:29.440
years

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:30.880
and people that are fortunate enough to

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:33.119
work enough don't don't get it because

01:35:33.119 --> 01:35:35.440
they haven't seen it themselves but lots

01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:36.719
of other people know

01:35:36.719 --> 01:35:38.080
and a lot of people pretend that they're

01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:39.360
doing fine are not doing fine they're

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:40.480
just like don't want to look like

01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:42.320
they're losers but but the bottom line

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:43.600
is most of the people don't have what

01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:46.080
they need so you can't like

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:48.000
oh is it important why what's joe but

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.920
okay did you hear anything in what she

01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:52.960
said about what joe biden's going to do

01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:55.280
is save us it starts with defeating

01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:57.920
trump okay what happens after that

01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:00.320
nothing it's just really important okay

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:02.320
thanks thanks for the info

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:05.280
something something systematic racism

01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:06.800
i'm gonna babble the words that i was

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:09.440
taught and [ __ ]

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:11.040
by the way all those were all those

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:12.480
nonsense terms

01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:14.159
that now if you have a corporate job

01:36:14.159 --> 01:36:15.840
they make you take a class to learn that

01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:18.080
[ __ ]

01:36:18.159 --> 01:36:19.119
jesus

01:36:19.119 --> 01:36:20.960
because that's a company's way of

01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:22.719
indemnifying themselves against being

01:36:22.719 --> 01:36:25.040
accused of racism you'd like this i was

01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:27.360
listening to uh see i told you i hate

01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:29.520
listen and watch a lot of stuff i listen

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:31.760
to uh there's a the number one podcast

01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:33.119
in the world right now is called nice

01:36:33.119 --> 01:36:34.560
white parents

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:38.000
yeah it's uh it's a new york times

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.159
i'm joking yeah nice white parents and

01:36:40.159 --> 01:36:42.480
it's about how white parents have ruined

01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:44.719
the public school system it's it's white

01:36:44.719 --> 01:36:46.239
parents

01:36:46.239 --> 01:36:48.400
uh i you know i kind of forget what's

01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:50.320
happening really improved in the phone

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:52.239
okay yeah it's about how white parents

01:36:52.239 --> 01:36:55.840
like uh like zoning [ __ ] and

01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:57.520
i don't know these white the main point

01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.600
of the story is a bunch of

01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:01.840
white parents in new york

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:03.600
decided to bring all their kids to this

01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:05.280
one school they didn't want to go alone

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:06.480
they didn't want to send their only

01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:08.480
white kid one of the dudes was like a

01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:10.560
professional fundraiser he raised a ton

01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:12.239
of money for this so it's rich people

01:37:12.239 --> 01:37:14.719
again rich people it's rich people yeah

01:37:14.719 --> 01:37:15.520
but

01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:17.360
uh one of the crazy things was after a

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:20.639
couple years this one school had

01:37:20.639 --> 01:37:22.800
uh like committees that would go around

01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:23.679
like

01:37:23.679 --> 01:37:25.280
they were looking for racism in the

01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:28.400
school so they had they had adults

01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:31.040
that would walk in the halls and look

01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:33.440
into classrooms and take notes

01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:35.520
looking for [ __ ] racism dude well

01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:37.440
like what did they find like all right

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:39.679
so there's one lady reported back

01:37:39.679 --> 01:37:41.600
so they all went out to the halls looked

01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:43.600
in these classrooms this lady observed a

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:45.360
classroom and

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.360
observed that they were working in

01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:49.360
groups of three there was a white girl a

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.199
white boy and a black kid and the black

01:37:51.199 --> 01:37:53.199
kid got the answer first and the white

01:37:53.199 --> 01:37:55.520
girl looked to the white boy

01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:57.520
first to see if

01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:00.080
she should raise her hand for the group

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:01.920
so the this is what this maniac goes

01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:04.880
back and reports and she's like now

01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:06.880
i don't know that classroom so maybe the

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:09.360
the the black boy i'm talking about was

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.760
uh he's typically wrong

01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:13.199
maybe that's it maybe she didn't trust

01:38:13.199 --> 01:38:14.880
him because he's [ __ ] why are you

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:17.040
putting a bureaucrat in the most minor

01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:19.760
of human interactions but then

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:22.400
then she goes or maybe

01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:24.239
does that white girl not even think he's

01:38:24.239 --> 01:38:25.440
human

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:28.239
and it's like maybe i mean who who knows

01:38:28.239 --> 01:38:30.080
i we can't read

01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:31.679
did you just bring that into the

01:38:31.679 --> 01:38:33.440
equation yeah they [ __ ]

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:36.320
they projected their nonsense

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:37.520
but yeah so

01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:39.119
take that job who's like i'm gonna go

01:38:39.119 --> 01:38:40.400
find the racism and every little

01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:42.480
interaction of children so that's right

01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:45.520
with a hyphenated

01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:48.639
dude by the way it's not money's not the

01:38:48.639 --> 01:38:50.880
[ __ ] issue you know they go like

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:52.080
because new york they spend the most

01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:54.080
money on school compared to new jersey

01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:55.840
has better schools in new york by a lot

01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:59.840
okay and and it why it's not because of

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:02.159
more money it's because

01:39:02.159 --> 01:39:04.800
corrupt [ __ ] officials and lunatics

01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:07.280
do their little pet projects and then

01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:09.040
the rich people don't have to put their

01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:11.360
kids in the same school as the ones

01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:12.719
where they're going to do this social

01:39:12.719 --> 01:39:14.880
experimentation their their kids get to

01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:17.280
go to like [ __ ] private schools and

01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:19.280
catholic so they're taking care of in

01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:20.400
the city

01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:21.440
the qualities because new jersey

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:22.800
everybody like i went to a school there

01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:24.159
was poor kids and there was rich kids in

01:39:24.159 --> 01:39:26.000
it everybody went to the school for

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.360
unless they went to catholic school but

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:28.320
for the most part everyone went to

01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:29.840
public school and the schools aren't

01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:31.199
going to be nice unless the rich [ __ ]

01:39:31.199 --> 01:39:33.280
have their kids in them

01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:34.400
otherwise they're going to suck out

01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:37.119
resources to give to their own [ __ ] so

01:39:37.119 --> 01:39:38.800
they created this situation and they

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:40.000
never instead of fixing it they

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.960
prescribe wackier and wackier [ __ ]

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:44.639
because that's how democrats run a

01:39:44.639 --> 01:39:47.040
[ __ ] city they suck at it

01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:49.199
suck at it

01:39:49.199 --> 01:39:51.440
hands down they suck at it like whatever

01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:53.520
you think about giuliani yeah no he was

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:55.440
the one that made it safe giuliani did

01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:57.760
that it wasn't dinkins before people it

01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:59.600
was actually now it wasn't it wasn't

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:01.600
dinkins it was giuliani putting a [ __ ]

01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:03.920
ton of cops and cracking down on people

01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:04.960
and a lot of it might have been

01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:06.480
violating their right but that's the

01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:09.040
nature of that city is that kind of [ __ ]

01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:10.560
so

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:12.639
it's going to get worse dude and and

01:40:12.639 --> 01:40:14.239
all the people live inside

01:40:14.239 --> 01:40:15.199
like

01:40:15.199 --> 01:40:16.719
yeah what do you think i don't know i

01:40:16.719 --> 01:40:17.920
mean so you

01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:19.280
do you think there should be you'd be

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:20.880
stupid to raise your kids in new york

01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:22.800
unless you were loaded

01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:24.719
yeah but even then i wouldn't do it

01:40:24.719 --> 01:40:26.159
because then they're gonna [ __ ] you

01:40:26.159 --> 01:40:27.040
know

01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:28.800
be like you ever seen kids that grew up

01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:30.639
in new york yeah they're [ __ ]

01:40:30.639 --> 01:40:32.880
lunatics they look like family

01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:35.360
yeah they have they're bizarrely more

01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:37.360
mature than you like

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:39.520
yeah yeah yeah who's like got over a

01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:41.520
coke habit when they were 15.

01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:43.440
they're all like old vampires like

01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:45.040
interview with them very uncomfortable

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:47.040
to be around yeah except they can't

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.199
drive or swim that's their one weakness

01:40:49.199 --> 01:40:50.639
yeah true

01:40:50.639 --> 01:40:52.880
like they've been to an orgy

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:54.000
and they've all got it was like the

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.480
movie kids the [ __ ] that they have yeah

01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:58.080
they're they're over it and they're

01:40:58.080 --> 01:40:59.440
dressed like they're from the 50s

01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:00.960
they're always wearing like vintage

01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:03.280
jackets and hats raised by shitty

01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:04.400
[ __ ]

01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:07.040
like lax liberal parents that [ __ ]

01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:08.560
try to be their friend

01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:10.239
you're like friend parents the worst

01:41:10.239 --> 01:41:11.920
parents that there are

01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:13.520
like religious lunatics are better

01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:15.760
parents than friend parents friend

01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:17.280
parents are like the lowest i mean i

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:19.119
can't really argue that's rough the

01:41:19.119 --> 01:41:20.719
white parents don't i can't even argue

01:41:20.719 --> 01:41:22.000
because that is a [ __ ] problem but

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.719
it's people that are rich do that

01:41:24.719 --> 01:41:25.520
yeah that kind of deal with the

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:26.880
uncomfortability of raising their own

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:28.159
kids they get like you know they get a

01:41:28.159 --> 01:41:29.600
filipino to breastfeed them and then

01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:32.000
they

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.520
send the baby away when it's bothering

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:35.280
