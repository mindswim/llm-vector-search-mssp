funny next long that wasn't it next

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.660
level for sure it was so next level that

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:39.140
people were like he's a Nazi

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.470

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.649
people that worked it not at Papa John's

00:08:56.649 --> 00:08:58.750
where was it dominoes dominoes made a

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:01.060
swastika out of pepperonis and personal

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.399
size there what size of this pie I'm

00:09:03.399 --> 00:09:05.050
imagining to get up like a decent

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.120
swastika it had to be pretty big I think

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.580
it was a little Caesars actually there's

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.370
little C Z's it was a swallow and a

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:15.250
stuffed crust or not that would be hard

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.680
to turn down to get a swastika beautiful

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.450
pepperoni pizza with a hate symbol on it

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:20.589
but it's stuffed crust and you're like

00:09:20.589 --> 00:09:23.020
I'm still I'm eating it this thing has a

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.730
swastika on it you're like really if I

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.070
ate a couple slices out of it yeah I

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:28.600
mean yeah now it's just kind of like

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.940
looks like a yes you have to preserve

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.700
the hate crime like Jesse you have to

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.410
wait till the proper authorities get

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.149
there they definitely did they

00:09:37.149 --> 00:09:38.980
definitely likes at a pizza on their

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.649
island in the kitchen Farrow till a cop

00:09:41.649 --> 00:09:43.450
showed up oh no they must have taken a

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:47.020
picture of it posted online you think do

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.850
you eat a swastika pizza or yeah are you

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.920
allowed to you have to you have to

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.300
destroy it basically like we have to

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.240
destroy this now true I bet if you were

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.709
gay enough to take a picture of it and

00:09:56.709 --> 00:09:57.970
report it for a hate crime you

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.770
definitely threw it the trash well get

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.990
this out of here drops America I'm not

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:04.209
eating this which obviously whoever did

00:10:04.209 --> 00:10:06.339
it yeah you'd be right not to eat a

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:10.260
swastika pizza but whatever else they do

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.940
it's a perfectly fine Pete not a lot of

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.010
symbology of the pepper like this could

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:18.430
be one of the Hindu ancient Hindu pizza

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.470
yeah there's definitely something I

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:22.480
would suspect if I saw swastika pizza I

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.920
might not eat it honest yeah there's

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.330
bewbs cuz you know you're getting like a

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.010
year lifetime I would actually settle

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.089

00:10:28.089 --> 00:10:29.620

they can probably sue you right if you

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.020

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.000

invest if you got cancelled they were

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.410

Papa John's thing happened they were

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.769
like we're investing in Papa John's

00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:04.170
stocks because they're like it's very

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.430
low right now and in like a week

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:09.269
everyone will forget true it's good it's

00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:10.980
good news Papa's probably invest in

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.810
little C's right now you think so

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.790

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:17.959
ordering some Little Caesars

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.829

yeah we'll have to follow we'll get some

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:27.589
developments this story we're gonna

00:15:27.589 --> 00:15:29.540
figure out what happened if you guys do

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.190
you guys have any developments on who

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:34.100
the pizza makers were true I would like

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.410
I did see that they were fired they

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.899
didn't terminate yeah it was - thank God

00:15:38.899 --> 00:15:41.000
- employees are fired if you can't keep

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.329
a job at Little Caesars it wasn't Ohio

00:15:44.329 --> 00:15:48.199
so that might explain the swastika what

00:15:48.199 --> 00:15:51.709
are people from Ohio funnier what are we

00:15:51.709 --> 00:15:54.139

the pizzas I wonder how many go on check

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.990
to hear how truthfully even funnier if

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:08.480
it's real like as far as the intention

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.569
if the intent was to literally be racist

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:19.069
lines yeah delivery drivers fills a

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:20.589
notebook with swastikas after that

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:24.530
explain to him explain World War 2 to

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.530
something I this is what I specifically

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:28.820
wanted to talk to you about dude was the

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.490
Edward Bernays thing in World War one so

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.409
I started reading the book oh yeah start

00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:36.550
of you never Bernays his book where he

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.429
he was a he was a PR guy who like back

00:17:39.429 --> 00:17:41.140
then like ad guys were looked at as like

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.059
scummy kind of like hucksters and like

00:17:43.059 --> 00:17:46.450
same with PR guys and they pretty much

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.340
sold the masses this is where I I need

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.020
your world war one knowledge yes

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.960
apparently they took guys you know the

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.970
average dude around World War one time

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.610
and we're like yo you know uh Prussia it

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.950
was Prussia right there Brian's yeah

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:02.230
they were just like we need to go to war

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.660
with all of them and people were like I

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.850
could see that yeah they Bay they

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:09.460
basically made it a popular idea to go

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.710
to war with Germany back then using just

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:13.840
like radios so that was that's kind of

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.670
question like how do you make people who

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:17.290
have no knowledge of geopolitics like

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:19.390
whatsoever what they did was like make

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:21.580
him like a big ape like the Hun yeah it

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.160
was like a big brute yeah I remember cuz

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.770
Hitler was like that's how you do it

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:28.809
when he was in World War two cuz in

00:18:28.809 --> 00:18:30.670
World War two Germany he's propaganda of

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.110
whoever they were fighting was like a

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.510
cartoon [ __ ] yeah and then you get in

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.790
then you're in the mud dying you know

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.830
like this isn't this is different than

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:40.630
the propaganda yeah these are not

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:42.250
cartoon [ __ ] that we just beat the

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.559
[ __ ] out of so so what the Allies were

00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:46.120
doing was putting out this like big

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.880
[ __ ] jacked ape that was carrying a

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.490
lady and like a club it was like you

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.140
gotta go kill that [ __ ] Hawn dude the

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:54.640
Germans are jacked

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.809
well that and that's kind of what the

00:18:55.809 --> 00:18:57.309
book was about Bernays was he's kind of

00:18:57.309 --> 00:18:59.170
bragging like you need guys like us the

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.150
whole book it's supposedly him being

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:03.160
like look I know people like propaganda

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.650
this propaganda came from the I think

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.059
the Vatican put it out when like

00:19:07.059 --> 00:19:09.130
Protestantism was like kind of

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:13.420
propaganda is everything's propaganda

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.250
yeah well that would that was the that

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:16.929
was going to put something out it has an

00:19:16.929 --> 00:19:21.640
agenda yeah but pretty much yeah but

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.410
they always so it started with the it

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:25.120
was called propagating like the Catholic

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.320
Church like we need to propagate the

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.000
good word and propagate people's minds

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.490
and they're like I'll put up again

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:31.600
that's pretty funny that's how it came

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.000
out and it was like you would be like

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.679
check out this propagate first it

00:19:35.679 --> 00:19:37.000
started as like a neutral word like you

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.440
know we got some new propaganda like

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.360
some propagator yeah oh those [ __ ]

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.220
rules and then I think World War one has

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.020
people got tricked into doing [ __ ] well

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.090
once you stop bringing that propaganda

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:48.370
around [ __ ] up every time Bernays

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:49.730
wrote a whole book being like no guy

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.350
it actually propagandists sick and you

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.060
need it because basically the average

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.430
person is kind of an idiot yeah you need

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:57.230
guys like us who are level-headed in the

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.300
right position in society to tell people

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.770
what they want otherwise all the wheels

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.120
fall off so it's like technically

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.470
everything is but like dude they were

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.840
talking about like taking like you know

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.000
you go to a piano company I think we

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.410
want to sell more pianos and Bearnaise

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.720
would do a spend like a year doing this

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.920
thing we're like you would you would set

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.240
up interviews where like you go to talk

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.770
to like celebrities and he's just like

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.780
oh that over there it's my music room

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.610
and like oh you have a music room that's

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:20.780
pretty cool people are like I want a

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.070
[ __ ] music room so it's like you do

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:23.450
[ __ ] like that to condition people

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:24.380
they're like you're not even selling the

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.060
piano you're telling them like a music

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.080
room something they need and they're

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.790
like I need a [ __ ] piano and it's

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.740
like no it's their idea so I I

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.540
definitely hear you but it's like the

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.190
whole books about basically if you give

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.650
guys like that who you know now have the

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:37.850
research and all that you know if they

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:40.580
can talk people into doing World War one

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.290
with like a radio it's like imagine all

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:43.550

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:44.840
day like what the [ __ ] they do to us

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.830
yeah cuz World War one was almost for

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.630
zero reason that's what I heard no one

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:53.900

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.630
was fought for really like at the end of

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.390
the war they were like alright that was

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:02.300
cool who won what or did we all just die

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:07.310

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:08.480
how do you I don't know and then

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.670
America's population was we had a ton of

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:12.380
Germans same thing with World War two

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.390

00:30:58.339 --> 00:30:59.839
you're whenever you start dating a

00:30:59.839 --> 00:31:01.070
checker you're living with a girl they

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:02.719
instantly start pushing it's like cook

00:31:02.719 --> 00:31:04.129
for them they'll start pushing the sweet

00:31:04.129 --> 00:31:07.580
Sonia yeah does it I'd never trust sweet

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:10.099
I was never a sweets guy do girls get if

00:31:10.099 --> 00:31:11.869
you like maybe I'm just biased

00:31:11.869 --> 00:31:13.580
something's dealing with day but they're

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.950
like I would like I'd wash her just like

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:17.779
dong two bowls the Captain Crunch

00:31:17.779 --> 00:31:20.659

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:24.859
two bowls that's a treat that's a sweet

00:31:24.859 --> 00:31:27.409
treat it's dessert dude yeah like you

00:31:27.409 --> 00:31:29.599
can't that's a good dessert though dude

00:31:29.599 --> 00:31:31.039
right I'm at the point now where I can't

00:31:31.039 --> 00:31:32.690
even like that [ __ ] makes me sick too

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:35.210
like I mean that's how I felt about like

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:37.489
donuts like the thought of a donut kinda

00:31:37.489 --> 00:31:39.679
makes me sick good then you munch well

00:31:39.679 --> 00:31:40.999
okay this is the best thing ever

00:31:40.999 --> 00:31:45.580
I see strawberry frosted frosted so good

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.570
that's probably not even one of your

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:49.070
favorites you just like the sound of it

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:51.229
you like the idea of a frosty with

00:31:51.229 --> 00:31:53.629
sprinkles boy yeah the pink frosting

00:31:53.629 --> 00:31:54.859
gets me well this is and this is a

00:31:54.859 --> 00:31:58.570
problem too it's like well first of all

00:31:58.869 --> 00:32:04.960
good Pig frosting gets me [ __ ] idiot

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.759
the you ever get into the idea of

00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:14.119
supernormal stimuli oh yeah man normal

00:32:14.119 --> 00:32:16.309
stimuli are things that affect your

00:32:16.309 --> 00:32:18.080
biology so that's like say like you know

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.419
strawberry frosting if you in nature

00:32:20.419 --> 00:32:21.710
we're programmed to find sweets because

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:24.710
yeah yeah yes so this is what I'm well I

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:26.119
think what we're describing is Doritos

00:32:26.119 --> 00:32:28.070
yes like it's literally the it's

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:30.529
chemically designed to be like exactly

00:32:30.529 --> 00:32:33.289
what you want yes it's like salty it's

00:32:33.289 --> 00:32:34.820
perfect you can't find it elsewhere in

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.049
nature that's the problem it's like this

00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:38.210
thing that your body's like mineral salt

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:40.009
or like you know yeah mmm strawberry

00:32:40.009 --> 00:32:42.019
flavor Cool Ranch it's so much better

00:32:42.019 --> 00:32:43.609
than a strawberry but it holds none of

00:32:43.609 --> 00:32:45.349
the that legend its negative value

00:32:45.349 --> 00:32:46.580
they didn't studies but I think I've

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:47.659
talked about it before they studies with

00:32:47.659 --> 00:32:49.460
butterflies where like there was like a

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:50.749
butterfly that's attracted to like a

00:32:50.749 --> 00:32:52.369
dark shade of blue and they just held up

00:32:52.369 --> 00:32:53.929
they made a darker shade of blue that

00:32:53.929 --> 00:32:54.279
the blood

00:32:54.279 --> 00:32:55.509
flies are able to make and they held up

00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:56.349
a piece of paper and the male

00:32:56.349 --> 00:32:59.529
butterflies will just go to die but it's

00:32:59.529 --> 00:33:01.119
feel like this [ __ ] rules and they'll

00:33:01.119 --> 00:33:02.739
just die yeah this is all I needed

00:33:02.739 --> 00:33:04.869
I'm Tony we live in much most of our

00:33:04.869 --> 00:33:06.669
diets are like that our information I

00:33:06.669 --> 00:33:08.799
think for the most point I swear to god

00:33:08.799 --> 00:33:10.029
I think we've gone completely off the

00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:12.580
reservation yeah we have like 100

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:13.210
percent

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:15.219
we're fried dude we'll get we'll bounce

00:33:15.219 --> 00:33:17.469
back we've met we've been fried before I

00:33:17.469 --> 00:33:19.629
don't know if we've been fried like this

00:33:19.629 --> 00:33:22.239
we have we've been fried dude when have

00:33:22.239 --> 00:33:24.669
they been staging global protests like

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:26.589
with a snap of a finger and like all the

00:33:26.589 --> 00:33:29.070
major cities that's relatively new but

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:33.789
there's been worse nothing compared to

00:33:33.789 --> 00:33:36.729
like Nazis and [ __ ] yeah yeah we've been

00:33:36.729 --> 00:33:38.979
fried we've been from butter your fried

00:33:38.979 --> 00:33:41.409

00:33:41.409 --> 00:33:42.999
of front we were I got out of that we'll

00:33:42.999 --> 00:33:43.479
be all right

00:33:43.479 --> 00:33:45.070
we're gonna be all right there's a

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:46.479
residue left over from that there

00:33:46.479 --> 00:33:48.700
happening it echoes and it's echoing

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:50.019
right now where everyone's like I want

00:33:50.019 --> 00:33:51.849
to be like that yeah it's like well you

00:33:51.849 --> 00:33:52.989
don't need to we don't need that right

00:33:52.989 --> 00:33:53.320
now

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:56.229
yeah no it's true that sounds like yeah

00:33:56.229 --> 00:33:57.519
well I want to be hippy yeah exactly

00:33:57.519 --> 00:34:01.659

almost sounded like I was mocking

00:34:06.989 --> 00:34:09.940
activists we trying to recreate the

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:12.309

they're LARPing civil rights you said I

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:23.279
think I think protesting right now is a

00:34:23.279 --> 00:34:26.470
method of social control I think people

00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:28.510

not being autonomous because they needed

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.839

it'll be there to get it they're gonna

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:51.950

being like well kovetz a greater or

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:01.760
racism of the greater threat than Co vid

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.589
and if they really did the numbers they

00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:05.089
would probably find that covetous to

00:40:05.089 --> 00:40:08.119
cure for racism they let that if they

00:40:08.119 --> 00:40:09.589

was watching the videos and there was

00:42:51.419 --> 00:42:53.819

are we getting hit with it might be a

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:02.279
noun dudes dude there's a realize might

00:43:02.279 --> 00:43:04.469
be like none of many people know it's a

00:43:04.469 --> 00:43:06.569
decent amount it's like a you know from

00:43:06.569 --> 00:43:08.459
the stuff I saw and it's like they

00:43:08.459 --> 00:43:10.140
vacated a police station so there's

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.969
people occupying a police station yeah

00:43:11.969 --> 00:43:13.469
they took it back I think after the they

00:43:13.469 --> 00:43:14.939
shot that kid they it's not the people

00:43:14.939 --> 00:43:17.849
they were like alright we're done killed

00:43:17.849 --> 00:43:19.739
a kid cuz they yeah exactly but they

00:43:19.739 --> 00:43:21.809
spray-painted police % they put like the

00:43:21.809 --> 00:43:24.929
people's precinct and it's like like how

00:43:24.929 --> 00:43:27.749
will the [ __ ] how old are you guys to

00:43:27.749 --> 00:43:28.919
like going there and be like this is

00:43:28.919 --> 00:43:31.619
mine now it's like no it's not dude if

00:43:31.619 --> 00:43:33.809
they wanted that they would kill you and

00:43:33.809 --> 00:43:35.309
take it and do it and that's the other

00:43:35.309 --> 00:43:36.989
thing too that's a I think the thing

00:43:36.989 --> 00:43:38.939
people have to get over of like you know

00:43:38.939 --> 00:43:41.069
like I'm a Democrat I'm a Republican

00:43:41.069 --> 00:43:43.289
they're wrong it's like you're within a

00:43:43.289 --> 00:43:46.439
system that does not give a [ __ ] which

00:43:46.439 --> 00:43:48.059
one you are you're just sitting there

00:43:48.059 --> 00:43:49.919
being like those guys are [ __ ] I

00:43:49.919 --> 00:43:52.559
mean while they probably did send some

00:43:52.559 --> 00:43:54.179
sort of weird special ops guy to be like

00:43:54.179 --> 00:43:55.859
go shoot a couple [ __ ] kids in the

00:43:55.859 --> 00:43:56.269
[ __ ]

00:43:56.269 --> 00:43:57.829
they probably [ __ ] did that and

00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:59.179
that's that's what I think people need

00:43:59.179 --> 00:44:00.199
to wrap their heads around of like

00:44:00.199 --> 00:44:01.609
that's what they're up against there

00:44:01.609 --> 00:44:03.799
being propagandized they in a little too

00:44:03.799 --> 00:44:05.599
far and they took over some weird little

00:44:05.599 --> 00:44:07.219
plot of some like art district and

00:44:07.219 --> 00:44:09.349
people are like it's also too like the

00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:10.609
news for billionaires it's just like

00:44:10.609 --> 00:44:11.749
their subreddit they're like what are

00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:12.290
they talking about

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:15.849
[Laughter]

00:44:15.849 --> 00:44:18.289
you probably saw that and we're just

00:44:18.289 --> 00:44:20.779
like alright what should we do here is

00:44:20.779 --> 00:44:22.189
like well this would be a kind of a

00:44:22.189 --> 00:44:23.359
weird thing to write about but if you

00:44:23.359 --> 00:44:25.069
shot a couple of [ __ ] black kids this

00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:26.389
would look like a real pickle

00:44:26.389 --> 00:44:28.339
dude you're dealing with your people red

00:44:28.339 --> 00:44:29.929
it'll get fired up if we do that I mean

00:44:29.929 --> 00:44:31.849
do take people who like sold out jobs to

00:44:31.849 --> 00:44:33.799
go get like basically slaves again in

00:44:33.799 --> 00:44:35.359
other countries if you look at the

00:44:35.359 --> 00:44:36.859
exchange rate it's like we're paying

00:44:36.859 --> 00:44:38.629
them it's like 13 cents an hour it's

00:44:38.629 --> 00:44:40.699
like slaves dude so it's like those

00:44:40.699 --> 00:44:41.809
people who are like you know what about

00:44:41.809 --> 00:44:42.919
all these people who are finally getting

00:44:42.919 --> 00:44:44.299
jobs getting in the factories you're

00:44:44.299 --> 00:44:45.769
just like [ __ ] them yeah that they have

00:44:45.769 --> 00:44:47.929
to spend on like their own uniform at

00:44:47.929 --> 00:44:49.609
the Fed that the factory sells to them

00:44:49.609 --> 00:44:51.379
yeah it's crazy and you're like [ __ ]

00:44:51.379 --> 00:44:52.819
them and then like all of a sudden like

00:44:52.819 --> 00:44:54.349
wait what's going on now you're like the

00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:55.849
[ __ ] cuz dude if people were just like

00:44:55.849 --> 00:44:58.219
imagine is it I think has to happen for

00:44:58.219 --> 00:44:59.899
a lot of the [ __ ] to go away just like

00:44:59.899 --> 00:45:02.899
the GOP or like the the debates nobody

00:45:02.899 --> 00:45:05.029
watches it just be like [ __ ] that for

00:45:05.029 --> 00:45:06.259
everyone in big that shit's [ __ ] that

00:45:06.259 --> 00:45:08.989
is the one thing I'm gonna watch I'm so

00:45:08.989 --> 00:45:11.839
you know if they do by name pied inverse

00:45:11.839 --> 00:45:13.969
Trump bottom versus Trump a Dendi that

00:45:13.969 --> 00:45:15.369
could be the game we go to this here

00:45:15.369 --> 00:45:17.749
there's gonna be no game there's gonna

00:45:17.749 --> 00:45:19.129
be no college football I don't think I

00:45:19.129 --> 00:45:20.659
was confident early but it's looking

00:45:20.659 --> 00:45:23.209
it's looking bleak if we can go to Biden

00:45:23.209 --> 00:45:25.609
it Biden Trump @nd he's not gonna have a

00:45:25.609 --> 00:45:27.579
crowd I don't know but we could tailgate

00:45:27.579 --> 00:45:31.339
if we do it alive we did a live cast at

00:45:31.339 --> 00:45:34.339
Notre Dame Trump V Biden for beating

00:45:34.339 --> 00:45:37.609
we're about to see it'll be ugly man

00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:40.339
Trump verse by Dan will be I mean I

00:45:40.339 --> 00:45:42.109
can't think of a worse beating when it

00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:43.909
comes to just a debate it's gonna be

I was watching I was watching yesterday

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:55.820
it wasn't like a [ __ ] TV what was

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:58.220

00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:00.140
only seen it on like dude episode I

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:01.610
think it's episode 6

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:04.400
yeah it's CW see I think was on the CW

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.400
episodes just a crash episode 6 it so

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.200
there's an episode called hothead that's

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.580
about the football coach he like gets so

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:12.380
mad he lights stuff on fire did it so

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:13.850
[ __ ] funny where he's like bossing

00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:15.020
kids around like threatening to beat

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:16.550
them it's actually got a funny on it and

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:18.290
then the sixth one the six episodes

00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:20.960
about a guy who like gets so cold cuz he

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.340
falls into the pond that has like the

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.890
Kryptonite [ __ ] in it and he freezes and

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:26.420
gets so cold that he could only survive

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:28.820
all-female body heat so he's essentially

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:30.800
kind of going on in raping chicks but

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.960

freeze them and then like they've fallen

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:38.990
shatter so it's like and the show it's

00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:40.610
[ __ ] crazy how they wrote it but at

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:41.930
the end of the I think the episode is

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:43.910

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:46.940
episode called cool they at the very end

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:48.080
they're just for no reason showing

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:49.520

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.650

00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:59.020

was funny cuz I was watching I think

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.410
what I thought about that I was at a

00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:48.690
basketball game and I was at graduation

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:51.030

and I fell off the court you fell yeah

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.410
but I like fell Oh God we are the most

00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:57.870
battling I know but it was enough if you

00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.390
fall in any game with people they are

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:02.550
screaming it's over nobody will me I

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:04.470
mean especially if it's it I mean if

00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:07.020
it's a step back and you fell everyone

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:09.060
just pauses waits to see if the jumper

00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:11.430
goes in if it's in you gotta fight it

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:13.020
you gotta fight you have to fight well

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.390
luckily for the record for the record we

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:16.860

Europe your monster in the post

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.840
that would have been cancelable if

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:33.360
somebody filmed that us be a post-op

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:38.620

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:40.330
was thinking about a graduation there it

00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:42.370

dudes too are very very likely to date

01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:43.660
outside the race Asian dudes aren't in

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:46.300

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.760

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:18.630
to a sleep paralysis I welcome it when

01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:20.760

01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:26.910
sound you get there no I've only gotten

01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:28.950

01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:32.310
once oh I'll get it like every month or

01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:34.290
so and I'm Tay I'm still scared of it

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:36.060
dude that rules man if you go I've got

01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:37.470
the one you're talking about horrible

01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:38.730
and you kind of like come what way can

01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:40.140
you see things around here I've gotten

01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:42.390
that that's bad when I get a body

01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:44.700
sensation that goes Brant I go I'm like

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:46.830
kind of half and sleep and I go oh sick

01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:49.280
I'm not like it yeah I get is it like

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.720
it's almost like sometimes it'll be like

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.580
a bang and a white like I can see the

01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:57.840
noise so I think that's always it sounds

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.660
like a [ __ ] somebody dropped

01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:03.240
something in the room very loudly like

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:04.110
okay easy

01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:06.390
no I get it wooden feels more like an

01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:08.670
electrical Kirk I have exploding head

01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:10.140
syndrome you might have exploding heads

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:12.270
in fact I certainly do I have a thing

01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:13.890
also whatever I have is and I get this

01:12:13.890 --> 01:12:14.940
during a day sometimes where it just

01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:16.380
sounds like an electrical current passes

01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:17.550
through my body so I'll be like moving

01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:19.350
around and go man I'm like whoa I get

01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:22.720
like a weird smell but when I'm asleep

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:25.730
just gloss over that spill I've looked

01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:27.140
it up what's the weird I think it has to

01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:29.990
do with my I've like completely trashed

01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:31.910
my nervous system three years of just

01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:33.530
precarious living so I think it's like

01:12:33.530 --> 01:12:34.910
my nerves are on end you haven't lived

01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:37.250
that precarious [ __ ] plane too fast

01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:39.110
and loose Braille for about like a good

01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:42.320
[ __ ] decade you met me when we met

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:45.050
yes well I had come off of uh I was

01:12:45.050 --> 01:12:47.270
still fast and loose I hated when you

01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:49.340
changed I had a we used to have fun

01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:50.840
together dude oh that was nothing I mean

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.580
like drinking's for [ __ ] I was like

01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:56.690
no drinking rule I watched sure I was

01:12:56.690 --> 01:12:58.070
stoned in my room and I watched Jordan

01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:59.030
Peterson where they did the pleasure

01:12:59.030 --> 01:13:00.230
Mountain when everyone was stopped it

01:13:00.230 --> 01:13:02.060
was literally a donkey and the Pinocchio

01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:03.620
is he's breaking it down of like turning

01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:05.600
into a beast of burden I'm watching the

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.370
donkeys have a good time and then I hear

01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:09.800
would stomp as the donkey stomps and I'm

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:11.420
stoned in my room at 1:30 and I was just

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:16.760
like oh but I think it was for the best

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.170
that's why I stay away from the weed

01:13:18.170 --> 01:13:20.810
weed hammer do you hear [ __ ] would

01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:23.530
fly down the steps you aren't sure

01:13:23.530 --> 01:13:26.420
there's no thought there's nothing

01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:27.980
deeper than there so with the sleep

01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:29.270
paralysis now I've gotten to the level

01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:31.130
where it like I'll feel it coming and

01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:33.050
usually I'd feel myself going like the

01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:34.880
world oh my god [ __ ] it's coming I try

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:37.790
to get out of it in like mid sleep it

01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:39.560
was like it was I swear to god I was

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.420
