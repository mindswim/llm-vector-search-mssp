00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.860
paid her in the election and it was just

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.690
Trump versus actual demon from hell and

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.880

time almost every year you coming up

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.310
with a lot of excuses I don't have

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.080
[ __ ] Co vid if I had Co bit I'm

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.730
telling you Mike I gave myself a fever

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.320
and got over it so I think I had it and

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:29.340
just overcame it immediately so I I read

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.590
them you have to have a dry cough some

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.290
your absolutive don't have to dry cough

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.200
light lightness of difficulty breathing

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.970
lightheadedness none of them dude

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.220

you're in the bath you didn't just

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.490
I don't think taking a bath is gonna

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:54.860
kill the coronavirus

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.110
you're you are fake news I mean think of

00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:59.060
it this way we're made up of

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.200
predominantly water so if we heat that

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.010
water up in our

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.430
boils off the [ __ ] so true that's

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.880
actually true sorry I just merge with my

overwhelming surge to emergency rooms

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.710

it's Timmy bros my boy yeah eating a

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:44.940
wild animal is considered a symbol of

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.320
wealth because they are more rare and

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.270
expensive also wild animals are

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.190
considered more natural and thus

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:51.990
nutritious compared to farmed meat it's

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:53.550
a belief in Chinese traditional Chinese

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:54.660
medicine that can improve the immune

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.270
system so they eat things that are hard

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.640
to get if they were catching them all

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.220

holographic charge that's nice

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.220
I had a holographic gear doing a time

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.440
capsule from our preschool I don't know

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.410

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.700
you have to get a metal detector and go

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:55.640
back to your old school hole you ever

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.070

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.160
definitely an autobiographical thing of

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.600
Shia LeBouf so our early life and I

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.200

LeBouf movie both of them get they hook

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.920

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:43.300
normalized this quarantine situation

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:45.190

stuff unless a sexual need

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.180

01:05:15.610 --> 01:05:19.810
see what you're up to I mean I

01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:21.580
I've seen the questions you're asking I

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:24.040
don't like it well to be fair I do think

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:25.720
they're gonna try to do definite or

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.570
start mandating vaccines they're setting

01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:30.190
up thermal cameras and if you have a

01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:31.600
