00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.170

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.230
overboard just like [ __ ] it this we

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.449
gotta get off this thing this is so this

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.250
isn't gonna be a good one but I'll tell

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.480
you what I think I know and a lot of

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.090
this is was written down at I can see

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.620
the time of the note to 20 in the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.020
morning earlier this week so you're

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.460
working at night yeah I was just reading

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.320
after like I get home and read and then

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.730
try to take notes while I was reading it

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.309
okay but uh so we left off I think right

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.800
where Thomas Francis Marr was about to

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.510
join the civil war the civil war was

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.460
just starting he put together an Irish

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.620
Brigade in New York that they were the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.109
69th New York militia so he owns the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.570
militia there if you remember there was

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.070
a guy named corker and I kept calling

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.690
corker and its Cochrane okay it is

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.280
pronounced Cochrane fair enough whatever

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.439
that happens nobody knows dude how would

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.170
you ever know to corker and i'm sure the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.000
name pronunciation is debatable true

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.159
that's probably the the debate rages

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.840
amongst historians mister cochran a

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.390

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:38.150
with nothing to do except train during

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.380

the southern capitals Richmond so

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.940
they're very close [ __ ] the capital the

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.440
each capital is very close so the first

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.000
battle they were like all right we're

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.159

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.229
up they get met there they meet it writ

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:17.930
there at a Manassas or it's called

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.090
Manassas or Bull Run yeah as happens a

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.039
lot bull run bull run that's cuz you're

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:24.860
in a northern yeah all right that's true

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.870
the rebel part they always so there's

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.580
there's the Battle of Antietam it's also

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.469
referred to as Sharpsburg I know that

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:33.590
yeah a lot of the Civil War battles have

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.879
that where it's two different names

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:36.770
because both sides call it different

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.990
things and the reason is northern

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.360
soldiers were usually from the city

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.389
and the more memorable thing was a rural

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:45.830
like a river or a creek or something

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.060
that's what they would remember about

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.979
southern boys from the countryside would

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:51.229
name it for whatever the closest town or

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:53.150
railroad was or some [ __ ] they never saw

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.189
Dan you know I mean pretty well you

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:56.659
think any of those Civil War generals

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:58.039
would thought one day their statue be

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:08.240
pushed over by a lesbian never ever been

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.449

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.590
pushed down my statue on wait just one

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.270

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.360
weathering the storm just standing there

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.729
just taking all the [ __ ] artillery

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:00.650
staying at the top of this hill didn't

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.000
budge because southern troops are

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.589
starting to retreat yeah one Brigade

00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:05.240
stood still because the general just

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.250
stood the front that's Stonewall Jackson

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.669
bro one of the other generals who said

00:08:10.669 --> 00:08:12.379
look over there dude he's just standing

00:08:12.379 --> 00:08:13.789
there like a stone wall they would be

00:08:13.789 --> 00:08:15.199
like Jackson then the southern troops

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:17.389
kind of reformed they got [ __ ] fired

00:08:17.389 --> 00:08:20.060
up that's doing I almost saved slavery

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.710
yes definitely almost save slavery

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:27.110
because he he was like a super religious

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.849
nut some well Jackson was like God's

00:08:28.849 --> 00:08:31.219
gonna decide when I die okay it's not

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:32.690
today there's nothing that's gonna

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.039
happen to me today I would just stand

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:38.690
and like a field yeah yeah the hill did

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:40.969
the south was on at this point it's

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:43.610
known as the Henry House Hill the Union

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.260
had been trying to get Stonewall Jackson

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.750
and general Beauregard off the hill very

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.250
unsuccessful they just wave after wave

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:53.029
was getting repelled what just get him

00:08:53.029 --> 00:08:54.860
off that hill okay get down off that

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.220
here

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.880
No get off that hill general Beauregard

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.610
was up there you think beau regard polar

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.650
garzo regarded Stonewall Jackson are up

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:08.880
at the top of the hill you don't want to

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.430
come off that hill

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.440
God that Soler's battle was funny pure

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.520
king of the hill that's what you did

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.750
back then you got to the top of the hill

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.550
and you're like what's good oh for sure

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.380
could they just go around the hill and

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.540
just like they do that so [ __ ] up

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.730
something like yeah you guys stand up

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.800
there we're gonna burn your city yeah

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.050
like [ __ ] with that well there was

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.880
definitely reinforcements on both sides

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.100
okay just in the back waiting and almost

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.840
most of the time double the amount sure

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.700
I guess the reason you're shooting from

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.930
the top of the hill that's an advantage

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.960
I guess yeah oh that's every back then

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.180
that's how like every war every battle

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.320
was fought like whoever got the high

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.820
ground and was in a defensive position

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.870
one you can never just charge up a hill

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.980
cherrylle these dudes you know get

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.950
gassed you get [ __ ] smoked beachbody

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.710
dude you're gonna see that gas they were

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.790
not jacked so the Union at this point in

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.550
the day he's starting to they're getting

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.680
stuck they can't get up this hill then

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.770
it's the that's the 69th turn dude yeah

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.650
they're like more Cochran take that

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.050
[ __ ] Hill and this they had hated the

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:13.950
Irish so far

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:15.270
I'm surprised saying to send them in

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.400
first no they well it was kind of the

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.720
same thing with like black soldiers

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.740
where they were like we don't want to

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.540
and early there's another thought of the

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.040
Irish they were like these guys are

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.620
[ __ ] retards - yeah like we're not we

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.210
can't rely on them you're bad enough

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.250
there's Irish officers yeah

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.140
like let them control the Irish don't

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.940
[ __ ] and let them [ __ ] up this battle

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.370
and then when everybody else failed

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.140
they're like I go [ __ ] get it and

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.060
they took it they took the hill they

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.890
started taking the hill they got pushed

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.160
back three times and went to the bottom

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.320
and they regrouped charged back up three

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.540
different times damn dude imagine

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.550
getting your ass beat so like the first

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.590
retreat yeah would have been like cool

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:55.770
glad that's [ __ ] yeah good lord going

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.050
back so that was as pure Irish spazzing

00:10:58.050 --> 00:10:59.880
there was absolute IRA spazzing this

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.250
whole imagine he'd ever do wind sprints

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.540
when you were kids remember that

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.550
depression any be like last one thang

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:08.010
yeah and the coach was like one more

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.570
[ __ ] dammit dude yeah exact same thing

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.790
you know except with guns well that's

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.590
just weird though the military minds of

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.000
the time my god we're gonna attack and

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.870
they're like sure they're on a hill [ __ ]

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.280
no that's I mean put anticipate they

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.350
didn't anticipate the hill yeah it's

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:26.640
just to go take it as I send

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.050
[ __ ] I just got run up that

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.000
hill can't hold it for too long

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.430
sure so they on a third time the Irish

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.410
Brigade takes the hill gets Beauregard

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:38.940
and those [ __ ] [ __ ] off the hill

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.330
finally yeah and then out of nowhere

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.460
dude out of the woods to the next to the

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.890
hill comes a [ __ ] charge some

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.300
southern boys that were supposed to have

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.040
been cut off they're coming from the

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.960
Shenandoah Valley there was a union

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.340
Brigade was supposed to have cut them

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.410
off they just came storming in that's

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:57.300
terrif started shelling them hit them

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:06.210
with artillery and stuff they they're

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:07.530
probably celebrating on top of the hill

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:11.100
too after the battle Mar Mar said we

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.140
beat their men their artillery beat us

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.610
that's the story of the day dude he was

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:15.900
basically like yeah we [ __ ] them up

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.080
one on one they had two [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.100
dude basic use him a button smash yeah

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.320
yeah they [ __ ] had cannons hidden we

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.820
killed them one on one which is a

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.650
reasonable quote yeah that's pretty

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.240
I don't lost a fight I would instantly

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.500
just be like well they had cannons they

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.430
cheated true which that actually stood

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.460
stuck out a little to me as a historian

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.190
for sure was that because you always

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:42.540
hear about how the south had like the

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.480
toughest walking rootinest tootinest but

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.880
then you know what Irish Brigade came up

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.260
and just [ __ ] them up yeah they

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.640
weren't ready for that wouldn't quit

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.410
weren't letting ready for that white

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.030
trash dude with that level of white

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.340
trash is like it's noted every brigade

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.160
every side of this war like if they saw

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.200
the green flag coming like there's

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.670
southern generals that are quoted as

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.530
being like there's that [ __ ] green

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.710
flag again

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:09.540
and what's funny is they would because

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.070
it was hot as [ __ ] they were always

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.780
fighting in like this summer yeah

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.700
the Irish would always take their shirts

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.400
off so they just go into battle just

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.560
like pants on they brought up I mean

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.150
this other generals were thinking they

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.720
could have like not

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.189
retreat let these [ __ ] gonna

00:13:23.189 --> 00:13:25.399
die

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.709
[Laughter]

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:33.569
so yeah the 69s is knocked back down the

00:13:33.569 --> 00:13:36.660
hill and then that's when a retreat and

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.339
panic started taking them no this is the

00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:40.019
first battle so both sides are [ __ ]

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:42.000
pure they have no idea how to do this

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.889
yeah neither sides in this war have

00:13:43.889 --> 00:13:44.759
really ever fought

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:46.949
there's the Mexican War yeah for this

00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:48.810
but that wasn't this amount of people

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.610
all these soldiers fighting this this is

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:52.439
their first day of combat yeah on both

00:13:52.439 --> 00:13:54.449
sides so these got like in the middle of

00:13:54.449 --> 00:13:55.800
the battle dudes are just [ __ ]

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.089
dropping everything and just like I'm

00:13:57.089 --> 00:14:00.269
out yes I'm sprinting so when they lose

00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:02.430
that Hill it starts this panic in the

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.410
Union Army that just everyone just

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.629
starts sprinting back to Washington okay

00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:08.370
just yeah dropping everything like

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.870
[ __ ] guns just [ __ ] full sprint

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:13.709
that's a fair that's what they never

00:14:13.709 --> 00:14:15.149
show that that much in a war movies

00:14:15.149 --> 00:14:17.040
people don't [ __ ] this dude that's what

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.750
that's what was so important about the

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.540
Red Badge of Courage because that whole

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.180
book is about being a [ __ ] coward in

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.420
the Civil War really yeah yeah yeah

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.500
about being a put like not to run

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.079
literally running away the character in

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:32.670
The Red Badge occurred Sprint's away for

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.230
the first battle he's like in the woods

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:35.670
and finds a dead body he's like oh my

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.180
god he's basically a time traveler it'd

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.680
be like if one of us was in the war oh

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.300
for sure I just sprint away right away

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.779
sees one dead body it's like going to a

00:14:45.779 --> 00:14:47.850
fight at a park every shot everyone was

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:53.579
getting rocks out of here yeah dude yeah

00:14:53.579 --> 00:14:55.290
I mean it especially when you do

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.670
consider it was the first like real

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:59.459
battle just like thousands of dudes

00:14:59.459 --> 00:15:02.629
shooting at each other yeah and you just

00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:05.459
I've never seen a thousand people at

00:15:05.459 --> 00:15:09.059
once now you see 20,000 shooting guns

00:15:09.059 --> 00:15:10.980
and [ __ ] holy [ __ ] and then imagine

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.559
being like lasts a charge like you've

00:15:13.559 --> 00:15:15.360
just been hearing just screaming and

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.829
murder all day and they're like all

00:15:16.829 --> 00:15:22.079
right you guys you're up Sonne what

00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:23.430
happened with the Irish Brigade this is

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:24.689
where they use the Irish Brigade a lot

00:15:24.689 --> 00:15:28.649
was when you're retreating you [ __ ]

00:15:28.649 --> 00:15:32.040
it's called rear guard so when your

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.630
armies are treating that you've set up a

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.110
rearguard to slow the

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:36.850
the enemy while you're retreating so

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.430
guys are just left behind to fight Oh to

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:41.110
be like I you slow them down as long as

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.290
you can and then come meet up with us

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:45.610
but to slow them down while we all run

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.640
so the Irish Brigade was left to do that

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.730
their gripe enjoy that job first they

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:53.769
groped about that a lot but they were

00:15:53.769 --> 00:15:54.519
the only ones that wouldn't just

00:15:54.519 --> 00:15:56.800
constantly sprint away in the middle of

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.310
a fight

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:58.690
well that's true of you activated the

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:00.519
Irish spasm they would just get over the

00:16:00.519 --> 00:16:05.170
grippe in absolute IRA spaz constantly

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:07.660
in this so the 69th is back at the

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.399
bottom of the hill that's when the Union

00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:12.370
retreat and panic took hold Cochrane

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.920
ordered the men to form a square

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.630
formation to hopefully slow the

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:18.040
Confederate counter-attack so they're

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.300
you know they're just in a square at the

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.190
bottom of hill wall dudes are running

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:24.640
down the hill at them in the haze of

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.560
battle Cochrane was separated from Mara

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.810
and his men so also another thing you

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:30.850
don't think about is all these muskets

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.890
emit a ton of smoke trail all these

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.390
rifles is [ __ ] so that the battlefield

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:39.100
you can't see ya just fog so they're

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.019
separated Cochran and his men were

00:16:41.019 --> 00:16:44.470
overrun he was taken prisoner Marr is

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.540
now officially in charge okay in the

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:47.860
middle of this battle Cochran's just

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.120
gone

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.339
well him up yeah they thought he was

00:16:51.339 --> 00:16:53.019
killed no no you know you just assume

00:16:53.019 --> 00:16:55.209
he's dead where'd the Cochran has been

00:16:55.209 --> 00:16:57.399
killed put more in charge the 69th was

00:16:57.399 --> 00:17:01.959
getting blood pounded good note for some

00:17:01.959 --> 00:17:03.459
reason they made a big [ __ ] stink

00:17:03.459 --> 00:17:05.260
about this his cat Mars cap had been

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.959
knocked off and his clothes were off so

00:17:07.959 --> 00:17:10.480
he's just got no shirt no hat just with

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.790
a [ __ ] sword on top of his horse he

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:14.140
gets on top of his horse once he

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.030
realizes he's in command in the middle

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.350
of battle gets on his horse while his

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:19.720
men are like wavering pretty [ __ ]

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.809
sick line he takes out the [ __ ] Irish

00:17:22.809 --> 00:17:25.179
flag yeah on his white horse in the

00:17:25.179 --> 00:17:26.589
middle of this hazy battle with his

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:29.440
shirt off dude Wow that's what they're

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.510
literally made for so sexy

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:32.830
that's dude that's literally what the

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.650
Irish are made for is they do

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:37.390
nonsensical battle moves yeah one dude

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:40.059
horse shirt off like this is what he

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:41.350
said which is pretty sick he's like look

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:44.350

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.059
front of his he's like deck of Ireland's

00:17:46.059 --> 00:17:48.490
mad [ __ ] wild

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:50.650
yeah that was the Romans notes on the

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:53.020
Celtic they would do stuff they would

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.850
show up to battle get out in like Pearl

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.410
[ __ ] you know I'm holding like a [ __ ]

00:17:56.410 --> 00:18:01.809
wolf's head so there it is [ __ ]

00:18:01.809 --> 00:18:03.910
that's so that's yeah Suze markets in

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:06.190
control he goes full [ __ ] hero time

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.540
ride horse yeah he Braveheart it yeah

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.679
I'm scared you did people don't talk

00:18:11.679 --> 00:18:13.330
about the effect if a single guy walks

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:14.950
by on a horse and rears it up and starts

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.260
talking me inspirationally I'm Way they

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.290
could take advantage of me is you and me

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:21.880
and brave boys I think you dude the two

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.470
dudes when Braveheart runs by and he's

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.210
given that speech and then I could home

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:28.540
the English are too many [ __ ] talks

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:34.870
him into fighting like we love you he's

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:35.500
up on his horse

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.030
yeah dude the last thing you need

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.140
somebody on the horse giving you a

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:42.820
speech I'm doing it yells [ __ ] look

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.070
at the flag think of Ireland immediately

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:46.720
Mars horses hit with a [ __ ]

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.910
cannonball horse gets ripped in half

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.290
knocked from his horse he's knocked out

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:55.240
he's totally knocked out Confederates

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.740
immediately over on the position they

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.420
were at he would have been captured if

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.510
it wasn't for private Joseph McCoy just

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:02.350
just private

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.630
that's his name's not notable private

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:06.490
Joseph McCoy here Anne's back and drags

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:08.290
him by his [ __ ] the back of his

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:12.250
[ __ ] pants I guess he said he was

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:13.809
shirtless apparently has a shirt on at

00:19:13.809 --> 00:19:15.760
this point I think when he got knocked

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.820
off his horse he threw a shirt on or you

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.980
know that's neither here nor there's a

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:22.540
weird thing about reading histories of

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.160
the Civil War where they just fill in

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.350
dialog yeah if you're writing a

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.050
historical book mm-hmm you're just like

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:32.250
and then he said come into my tent yes

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:35.380
don't put quotes yes he told him to come

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.960
in there yes this is pretty funny though

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:41.679
so the the retreats on there's no

00:19:41.679 --> 00:19:42.940
[ __ ] control I was just [ __ ]

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.309
running Marr there treat gets put into

00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:46.840
the back of a wagon he's still knocked

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.390
out while the [ __ ] wagon is crossing

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:50.650
this bridge during the retreat a

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.900
cannonball hits those horses [ __ ] in the

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.330
front the wagon basically flips over the

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.220
side of this bridge he gets launched

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:00.730
into a [ __ ] Creek if in any wakes up

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.350
and you know it gets up goes on the side

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.809
but I think it's pretty funny that again

00:20:05.809 --> 00:20:07.520
his horse got blown up off a [ __ ]

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.620
candle I just knocked out then while

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.330
he's knocked out he gets launched off a

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:14.000
bridge it's a great it gets up it's just

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.049
like oh just keep trying I mean what a

00:20:18.049 --> 00:20:19.370
[ __ ] that's so funny is I'm just

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.690
imagining Conor McGregor this whole time

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:28.130
look to the flag blown up oh my god I

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:29.779
mean dude getting knocked out getting

00:20:29.779 --> 00:20:31.250
put in the back of a wagon while you're

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.289
unconscious the wagon explodes you get

00:20:33.289 --> 00:20:35.029
launched all over the side of a bridge

00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:38.029
holy and when you wake up into water

00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:40.669
yeah wake up into it undoubtedly a

00:20:40.669 --> 00:20:42.860
shallow Creek and come to realizing

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.210
there's an army chasing you and you're

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.190
like [ __ ] yeah just talk too much [ __ ]

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:48.380
about the [ __ ] just talking [ __ ] the

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:49.789
last thing I remember was given a sick

00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:58.669
speech your horse getting blown off this

00:20:58.669 --> 00:21:00.649
is pretty funny this is what Manassas

00:21:00.649 --> 00:21:03.080
first Manassas or Bull Run they didn't

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.559
fight here again later in the war guy

00:21:05.559 --> 00:21:07.789
it's a funny thing about this war cuz

00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:10.159
it's kind of like in World War one where

00:21:10.159 --> 00:21:11.539
everybody like marched into it like

00:21:11.539 --> 00:21:13.610
wearing cool clothes thinking like this

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:14.419
is gonna be fun

00:21:14.419 --> 00:21:16.429
yeah same thing happened here where like

00:21:16.429 --> 00:21:18.140
everyone was like dude war is awesome

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.590
we're gonna have fun expecting an easy

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:23.539
Union victory the wealthy elite of

00:21:23.539 --> 00:21:25.669
nearby Washington including congressmen

00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:27.950
and their families had come to picnic

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:31.520
and watch the battle huh yes he was just

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.549
watching this battle when the Union Army

00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:36.350
was driven back in a running disorder

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:37.669
the roads back to Washington were

00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:40.130
blocked by panicked civilians attempting

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.620
to flee in their carriages this is what

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:43.970
I this is what I included this for I

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.409
think he'll enjoy this the pell-mell

00:21:45.409 --> 00:21:47.539
retreat became known in the southern

00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:51.799
press as the great skedaddle there's

00:21:51.799 --> 00:21:52.460
fans

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:55.039
yeah dude fans came down to watch one of

00:21:55.039 --> 00:21:56.510
the congressmen got ripped off of his

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:58.340
horse by a southern dude which is great

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.940

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:11.809
calling the great skedaddle dude it's

00:22:11.809 --> 00:22:12.679
like they thought they're gonna come

00:22:12.679 --> 00:22:14.119

00:22:14.119 --> 00:22:18.619
battlin pure chaos dude I must have been

00:22:18.619 --> 00:22:20.359

the London Times because they had

00:23:25.369 --> 00:23:26.659
reporters and reporters were everywhere

00:23:26.659 --> 00:23:29.269
just on the hill watching the London

00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:30.829
Times reported that Marr had fell from

00:23:30.829 --> 00:23:32.479
his horse due to him being a drunk

00:23:32.479 --> 00:23:35.119
Irishman because the British still hate

00:23:35.119 --> 00:23:38.299
him he's still an outlaw true which is

00:23:38.299 --> 00:23:40.789
and in the London Times oh yeah more you

00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:42.289
remember that Marr dude he tried to lead

00:23:42.289 --> 00:23:43.999
a battle he got drunk and fell off his

00:23:43.999 --> 00:23:44.799
horse

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:47.449
that's far you [ __ ] funny is pretty

00:23:47.449 --> 00:23:49.339
funny they probably fake they fake news

00:23:49.339 --> 00:23:51.979
them damn dude but the failing New York

00:23:51.979 --> 00:23:54.229
Times did defend him they quoted an

00:23:54.229 --> 00:23:56.539
eyewitness who said Maher was remarkable

00:23:56.539 --> 00:23:58.909
in his bare head see they were just

00:23:58.909 --> 00:24:00.139
obsessed that he wasn't wearing a hat

00:24:00.139 --> 00:24:02.899
that's been crazy back then for somebody

00:24:02.899 --> 00:24:04.249
not to be wearing a hat that kind of was

00:24:04.249 --> 00:24:05.599
back there yeah that was weird to be

00:24:05.599 --> 00:24:08.359
bareheaded yeah like Maury is remarkable

00:24:08.359 --> 00:24:12.399
in his bare head urging his men forward

00:24:12.399 --> 00:24:16.849
then 29 officers in Mars unit wrote to

00:24:16.849 --> 00:24:19.129
the New York papers to defend him saying

00:24:19.129 --> 00:24:21.169
on the March no one was more eager in

00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:23.449
battle none more reckless in his life

00:24:23.449 --> 00:24:25.249
imagine people watching you battle and

00:24:25.249 --> 00:24:27.299
writing about it I'd be wiling out

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:28.950
or someone wrote like yeah he was wasted

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:30.269
that's why he fell off his horse like no

00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:32.399
I was in the middle of giving and after

00:24:32.399 --> 00:24:34.679
I had just fought for [ __ ] six hours

00:24:34.679 --> 00:24:35.519
yeah

00:24:35.519 --> 00:24:39.179
killing people no one else my horse that

00:24:39.179 --> 00:24:40.649
I love you got ripped in half and I got

00:24:40.649 --> 00:24:42.600
knocked out yeah and then thrown off a

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.239
bridge so he was probably ticked he was

00:24:45.239 --> 00:24:47.580
probably a little ticked so they've all

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.909
retreated back I think across the river

00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:52.440
what's the river there the James River

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.360
the nothing but it might be the Potomac

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.659
yeah they forded the river yeah it got

00:24:57.659 --> 00:25:00.570
back across both sides didn't fully

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:02.850
deploy there like they had just as many

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:04.289
in reserve as they ended up actually

00:25:04.289 --> 00:25:05.399
fighting okay

00:25:05.399 --> 00:25:08.009
it's it was just mismanaged nobody knows

00:25:08.009 --> 00:25:09.769
what they [ __ ] doing

00:25:09.769 --> 00:25:12.269
someone guys scolded I'm sure people

00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:13.830
yeah that's what happens here

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:16.109
back at the camp after the battle the

00:25:16.109 --> 00:25:18.299
69th New York had finished its 90 days

00:25:18.299 --> 00:25:19.980
so they were only enlisted for 90 days

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:21.989
at this point the 90 days is up and they

00:25:21.989 --> 00:25:23.549
can go home they get paid to don't they

00:25:23.549 --> 00:25:25.200
they get paid that 90 days is up they

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.600
get to go home Mar was stopped by

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.340
Sherman while he was like packing his

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.129
[ __ ] and Sherman basically in front of

00:25:32.129 --> 00:25:34.440
everyone called him [ __ ] gay he was

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.850
like if you [ __ ] leave here you're

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:38.850

you attempt to leave without my orders I

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:42.359

everyone

00:25:42.899 --> 00:25:44.399
it wasn't he down the hose this quote

00:25:44.399 --> 00:25:46.649
yeah but Sherman Sherman is a wild man

00:25:46.649 --> 00:25:48.899
Sheryl Sherman doesn't give a [ __ ] and

00:25:48.899 --> 00:25:51.269
that afternoon Lincoln comes to camp

00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:53.820
President Lincoln comes down Maher tried

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:55.169
to snitch on chairman in front of

00:25:55.169 --> 00:25:57.269

talking to people saying what's up yeah

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:03.509
he said mr. Lincoln I have a grievance

00:26:03.509 --> 00:26:06.269
this morning Colonel Sherman said he he

00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:08.129
threatened to shoot me Lincoln responded

00:26:08.129 --> 00:26:09.899
if I were you and he threatened to shoot

00:26:09.899 --> 00:26:13.139

00:26:13.139 --> 00:26:16.559
punked him in front of everyone you

00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:17.789

you he's contracts up this is Sharon

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:26.700
Lincoln needs Sherman yeah but Lincoln

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:30.179
also needs more which Lincoln does give

00:26:30.179 --> 00:26:31.739
him the order he's like yeah you can go

00:26:31.739 --> 00:26:33.899
okay so Lincoln you know he's like you

00:26:33.899 --> 00:26:35.429
Punk's him for trying to get out early

00:26:35.429 --> 00:26:39.509
pretty funny but then yeah so mores done

00:26:39.509 --> 00:26:41.190
he's after New York

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:43.080
69 fits back in New York now just that

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:47.640
that tour yeah I guess they're up Mar

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.410
returns to New York City in August of

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.710
1861 he gives a speech in New York City

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:54.180
it's at a fundraiser for the widows of

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.250
bull run so the Irish brigades wives

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.350
yeah you know all the guys that died to

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.660
their wives yeah an estimated 60,000

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.860
people showed up its the largest

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.140
gathering largest public gathering in

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.760
New York City at the time up to that

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:06.870
point there had never been a larger

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:09.390
gathering dan Mars the head he's given

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:12.300
speeches they finally figured out

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.910
Cochran's in prison they found that he's

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.340
not dead so that's good Mar gives a

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.660
speech saying that he didn't vote for

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.520
Lincoln but any victory for the United

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.530
States Fox England so they should all

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:25.830
join so the all the all the Irish people

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:27.690
in New York were Democrats yeah so they

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:30.000
all kind of hated Lincoln and at this

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.530
point the Emancipation Proclamation

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:34.770
hadn't come out so they're just they're

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:36.360
kind of like states rights are good this

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.310
isn't a war for slavery yet yeah not

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:42.090
publicly at least okay so yeah that's

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:43.050
always important to remember what the

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:45.540
Civil War is at first it wasn't I mean

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.130
it was about slavery but it was states

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:50.010
rights to own slaves guys whether the

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:51.480
federal government could dictate that or

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.980
not yeah and also the South was

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.990
basically there basically hey Larry fans

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.690
when they lost when Lincoln won they

00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.370
were all crying their life is [ __ ]

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:03.240
this isn't fair right so [ __ ] fine

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.040
yeah I think I said it in the last one

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.170
he wasn't even on the ballot in almost

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:09.840
every southern state Lincoln really yeah

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.100
so then they were starting to the South

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.120
was starting to get worried that they

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.340
weren't gonna be able to compete with

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:16.590
the North can just decide who wins every

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:20.570
election yeah we have no say in anything

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:23.130
so the the people in the crowd were like

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:26.220
[ __ ] you dude you love Lincoln like all

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.230
that [ __ ] but he the way he spun it

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:31.740
Maher was spinning it was a war against

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.080
the south as a war against England

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:37.950
because at this time in history England

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:39.810
was running almost entirely on its

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:42.570
textile industry one in five Britons

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:44.850
were connected to the trade eighty

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:47.340
percent of the cotton England used was

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:49.650
imported from the south really and at

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.150
the time the south was also sending

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:53.340
delegates to England they got arrested

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.180
on the way out

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:56.640
in a Union blockade so that so it was

00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.720
clear that the South was trying to they

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.520
were working with England because the

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.840
sooner england recognized them as a

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.400
country and started sending ships over

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.750
to [ __ ] us up yeah

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:09.270
the better so the South was and that was

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:11.490
their entire economy was I mean if if 80

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:13.710
percent of the cotton England's using is

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:15.600
from the south that's a huge yeah it's

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.130
all the that's a big job it's like the

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:20.370
world is still a big Empire yeah but at

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:21.510
this point the United States has the

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:23.970
largest military in the world during the

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:24.450
Civil War

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:26.610
okay so they're just fighting each other

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:30.540
yeah well now they do yeah before this

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.820
award no but now I mean I don't know

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.470
about at this point after the first

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:36.690
battle but by the end of them by the end

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:37.920
of like the second year the United

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.620
States just the u.s. just the North has

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:41.910
the biggest military in the world

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:47.130
damn February now we're gonna go to

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:48.600

Irish dude in every city to fight which

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:41.850

million damn the two or four million

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:47.700

Lincoln Lincoln needs to stir up the

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.700
Irish to get them to join the war yeah I

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.680
mean he issues a draft eventually but

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.440
for now yeah best thing to do is to get

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.690
[ __ ] I imagine this was kind of an

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:29.620
easy sell to black people as well again

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:31.150
he hasn't done the Emancipation

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:33.400
Proclamation he has man yeah having

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.500
black soldiers wasn't an easy sell for

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.230
the rest of the army oh okay

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:41.950
yeah got you not great in fact most of I

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:43.980
mean there's like general McClellan

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:46.840
[ __ ] they hated black people like a

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.580
lot I mean a lot of the union officers

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.530
were like [ __ ] Lincoln for this yeah

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:54.900
like I'm not helping black people like

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:58.000
yeah it's funny it's like their version

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.020
of like they're just doing it for the

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.880

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:12.310
sick oh yeah because in 1862 once he was

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:19.720
hard he's gonna lot of pressure he's got

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.080
a lot of [ __ ] he saw battle that was

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.580
the first battle you'd ever seen yeah

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.650
there was no real battle he had been in

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:28.990
true that's PTSD I was [ __ ] his time

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:30.730
too yeah he start to booze and he starts

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:33.850
[ __ ] father Corby who was the

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:38.560
brigades priest was uh soon to be the

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.180
president of Notre Dame by the way

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.610
father Corby there's a statue of him in

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:44.320
ER Dame he's given a [ __ ] blessing

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.440
looks like he's calling for a fair catch

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.400
this turning point he's known as fair

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.390
catch Corby come on now

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:54.340
father father Corby actually noted that

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:56.050
Maher was a very good drunk but he was

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:57.790
starting to turn to the bottle under the

00:32:57.790 --> 00:32:59.500
stress and also they were like yeah you

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.850

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:03.400
people drunk and like talk [ __ ]

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.350
everybody that's pretty funny here let's

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:06.730
take a break real quick

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:08.990
all right

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:11.480
so the rest of this is uh yeah we have a

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.760
little fun it's murky huh yes a little

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.559
murky because I just realized I stopped

00:33:15.559 --> 00:33:20.659
taking notes and was just reading now

00:33:20.659 --> 00:33:23.419
we're in May of 1862 it's important this

00:33:23.419 --> 00:33:25.190
is this was [ __ ] wild to know this is

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:28.070
just a year into this war and the South

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:30.380
has [ __ ] up despite the win at Bull

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:33.350
Run they they're getting [ __ ] up in

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:38.390
the Western theater so it's on the

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:41.690
western theatre grant soon a bit you

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:43.880
know you know Ulysses I know about what

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.470
you used to think his first name was ill

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:48.850
ESS Julius's is out out west just

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:51.559
[ __ ] him up so after Bull Run they

00:33:51.559 --> 00:33:53.600
started losing a couple they were losing

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.399
on the Western theater which wasn't as

00:33:55.399 --> 00:33:58.159
important yeah but grant won major

00:33:58.159 --> 00:34:00.770
battles in Tennessee the Union ships had

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:02.720
conquered New Orleans as we already have

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.580
you know North already has New Orleans

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.850
in 1862 which is that kind of gives them

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:09.500
control of the Mississippi River

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.869
oh [ __ ] which the south you know really

00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:16.520
depended on entirely their thing the

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.919
South had suspended habeas corpus they

00:34:18.919 --> 00:34:21.919
had put Norfolk Portsmouth and Richmond

00:34:21.919 --> 00:34:22.700
under martial law

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:25.280
they issued a draft for anybody under 18

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.919
18 to 35 excuse me that'd be sick it was

00:34:27.919 --> 00:34:31.609
only under 18 corporations I think that

00:34:31.609 --> 00:34:34.159
means no trial got you guys right yeah I

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:35.599
believe so I believe that just means

00:34:35.599 --> 00:34:38.599
we're arresting over the [ __ ] Dan you're

00:34:38.599 --> 00:34:40.220
asleep state they would absolute deep

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.960
space this is one year in in the South

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.089
is just the turn a dictatorship [ __ ]

00:34:44.089 --> 00:34:45.950
gar going wild holy [ __ ]

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:48.409
the gold their gold was locked away for

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:49.970
shipment they were ready to ship it out

00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:52.580
as soon as the north got close so that

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:54.530
all the gold was gone to the [ __ ] so the

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:57.339
prices their economy just got trashed

00:34:57.339 --> 00:35:00.200
butter and sugar were impossible to get

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.970
production of alcohol had been outlawed

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:06.980
Isis yeah they did for real they went to

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.859
Isis right away what the [ __ ] actually

00:35:09.859 --> 00:35:12.020
yeah they were kind of Isis that's crazy

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:14.000
slaves they outlawed booze they [ __ ]

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.680
we have all the money don't worry about

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.839
that dude Wow

00:35:17.839 --> 00:35:19.820
never really likened them to Isis but

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.190
that's well if you're losing a battle

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:24.109
kind of the only play you have like all

00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:25.460
right well nobody has a saying this

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.740
anymore give us all your stuff yeah

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.270
which is funny because that's what the

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:30.890
North was accusing Lincoln of the whole

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:32.180
time they're like you better not [ __ ]

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:33.560
become a dictator we know you're a

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:36.050
dictator and the South was accusing no

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:38.119
no the North was northern people really

00:35:38.119 --> 00:35:40.010
yeah there were like draft riots they

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:41.780
were fun right there was in the cities

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:42.980
people hated Lincoln yeah

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:44.660
dude he's a Republican come on mature

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:47.210
lives Hayes enough sure the libs [ __ ]

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:51.079
hater dude classic 1776 Republicans oh

00:35:51.079 --> 00:35:53.060
for sure the party of Lincoln dude party

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:56.270
Lincoln Party Trump true great Sic

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:58.160
Semper Tyrannis how exact however you

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:02.119
slice it dude um also it's funny during

00:36:02.119 --> 00:36:04.849
the this this time it was unusually

00:36:04.849 --> 00:36:08.380
rainy in the spring this is May 1862 and

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.880
so there was mass flooding all over the

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:16.420
south like mass flooding in Virginia

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:21.140
and there they've only had one battle

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:24.650
one major battle in this theater [ __ ]

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:27.200
at this point general McClellan was in

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:30.319
control in the Northeast as little

00:36:30.319 --> 00:36:33.589
Napoleon Little Mac [ __ ] yeah he's

00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:36.290
supposed to be the guy but also at this

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:39.200
point which is funny and he controls the

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.359
military and this is still a time and

00:36:41.359 --> 00:36:43.520
you see it in other countries now yeah

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:46.490
but it's like the general is like the

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:48.200
whoever the leader of the country is is

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.720
like all right I'm not gonna [ __ ] with

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.640
him because at any point he can just be

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.190
like no this is my country I have a

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:57.170
hundred thousand soldiers that's true

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:59.240
what do you have like [ __ ] just at any

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.650
moment McClellan could have just been

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:02.270
like the Lincoln like now a minute this

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:04.790
is my country you're out that's true

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:08.810
yeah some McClellan was in control at

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:10.369
this point of the largest military in

00:37:10.369 --> 00:37:12.349
the world he also had a hundred and five

00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:14.750
thousand troops outside of Richmond but

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:16.160
he never moved that was the big

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.630
complaint about McClellan was he never

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.069
really did [ __ ] he just drilled and

00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:21.050
trained and he always overestimated his

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:23.119
enemy yeah he was always like now they

00:37:23.119 --> 00:37:24.650
have reinforcements we can't attack yet

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:27.079
we can never like it was pretty constant

00:37:27.079 --> 00:37:28.609
he was young and he was known as a

00:37:28.609 --> 00:37:30.619
little Napoleon the troops loved him he

00:37:30.619 --> 00:37:32.000
was actually pretty racist they found

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.920
they found his secret podcast and he

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.810
called Lincoln because Lincoln and

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:40.070
and lover his secret cats yeah it wasn't

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:42.320
great secret trails he had secret here

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.880
the secret podcast Oh

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:51.170
McClellan yeah he ended up being he

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:52.760
wasn't that good but the troops loved

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.100
him again and that was a problem for

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.830
casters hot dude McClellan's cast was

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:04.490
too hot well here's the thing so June

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:07.130
25th alright this is gonna be less about

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:08.840
Mar and more about it's the Civil War at

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.760
this point yeah yeah this is the seven

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.220
days battles the seven days battles was

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.350
a serie of series of seven battles over

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:18.130
seven days from June 25th to July 1st

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:22.870
near Richmond Virginia at this point

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:26.120
robert e lee's in charge okay I think it

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.650
was Beauregard I forget who the [ __ ] I

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:29.090
think it was Beauregard who was in

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:31.370
control of the Confederates but he got

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:34.400
hurt at maybe during the Peninsula

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.730
Campaign which is which was when

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:44.780
Manassas was so he went down McClellan

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.060
during the Peninsula Campaign was

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:49.280
successful against the south but this is

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.140
again this is when he's right outside of

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:52.250
Richmond like during the Peninsula

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:53.570
Campaign they there was an amphibious

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:56.000
landing around Virginia yeah so they

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.740
started working up the peninsula and he

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.200
never ki he didn't capture Richmond he

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.790
could have but he just stayed outside of

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:07.790
it and this is when General Joseph

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:09.890
Johnston who was leading the

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:12.620
Confederates he got wounded during this

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.480
battle so now and then Lincoln takes

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:18.110
control and when Lincoln excuse me

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:19.970
that's when Lee takes yeah and when lead

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:21.350
took control he immediately went on the

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:23.360
offensive at this point the South had

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.090
only only been defensive and when Lee

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:27.440
takes control they just started [ __ ]

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.630
people up dams they they started leading

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:35.720
the attacks there's give me a lot of

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.280
arms here because I'm trying to remember

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.110
what the [ __ ] I was reading yeah that's

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.610
why danger seven days battle

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:43.640
so when McClellan wins the first one at

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.130
the victory at Seven Pines but McClellan

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:48.500
was like kind of like shaken by the

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:49.700
experience and that's that's when

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:52.160
the leaf starts going on the [ __ ]

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.040
offensive the there the unions military

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:58.220
split by this river and during the it's

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.140
it's crazy that during the day this this

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.990
is where like the the thing gets pretty

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:06.020
[ __ ] gross was like this the the

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:08.299
Irish Brigade with Maher was like again

00:40:08.299 --> 00:40:09.619
they were having steeplechase they were

00:40:09.619 --> 00:40:12.140
like racing horses [ __ ] booze and

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:14.270
chillin on this side of the river having

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:16.339
fun and then cannons start going off

00:40:16.339 --> 00:40:18.230
then I call [ __ ] we got to go we got to

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:20.000
go help the guys on the other side of

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.619
the river because they were split so

00:40:21.619 --> 00:40:23.059
that the southerners tried to attack

00:40:23.059 --> 00:40:25.640
them [ __ ] attack half the pool because

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:26.780
they thought they were just gonna be the

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.849
ones attacking so they're just chillin

00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:29.420
in camp

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:31.250
being like we're gonna invade Richmond

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:36.559
yeah but then Lee attacked them and it's

00:40:36.559 --> 00:40:39.470
pretty wild like they had to like sprint

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:41.000
try to get everything ready but again

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.130
like I said the rain had made it like

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:44.990
they couldn't get artillery anywhere

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:47.089
like the roads were just mud

00:40:47.089 --> 00:40:49.010
yeah so now it's just troops and they

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:50.359
end up not getting there in time and

00:40:50.359 --> 00:40:52.369
having like sleep throughout the night

00:40:52.369 --> 00:40:56.480
on the way to the battle which they were

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.130
like it looks like the grounds moving I

00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:59.809
think because they were sleeping where

00:40:59.809 --> 00:41:01.670
there had already been a fight they're

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:04.220
sleeping in mud in the rain but like

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:05.569
they would see cannon flash and you

00:41:05.569 --> 00:41:08.109
would see like images of just hell

00:41:08.109 --> 00:41:10.940
around you like it was dark yeah yeah

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:12.349
they described the darkness as like it

00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:13.670
mean it was crazy dark because of all

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:15.349
the cannons on smoke that was in the air

00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:16.700
so there's just a blanket of smoke

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:17.510
there's no lights

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:19.160
it's just pitch they were trying to

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.349
sleep yeah they're trying to sleep oh

00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:23.119
yeah try to get some rest they knew they

00:41:23.119 --> 00:41:27.650
had to fight the next day and like Mar

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:30.140
was in like a trench like a crater

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.270
uh-huh and he said in the morning he

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:33.530
woke up and he had just been sleeping

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:35.780
next to a dead guy all night and a horse

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.849
with its eyes out is what he said he

00:41:37.849 --> 00:41:38.720
remembered yeah

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.240
like father Corby was like we woke up

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.790
and I coulda sworn I saw the mud moving

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:46.520
it's because they were just men they

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.520
were dying and dead around them like

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:52.490
sloshing around [ __ ] yeah but when they

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:54.170
wake up the next day there's nothing to

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:56.780
even do fights over but there was a

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:57.980
couple more of those during the seven

00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:59.839
days battles where was just battle

00:41:59.839 --> 00:42:02.630
battle Wow Lee kind of won

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:05.210
hmm he lost just as many people if not

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:07.549
more yeah because he was attacking and

00:42:07.549 --> 00:42:10.990
McClellan was like scared of them sure

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:13.220
did somehow it's considered like a

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.170
Confederate victory and they pushed them

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:17.180
off the peninsula so they got them away

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.519
from Richmond but one of the Knights the

00:42:19.519 --> 00:42:22.490
Irish Brigade or the the Union Irish

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:24.680
Brigade runs into the tiger brigade from

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:27.140
Louisiana which was just the southern

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:30.559
Irish Brigade and they were like they're

00:42:30.559 --> 00:42:32.539
from New Orleans they were [ __ ] the

00:42:32.539 --> 00:42:34.279
same thing as the New York guys it was

00:42:34.279 --> 00:42:35.960
like the five points just in New Orleans

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:39.049
yeah it was just thieves pieces of [ __ ]

00:42:39.049 --> 00:42:40.940
so his gangs in New York versus gangs of

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:42.890
[ __ ] New Orleans d and they got to

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:45.230
fight at night where they both kind of

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:47.509
like the tigers who were just as feared

00:42:47.509 --> 00:42:49.309
if not more than the Irish Brigade like

00:42:49.309 --> 00:42:51.200
the same thing was like if you see that

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.940
[ __ ] the Tigers get the [ __ ] out of

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:54.769
office I got damn it dude these guys are

00:42:54.769 --> 00:42:57.559
gonna [ __ ] us up and see how he's just

00:42:57.559 --> 00:42:59.329
fought themselves and yeah I forgot in

00:42:59.329 --> 00:43:01.789
the at night and so they weren't like

00:43:01.789 --> 00:43:04.490
they weren't like and they got into the

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:06.500
Irish the Union Brigade it's like camp

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.240
basically and they just kind of

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.039
fistfight with knives

00:43:10.039 --> 00:43:12.529
of course people were shooting for sure

00:43:12.529 --> 00:43:14.059
it was just like a hand-to-hand fight

00:43:14.059 --> 00:43:16.849
holy [ __ ] Tigers left and they just woke

00:43:16.849 --> 00:43:18.940
up the next morning like Jesus Christ

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:21.890
yeah yeah yeah we'll get back to the

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:23.660
tags just popped up all right she's

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:25.250
[ __ ] real on site dude they're like

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:26.630
oh you guys are [ __ ] sleeping dude

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:28.730
get up we're gonna get in a fistfight

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:31.730
that's so funny funny to the northerners

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:33.140
back you guys are [ __ ] helped in

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:34.579
England you [ __ ] yeah you're

00:43:34.579 --> 00:43:35.180
[ __ ]

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:36.410
well we'll get into that in a second

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:38.450
because that's what that's what kind of

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:40.160
changes this and I'm fast-forwarding a

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.000
bit because we still got to do like

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.220
[ __ ] Antietam sure yeah that's what

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:44.089
we're gonna do next time we're gonna

00:43:44.089 --> 00:43:45.920
stop here shortly okay the thing about

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.170
England that flips this thing and kind

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:50.450
of [ __ ] more is the Emancipation

00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:53.720
Proclamation because now the war isn't

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:57.349
about you know like state like North

00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:59.240
we're south and [ __ ] this out and we got

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.160
to [ __ ] them for help in England and all

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:04.039
that [ __ ] now it's just freeing black

00:44:04.039 --> 00:44:06.710
people yeah as soon as Lincoln announces

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:08.240
the Emancipation Proclamation the war

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:11.119
goes from states right or to now it's a

00:44:11.119 --> 00:44:13.609
war of freeing black people yeah and

00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:15.950
that does a couple things

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:18.529
including uh you know a lot of the

00:44:18.529 --> 00:44:21.470
northern racists yeah we're like well

00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:23.269
what the [ __ ] I'm not fighting for that

00:44:23.269 --> 00:44:25.279
yeah I'm fighting for the United States

00:44:25.279 --> 00:44:29.299
or not you know sure yeah but it also

00:44:29.299 --> 00:44:32.240
really the the move you know as as

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.980
awesome as it is that Lincoln did that

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:35.420
there is some political play there

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:38.599
because announcing that it's a war to

00:44:38.599 --> 00:44:41.359
abolish slavery keeps England out of the

00:44:41.359 --> 00:44:45.019
war there's now England England who had

00:44:45.019 --> 00:44:47.450
already abolished slavery and is kind of

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:48.650
considered like the leader of the

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:51.950
Western world can't jump in to help a

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:53.869
slave country and that crush is the

00:44:53.869 --> 00:44:57.589
South's economy to either yes but it

00:44:57.589 --> 00:45:00.230
also I mean there's a you could be a

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:02.029
real cynic about this there's a real

00:45:02.029 --> 00:45:03.680
cynical way to look at this as Lincoln

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:07.039
declared that in order to keep England

00:45:07.039 --> 00:45:09.140
and anybody else out from helping the

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:12.279
south to be like oh you're helping slave

00:45:12.279 --> 00:45:14.779
slaveholders you can't do that who else

00:45:14.779 --> 00:45:16.760
was not down with slaves at that point

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.890
everybody really literally I we were

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:22.970
close to last Oh throw the Seas he was

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:25.549
like awesome Brazil okay I think Brazil

00:45:25.549 --> 00:45:26.809
was still getting rowdy I think the

00:45:26.809 --> 00:45:28.099
Portuguese down they are still getting

00:45:28.099 --> 00:45:28.759
started

00:45:28.759 --> 00:45:31.700
yeah well yeah giggling go around and

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:32.960
bully everyone today you know start with

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.599
the slaves yeah so I sorry they did the

00:45:35.599 --> 00:45:36.950
whole campaign we're like yeah yeah

00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:39.079
we're done yeah and then the when they

00:45:39.079 --> 00:45:40.490
were like while they were meeting with

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:42.349
like southern diplomats we were like the

00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:43.970
North was like no we're freeing slaves

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:45.049
that's what we're doing that's what this

00:45:45.049 --> 00:45:47.900
war is actually about which it was

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:49.819
according to everything I've ever heard

00:45:49.819 --> 00:45:52.190
was Lincoln's goal the entire time sure

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:54.920
he always wanted to announce that as his

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.289
goal I think he gave some speeches early

00:45:57.289 --> 00:45:58.569
on then I was like I'm not gonna do that

00:45:58.569 --> 00:46:01.039
but privately it was always like Ames

00:46:01.039 --> 00:46:03.230
like that's emancipation is key yeah

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:04.309
which is sick

00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:06.829
that's true that's so I was reading a

00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:08.930
thing about I mean totally unrelated but

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:11.869
it was a they try to study the Monessen

00:46:11.869 --> 00:46:13.819
effects of hash in the 1800s

00:46:13.819 --> 00:46:15.920
yeah so like way be this is like I think

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.710
eighteen like 30s or 40s and they were

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:20.809
like people were like taking these crazy

00:46:20.809 --> 00:46:23.240
doses of it and being like it just turns

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:24.559
people crazy but I'm like dude imagine

00:46:24.559 --> 00:46:27.019
being that high when there were slaves

00:46:27.019 --> 00:46:29.490
and stuff like being like wait

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:32.790
what and it bug out back the end of like

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:35.609
being like wait wait we control people

00:46:35.609 --> 00:46:39.390
it's be illegal or property doctors like

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:40.500
yeah I tried it on people

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:45.150
this shit's bad news so Dan that's true

00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:46.710
that doesn't mean that is one thing I'm

00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:48.180
sure that would did actually work well

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.650
for them someone had one England stayed

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:50.700
out yeah

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:53.640
oh you mean weed or the medicine yeah I

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.020
think we did the Civil War but I think

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.119
like I would have helped those guys some

00:46:57.119 --> 00:46:58.830
of those injuries but instead I'm like

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:00.869
heroin there was a big heroin spike out

00:47:00.869 --> 00:47:03.900
of Americans that was oh yeah opium and

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.089
[ __ ] was like being diagnosed or did not

00:47:06.089 --> 00:47:09.390
diagnose being prescribed to like

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:12.390
obviously veterans who had PTSD and shed

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:15.000
sure and injuries but also widows who

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.440
were very depressed and [ __ ] later they

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:17.609
were just giving out of opium they

00:47:17.609 --> 00:47:18.720

it's something like that where it's like

00:47:46.589 --> 00:47:49.830
PTSD I think you're really [ __ ] up

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:52.140

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:54.060

yeah it's gonna be which we gotta change

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:14.880
that name that something great harder

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.619
core hits hard it's just harder core

00:48:16.619 --> 00:48:19.710
we're not afraid to curse the hardcore

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:22.170
this episode was more hardcore towards

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:23.940
the end this was dude your heart your

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:25.440
soul run was great we got the battle

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.300
bull run the the seven days and the

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:28.890
Peninsula Campaign people are gonna

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:30.480
disagree with a little I mean you you

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.010
actually set your bar high for the

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:33.540
historian but I'm listen I like this

00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:35.400
[ __ ] is [ __ ] tight sure I got a good I

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.680
got a good ear for quality podcasts not

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.980
true so I'm telling you this is a [ __ ]

00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:43.140
another gold [ __ ] wreck I appreciate

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:46.349
this is tight the yeah I mean I can't

00:48:46.349 --> 00:48:47.519
wait to get to Gettysburg we're gonna

00:48:47.519 --> 00:48:49.049
get to Antietam and then we could to

00:48:49.049 --> 00:48:51.720
Antietam it's like I mean so at this

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:52.950
time I think it was the Battle of Shiloh

00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:56.730
mm-hmm the the amount of people dying at

00:48:56.730 --> 00:48:58.499
these battles and casualties was just

00:48:58.499 --> 00:49:02.789
crazy yeah it was like more people would

00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:05.190
die in one day usually in like five

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:07.769
hours in a battle then had ever died

00:49:07.769 --> 00:49:10.319
ever in the history of the United States

00:49:10.319 --> 00:49:13.609
in the French and Indian revolutionary

00:49:13.609 --> 00:49:17.190
[ __ ] 1812 all that combined holy [ __ ]

00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:18.989
more people die in like three hours and

00:49:18.989 --> 00:49:20.819
some of these battles two hours than the

00:49:20.819 --> 00:49:23.609
entire Revolutionary War like it was

00:49:23.609 --> 00:49:26.009
like a daily 911 basically yeah just

00:49:26.009 --> 00:49:28.319
about almost those exact numbers like

00:49:28.319 --> 00:49:29.670
most things but yeah they give you

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:31.410
casualty reports like when you see like

00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:33.569
20,000 casualties you had a bout it's

00:49:33.569 --> 00:49:35.220
like holy [ __ ] but then it's like 6,000

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:37.259
them were just dead sure casualties are

00:49:37.259 --> 00:49:38.849
just you can't fight they got [ __ ] up

00:49:38.849 --> 00:49:40.710
you're injured which usually resulted in

00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:42.029
death I mean more people died from

00:49:42.029 --> 00:49:44.069
disease obviously than it sure more

00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:48.059
people died of just dysentery then still

00:49:48.059 --> 00:49:49.799
yeah I mean if you want to see some

00:49:49.799 --> 00:49:52.200
fucked-up stuff go look at like Civil

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:54.630
War camps and just read the number I

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:57.809
mean I think like these guys are just in

00:49:57.809 --> 00:50:00.690
camps waiting for months at a time for

00:50:00.690 --> 00:50:03.869
the next battle just like just everyone

00:50:03.869 --> 00:50:05.369
just [ __ ] everywhere you run out of

00:50:05.369 --> 00:50:06.480
clothes it gets cold

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.450
yeah sometimes there's winters we'll get

00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:11.430
that we're gonna get to it but is the

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:13.529
stuff I've read about more like he does

00:50:13.529 --> 00:50:15.359
turn to the bottle a little bit but so

00:50:15.359 --> 00:50:17.519
you know so does grant great stuff

00:50:17.519 --> 00:50:20.130
they're getting [ __ ] shit-faced yeah

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:24.329
okay he's party I get it I mean dude

00:50:24.329 --> 00:50:27.180
I guess all bets are off to me in that

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:29.640
mud camp all bets are [ __ ] on well

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.380
it's funny there's a quote from Lincoln

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:33.359
about like people like accusing grant of

00:50:33.359 --> 00:50:34.799
drinking yeah there's like all right

00:50:34.799 --> 00:50:37.170
well maybe I'll start sending barrels of

00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:38.700
whiskey to everybody else in this army

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:40.339
because that guy's actually doing it

00:50:40.339 --> 00:50:42.269
maybe you should start drinking if

00:50:42.269 --> 00:50:43.710
that's what he just like crushed awake

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:46.190
[ __ ] one-liners along Lincoln

00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:48.509
historically is known as a funny guy

00:50:48.509 --> 00:50:50.160
really he would always have like a witty

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.019
kunti response except at the very end he

00:50:52.019 --> 00:50:55.190
didn't have a comeback for that one

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:59.010
didn't say anything witty they probably

00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:01.050
had a good brother would have yeah he's

00:51:01.050 --> 00:51:02.040
probably would have said something from

00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:05.640
you [ __ ] shop oh cool

00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:08.250
his last one was just like a [ __ ] you

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:16.970
know immature fifth grade oh you so cool

00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:18.990
but yeah that's it for now okay we'll

00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:20.130
get it back we'll get it we'll get fired

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:21.840
up again this is one battle I mean

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:23.330
there's Antietam is nuts

00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:26.760
fight immediately D Fredrick's Berg's

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:30.720
nuts but ant items a little a little

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.880
[ __ ] preview for the next week

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.100
Antietam again the Irish Brigade is

00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:37.710
called upon to do the impossible which

00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:40.200
is take I think what's called the bloody

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.570
corner so basically these southerners

00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:44.580
were in this trench mmm-hmm this wall

00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:46.770
not a wall but there was a fence and

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:50.820
then like a dirt a half but yeah kind of

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:52.860
like a half pipe type trench where this

00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:55.200
road was going and they were just laying

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.510
down under the fence between the fence

00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:59.160
in the ground on the ground all you

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:00.450
could see was their head just shooting

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:02.580
out of this trench you couldn't yeah and

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:03.930
that you're marching through a field

00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:05.550
trying to get to them so everyone's just

00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:07.560
[ __ ] getting rocked in this field and

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:09.030
then finally Irish get through at the

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:11.940
same time another Irish Union Brigade

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:15.300
gets on the other side of this trench

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.640
where some dudes are just in this pit oh

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:20.490
they just get [ __ ] lit up oh the

00:52:20.490 --> 00:52:22.500
southern dude so they did some dudes had

00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:24.930
just slaughtered everybody yeah on the

00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:26.580
way and then when the Union finally

00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:28.290
caught up to them in that trench they

00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:31.670
just massacred them Oh Antietam was I

00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:33.870
think it still is the bloodiest day in

00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:34.620
US history

00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:37.770
really just Antietam is one day yeah who

00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:39.360
got to go around the back and like sneak

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:43.410
up behind them just another [ __ ] unit

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:44.940
coming from the side I mean these guys

00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:46.560
this was and there was no real

00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:49.020
communication back then yeah you just

00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:51.030
have one general looking at like a map

00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:52.560
like I think this is where my guys are

00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:55.380
[ __ ] know it hold up a flag and send

00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:56.820
them that way but then the smoke comes

00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:59.070
from all those shots yeah you just

00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:00.600
[ __ ] cuz you're definitely walking

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.370
like oh sweet the trenches over we can

00:53:02.370 --> 00:53:04.530
go around this thing yeah oh we're gonna

00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:06.600
[ __ ] these guys oh man the guys that

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.369
probably got on that other side of that

00:53:08.369 --> 00:53:11.670
like you [ __ ] [ __ ] you guys [ __ ] you

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:15.749
or in the in the book it's talking about

00:53:15.749 --> 00:53:18.150
the casualties that Antietam being like

00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:20.460
whoa this is a different one yeah this

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:22.140
is intense compared to the other battles

00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:25.920
like this is like 50 60 % of us are

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.960
dying how about those dudes who were on

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.730

be like oh yeah whoa [ __ ] yeah I mean

00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:36.539

00:53:36.539 --> 00:53:39.839
sometimes like 60% casualties in every

00:53:39.839 --> 00:53:41.819
one of these engagements like of like

00:53:41.819 --> 00:53:45.210
700 men going into battle like two 300

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:47.490
