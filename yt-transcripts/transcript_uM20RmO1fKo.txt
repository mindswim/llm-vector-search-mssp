someone explain yeah dude please

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.360
it's basically there's that group of

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.860
people that go around to certain parks

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.390
and playground coalition yeah the

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.940
coalition and they they open them up and

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.610
they do everything that it's called

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:23.950
black and brown so I obviously bring

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:26.650
people made this yes yeah and they're

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.300
like this black and brown we're both

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.660
equal yeah no murder I was just like no

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.880
is that black brown Murdock incorporated

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:44.230
like photo shops his name no basically

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.180
what they do is they go around Philly to

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.100
serve like in this instance they go to

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.260
this park they open it up they redo it

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.360
they make it in real nice clean it up

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.970
and then they relieving toys for kids so

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:56.440
the next day when they come in the parks

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.080
open there's you know Tyvek suits they

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.110
wear strange yeah yeah because what the

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.150
door is technically illegal breaking in

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.130
iron again I think it's also the reason

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:07.540
they wear that is because if you see

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.100
that you're not really gonna question as

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:09.970
much as you see a bunch of people

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:11.590
wearing like bandanas and ski that's

00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:13.900
true bye see you long time ago I don't

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.340
want to feel if you see them opening up

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.209
a little band in park and they're doing

00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:23.080
lock cutters yeah yeah okay fair enough

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:35.170
bikes taping it from across street then

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.900
you see old Joey creeping around looking

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.670
in he's like what's going on here and

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:42.280
then next thing you know he went in had

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.110
two soccer ball just start hauling down

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:45.850
the street and they're like you give

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:47.950
that kids toys back he's like no and

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.950
then it's just funny because he's a guy

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.380
we know yeah media he's a comedian in

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.180
Philly so it was funny he's got an ID on

00:17:55.180 --> 00:18:03.630
him too yes he's got slapped he did yeah

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:11.410
technically it's a hate crime I think he

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:12.730
told him something along the lines of

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:14.530
like if I see you I'm gonna hit you can

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.060
see like a noise or something and he saw

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.190
him he annoys them it's like yeah

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:20.080
what he does it's kind of the condition

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.539
and the uh could select so I think

00:18:22.539 --> 00:18:24.429
you'll Murdock is pointless though focus

00:18:24.429 --> 00:18:25.629
the point of that you're not you're not

00:18:25.629 --> 00:18:27.399
ringing any bills you're not [ __ ]

00:18:27.399 --> 00:18:35.200

time period of be like yeah that's when

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:09.510

Acula my doing dude I was just listening

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:17.610
that I've been realistic way back when

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:21.150
if you have any interest in history

00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:23.130

[ __ ] Nazis just evil versus evil it's

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:41.210
[ __ ] crazy

00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:45.810

00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:47.970
this [ __ ] thing sure Holocaust and

00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:51.480
World War two but huh I always wondered

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.790
cuz the siege of Stalingrad took like

00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:56.730
three years yeah the Nazis just surround

00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:58.260
the city and I was always like why don't

00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:00.930
they just [ __ ] take it the Nazis were

00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:03.900
seeing cities because they didn't want

00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:06.090
to be responsible for the civilians like

00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:07.170
they didn't want to have to take care of

00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:08.700
them so they're like we'll just starve

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:10.650
them and then we'll just take the city

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:12.630
yeah like they were literally like we

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:13.830
don't want to just go take the city

00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:15.030
because then we'll be responsible for

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:16.800
these people or we'll have to kill them

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:22.110
we'll just sit outside and wait and then

00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:23.780
the people started eating each other and

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:27.980
rowdy in there but then it got cold out

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:33.060

opinion against pyramus what are we

00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:26.070
doing I said was that the name of the

00:58:26.070 --> 00:58:27.420
song was that a lyric in the song

00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:30.840
no that's name of the song but

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:32.580
apparently it was like what what

00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:34.200
everyone is coming to defense is that

00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:36.869
a satire it was a satirical song in fact

00:58:36.869 --> 00:58:38.640
she recorded a guy with a blood she

00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:40.589
record that song with another black yeah

00:58:40.589 --> 00:58:45.829
I saw something about turning Japanese

00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:48.420
so she was with a black dude yes she

00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:49.980
recorded that song with it it was like

00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:51.720
apparently was a satire of somebody

00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:53.520
who's writing like it was an anti

00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:55.920
nationalists song it was like a joking

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:57.270
about how so it was featuring like the

00:58:57.270 --> 00:59:00.810
t-pain of her time yeah yeah Wow so yeah

00:59:00.810 --> 00:59:03.540
that's where everyone's come so she was

00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:07.560
like kind of woke on the defend that it

00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:08.970
was that's where the defense is coming

00:59:08.970 --> 00:59:11.820
from but everyone's like no that's also

00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:14.579
a weird fight to fight yeah yeah there's

00:59:14.579 --> 00:59:16.770
definitely woke people in 30s but

00:59:16.770 --> 00:59:18.900
probably more so than now I'm going on

00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:20.190
the Statue circuit I gotta get my I'm

00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:21.270
gonna start researching these people

00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:23.550
deeply make oh every statue you could

00:59:23.550 --> 00:59:25.859
tear it say like why is this just coming

00:59:25.859 --> 00:59:27.869
out like that's been there forever she

00:59:27.869 --> 00:59:29.160
did the song in the thirties but you

00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:30.930

00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:37.829
thing I haven't heard the song I'm

00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:40.230
afraid to search it's gonna be bad yeah

00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:42.180
I feel like it's really bad defensively

00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:45.810
it's about jerking off no not me sad tie

00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:47.849
rings back then if you're in a satire

00:59:47.849 --> 00:59:49.680
racism back then it was probably so

00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:51.150
