lot of guest presenters today this is a

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.360
big deal to get an assy award

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.560
in 2020 i mean it's a particularly weird

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.440
year right so to actually achieve that

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.360
level of excellence this year

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.120
it's a whole other thing you know people

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.120
have to realize the the the competition

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.840
was stiffer than ever before um we we

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.600
put more effort into this award show

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.960
than ever before i haven't seen any of

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.120
the work that they've done so i'm hoping

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.800
that it [ __ ] i hope they nail it

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.400
we'll see shannon doesn't look confident

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.759
right now shannon you actually look are

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.440
you nervous about the makeout session at

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.120
the end that's 100 [ __ ] percent

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.680
happening shannon um what i no the look

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.080
on my face is just i hope that you are

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.600
happy with the outcome because dylan and

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.680
i spent all of new year's eve

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.000
working on this with no celebration

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.599
goodwill would like a little bit of

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:50.560
booze

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.080
yeah you could have some booze shannon

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.599

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:54.960
aspirins as well

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.400

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.919

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.520
like no you're not good enough so yeah

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.120

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.240
okay

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.520
[ __ ]

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.919
kykes

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.240
[ __ ]

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.159
the nominees are

00:22:31.919 --> 00:22:33.679
all right let's go uh

00:22:33.679 --> 00:22:35.200
so look i i mean i already i already

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.480
think i already know who i want to win

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.000
this category but maybe zach you could

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.840
be swayed camo's blackface was carl

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.440
malone

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.720
it's fine

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.000
um

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.600
did he end up apologizing for it in any

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.960
way what was his statement because i

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.080
think that when you're dealing with the

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.360
real ass

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.120
blackface of the year you have to be

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.039
unapologetic right

00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:55.200
so anybody who apologizes

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.120
um find out if kylie jenner apologized

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.640
find out if fallon apologized find out

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.000
if kimberly i know stern did not

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.080
apologize yeah i was gonna say i think

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.000
kimmel did

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.360
and then they found out that he said the

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.200
n word in a rap song

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.360
ah but i think he apologized for that

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.400
too who cares

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.200
i have been reluctant to address this as

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.120
i knew doing so would be celebrated as

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.559
victory by those who create apologies

00:23:18.559 --> 00:23:20.159
with weakness i'm cheering for the

00:23:20.159 --> 00:23:23.520
leaders supreme dividers

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.159
does he say i'm sorry

00:23:26.159 --> 00:23:27.840
go keep on going down

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.880
there's nothing more important to me

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.600
than your respect and i apologize wow no

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.559
not real ass at all nope no not real ass

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:36.480
at all did fallon fallon apologize too

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.039
right of course he did yeah i wonder if

00:23:39.039 --> 00:23:40.799
kylie apologized because she's hot too

00:23:40.799 --> 00:23:42.799
i'll just give it to kylie right now

00:23:42.799 --> 00:23:44.480
i don't want to know if she apologized i

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.559
mean stern went the act because the

00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:48.000
jimmy kimmel

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.640
and jimmy fallon were doing impressions

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.640
they just had makeup on

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.279
stern did blackface yeah stern was the

00:23:55.279 --> 00:23:57.679
white dancing and yeah i mean cern was

00:23:57.679 --> 00:23:59.039
pretty realized and then also when asked

00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:00.320
to apologize sermon was like yeah i

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.279

00:24:03.279 --> 00:24:05.200

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.120

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.880
apology uh i had to really examine

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.159

all right um look i'll tell you right

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.880
now in my opinion it's right now it's

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.559
between cuties and wings of vr presents

00:31:16.559 --> 00:31:18.559
bubarites with umajili

00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:19.440

any anything in the chat

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.679
anything in the chat anybody have any uh

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.279
any

00:31:27.279 --> 00:31:29.519
suggestions because i'm split right now

00:31:29.519 --> 00:31:30.799
zack what do you think cutie because

00:31:30.799 --> 00:31:32.559
cuties look cuties broke the internet

00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:34.080
and i gotta be honest with you like you

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.840
gotta give netflix credit because they

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.919
don't give a [ __ ] right yeah so that the

00:31:37.919 --> 00:31:39.519
movie was disturbing to watch right we

00:31:39.519 --> 00:31:40.960
watched the last scene of it on legion

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.480
of skanks and it was like okay a little

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.320
bit too you know a little too crazy

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.240
these are actual little girls but

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.760
netflix and everyone's like cancel

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.919
netflix sample netflix actually netflix

00:31:49.919 --> 00:31:51.679
was like yeah go ahead yeah they don't

00:31:51.679 --> 00:31:53.039
give a [ __ ] dude the amount of press

00:31:53.039 --> 00:31:54.880
that they got over that was incredible

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.000
netflix should be up for real estate of

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.200
the year to be honest with you because

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.640
they didn't give a [ __ ] and this is

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.200
actually this as it relates you see them

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.360
giving andrew schultz a special now you

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.640
see them [ __ ] they're going to give

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.159
tim dillon something probably soon if i

00:32:06.159 --> 00:32:08.799
had a guess i think netflix understands

00:32:08.799 --> 00:32:11.760
that controversy sells they have so much

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.440
content on there that they can sort of

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.279
go outside of the normal

00:32:15.279 --> 00:32:18.240
um parameters of of will course [ __ ] and

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.320
drum up interest i think i literally i

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.799
think cuties was a um

00:32:22.799 --> 00:32:24.480
in a weird way like a white marketing

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.159
tactic yeah where they were like yo

00:32:26.159 --> 00:32:27.360
let's just see what this does and they

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.720
went oh yeah you know what controversial

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.840
[ __ ] actually gets more people

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.080
subscribing they they they analyze those

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.240
numbers and the subscribers and believe

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.320
me if they were losing subscribers at a

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.399
mass you know that [ __ ] will be gone

00:32:38.399 --> 00:32:41.440
gone [ __ ] gone okay um but i think

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.960
they like the controversy a little bit

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:46.320
so i think overall cuties sort of opens

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.799
the window for a guy like me you know

00:32:48.799 --> 00:32:51.039
who knows maybe i'll be on netflix this

00:32:51.039 --> 00:32:53.600

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.960

it's a different angle on this george

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.720
floyd there was not much success or

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.319

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:48.880
of the year brian callan

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:49.760
uh

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.119
i look i'll tell you right now brian

00:46:51.119 --> 00:46:53.359
cowan in his cancellation keeping it

00:46:53.359 --> 00:46:55.680
very real ass did not take the foot off

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.480
the gas

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.400
didn't stop doing comedy i just kept

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.000
doing comments and disappeared he's

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.040
suing

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.680
uh he's suing his accusers which i a

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.440
real ass [ __ ] move right there i got

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:06.800
no problem with that

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:09.680
um delia yeah and i like dalia uh you

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.280
know easy you know

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.400
and to be honest with you his

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.800
cancellation i feel like was unjustified

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.720
whereas at the very look

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.160
calendars he's handling a real last week

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:19.119
but i don't know i don't know what the

00:47:19.119 --> 00:47:20.640
[ __ ] happened there but when you look at

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.319
the evidence of dalia's cancellation you

00:47:22.319 --> 00:47:24.000
go like oh he likes young chicks he

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.760
didn't do anything illegal like the

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.359
times where they showed he found out he

00:47:27.359 --> 00:47:28.400
was talking to a girl that's under the

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:29.680
age of 18. he was like oh yeah i'm not

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.880
interested in talking to you anymore i

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:32.079
almost feel like that was like the light

00:47:32.079 --> 00:47:33.440
that should have been shown on that was

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.960
like oh no he had a standard he's just

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:36.480
he's a clown

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.400
he likes young [ __ ] chicks guys like

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:39.760
young chicks what are we gonna say you

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.520
know um i don't think he should have

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:43.040
been canceled for that but it is what it

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.480
is uh

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.160
you know callum keeping it real kicked

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:48.000
off fighter and the kid

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:48.960
which

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:50.319
i mean

00:47:50.319 --> 00:47:52.559
that has to [ __ ] sting that's the

00:47:52.559 --> 00:47:53.839
king instinct

00:47:53.839 --> 00:47:54.800
um

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:56.480
and who else we got here we got ellen

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:58.480
degeneres ellen's generous she'll be

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.240
fine she wasn't really canceled she

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.400
wasn't canceled they tried to they went

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.000
after her it was for just being mean

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.359
yeah she's not the cancellation of the

00:48:05.359 --> 00:48:08.640
year and uh the last one are she fear

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.720
ooh

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:11.920
ari kept it realized the whole time he

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.280
took the lie detector test and said if

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.640
he had to do the kobe tweet all over

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.160
again he would do it again he was not

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:18.559
lying that's as real as it gets so right

00:48:18.559 --> 00:48:20.720
now in my opinion it's between callan

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.720
and ari shafir for real last

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.559
cancellation of the year i'll cross off

00:48:24.559 --> 00:48:28.079
dalia and ellen generous right now

00:48:29.599 --> 00:48:31.359
i want to say ari because ari got

00:48:31.359 --> 00:48:32.960
himself canceled to the point where he

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:36.160
had to hang out with us more often

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:40.240
so his cancellation really benefited us

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.240
more so than countless

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.800
it did benefit us and his cancellation i

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:47.040
mean it did have like

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.880
had a big impact but it's like

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:52.480
he well also ari wasn't truly canceled

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:53.839
you know what i'm saying like he had a

00:48:53.839 --> 00:48:55.280
special cancelled

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:57.359
but it was his self-produced special so

00:48:57.359 --> 00:48:58.240
he just had to stop working the

00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.200
production company didn't make sense and

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.359
then covet hit so

00:49:01.359 --> 00:49:06.079
yeah i feel like callan was legitimately

00:49:06.079 --> 00:49:08.079
cancelled from something you know he was

00:49:08.079 --> 00:49:09.520
canceled from that that podcast that he

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.040
did he's the kid of the fighter and the

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:12.000
kid

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.480
and um i'm sure he did i think he was on

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.400
the goldbergs and he lost that yeah did

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.240
he like he legitimately got cancelled

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.079
and the fact that he's just saying [ __ ]

00:49:20.079 --> 00:49:21.520
you i didn't do this and he's suing them

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.040
and going after him and he [ __ ]

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.800
started a podcast with sam tripoli which

00:50:52.559 --> 00:50:54.079
quickest way to let people she was a

crazy [ __ ] look at her face

00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.960

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.920
two biggest news stories coveted 19 and

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.880
louis's fake presidential election but

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:21.440
presidential administration though it's

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.359
rumored that amy klobuchar is being

considered for a position in the gilles

00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:26.480

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.400
speaking on his podcast or even the fact

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.400

but you know that letter the twitter

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:41.839
stuff

00:52:41.839 --> 00:52:44.160

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.280

holding it down for her man

00:52:57.839 --> 00:53:00.319

00:53:00.319 --> 00:53:02.880
ethical level uh i mean i guess i

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.400
disagree with all of them but that one's

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.319
particularly rough and anyway for the

00:53:06.319 --> 00:53:08.240
last one we have

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.559

to say this is stupid but

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:20.319
there's lesser contributions uh to bring

00:53:20.319 --> 00:53:22.319
to society than being hot and i'm sure

00:53:22.319 --> 00:53:24.079

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:00.880
nominating a real ass trick of the year

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:04.400
first time doing the awards with you

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:07.200

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:10.480
it in 2017. shannon you can be up for

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:13.040
2021's real ass chick of the year if you

00:54:15.119 --> 00:54:16.880
pretty real ass yeah you could really

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:19.119
sink that position right now i'll keep

00:54:19.119 --> 00:54:21.119
keep that in mind well now it's 20 21 so

00:54:21.119 --> 00:54:22.559
she can't be nominated for 2020. she

00:54:22.559 --> 00:54:25.839
wasn't realized at all last year

00:54:25.839 --> 00:54:27.359
um all right let's eliminate some of

00:54:27.359 --> 00:54:28.319
these

00:54:28.319 --> 00:54:30.480
kamala harris gone what are we doing

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:31.280
here

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.920
the [ __ ] who cares okay [ __ ]

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.119
uh

00:54:35.119 --> 00:54:38.000
all right let's see let's see uh i mean

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.440
everyone else is pretty real yeah

everyone else this is really hard can we

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:43.680
make them all split one award

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.200
i think we should make them fight for it

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:46.640
and i think we know who's gonna get it

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:47.839
oh yeah the girl beat up pink pants

00:54:47.839 --> 00:54:51.040

00:55:04.559 --> 00:55:06.240
all right boomer girl wasn't real ass

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:08.000
like that's she's just hot fine we'll

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.440
take her off the list goddammit she's so

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:11.839
hot though i follow her on everything

00:55:11.839 --> 00:55:14.799
she's [ __ ] streets she's in counties

00:55:14.799 --> 00:55:16.079
avenues

00:55:16.079 --> 00:55:18.799
boomer girl's gone uh

00:55:18.799 --> 00:55:20.799
i like jk rowling as well i like the

00:55:20.799 --> 00:55:22.559
fact that she's all anti-tranny gotta

00:55:22.559 --> 00:55:23.920
give her a lot of respect for that she's

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:25.520
no joke you think she'd be but we have

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.200
to stick to our guns we do appreciate

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.720
the non-apology

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:30.240
i appreciate if anything she stuck the

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.839
landing on it

00:55:31.839 --> 00:55:34.240
but i'll still say she's not in there

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.040
for

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.079
real last check of the year i think we

00:55:36.079 --> 00:55:38.240
have to eliminate some uh gizlane she

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:40.319
did stand behind her man amber heard

00:55:40.319 --> 00:55:41.760
shooting and she's so hot so she's

00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:43.200
hitting on two things she's hitting on a

00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:44.559
hot chick thing

00:55:44.559 --> 00:55:45.920
and [ __ ] in johnny depp's bed that's

00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.760
just a very funny real ass thing to do

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.280
you have to use your real ass to take a

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:50.559
[ __ ] on a bed

00:55:50.559 --> 00:55:52.559
so i mean in a literal sense i feel like

00:55:52.559 --> 00:55:54.720
she's sort of a head in my mind

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:56.400
um and then the girl beat up pink pants

00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.960
that [ __ ] was [ __ ] hardcore parkour

00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:00.720
nobody saw that comment in my opinion

00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:03.040
zack right now it's between amber heard

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:05.119
and the girl who beat up pink pants well

00:56:05.119 --> 00:56:08.240
one of them won a fight

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:09.839
yeah

00:56:09.839 --> 00:56:11.280
and i'm gonna go i'm gonna go with the

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:13.119
girl beat the pink pants over amber you

00:56:13.119 --> 00:56:14.720
know what i think i agree with you zack

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.000
that was a pretty real ass move if you

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.760
guys don't remember go watch that video

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.920
girl beat up pink pants um

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:21.760
do we think girls pink pants could beat

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:24.079
up johnny depp easily johnny that was

00:56:24.079 --> 00:56:25.440
like five foot four

00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:26.640
look at this girl we thought pink pants

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:30.359
was gonna [ __ ] her up

00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:33.200
look at this oh pink pants on top too

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.520
you forget that pink pants was on top

shown up on legion of skanks

00:57:35.359 --> 00:57:36.799
what is real

and what is fake

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:42.079
founder of the assy awards

00:57:42.079 --> 00:57:43.680
richard ass

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:46.240
once described a fake ass dude as some

00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.480
dumb jackoff that doesn't know his place

00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:50.880
now get out of my restaurant it's still

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:52.960
segregation

00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:55.359
it's amazing to think that

00:57:55.359 --> 00:57:57.440
70 years later and the assy awards are

00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.119
still putting fake ass dudes in their

00:57:59.119 --> 00:57:59.920
place

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:02.079
this year's nominees for fake ass dude

00:58:02.079 --> 00:58:04.960
of the year are special ones there's so

00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:07.520
many fake ass dudes to choose from this

00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:10.400
year it was a very inclusive list that

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:11.280
all

00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:13.839
didn't really have many people of color

00:58:13.839 --> 00:58:15.920
and for that we're probably pretty happy

00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:17.440
and so should

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:19.359
people of color be to know that they're

00:58:19.359 --> 00:58:23.520
not on a list of fake ass dudes

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:25.599
this year's nominees

00:58:25.599 --> 00:58:28.160
first nominee

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.760

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.920
for being trans now

00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:35.119
that's a literally fake ass dude

00:58:35.119 --> 00:58:38.240
some canceler jagoff that had heat on

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:39.599
him about a year ago because he

00:58:39.599 --> 00:58:41.200
cancelled somebody very funny and then

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.960
it's just kind of been dwindling since

00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.720
then and then he moved to idaho to live

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:46.720
with his parents and now he's afraid to

00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:49.359
leave his parents house without a mask

00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:51.599
on because his dog might die or

00:58:51.599 --> 00:58:54.559
something like that for being gay

00:58:54.559 --> 00:58:56.720

incredibly obsessed with louis j gomez

00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:08.160
at every given moment until he sees him

00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.559
in person then his eyes water up and his

00:59:10.559 --> 00:59:12.240
legs shake

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:14.799

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.319
he gave you the business on the

01:00:10.319 --> 01:00:12.480

01:00:14.559 --> 01:00:16.160
behind him yeah it takes his shots it is

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.599
what it is like i can't i'm not going to

01:00:17.599 --> 01:00:18.960
just say guys a fake ass dude just

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.720
because he doesn't like me or i don't

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.559
like him we've made our piece i'm going

01:00:22.559 --> 01:00:24.799
to take my cult off that list uh i'm

01:00:24.799 --> 01:00:26.079
also going to take elliott page even

01:00:26.079 --> 01:00:27.920
though she's the most literal literal

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.880
fake ass dude i just feel like um that

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:33.200
accomplishment is not unique to her

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.480
there's a lot of other fake ass dudes

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.640
out there that just did that right so it

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.480
really comes down to jake flores and

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:41.200
seth simons the fact that if i was jake

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.680
flores and i was being compared to seth

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.920
simon so often i would actually put a

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:47.359
[ __ ] bullet in my mouth i would kill

01:00:47.359 --> 01:00:49.599
myself i would kill myself if i was if

01:00:49.599 --> 01:00:51.440
somebody was saying like oh seth simons

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.640
and jake flores just regularly

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.640
synonymous that would be enough for me

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:56.480
to [ __ ] commit suicide but jake

01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:57.359
flores

01:00:57.359 --> 01:01:00.079
uh he loves it he loves being

01:01:00.079 --> 01:01:02.559
you know that [ __ ] guy and he's also

01:01:02.559 --> 01:01:04.640
both of these guys are very fake ass can

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.079
you bring up that picture of seth simons

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:09.079
again

01:01:10.799 --> 01:01:12.319
because

01:01:12.319 --> 01:01:14.640
i didn't realize this until that picture

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.000
but that's the picture when you like you

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.839
tell an autistic person to smile for the

01:01:17.839 --> 01:01:18.880
camera right

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.640
no he's a dweeb yeah that's when you

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:21.599
tell

01:01:21.599 --> 01:01:23.839
somebody with asperger's to smile at the

01:01:23.839 --> 01:01:25.359
camera they look away and like their

01:01:25.359 --> 01:01:26.640
mouth goes

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.119
he's a [ __ ] dweeb if listen if

01:01:29.119 --> 01:01:31.280

01:01:39.359 --> 01:01:41.040
and beg for forgiveness i promise

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.559
everyone that that is a promise that i

01:01:42.559 --> 01:01:43.680

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.359

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.200
okay and jake flores doesn't call the

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.880
cop so i might just attack him who knows

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:53.280
what's gonna happen okay he's a anti-cop

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.200
guy so we'll see how anti-copy is if he

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.200
[ __ ] runs into me again fake ass

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.920
dudes are very very close right now um

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.079
what's fake about these guys

01:02:02.079 --> 01:02:02.960
uh

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:06.039
i mean

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:08.799
i'm trying to think who's more of a fake

01:02:08.799 --> 01:02:12.640
ass dude who is who is there who's

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.880
i think i have to give it a seth yeah

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.839
because jake at least gets on stage

01:02:17.839 --> 01:02:19.359
and and tries

01:02:19.359 --> 01:02:20.960
it's not even that he tries it's just

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:21.680
that

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:24.799
he's at least doing comedy seth failed

01:02:24.799 --> 01:02:27.039
out of comedy look i gotta say right he

01:02:27.039 --> 01:02:28.559
still wants to be part of it so he has

01:02:28.559 --> 01:02:29.760
to write these articles

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:30.799
i'm kind of going back and forth though

01:02:30.799 --> 01:02:32.480
because very fake-ass move like jake

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.559
flores knew that i i'm not a proud boy

01:02:34.559 --> 01:02:36.559
right he knew that but he still put that

01:02:36.559 --> 01:02:39.680
out as a narrative um which it's just

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:41.839
like if you know for like well i would

01:02:41.839 --> 01:02:43.839
never argue a point that just isn't real

01:02:43.839 --> 01:02:45.119
you know what i'm saying like that i

01:02:45.119 --> 01:02:46.839
wouldn't stand on that [ __ ] that

01:02:46.839 --> 01:02:48.960
ground um so it was a pretty fake ass

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:52.559
move seth simons

01:02:53.839 --> 01:02:55.760
is he being fake as i mean he sort of is

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.440
like he knows like he writes article an

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.039
article about dave smith being a nazi

01:02:59.039 --> 01:02:59.839
and uh

01:02:59.839 --> 01:03:01.440
an anti-semite it's like no dude you

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:02.799
know he's not you know he's [ __ ]

01:03:02.799 --> 01:03:04.559
jewish you know he comes from [ __ ] a

01:03:04.559 --> 01:03:07.039
jewish family in brooklyn but he sort of

01:03:07.039 --> 01:03:08.720
keeps on pressing on that just because

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.079
he knows that those are buzzwords

01:03:10.079 --> 01:03:11.839
that'll get people canceled

01:03:11.839 --> 01:03:14.640
it is really tough i'm really torn right

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.480
now

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.720
um

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.480
jake eating his own calm that's not very

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:21.760
fake ass that's kind of real i gotta be

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:22.960
honest with you it's a realized move to

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.799
eat your own calm on camera well [ __ ]

01:03:24.799 --> 01:03:27.039
punch you in the balls

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.120
not because lewis was sexually

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:22.239
assaulting the employee

01:11:22.239 --> 01:11:24.800
hell yeah for that reason many fans saw

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.960
this as a new take on an old classic and

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:29.120
one of the best episodes of the last 10

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:31.440
seasons

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.840
the next the next nominee big anthony's

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:36.960
life matters oh a life matters uh

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.360
joke i would imagine yep featuring aaron

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.560
berg

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.120
in this episode aaron berg rips off of a

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:46.000
child's book titled

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.080
he brings laughter to the show but

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.920
unlike past episodes that featured

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:52.080
laughter this was not due to lewis

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:53.840
laughing while sexually assaulting an

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.040
employee

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:57.280
for that reason many fans saw this as a

01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.679
new take on an old classic and one of

01:11:59.679 --> 01:12:02.960
the best episodes of the last 17 seasons

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:05.520
though it is a polarizing episode as

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:07.600
some fans prefer the more regular

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:10.400
non-comedic episodes

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.679
this is how it's supposed to end i don't

01:12:11.679 --> 01:12:13.440
like how i'm being trashed

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.040
in my opinion to be responding to

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:17.679
someone off camera

01:12:17.679 --> 01:12:19.840
what you're saying it is supposed to be

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:21.600
a comedy show

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:24.239
who are you get the [ __ ] out of my house

01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:25.600
so there was supposed to be an intruder

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.360
i guess that came in and said

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.120
a stranger an intruder at the end that

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.239
said

01:12:30.239 --> 01:12:31.840
hey you know that's a comedy show and i

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:34.159

01:17:42.239 --> 01:17:44.000
but this is just a little it's a little

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.120
sampling let's say this is very

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.239
interesting

01:17:46.239 --> 01:17:47.280
quiz

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:49.920
to see who's more real ass you or matt

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:51.520

i'll give you i'll give you the answer

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.400
to the quiz matt's more real ass than me

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:55.520
do you think he's more realistic for

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.960
sure

01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:58.000
you don't know that though maybe you

01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.360
don't even know that about yourself i do

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:01.199
know that about matt i'm gonna answer

01:18:01.199 --> 01:18:05.040
the first question avenged sevenfold

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:13.440
sevenfold has been sliding do you a

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.159
avenge them um all right so here's what

01:18:16.159 --> 01:18:18.080
we're gonna do nate explain to me a

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.280
little bit because i don't know the uh

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.239
the the scoring system nate was here how

01:18:22.239 --> 01:18:23.920
does this work this is this year

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:25.280
the scoring system is at the bottom

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.880
first show of the year i think wow okay

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:28.800
so you you how well how many points do

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.640
you get per thing

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:31.920
well it's dependent on the way you want

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:33.360
so there's it's multiple choice

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:35.040
questions and then based on your answer

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.239
you get different points i mean i'm

01:18:36.239 --> 01:18:40.760
hating dylan moore as i'm here

01:18:44.610 --> 01:18:49.650
[Laughter]

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:55.120
how about lewis can't administer a quiz

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:56.960
oh [ __ ] i mean look what if they had a

01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.320
great episode we i mean real last

01:18:58.320 --> 01:18:59.520
podcast

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:01.520
um more laughs per week than any other

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.199
podcast in the world i would be

01:19:03.199 --> 01:19:04.880
surprised to find another podcast that

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:06.480
has more laughs per week than the

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:08.560
realest podcast uh in my opinion is

01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:10.640
gonna have to really come down to

01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:12.880
um can i get a taste featuring dalton

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:15.760
pruitt and karen margolis or coke magic

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:18.320
featuring shane gillis and dan soder i

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:19.840
mean it's really a toss up between those

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.360
two they hit on such different things

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.040
for such different reasons maybe a

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:24.400
little bit of feedback from the uh the

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:26.480
producers in the booth

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.719
what are you thinking shannon um i mean

01:19:28.719 --> 01:19:30.800
so much work went into the coke magic

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:33.120
episode it really ruined like my whole

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:34.960
week because because i lost the whole

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:37.040
night of sleep so it has to be coke

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:38.960
magic you like coke man in my opinion

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:42.000
yes dylan

01:19:42.159 --> 01:19:43.600
people understand how much work goes

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.520
into some of these things and that's why

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:47.440
i'm picking coke magic it's not because

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:50.719
of my emotions because coke magic was me

01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:53.280
on the phone with you for an hour

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:55.120
yelling getting yelled at about your

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:56.640
zoom update and

01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:57.920
i didn't even happy that the [ __ ]

01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:59.360
episode happened and somehow it turned

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:01.120
out this great stuff you were an hour

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:04.320
late to a zoom podcast on that one yeah

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:06.400
so

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.400
it's so close

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.480
it's so close i mean

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:14.400
i think in my opinion my love of

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:16.639
radio drama

01:20:16.639 --> 01:20:18.960
makes me want to say can i get a taste

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:21.040
can i get a taste was just an incredible

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:23.840
just like dylan showing his ass

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:26.639
he i mean he legitimately cried i mean

01:20:26.639 --> 01:20:28.480
it doesn't get any better i was just

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:31.040
ganging up on someone who's genuinely

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:33.040
nice to us all the time a wounded little

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.560
deer in the woods who's just trying to

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:36.400

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.880
that deer like hyenas and just [ __ ]

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:46.320
cackled at him while we tore out his

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:47.600

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:01.040
um

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:03.440

01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:47.440
uh live via satellite from the stress

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:52.760
factory comedy club it's louise gomez

01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:00.560
2020 has been a rough year in trying

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:02.400
times like these i often find solace in

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.719
this harriet tubman quote she said real

01:30:04.719 --> 01:30:06.560
ass times call for real ass men to run

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:08.800
[ __ ] and put us [ __ ] in place

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:10.639
to be realized means more than having a

01:30:10.639 --> 01:30:12.800
real ass it's more than having two butt

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.560
cheeks and an anus that [ __ ] comes out

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:16.800
of believe it or not having an actual

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:17.760
ass

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:19.600
has almost nothing to do with being real

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:20.400
ass

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:21.840
being real ass means giving a middle

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:23.920
finger to the fake asses of the world it

01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:25.760
means doing whatever the [ __ ] you want

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:27.920
it means never taking no for an answer

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.280
unless it's from a girl who doesn't want

01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:31.199
to [ __ ] which in that case you take her

01:30:31.199 --> 01:30:33.280
no shove it up her [ __ ] then fight an

01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:34.480
uber driver on the way home when he

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:36.400
refuses to smell your fingers

01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:38.159
when i think about being a real ass i

01:30:38.159 --> 01:30:39.520
also think about the comedians who have

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:42.719
paved the way for me cosby aziz ansari

01:30:42.719 --> 01:30:45.120

01:33:54.639 --> 01:33:56.560
ayg is closer to the heart

01:33:56.560 --> 01:33:58.480
i don't want to split the vote but ayg

01:33:58.480 --> 01:33:59.840

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:04.560
pretty real ass other than you yeah i

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:06.000
mean without even a conversation of how

01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:11.040
[Laughter]

01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:12.480
which by the way i don't actually harbor

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:13.760
resentment for those guys they're great

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:15.120

01:34:16.239 --> 01:34:18.159
six months that was okay after that we
