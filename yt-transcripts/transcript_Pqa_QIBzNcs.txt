WEBVTT

00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:12.240
[Music]

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.920
we are continuing

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.920
our exploration

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.359
of

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.400
pure mysticism

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.400
of which

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.960
most of the time

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.359
i talk about the practical applications

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.920
but now and then

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.559
it is very useful

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.640
even necessary

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.399
to

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.559
remind ourselves

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.200
of what are the fundamentals

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.320
of

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.239
mysticism

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:51.760
which has been

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.280
defined

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.280
as the art of union with reality

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.280
to the extent

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.799
that

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.680
i learned the art of

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.400
identifying myself with reality

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.800
to that extent i become more real

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.000
[Music]

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.240
so

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.320
when the buddha talks about

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.280
or almost being a slave

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.840
being enticed

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.280
by the fleeting phenomena of the world

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.759
it is not to deprecate us

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.079
but it is to remind us

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.400
that our legacy

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.600
is vast

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:48.479
[Music]

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.960
if i can

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.640
put

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.320
the theme of the spiritual life

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.920
in one short sentence

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.320
you can see the contrast

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.799
between the spiritual life

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.399
and the worldly life

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.200
that is lived by almost all today

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.319
what matters

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.420
in the world today is what i have

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.400
[Music]

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.400
what matters

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.640
on the spiritual path is what i am

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.120
we have always to remember

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.879
that

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.920
whatever i may have

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.120
if i don't know who i am

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.519
i'm likely

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.000
to run into trouble all the time

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.560
all right here we are third and final

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.959
part of the meditation series we did it

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.480
this is the spiritual level of

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.920
meditation

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.200
welcome to the

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.840
absolute top level of the temple this is

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.120
the secret esoteric knowledge

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.480
this is the third and final part of the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.239
meditation series what i am calling the

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.480
spiritual level of meditation this is a

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.319
big topic that can go in a million

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.560
different directions but i'm going to

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.959
keep this as simple and basic as

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.200
possible so first let's try to clearly

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.959
define exactly what we're doing here

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.040
what do i mean when i say the spiritual

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.400
level of meditation because it's a

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.400
loaded word the spiritual level of

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.920
meditation could be thought of as the

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.080
quest of fully integrating mindfulness

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.000
meditation into every aspect of your

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.480
life into decision making feeling

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.840
thinking behaving etc and not only that

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.239
but using mindfulness meditation as a

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.799
means to reach some ultimate personal

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.280
goal which we'll talk about in a second

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.959
so for example a lot of beginning

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.799
meditators start to meditate to gain

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.640
some kind of short-term benefits they

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.159
don't want to change the way they

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.400
operate or think they just want relief

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.360
from feelings thoughts emotions whatever

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.200
it's almost used as more of a surface

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.879
level band-aid but if we continue to

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.720
meditate to continue to notice our

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.560
thoughts and feelings and look deeply

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.239
into them over and over we start to

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.599
notice that what we thought only

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.760
required a band-aid might actually

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.760
require major surgery like we said

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.439
people tend to meditate because they

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.760
need help in some aspect of their lives

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.760
something's wrong but maybe they're not

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.920
sure what it is or what to do about it

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.519
it's like living in an old house that's

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.680
a fixer-upper but not knowing anything

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.040
about construction

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.600
the walls show signs of mold and water

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.639
damage

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.080
and you just try to you're constantly

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.919
just trying to paint over it and sure

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.000
enough the water keeps coming through

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.520
and the mold just bleeds right through

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.199
whatever paint we put on it eventually

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.040
in time

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.639
we often take the same approach to our

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.040
minds we know something's wrong but we

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.199
think we can just patch it up and gloss

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:40.800
over it the spiritual level of

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.960
meditation is ripping the walls open and

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.520
seeing what's actually going on

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.680
finding where the water's coming in and

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.240
sealing up the leak once and for all if

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.320
our minds are fundamentally scattered or

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.560
for being primarily fueled by unhealthy

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.639
beliefs or emotions then we can meditate

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.800
all we want but we'll most likely stay

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.320
in the same spot mentally and become

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.919
frustrated and give up

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.199
and so for that reason we're going to

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.039
start this series by examining how

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.400
belief systems play a role in meditating

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.320
and why it's important to look deeply

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.560
into what we believe and then clarify

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.160
our beliefs we mentioned something a

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.919
minute ago about using meditation as a

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.080
means to achieve some ultimate personal

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.120
goal

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.199
many of the eastern spiritual practices

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.360
have a concept of what this looks like

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.120
you've probably heard about nirvana

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.440
enlightenment and other stuff like that

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.880
most people kind of view these things

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.320
with a you know

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.680
a grain of suspicion or like disbelief

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.960
but what most people typically don't

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.720
talk about are the smaller versions of

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.360
those seemingly humongous and impossible

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.360
goals these are the prerequisite

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.639
checkpoints for achieving these

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.080
legendary mystical states of

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.400
consciousness for instance the hindus

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.880
have this idea of samadhi which means

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.039
agreement specifically agreement within

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:52.960
one's mind this is thought to arise

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.639
after a person really practices a

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.639
certain system of meditation for some

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.120
time where all the aspects of one's mind

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.880
come into agreement with one another

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.560
rather than being scattered between

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.880
competing urges and concerns now another

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.319
reason that i'm calling this a spiritual

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:08.160
level of meditation is because i think

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.000
that currently people in the west are

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.639
meditating under the paradigm of science

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.319
and science is great for certain things

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:16.240
but in my opinion with meditation it

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.800
leaves a ton of stuff off the table

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.400
and the stuff i'm talking about is is

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.080
more of the

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.479
longer term goals that can shape your

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:26.240
meditation practice and give you

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.960
something to actually look forward to

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.800
check this out okay so this is a quick

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.880
example of what i'm talking about

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.639
we mentioned that

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:36.880
the spiritual level of meditation is to

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.080
pursue

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.440
a sort of

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.560
an end goal a sort of state that we can

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.400
attain through meditation it's not just

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.639
to kind of calm down we can do that if

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:48.160
we want but if we really want to take it

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.080
to the next level we need some sort of

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.840
goal to work towards

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.680
now the best goal that i can come up

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.880
with

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.880
within the scientific context would be

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.440
to achieve a state of sanity and if you

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.680
look up what sanity means the definition

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.560
of it

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.960
is just soundness of mind

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.360
which is kind of vague but we we know i

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.759
guess we have an idea of what that is

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:11.039
so look at this right here how to

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:13.280
achieve sanity the first thing that pops

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.560
up this is the

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.479
this is my critique of meditating within

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:18.160
a scientific context

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.599
hey it doesn't really give you anything

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:21.840
that compelling to aim for

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.919
and say okay well it gives you sanity

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:26.080
okay we have sanity what's the road map

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.240
to achieving sanity where's the clear

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.120
and

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.240
concise roadmap here's here's part of 10

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.720
ways to keep your sanity

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.240
look for sunshine

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.039
plan your days and weeks limit news and

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:41.039
social media checking

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:43.360
get fresh air every day

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.840
prioritize exercise pick playlists and

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.840
podcasts carefully cook healthy

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.319
nourishing meals and read books real

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:53.280
books and i think 9 is meditating funny

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.080
enough

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.759
and 10 is connecting with friends

00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:00.000
so again not bad advice

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.680
but is this the stuff

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.039
that could keep you tethered to a

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:05.759
regular meditation practice

00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:07.520
for me no this is kind of just a

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.840
hodgepodge of stuff and again

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.520
i'm not saying like this is the ultimate

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.919
answer of science but it's i've looked

00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:15.680
around for a lot of them and i i haven't

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.520
seen

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.720
many that

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.560
are different or better than this except

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.639
for act which we'll get to later which

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:24.639
if you read act if you learn how to

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:26.000
about acceptance and commitment therapy

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.440
which i've covered before

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.800
and you read about buddhism and all

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.639
these spiritual traditions you'll see

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:33.760
that act borrows very very heavily

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.640
from

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.080
this kind of

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.519
let's call it the spiritual level of

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:38.800
meditation but then puts it into

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.479
scientific terms which again if that

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:43.279
works for you cool none of this is to

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:45.279
promote one thing over the other but to

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:46.959
just show people that there are more

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:49.200
options than they think they have so

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.800
let's jump over to

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.399
buddhism so if we're meditating within a

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:55.040
buddhist framework again if you want to

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.160
do it cool if you don't want to do it

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.680
whatever i'm not here to kind of sell

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.600
any type of framework but just to

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.080
illustrate that within the spiritual

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.560
level of meditation we get a little more

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.880
guidance and we get

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.360
we can aim for higher states so you know

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.680
within buddhism you're not just going

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.800
for sanity you're going for

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.600
enlightenment for nirvana well how do

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.200
you reach that by following the what's

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.519
called the noble eightfold path uh right

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:21.200
understanding right thought write speech

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.040
right action right livelihood right

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.560
effort right mindfulness right

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.399
concentration i'm not going to go into

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.240
all these things because again it's like

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.760
i have a

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.720
very

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.320
weak understanding of them but i have

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.080
read about them and

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.200
they're pretty compelling they're pretty

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.440
good and if i were to sit down or anyone

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.959
were to sit down and actually follow

00:09:38.959 --> 00:09:41.760
these things and put them into practice

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.080
i haven't i have a belief that they

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.720
would experience serious benefits

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.080
now i don't i don't see this kind of

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.920
thing in science because science can't

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.279
talk about

00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:54.320
a thing like right livelihood it's not

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.240
scientific to talk about but it's

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.920
incredibly useful

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.320
to think about and talk about but you

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.040
don't get that within just a strictly

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.760
scientific mode of meditation that's why

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.920
i'm saying if we can kind of

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.240
suspend our

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.320
rigid adherence to one world view and

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.160
start to explore some others we can get

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.839
some super helpful

00:10:15.839 --> 00:10:18.079
stuff in terms of crafting our own

00:10:18.079 --> 00:10:20.160
practice that we find meaningful and

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.720
personally useful and try to use that to

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.839
reach a

00:10:23.839 --> 00:10:26.160
let's say higher state of awareness

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.959
or a more functional state of awareness

00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:31.040
that's my point all right so we saw that

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.279
little example you know again

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:34.560
it's the best i can do but for

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.160
simplicity's sake let's say that the

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.839
standard run-of-the-mill mode of

00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:40.480
meditation here in western countries

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.279
usually lies within a scientific context

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:45.360
meaning science is the system of belief

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.440
that we are meditating within and this

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.880
is kind of obvious if you think about it

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.800
since the benefits that we can hope to

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.800
experience under this scientific mode of

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.120
meditation tend to be portrayed in

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.279
personal physical terms we're talking

00:10:57.279 --> 00:10:58.959
about lowering cortisol the stress

00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:00.800
hormone we're talking about easing the

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.800
heart rate increasing gray matter in the

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.440
brain and all this is fine but

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.920
it can also limit us to those benefits

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.760
where there are potentially more to be

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.560
had

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.880
the practice within the scientific mode

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.040
is capped by the limitations by its own

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.560
belief system

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.079
meaning all we can ever hope for within

00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:20.560
the strict adherence to this worldview

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.880
is basically temporary relief and as far

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.240
as i can tell that's all we're really

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.480
getting when we meditate strictly within

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.320
this context and again i i'm i'm 100 i

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.480
swear if that works for you

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.279
good

00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:35.120
the point isn't to be like shame on you

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.720
for this it's to be

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.519
for a lot of people i it's my own belief

00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:41.920
that that doesn't necessarily get the

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.040
job done

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.200
i think we can do better so that's what

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.120
taking it to the next level is for if

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.279
that first level works for you cool like

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:51.200
we said before if breathing through the

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.360
diaphragm and calming yourself down is

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.560
enough for you

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.639
that's awesome do that and if you can

00:11:56.639 --> 00:11:58.240
just kind of do the stuff of the mental

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.240
level and work on that for a while and

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.880
that's enough for you sweet this is just

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.160
for people who say all that stuff's cool

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.000
but i feel like i could use a little

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.720
more of this well here it is and again

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.639
this isn't a bash of science science

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:14.560
rules it's 10 out of 10 in terms of its

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.720
practical applications it helps us stay

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.800
alive stay comfortable and all that good

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.000
stuff

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.320
but in terms of you know immaterial

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.639
stuff how we think and feel it leaves a

00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:26.240
lot to be desired

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.320
even before all the covet stuff anxiety

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.320
depression suicide addiction

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.320
all were on the uptick

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.800
science for all of its gifts and whatnot

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.560
seems to be missing the mark on some

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.480
fundamental level a level that's maybe

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.399
hard to define or talk about but it's

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:42.639
felt nonetheless and can be reflected

00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:45.279
through mental health statistics science

00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:46.880
like we said does a great job at

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.200
extending the human lifespan

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.680
but doesn't seem to be doing such a

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.480
great job at giving us something to live

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.920
longer for

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.519
so i guess the spiritual level of

00:12:57.519 --> 00:12:59.760
meditation another definition of it

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.600
could be taking your practice out of

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.000
this realm of science and into a more

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.240
lush and vibrant belief system of your

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.560
own choosing especially one that feels

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.839
right to you

00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:11.519
personally and this is kind of my belief

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:13.839
here i feel like a great deal of human

00:13:13.839 --> 00:13:16.639
beings are at a sort of impasse the

00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:18.480
scientific worldview is spiritually

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.000
bleak as it is oftentimes feels better

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.839
than turning to the other option which

00:13:23.839 --> 00:13:25.760
would be organized religion which

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.760
sometimes seems almost ridiculous in

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.040
light of all the stuff that we know

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.279
today so most of us just kind of hang in

00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:32.399
the balance

00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:34.320
somewhere between these world views in a

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.040
state of like non-committal confusion

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.120
and my goal my clear goal for this whole

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.360
series is to help anyone who wants to

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.120
meditate their way out of this strange

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.279
spot that we find ourselves in today

00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:46.639
toward more

00:13:46.639 --> 00:13:49.199
toward greener spiritual pastures while

00:13:49.199 --> 00:13:51.279
also not having to deny that dinosaurs

00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:53.440
existed or be forced to believe anything

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.600
that doesn't feel right to you hans

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.360
torres and author of vedanta heart of

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.040
hinduism kind of sums it up with this

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.120
quote we nevertheless seem to be at a

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.800
turning point today

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.440
awareness of our tragic isolation and

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.240
longing for a wider context within which

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.880
man can once again experience himself as

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.199
part of the universe not just as its

00:14:13.199 --> 00:14:15.600
conqueror is growing steadily here's

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.519
another quote this one's by carrie f

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:19.199
baines and can be found in the preface

00:14:19.199 --> 00:14:21.120
of carl young's book modern man in

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.199
search of a soul between these two

00:14:23.199 --> 00:14:24.800
extremes of traditional faith and

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.440
militant rationalism it may be said that

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.279
the middle position is held by those

00:14:29.279 --> 00:14:31.120
people who know that they have outgrown

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.639
the church as exemplified in

00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:34.720
christianity but who have not therefore

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.800
been brought to deny the fact that of

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.880
religious attitude to life is as

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.639
essential to them as a belief in the

00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:42.480
authenticity of science

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.000
they are convinced that if they can

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.600
attain more knowledge of the inner

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.600
workings of their own minds they can

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.440
achieve the new attitude that is

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.839
demanded without having on one hand to

00:14:51.839 --> 00:14:53.519
regress to what is but a thinly veiled

00:14:53.519 --> 00:14:56.399
medieval theology or on the other to

00:14:56.399 --> 00:14:58.959
fall victim to the illusions of the 19th

00:14:58.959 --> 00:15:01.040
century ideology

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.160
end quote

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.240
and by 19th century ideology what

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.920
they're referring to were the systems of

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.920
philosophy that viewed religious thought

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.680
as a useless artifact of primitive

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.000
people and sought to replace it with a

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.320
total dedication of logic reason

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.160
government economics

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.240
and if you follow world war ii males

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.680
china all that stuff

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.839
uh it all ended pretty badly with like

00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:24.240
you know genocides prison camps

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.720
totalitarian dictators definitely not

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.279
the stuff of science-based utopia and

00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:30.959
without getting too far off topic young

00:15:30.959 --> 00:15:32.959
believes that the spiritual inclination

00:15:32.959 --> 00:15:34.720
of humans was not only real but

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.959
essential for our mental health here's a

00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:38.800
quote from young himself

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.800
among all my patients in the second half

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.440
of life that is to say over 35

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.680
it is safe to say that every one of them

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.759
fell ill because he had lost what the

00:15:47.759 --> 00:15:50.160
living religions of every age have given

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.079
their followers and none of them has

00:15:52.079 --> 00:15:54.000
really healed who did not regain his

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.440
religious outlook

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.600
this of course has nothing whatsoever to

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.600
do with a particular creed or membership

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.920
of a church and notice young saying this

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.600
religious attitude has nothing

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.600
whatsoever to do with a particular creed

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.360
or membership to a church i mean there's

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.040
nothing wrong with joining one if it

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.800
resonates with you and you find it

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.920
useful

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.759
that's that's awesome what young's

00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:15.519
talking about here is something he's

00:16:15.519 --> 00:16:17.519
written about extensively about the

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:19.519
psychological benefits of contacting

00:16:19.519 --> 00:16:21.839
what he calls the numinous or that which

00:16:21.839 --> 00:16:24.320
goes beyond thought and words that which

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.639
brings us peace simply by experiencing

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:27.759
it

00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:28.880
and again

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.399
does that sound familiar we're talking

00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:32.560
about enlightenment we're talking about

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.920
nirvana

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.959
here's the same concept just popping up

00:16:36.959 --> 00:16:38.560
in a different tradition basically

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.199
there's this idea that if we train our

00:16:41.199 --> 00:16:43.680
minds properly and align ourselves to

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.959
the right things in a way that's

00:16:44.959 --> 00:16:46.959
authentic to ourselves

00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:49.279
we can experience these

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:51.519
blissful states that might pop up and

00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:53.279
kind of come and go or maybe we can just

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:54.880
kind of attain them and be at some new

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.160
level

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.839
but it's well documented and well

00:16:57.839 --> 00:16:59.120
written about

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.880
that human beings

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.680
do their best when striving toward

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.439
this stuff that young's calling the

00:17:05.439 --> 00:17:07.520
numinous that and other traditions they

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.199
have other words for it but it's all the

00:17:09.199 --> 00:17:10.400
same idea

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.240
we can train our mind

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.199
we can

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:15.679
design our life toward experiencing

00:17:15.679 --> 00:17:18.160
these blissful states and growing as a

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.880
result and healing ourselves as a result

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.799
so like we said one of the main goals if

00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:24.720
not the main goal of the spiritual level

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.199
of meditation is altering ourselves

00:17:27.199 --> 00:17:29.440
through meditation mind body and soul so

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.520
that we can directly experience the

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.120
numinous whatever that is to us the

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.080
bliss wholeness oneness or whatever

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.919
rather than merely relieving stress

00:17:37.919 --> 00:17:39.840
before a job interview

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.120
we're going for the gold here on the

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.559
spiritual level we're trying to

00:17:42.559 --> 00:17:44.799
experience the version of the numinous

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:47.120
that only we can personally experience

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.760
whatever that state of all clarity

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.799
oneness whatever that is for you

00:17:52.799 --> 00:17:54.799
the the idea here is that you can work

00:17:54.799 --> 00:17:56.880
your way toward that and while i can't

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.160
personally attest to becoming

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.600
enlightened or achieving a state of

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.679
nirvana obviously i can definitely say

00:18:01.679 --> 00:18:03.280
that the benefits of seeking those

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.280
states are very real

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.400
and why is that it's because the

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.840
traditions that guide us toward the

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.160
attainment of those states ask a lot

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.440
from us

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.200
they demand that we rip our house down

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.280
to the foundation and rebuild it rather

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.280
than just going and getting fresh air or

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.960
being selective about what podcasts we

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.200
listen to which again are both

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.440
decent pieces of advice but don't go far

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.880
enough in my opinion

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.799
so that's the end of part one and again

00:18:26.799 --> 00:18:27.919
i told you we're gonna keep these things

00:18:27.919 --> 00:18:29.840
short and sweet but we're gonna end with

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.400
a little meditation trying to kind of

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.320
organize this material in our heads in a

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.000
way that we can only do through

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.240
mindfulness and contemplation so

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:42.760
see you in the next one after this thing

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.679
all right so just like we did before in

00:18:45.679 --> 00:18:47.280
all the other videos we're going to

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.679
start to meditate by doing

00:18:49.679 --> 00:18:52.559
proper breathing our eyes are closed

00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:54.640
we have a hand on the chest one hand on

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.400
the stomach we're going in through the

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.640
nose

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.960
feel the stomach rise

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.280
and then out through the mouth

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.080
the belly falls

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.000
again the idea here

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.760
is to make our stomach rise not our

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.120
chest that's where we're breathing

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.120
through the diaphragm this is helping

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.200
our bodies physically to relax

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.480
so in through the nose

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.080
belly rises

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.440
and out through the mouth

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.440
do a couple more breaths like this into

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.919
the nose

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.130
out through the mouth

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:41.079
[Music]

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.840
so

00:19:55.919 --> 00:19:57.760
so once we have our breathing down

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.880
feeling relaxed we're in a nice rhythm

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.400
try to see if you can meditate on a

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.520
question

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.640
meaning this

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.200
a question is going to be posed to you

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.679
see if you can meditate on it meaning

00:20:09.679 --> 00:20:11.520
watch what your mind produces in terms

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.039
of thoughts and feelings around what is

00:20:13.039 --> 00:20:15.200
said rather than trying to make yourself

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.200
think about it or figure out an answer

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.200
if that makes sense

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.799
now before you get the question just

00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:21.919
remember

00:20:21.919 --> 00:20:23.440
keep breathing

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.360
don't lose that rhythm keep that breath

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:25.820
going

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.920
[Music]

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.000
here's the question

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:34.780
why are you meditating

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:40.920
[Music]

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.799
[Music]

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:55.799
so

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.840
here

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:20.609
[Music]

00:21:25.039 --> 00:21:26.640
now whenever you're ready see if you can

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.120
let go of the goal of meditating on this

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.600
question of watching your mind

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.000
spontaneously produce stuff

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.670
versus thinking like normal

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:40.709
[Music]

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.240
let go of this idea of

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.400
needing or wanting to focus or meditate

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.559
at all just let your mind do whatever it

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:51.679
feels like

00:21:51.679 --> 00:21:53.679
knowing that whatever it's doing is

00:21:53.679 --> 00:21:56.159
ultimately

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.919
okay and as you do this as you disregard

00:21:59.919 --> 00:22:02.159
everything and just let go

00:22:02.159 --> 00:22:03.679
try to pay attention to what it feels

00:22:03.679 --> 00:22:05.280
like to do this

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.520
maybe it feels peaceful maybe it feels

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.840
weird or uncomfortable either way just

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.960
feel it

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.880
there's no need for thought

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.520
and no need to not think either

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.039
you're just

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:18.480
being there

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.159
you're looking

00:22:20.159 --> 00:22:22.400
and knowing you're okay

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:27.559
with whatever is going on at this moment

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.880
[Music]

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.480
now imagine that you're letting this go

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.960
too this desire to even be aware of

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.559
anything

00:22:48.559 --> 00:22:50.240
just as you exhale

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.600
just let go

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.760
try to really imagine and feel the sense

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.799
of letting go like a trustful there is

00:22:56.799 --> 00:22:58.320
nothing to do

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.640
there's nothing you need to do there is

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.760
no way you need to be other than how you

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.940
currently are

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:12.630
[Music]

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.880
imagine that when you fully let go that

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.120
someone or something is behind you to

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.039
catch and hold you

00:23:25.039 --> 00:23:26.720
and within this space

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.880
everything is actually okay

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.000
it's handled taken care of

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.559
you're just here experiencing it all

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:36.880
experiencing being alive

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.200
there is no need to gain any information

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.679
or skill or be different in any way at

00:23:41.679 --> 00:23:42.960
this moment

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.120
being as you are

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.840
is simply enough

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.360
what would it take for you to feel like

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.200
this normally

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.880
what would you have to believe or not

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.760
believe

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:02.440
what would you have to do or not do

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.880
on this for a moment
