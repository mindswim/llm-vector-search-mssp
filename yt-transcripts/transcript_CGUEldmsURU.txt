WEBVTT

00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:03.199
what up everybody uh welcome to

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:05.920
welcome back i should say to psych null

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.080
um

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.920
real quick before i get into it a little

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.440
update on the groups

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.719
uh there is an intake process going down

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.760
um it's nothing very crazy at first i

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.439
i kind of really just kind of jacked a

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.920
intake form uh from a website

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.560
from some counseling center but it's it

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.920
was like you know i don't i think maybe

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.359
one or two people

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.400
uh got exposed to this questionnaire but

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.079
it was kind of a little too clinical in

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:33.440
like you know

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.960
i don't know just ask too many questions

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.800
that again for intensive therapy i'm

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.120
sure

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.920
are you know good things to know uh for

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.800
these purposes i

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.079
just you know i think we use it on a

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.079
couple people and it was just like that

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.719
so i updated that so there's like if

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:47.680
people are and this is

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.520
what i'm i'm still figuring this thing

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.800
out but really it's like if people are

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.920
interested in

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.480
kind of optimizing their group go ahead

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.079
and do an intake if you're like hey man

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.520
i just kind of want to like you know

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.480
have a general life enhancing chat with

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.840
people once a week

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.359
not totally necessary you can still do

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.960
it if you want you know knock yourself

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.240
out sometimes it's good just to answer

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.200
questions about yourself because it

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.640
makes you think about stuff

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.479
um but you know some people are like no

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.960
i don't want to do that totally fine

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.000
but the i say that i say that because

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.880
uh the groups should be getting started

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.479
at least

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.280
towards the end of july and how it's

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.640
going to work is

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.960
i have a book right now i'm i'm putting

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.400
together some sort of uh

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.240
you know group program in terms of like

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.320
session one session two session three

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.840
you know and then figuring out like well

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.680
you know how many sessions will these

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.079
groups

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.439
last for i'm thinking probably like six

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:40.079
to eight

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.360
meaning like you know an eight-week

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.439
thing and i can only take really like

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.000
three or four on at a time

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.240
so what i'm thinking of doing is uh so

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.079
i'm reading a book about basically brief

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.360
interventions that you know some of them

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.560
are even like four days

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.560
so i'm i'm figuring that out but what

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.840
it's looking like i think i said this

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.560
before

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.240
are they'll probably be like four groups

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.479
going that'll last anywhere between

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.320
four and eight weeks probably more

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.479
between six might be the magic number

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.479
um and then as soon as that's done it's

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.399
like you know back to the discord or you

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.679
might be like yeah i think i'm good

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:10.879
i'm done with this whole thing you might

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.560
be like [ __ ] matt who knows i don't know

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.400
how this will go it's an experiment

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.239
um but ideally it would be something

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.040
like you know back to the discord

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.040
uh now here you are this human being

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.480
who's done a six week program you have a

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.760
little more knowledge

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.879
you know you're in the discord people

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.480
are doing those informal meetups and

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.280
maybe pop in

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.560
maybe pop in and flex your uh

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.160
psychological flexibility on people like

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.599
hey actually check this out

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.640
you know because that's in terms of the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.879
reach of this and this is more or less

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.080
the entire experiment

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.200
is like you know uh what do you

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.200
what things do you actually need a

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.800
trained professional for and i know

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.040
people are probably our hairs if you are

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.080
some sort of trained professional

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.360
therapist you could be like oh jesus

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.920
christ this could go so wrong blah blah

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.440
yeah maybe i don't know but it's like

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.440
there is some stuff that like i think

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.599
human beings can handle by themselves

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:58.720
mainly like

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.519
i don't know with given the proper

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:02.640
skills like a

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.040
having a grounded conversation about

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.200
their goals and values i i think

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.959
i think the average cat can handle that

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.400
you know so it's like

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.840
you know this isn't like any sort of

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.159
like anti-psychiatry

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.159
movement or like you know down with all

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.239
it's like no it's just like let's

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.760
figure out some you know more affordable

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.519
options will they be the best

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.040
probably not i don't know maybe they'll

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.239
be the best i don't know but will they

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.440
be the best probably not they're free

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.959
you know if you're paying somebody

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.120
who's done like you know like who's like

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.000
a researcher

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.440
or does all kinds of stuff and you know

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.519
has read all the literature

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.720
yeah man that's you know that's why they

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.640
cost a couple hundred bucks um but i do

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.879
think it will be good to have an option

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.239
for people because like

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.080
you know someone might not need that you

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.440
know it's like say i have a little bit

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.159
of back pain

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.599
i don't need to get back surgery you

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.200
know i might just need to like

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.879
have a little yoga class this is kind of

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.319
you know maybe this is like a mental

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.159
yoga class i don't know you know i don't

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:55.280
exactly know but i

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.879
i just i have my suspicions that

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.840
i don't know that you know

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.200
again this is you know this is

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.640
psychology this is the mind we don't

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.680
even know what the mind is

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.040
but you know people are very quick to be

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.480
like oh not everybody can deal with the

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.760
mind it's like

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.519
what is it you know it's like we don't

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.280
have a standard real definition for

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.799
the mind or what consciousness even is

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.720
so this is like consciousness doctor

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.600
stuff

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.040
so i feel like we can start doing some

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.199
things that seem pretty safe

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.479
seem pretty neutral and only seem to be

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.440
again like promoting certain life skills

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.840
or

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.600
you know psychological skills i i just

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.120
don't see the downside of that

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.919
and i do think there needs to be

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.680
something there needs to be some option

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.400
other than the

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.000
professional clinical option which does

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.360
leave a lot of people with a bad taste

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.479
in their mouth it just does

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.320
you know and i left me with a good taste

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.919
in my mouth i had it in my mouth i liked

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:48.240
it

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.720
uh so you know i'm not like downplaying

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.680
that

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.440
but again i do want to try to like you

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.040
know this whole thing is

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.120
experiment is to see is it possible to

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.360
generate some sort of clinically

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.160
significant

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.520
value on a movement that's

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.759
largely peer-led you know help of

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.440
experts sure dude i'll read all your

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.880
books i'll have you on if you want to

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.720
help no doubt dude

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.680
um but again it's like can the can

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.720
people

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.560
you know quote unquote lay people get

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.160
the information

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.560
and use it in a way with themselves in

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.320
each other that is clinically

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.160
significant or even just you know

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.560
testimonial level beneficial i think you

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.840
can so that's the experiment so the

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.800
group should be started

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.360
sorry that's kind of a long tirade but

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.960
the reason i'm saying that is the groups

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.960
will be started if you're in the groups

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.560
you know feel free to pop in on the

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.160
discord when you're done it's like go

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.520
back to the discord you can continue

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.120
meeting people you continue doing like

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.639
informal meetings with people they pop

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.400
up on the discord all the time

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.240
and you know maybe flex your [ __ ] you

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.520
know go back there and do that i'll take

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.280
more people and then ideally i'll get

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.160
through

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.240
you know everybody in this little beta

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.360
version um

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.720
get through everybody then it's like now

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.479
you have this discord where everyone's

00:05:58.479 --> 00:05:59.440
been through

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.720
you know they've gained some

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.800
psychological skills so it's like

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.080
maybe they can continue to help each

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.440
other unofficially maybe they can think

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.800
you know save each other the you know

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.240
the money and time

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.759
all the hassle of you know trying to get

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:11.520
to a therapist and blah blah blah

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.639
and maybe they'll do it and say you know

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:13.600
what i kind of would like some

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.120
one-on-one stuff i you know i feel like

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.720
i kind of highlighted what i want to

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.600
work on but you know

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.720
you might do that too that's totally

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.639
fine again this isn't like a all or

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:22.560
nothing kind of thing this is just

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.720
introducing another option free option

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.080
and i think

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.840
humans should be able to communicate

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.199
with humans in a way

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:31.039
that doesn't cost a bunch of money that

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:32.639
you know that's me

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.960
maybe i'm crazy i don't know um all

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.759
right

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.919
so this one is this isn't this isn't uh

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:43.680
let me say this isn't from the book the

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.479
thing that i'm doing with this one is

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:46.960
from

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.520
a from putting these groups together i

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.880
stumbled across

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.400
uh something i really liked and this

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.400
will be what the first group is based on

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.400
so i think i can just kind of like

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.000
it seems simple enough that anyone can

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.840
do it um you know with a little bit of

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.120
explanation

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.120
so i'm going to show you what i what the

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.720
first group will be for everyone and

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.240
it's basically filling out the act

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.280
matrix

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.120
so and i'm doing it this way too because

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.560
again i'll only be working with like you

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.479
know three maybe four groups

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:14.160
um so maybe this can be something that

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.840
can get entered into that discord space

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.880
where it's like it's really

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.280
very intuitive and it's pretty

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.880
self-explanatory but we can go through

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.160
it and if you know people want like a

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.599
little something to uh

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:25.199
you know spice up their discord groups

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:27.039
or try to like you know some sort of

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:28.880
structure or some sort of thing to talk

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.319
about well here's something i found i

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:32.000
think it's pretty cool

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.440
all right so this thing's called the act

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.680
matrix and um if you're looking at this

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.240
video

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.560
you will see that i figured out how to

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.280
put an

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.039
image as like the whole background slide

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:42.479
so the image if you can't see this is

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:44.639
keanu reeves in all ones and zeros like

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:46.080
either putting on or taking off

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.840
sunglasses can't tell

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.680
um so it looks [ __ ] sick first of all

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.120
and you know the title is getting into

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.800
the ones and zeros of your daily life

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.680
you know because we're out here we're

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.800
bopping around

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.039
we have thoughts going all the time well

00:07:57.039 --> 00:07:58.000
this is actually something cool

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.840
too i'm reading another book brief inter

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.240
brief interventions for radical change

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.879
and um they kind of talk about you know

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:06.400
the act stuff

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.560
what it's trying to promote is this idea

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.759
that you know it's like think of

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:11.440
yourself as a three-part system where

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.039
it's like you know you're

00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:14.400
you know you have a context right you

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.759
have an environment you have a physical

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:17.120
environment you're out bopping around

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:17.840
you're at work

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.759
there's certain people at work you go

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:21.199
home there's certain people at home you

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:21.919
live in a

00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:23.919
you know a certain state a certain

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:26.479
country you have a certain family

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:27.919
all of those people are kind of

00:08:27.919 --> 00:08:30.160
flavoring your experience

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.000
with the things they do the way the ways

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.399
they the stimuli they give you you know

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:35.760
are your parents yelling at you when you

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.279
go home are they high-fiving you telling

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:38.000
you the best

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.599
are they telling you the best too much

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:40.959
in a kind of a weird way where you're

00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:42.719
their special little boy or special

00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:43.839
little girl

00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:44.959
you know i don't know everyone

00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:46.240
everyone's experience is different but

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.440
that's the first level that's your

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.560
external environment

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.399
that's your context that's your si

00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:52.080
they're the systems that you're part of

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.800
right

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.399
so you're part of a bunch of systems

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:55.360
you're in an environment and they're

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.880
spitting little things at you that

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.000
trigger what

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.839
thoughts in you all day long so you have

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:01.120
it you're in an environment

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.519
and your brain is producing thoughts all

00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:05.120
day long or you can call it your mind

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.399
your mind is producing thoughts all day

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:09.920
long even when you sleep it's still it

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.200
you know it does it differently

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.720
but it keeps producing all of these

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.160
thoughts that's the second level of like

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.600
you know so you have stimuli

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.200
stimuli brings the pound thoughts and

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.640
sometimes thoughts just happen but let's

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.279
just for

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:21.040
the sake of ease you're out in your

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.880
environment your context right all the

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.320
things that make up all the things

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.399
around you that aren't you basically

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:29.279
um and then they're triggering thoughts

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:31.279
constantly in you just all day long like

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:33.200
just a stock ticker of just like you

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.440
know i suck i suck i suck or like i'm

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.560
the best on the best

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.240
you know whatever it's just there's some

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.320
stream of thoughts going in your head

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.040
all of the time all of the time it

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.800
doesn't stop

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.320
but people tend to stop there and the

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.839
psychological flexibility what they're

00:09:47.839 --> 00:09:49.120
trying to really get at is

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.560
i thought this was really cool is like

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.160
there's also another part of you which

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.680
is the observing self

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.959
because like you know you you're in your

00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:56.959
environment you have thoughts going 24

00:09:56.959 --> 00:09:57.839
7.

00:09:57.839 --> 00:10:01.680
but there is a you that can slash

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.040
should be or is observing your thoughts

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.600
so a thing happens thoughts are going

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.440
either this is cognitive fusion

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.600
you know uh you go in your dad yells at

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.800
you like my dad's such a [ __ ]

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.519
[ __ ]

00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:15.600
and then you know that might leap your

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.600
physical body into action versus if you

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.440
have an observing self your dad's saying

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.800
some [ __ ] to you you can sit back you

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.959
can think my dad's [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:24.320
and then think about a little longer and

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.440
be like well i wonder why he's doing

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.720
this or like you know like

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.480
or i'm noticing that i'm getting

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.760
incredibly angry

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.120
you know it's rather than just being

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.800
like [ __ ] you dead and trying to fight

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.000
him you can say like

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.760
you just notice you're getting angry and

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.360
then even observe yourself over time be

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:37.920
like

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.680
does this guy get me angry a lot and i

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.440
wonder why he does you know that's kind

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:41.920
of

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.680
the work that's being psychologically

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.120
flexible of like

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.040
environment triggers thought triggers

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.160
feeling in you

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.000
and you observe yourself with that

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.160
feeling rather than letting that feeling

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.480
launch you into most likely negative

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.000
action that you know it

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.120
maybe that could be positive actually

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.480
maybe you've had enough of your dad [ __ ]

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.079
you're lex luthor i'm watching a lot of

00:11:00.079 --> 00:11:01.839
smallville which is such a

00:11:01.839 --> 00:11:03.600
it's a horrible show it's really bad um

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.800
but it's kind of funny and it's kind of

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.600
addictive

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.959
you know so if you're like a lex luthor

00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:08.320
set up or you're like the billionaire of

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.920
luther corp and you know your dad just

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.040
hates you and

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.640
you know has been giving you books like

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.160
the art of war your whole life and this

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.600
is like i'm disappointed in your kid and

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.040
he's constantly [ __ ] with you

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.240
then yeah that would be good for lex

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.360
luthor to find him like dad you know

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.880
what [ __ ] you but i don't

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.640
i think he turns bad and you know i

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.800
think yeah he's like nice i'm not gonna

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.959
get into smallville but

00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:28.160
that's the whole point so it's like you

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.000
know none of this stuff is like

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.560
gospel it's just a way to approach your

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.320
life in a way that will help you could

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.839
just sit and think like my dad

00:11:35.839 --> 00:11:38.720
is just a [ __ ] [ __ ] and i'm gonna

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.920
give him my wrath

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.320
but it's like how much distance and

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.839
space can we get between thought and

00:11:43.839 --> 00:11:45.279
reaction you know that's kind of like

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:46.480
you know the third part you have an

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.760
observing self who can

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.680
think about and observe your thoughts

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.399
and feelings that's what flexibility is

00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:54.320
like you know i feel like [ __ ] that can

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.600
just you know i've said this a thousand

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.399
times

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:58.480
you know your dad's being a [ __ ] i'm

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.079
angry i feel like [ __ ]

00:12:00.079 --> 00:12:01.760
[ __ ] my dad hates me this sucks it sucks

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.120
to be me you can go down that whole road

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.800
you can just be like man

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.720
i feel really angry right now i feel

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.320
really shitty and observe yourself

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.320
observe those thoughts and just try to

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.440
think about you know where they're

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.959
coming from what's going on and even

00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:14.000
just to

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.480
buy time before you react because the

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.519
you know let's say the

00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:19.519
the ultimate thing that happens or the

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:21.440
thing you can think all you want

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.519
but if your thoughts are making you do

00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:24.639
things

00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:26.720
that end up you know jamming you up

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.399
that's like the ultimate expression at

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:29.600
the end of this thing is like you know

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.880
you have your observing self but at the

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.320
end of the day that's all tied to your

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.519
physical body

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:35.920
your you know your pure physical self

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.440
and if you were to reach and just punch

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.120
your dad in the face it's like

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.320
you know maybe you'll go to jail now

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.839
maybe you'll kill your dad which would

00:12:41.839 --> 00:12:42.639
be

00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:45.200
horrifying um even if he has a [ __ ]

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.279
so it's like how do we buy some time

00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:49.440
slash space how do we keanu reeves slow

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.639
down those bullets

00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:52.560
coming at us all day and slow down you

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.560
know most importantly our reaction

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.600
um this the act matrix thing i think

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.720
really helps with that

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.920
and it was if you're if you see the

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.560
video this was designed by kevin polk

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.360
um he spent about like 17 000 hours

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.079
simplifying

00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:08.560
act down to like these just two simple

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.440
lines in a

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.000
like a four part matrix pretty cool um

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.279
so yeah just giving credit where

00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:14.880
credit's due

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.519
um yeah and again this this info is what

00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:19.279
the initial group session will consist

00:13:19.279 --> 00:13:20.079
of

00:13:20.079 --> 00:13:21.440
so i figured you know why not give it to

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.720
everyone you know something for the

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.160
discord groups while

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.920
they wait for your boy to come around

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.760
and be like yo let's go

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.279
alright so i think that's a good

00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:31.040
introduction

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.800
this is a picture of the act matrix uh

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.079
if you're looking at it it's pretty

00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:34.880
clear what it is

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.959
if you're listening to this just think

00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:38.000
of a

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.040
lowercase t a plus sign that gives you

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.079
four quadrants

00:13:42.079 --> 00:13:43.920
and then like a you know an up and down

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.120
a left and right

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.199
so the bottom quadrant bottom right is

00:13:47.199 --> 00:13:48.720
who's important to you that's you know

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.639
that's the first thing you think of

00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:52.959
uh the bottom left quadrant is what are

00:13:52.959 --> 00:13:53.920
some of the the

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.600
you know the stuff that shows up inside

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.360
of you the yucky stuff the

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.519
thoughts memories feelings that is like

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:00.639
uh you know it just

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:02.399
makes you feel bad like i was saying

00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:03.680
like you know the thoughts you get fused

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.839
with and launch into some kind of action

00:14:05.839 --> 00:14:07.279
so the thing above that is what do you

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:09.199
do for relief from the yucky stuff

00:14:09.199 --> 00:14:10.399
that's the

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:12.160
uh top left quadrant if you're listening

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.440
to this you're just like this sounds

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.959
like gibberish probably

00:14:14.959 --> 00:14:16.480
um so it's basically like you know who's

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.480
important to you and what can you do

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.000
above that what can you do for who's

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.519
important and what's some of the stuff

00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:23.440
that shows up inside of you

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.079
that seems to be working counteract you

00:14:26.079 --> 00:14:27.279
know that seems to be uh

00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:28.800
counterproductive towards

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.399
moving you towards what's important to

00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:32.160
you because why would you not be around

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.040
what's important to you

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.480
that would be weird if you weren't which

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.639
most of us aren't why i don't know

00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:39.440
um and again in the thing they have the

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.680
really the real cool takeaway

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.199
in this thing like on the left side you

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:45.120
have a way on the right side you have

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.800
towards so like you're when you're

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.240
solely trying to find relief from the

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.920
yucky stuff you tend to do actions that

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.120
bring you away from the things that are

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.000
valuable to you

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.480
not all the time but most times and then

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.279
towards is just

00:14:55.279 --> 00:14:56.800
moving towards what you value just

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.480
moving despite all the yucky stuff which

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.000
is such a funny way for this person to

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.040
put this

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.720
the stuff that pops up inside of you

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.480
what could you do that would just move

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.920
you more towards the things that are

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.519
important to you and also maybe two

00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:08.639
birds one stone

00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:10.399
take care of some of the yucky stuff and

00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:12.000
on the top it's your senses that's your

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.600
physical world that's the action that's

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.240
doing

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.240
the bottom part is mind what are the

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.600
things you're thinking of what are the

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.880
things that are popping up

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.320
in the middle is you just simply

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.560
noticing all right so let's break this

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.000
thing down a little more because that

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.199
might be a little confusing

00:15:25.199 --> 00:15:28.079
um so again the most important thing is

00:15:28.079 --> 00:15:31.279
this idea of towards an away

00:15:31.279 --> 00:15:34.320
right and if we think of a rabbit

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.240
if we think of a rabbit we can see here

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.320
in this little illustration

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.240
so rabbit is in the middle of being

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.560
towards things that it wants and being

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.920
away from predators

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.399
or things a rabbit doesn't want and

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:47.199
rabbits

00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:49.440
strictly live in physical universes so

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.279
that whole thing i said of like you know

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:53.120
you're part of a context and then you

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.160
have thoughts and then you have an

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.759
observing self then you know your whole

00:15:55.759 --> 00:15:57.600
physical body can react in a way to any

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.000
of those

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.759
those things the environment triggers in

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:01.600
you to think about something you

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.600
evaluate that thought and then you act

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.800
but typically that happens in the blink

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.720
of an eye and you know that's that's the

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.600
spaz that's what i'm working away from

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.120
um but think of a rabbit rabbit has none

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.720
of that a rabbit just is a physical

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.240
creature in a physical world and as far

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.680
as we know a rabbit doesn't really think

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.480
at all

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.639
it doesn't have a mind and it has no

00:16:18.639 --> 00:16:20.480
inner experiences no inner events it's

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.440
just

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.920
moving towards carrots and having sex

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.440
with other rabbits

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.360
and it's moving away from predators

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.560
things that scare it

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.040
that's it that's all that's a rabbit's

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.639
act matrix it's like yep

00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:35.120
i want a bone i want to eat and i don't

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.000
want someone to shoot me

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.519
and i don't want an animal to eat me

00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:38.880
that's it that's been you know that's

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.160
been the reality for

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.000
pretty much all organisms on earth for

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.680
since the beginning of time it's like

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.600
you're born you either eat stuff or

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.120
stuff eats you and

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.800
you know then you something eats you and

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.320
shits you out or you eat a bunch of

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.079
stuff [ __ ] a bunch of [ __ ] out

00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:54.000
and either get eaten still or just you

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.600
know die which pretty grim

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.279
so you know that's what we've evolved

00:16:57.279 --> 00:16:58.639
out of and you know

00:16:58.639 --> 00:17:00.720
to add an inner life to all that stuff

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.720
and a bunch of weird experiences and

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.120
here we are so kind of a grim thing

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:05.919
sorry but

00:17:05.919 --> 00:17:08.079
it's kind of true so all right so let's

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:09.360
look at the human edition of this and

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.959
again just to clarify this is what it's

00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:12.480
like in a for a physical creature it's

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.760
pretty simple right you just

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.480
eat reproduce don't get eaten by stuff

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.520
don't get just

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.959
shot by some hunter who's like check

00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:21.679
this out all right

00:17:21.679 --> 00:17:23.439
look at the human edition and for this i

00:17:23.439 --> 00:17:24.959
actually use nick cannon

00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:27.199
as an example i don't know why i

00:17:27.199 --> 00:17:28.960
honestly don't i just feel like

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.280
it just popped into my head so you know

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.880
so like rabbits we technically or at

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.679
least can

00:17:33.679 --> 00:17:37.039
or you know maybe do face you know

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:39.280
animal problems like we we do have that

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.720
part of us that we need to have

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.320
you know that has to be dealt with

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.320
immediately but in the developed world

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.080
it's that's kind of taken for granted as

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:46.640
like you know

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.559
i mean yeah i'm gonna eat like i'm not

00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:50.240
really worried about not eating if

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.919
you're like well i am it's like

00:17:51.919 --> 00:17:53.520
hey that sucks but you know the majority

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.280
of people just aren't in the developed

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.480
world you know

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.240
um so it's like so which launches us

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.160
into a whole other

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.600
kind of quest where it's not so much

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.280
about securing food if you're you know

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.039
again if you're in like a g7 country or

00:18:05.039 --> 00:18:06.000
any other

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.440
developed country you're not really

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.799
worried about securing food you're

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:10.320
worrying about like

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.600
securing relationships you're the things

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.000
you want

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.840
and i think the easiest way to explain

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.240
that is like you know um

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.240
aligning objective reality with the

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.919
story of yourself and you know who

00:18:21.919 --> 00:18:22.640
you're

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.400
thinking you'd like to turn out and what

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.919
you'd like to have and then typically

00:18:25.919 --> 00:18:27.120
your life is trying to

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.559
make that happen despite the fact you

00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:31.120
could be again eating three meals a day

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.120
living comfortably not worrying about

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.039
housing and still completely jammed up

00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:35.840
that like you know

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.919
you don't have the corner office or

00:18:37.919 --> 00:18:39.440
whatever kind of stuff people

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.880
get whacked out about so all right let's

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.640
let's look at nick cannon right same as

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.120
a way and towards thing as a rabbit

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.320
i have if you're if you're listening to

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.320
this it's just a straight line right

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.240
with two arrows an arrow leading towards

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.440
and how we're leading the way

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.000
nick cannon smack dab in the middle so

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.640
you know what's

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.640
nick cannon moving towards right i mean

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.559
he obviously food i have food up here

00:18:58.559 --> 00:19:00.799
but not even just any food if you if you

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:02.000
know anything about nick cannon he

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.600
suffers from lupus which is the thing he

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.039
wants to move away from

00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:06.960
so he eats good clean food he did an

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.720
interview recently as i read some of it

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.039
to

00:19:09.039 --> 00:19:10.640
you know know what i was talking about

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.960
so nick cannon eats good clean food

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.039
he works out hard and he drinks two

00:19:15.039 --> 00:19:16.160
gallons not one

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.240
two gallons of water a day so that he

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.919
doesn't what he's moving away from death

00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:21.679
but also being human being he also knows

00:19:21.679 --> 00:19:23.760
he will die eventually at some point so

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.200
but he doesn't want to die today so he's

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.559
moving away from that knowing he'll die

00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:27.679
eventually

00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:30.400
also you know has lupus but he says he

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:30.880
finds

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.559
relief from his symptoms by working out

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:34.080
hard eating clean

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.760
drinking two gallons of water a day

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.320
what's it all for mariah he loves mariah

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.440
i don't know if they're still together

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.280
or what but that is his babe dude

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.679
mature mariah he he waited till she was

00:19:43.679 --> 00:19:45.600
40 and said i love that woman he still

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.320
does

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.559
so it's like that's nick cannon again

00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:49.840
this is a lot more complicated than a

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.360
rabbit right already this is only a

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.000
couple things

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.760
oh there's also eminem he had beef with

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.360
eminem and so you know subs

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.160
you know whatever also he has beef with

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.760
uh 50 cent

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.559
so he's moving away from that um or he

00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:04.240
could be like you know what

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.679
i could get a lot of fame this is

00:20:05.679 --> 00:20:07.360
another thing he's moving towards

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.960
by attacking these guys so sometimes

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.640
like i said he's moving towards fame but

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.320
he has to move towards things that you

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.440
know could be scary

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.120
i wouldn't really want to battle eminem

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.880
in terms of rap um

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.480
you know here's a guy who's in the kkk

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.080
i'm sure he's avoiding that guy

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.600
you know then he's thinking about god

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.760
and then there's jesus and like wait is

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.240
jesus black i have black jesus here what

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.679
the [ __ ] up with that picture of outer

00:20:27.679 --> 00:20:29.679
space there's the greek god prieta piss

00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:30.799
which is uh

00:20:30.799 --> 00:20:31.919
it's actually where the the term

00:20:31.919 --> 00:20:33.440
priorism comes from when like someone

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.120
gets an erection that won't go down

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.240
he has to get like drained that's a

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.400
priya prism and also

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.400
priapis it's pretty funny he was a greek

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.520
fertility god

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.919
so the scarecrows in ancient greece were

00:20:43.919 --> 00:20:45.600
they would be priapus

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.360
but they also had like a gigantic boner

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.640
which is pretty funny because the birds

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.200
most

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.039
you know most likely would just perch on

00:20:51.039 --> 00:20:52.640
this guy's wooden boner or the fertility

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.520
god

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.520
um you know there's the devil there's

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.280
ancient aliens there's so much [ __ ]

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.400
other than just like

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.799
securing food and you know staying away

00:21:00.799 --> 00:21:02.799
from let's just call this guy

00:21:02.799 --> 00:21:04.720
the kkk robe maybe his natural predator

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.919
i don't know

00:21:05.919 --> 00:21:07.600
so it's like with human beings it's way

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.200
more complex than a rabbit because all

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:09.679
of our

00:21:09.679 --> 00:21:11.840
our you know our symbolic self let's say

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.600
the part of ourselves that's

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.320
worried deeply worried about stuff other

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:16.640
than

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.840
uh you know shelter food and water

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.600
you know that's our symbolic self

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.960
anything that's not any

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.480
any part of us that freaks out about

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.159
non-biological threats

00:21:26.159 --> 00:21:27.440
think of it that way that's your

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.960
symbolic self because why are you

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.159
worried about it well because

00:21:30.159 --> 00:21:32.159
if if i you know if i lose my job i'll

00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:33.440
starve to death in america

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.720
no you won't you won't starve to death

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.559
you can go you know it won't be awesome

00:21:36.559 --> 00:21:38.320
for sure and i'm not saying you know i

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.880
get that but it's like you know it's not

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.120
i wouldn't say it's truly a biological

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.400
threat you know

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.320
um i mean you can even extrapolate and

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.000
think well technically it would be

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.799
because

00:21:48.799 --> 00:21:50.400
yeah i'd be eating in a soup kitchen but

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.840
the food is probably not the best and

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.960
i'm sure they're cutting corners and

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.600
it's like

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.200
yeah you're already still i'm talking

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.880
about you versus a rabbit and it's like

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.799
rabbits are like soup kitchen [ __ ]

00:21:58.799 --> 00:22:00.159
[ __ ] on the ground i don't give a [ __ ]

00:22:00.159 --> 00:22:01.440
i'll go see it i'm just hungry i'll eat

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.799
it you know so it's like

00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:04.240
that ability to be like well i don't

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.000
want to eat at a soup kitchen because

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.280
you know opens up all this whole

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.360
pandora's box of just all of these other

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.039
things we strive for and try to stay

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:12.960
away from so remember

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.880
super complicated didn't need to get all

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.880
in depth about nick cannon or whatever i

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.440
think his life is um but just remember

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.880
that towards an away [ __ ] is like my

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.400
favorite part about this and again as

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.760
being a human being no

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.000
knowing how like infinitely complicated

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.440
because we're not only moving

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.880
moving towards and away from physical

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.039
things we're moving towards and away

00:22:31.039 --> 00:22:31.360
from

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.919
things that are immaterial that we can't

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:34.799
really touch or

00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:36.640
feel really but we kind of know about

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.400
and we move towards them and maybe

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.240
us moving towards that thing is actually

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.600
out of line of our personal values so

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.799
what we'll get into we'll actually build

00:22:42.799 --> 00:22:44.720
one of these matrix except matrices so

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.919
we can see

00:22:45.919 --> 00:22:48.480
um all right so building your matrix

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.080
right this is making room for inner and

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.039
outer stuff

00:22:51.039 --> 00:22:54.400
so as i said before first question who

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.159
this is in the bottom if you're sitting

00:22:56.159 --> 00:22:57.360
down if you're listening to this and you

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.200
want to draw it just you know again draw

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.960
a lowercase t

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.880
uh an a on the left side of the

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.400
horizontal line a t

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.919
on the other side of the horizontal line

00:23:05.919 --> 00:23:08.400
on the right side bottom right quadrant

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.320
first question who and what are

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.440
important to you right

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.280
so let's see this can include anything

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.960
people places things

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.640
even things that aren't physical like

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.039
qualities or concepts it's all fair game

00:23:19.039 --> 00:23:21.440
anything that's important to you go

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.440
ahead and write it in this box and i

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.679
also i got this um the stuff that i'm

00:23:25.679 --> 00:23:26.960
about to talk about now

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.480
this came from an article the initial

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.240
session setting up the act matrix for

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.440
the first time

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.440
i was written by jacob martinez so if

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.039
jacob martinez ever sees this

00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:37.919
yes this is your stuff you are the man

00:23:37.919 --> 00:23:38.400
um

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.000
okay so this can include anything again

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.840
like i said people places things

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.159
uh qualities concepts just write down

00:23:44.159 --> 00:23:45.600
what you personally value

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.120
do this in pencil because maybe next

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.880
week it changes or you forgot stuff

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.320
or just do another one you can update

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.840
this every week it doesn't matter but

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.159
it's

00:23:52.159 --> 00:23:54.320
really cool to sit down and do this

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.159
because if you don't know

00:23:56.159 --> 00:23:59.360
what you value what do you what do you

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.039
do like what are you doing other than

00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:01.360
just

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.120
are you just out here like watching

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.799
stuff and be like that was cool and just

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:06.400
reacting it's like

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.919
whatever that's fine but if you don't

00:24:07.919 --> 00:24:09.440
figure out what you actually

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.840
value in life what are you moving

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.240
towards

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.320
something to think about all right

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.679
second question

00:24:17.679 --> 00:24:19.200
what are some of the things on the

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.520
inside like thoughts feelings memories

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.240
etc

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.559
that can show up to get in the way of

00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:26.960
these people and things and values

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.080
that are important to you right um and

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.440
we'll do like a little example one he

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.679
gave us a generic sample matrix

00:24:33.679 --> 00:24:35.279
third question and this is in if you're

00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:36.799
listening so again first question is in

00:24:36.799 --> 00:24:38.559
the bottom right quadrant

00:24:38.559 --> 00:24:40.000
second questions in the bottom left

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.200
quadrant third questions in the top

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.880
left quadrant so this third question

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.880
what do you tend to do

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.200
on the outside in terms of actions when

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.720
you're wrapped up in the stuff on the

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.240
inside mentioned below

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.080
right like a brief example you know

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.400
you're at your job you hate your job

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.919
what's important to you is having

00:24:57.919 --> 00:25:01.039
financial independence and job security

00:25:01.039 --> 00:25:02.880
and you know being able to be around

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.159
from your kids you hate your job because

00:25:04.159 --> 00:25:05.520
you're like this job keeps me away from

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.320
my kids

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.039
i hate my boss so second question right

00:25:09.039 --> 00:25:10.559
so the thing that's important to you is

00:25:10.559 --> 00:25:12.320
being there for your kids and being fine

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.159
being your own person

00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:15.600
second question right so what are the

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.279
things that on the inside like thoughts

00:25:17.279 --> 00:25:18.799
feelings memories can get in the way of

00:25:18.799 --> 00:25:20.400
you being your own person

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.640
or being around your family more uh you

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.400
know so say you're at your job

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.919
you can't handle your job you love your

00:25:25.919 --> 00:25:27.600
kids you love your family

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.440
but your job's so stressful that you

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.799
need to stop at the bar and have a

00:25:30.799 --> 00:25:31.919
couple before you go home

00:25:31.919 --> 00:25:33.200
and none of this is saying like that's

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.640
inherently bad or none of this is

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.000
moralizing at all you

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.039
are like trying to say like you

00:25:37.039 --> 00:25:39.440
shouldn't drink it's like

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.960
you can do whatever you want this is all

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.720
up to you so it's like if you

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.760
you know where like you value your

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.840
family you value your independence and

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:46.720
you'd one day

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.240
like to work for yourself so that you

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.400
can be around more or less maybe you

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.520
think that because you usually end up

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.200
working even more hours but at least you

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.960
can take a day off if you want

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.320
um it's like you know so if you're at

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.080
your job and these things are popping up

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:00.640
like god

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.480
i can't take this this sucks i'm never

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.080
going to get out of here what would i

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.120
even do

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.080
these are all these things that are

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.760
popping up in you so the third question

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.600
is what do you do this that's you being

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.000
wrapped

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.919
up in the stuff mentioned below third

00:26:11.919 --> 00:26:14.080
question what kind of actions you take

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.320
that strictly deal with the stuff that's

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.080
popping up inside of you

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.080
that can sometimes help you move towards

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.080
your values but in this case

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.520
they typically don't right so the

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.440
example is you know when i'm wrapped up

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.039
in all of my stuff about work and i'm

00:26:27.039 --> 00:26:28.320
all worked up

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.679
just so i don't go home and like you

00:26:29.679 --> 00:26:32.000
know i'm angry or snippy with my family

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.320
i stop at the bar i have two three or

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.440
four drinks

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.960
and then i go home right but then when i

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.320
go home my wife smells alcohol and she's

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:38.559
like

00:26:38.559 --> 00:26:40.000
i needed you here why did you stop a

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.520
drink and you're like i have to drink

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.880
because i have all this stuff in me

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.640
it doesn't feel good and i want to go

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.559
take care of that before i come do the

00:26:46.559 --> 00:26:47.760
thing that i say

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.360
i find personally valuable which is

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.279
spending time with you guys

00:26:51.279 --> 00:26:53.600
but i'm so jacked up about my job i

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.720
gotta catch a buzz

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.120
okay and your wife's like no dude you

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.320
can't catch a ball so i can't catch a

00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.120
buzz you can't get

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.279
i gotta catch a [ __ ] buzz so again

00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:02.159
that's just an example

00:27:02.159 --> 00:27:03.760
this this is you can do a million things

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.240
i'm just trying to simplify it so again

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.000
i value the family i value my family i

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.279
want to be independent i want to work

00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:10.480
for myself

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:13.120
but my reality is my context i'm in is

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.039
this job where i get micromanaged and

00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:16.799
told when i can come in they make me

00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:18.480
come in on saturdays i miss stuff

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.640
it bothers me it makes me sad it makes

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.360
me feel like a failure i'm a bad parent

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.960
oh my god i need a couple i need to go

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.960
hit a couple of long island sts before i

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.120
go home so that's the things you do

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.880
on the outs when the things you the

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.559
actions you take when you're wrapped up

00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:34.320
in the yucky stuff that's popping up in

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.240
you now the fourth question

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.480
top right quadrant what are some of the

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.679
things you can actually

00:27:39.679 --> 00:27:42.640
do that would move you towards who and

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.080
what matters to you right so you have

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.279
this person he's in an office he's

00:27:45.279 --> 00:27:47.360
sulking this sucks this sucks this sucks

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.120
i'm gonna catch a fat buzz before i go

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.880
home and it's like okay

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.399
that's a thing you're doing just for the

00:27:52.399 --> 00:27:54.000
yucky stuff that's not in line with your

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:54.799
values right

00:27:54.799 --> 00:27:56.159
because you know and maybe it is maybe

00:27:56.159 --> 00:27:57.360
everyone's like oh dad's home he's kind

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.039
of drunk he's fun when he's drunk

00:27:59.039 --> 00:28:00.399
i don't know maybe if that's something

00:28:00.399 --> 00:28:01.760
that doesn't bring up friction for you

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.200
knock yourself out there's nothing wrong

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.080
with that

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.520
but again if that's getting in the way

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.279
then that's out of line with your values

00:28:07.279 --> 00:28:08.000
because you know

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.520
you say you value this thing yet you

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:12.240
seem to value you know alcohol more

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.880
anyway um so what could you do that

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.480
would actually move you towards so take

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.159
this person for example

00:28:18.159 --> 00:28:19.760
and instead of going home to be like you

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.200
know i'm going to get drunk before i go

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.440
home i'm going to get a fat buzz

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.840
um what if i went home and on the way

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.679
home i just i drove straight home but i

00:28:27.679 --> 00:28:28.000
sat

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.640
and brainstormed uh different ways to

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.640
work for myself or to like a proposition

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.880
to work from home a couple days a week

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.720
what if i took all this hatred from my

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.799
job and channeled it into some sort of

00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:39.679
activity

00:28:39.679 --> 00:28:42.399
an action that would move me closer to

00:28:42.399 --> 00:28:44.799
my values so it's it's something that

00:28:44.799 --> 00:28:46.080
you know i would do that

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.600
might take the yucky stuff it might not

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.360
i don't know but it's an action that i

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.799
can personally do

00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:52.559
instead of the thing that i do to like

00:28:52.559 --> 00:28:54.320
kind of just like you know quell my

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.600
internal state

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.039
that would just just it's just like

00:28:57.039 --> 00:28:58.880
forget that what do i need to do to get

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.399
me closer to my values it might be

00:29:00.399 --> 00:29:01.600
quitting your job or just

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.440
starting a new a search for a new job

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.360
but then again what is some of the yucky

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:05.919
stuff like

00:29:05.919 --> 00:29:09.679
i'm 37 i'm 40 no one's going to hire me

00:29:09.679 --> 00:29:11.279
that's just you saying that i don't

00:29:11.279 --> 00:29:12.720
maybe it's true maybe it's not i don't

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.679
know but you'll never

00:29:13.679 --> 00:29:15.760
know unless you take some sort of action

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.720
you know this is like

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.320
stock inspirational stuff but it's so

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.240
true and it's like you know we spend a

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.679
lot of times telling ourselves we can't

00:29:21.679 --> 00:29:23.360
do a million things and it's like

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.039
you know when when that boils down to

00:29:25.039 --> 00:29:26.240
like i'll never be able to get a

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.559
different job than this one it's like

00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:30.960
okay i mean is that true i don't i don't

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:31.919
think that's true there's you know

00:29:31.919 --> 00:29:33.600
there's a bunch of things people can do

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.440
so you know that's one of those things

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.720
people go oh you don't understand

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.559
my situation's fixed and it's like okay

00:29:38.559 --> 00:29:39.840
and this is part of that you do the act

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.039
matrix it's like

00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:42.640
what's fixed about it what do you feel

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.039
it's missing and i mean if you want to

00:29:45.039 --> 00:29:46.480
just completely give up and say this is

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.840
just what it is

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.760
fine do that you know typically that

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.760
doesn't really work well for people

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.080
or it's like what tiny little thing

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.600
could you start working towards that

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.799
might give your life a little more

00:29:56.799 --> 00:29:57.919
meaning and you know

00:29:57.919 --> 00:29:59.919
a little more zest and make it feel like

00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:01.760
uh what do they say that the

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.440
bring about some vitality like you're

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.960
alive you're moving towards something

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.559
you're doing rather than just being like

00:30:06.559 --> 00:30:09.279
hey truck another day another dollar

00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:11.600
um all right so this is i'll give you a

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.840
generic sample matrix written by the guy

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.880
i mentioned before

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.760
um all right so here's a sample so on

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.039
this one they have the

00:30:19.039 --> 00:30:21.039
things people value quadrant family

00:30:21.039 --> 00:30:22.480
friends being happy

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.399
loving relationship that's the the

00:30:24.399 --> 00:30:26.080
person this is the person's fictional

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:26.799
values

00:30:26.799 --> 00:30:28.399
or the fictitious person's values which

00:30:28.399 --> 00:30:30.640
you know pretty general you know

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.399
family friends being happy loving

00:30:32.399 --> 00:30:34.799
relationship uh the things that the

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:36.799
yucky stuff that pops up in the

00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:39.200
bottom left quadrant are anxiety the

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.520
thought i'm letting everybody down

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.960
and stress right so what they do here in

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.960
this thing is they show arrows like

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.960
between the in this instance the thought

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.000
i'm letting everybody

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.480
down and they do an arrow up to an

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.919
action that is uh

00:30:53.919 --> 00:30:56.799
push people away and isolate so it's

00:30:56.799 --> 00:30:58.159
like you know i'm thinking like i met

00:30:58.159 --> 00:30:58.640
you know this

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.399
you keep this guy at this job i'm

00:31:00.399 --> 00:31:02.080
letting everybody down i can't make the

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.200
little league game

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.360
uh so what does he do he just stops

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.559
talking to his family

00:31:06.559 --> 00:31:08.159
for he spends like a week just staying

00:31:08.159 --> 00:31:09.360
away from them because seeing them

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.559
brings them so much pain because it

00:31:10.559 --> 00:31:11.679
reminds him of

00:31:11.679 --> 00:31:13.919
his perceived notion that he's somehow a

00:31:13.919 --> 00:31:15.440
failure

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.200
so he just isolates from them which you

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.480
know if you push people

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.679
you know your family and friends away

00:31:19.679 --> 00:31:21.519
and isolate but you say you value

00:31:21.519 --> 00:31:22.720
friends and family and being happy and

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.159
loving relationships well isolating

00:31:24.159 --> 00:31:25.039
doesn't

00:31:25.039 --> 00:31:26.559
really help with relationships if this

00:31:26.559 --> 00:31:28.559
guy wanted to become like a monk

00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:29.919
isolating would be a towards move it

00:31:29.919 --> 00:31:31.279
would be a cool thing to do but in this

00:31:31.279 --> 00:31:31.679
guy's

00:31:31.679 --> 00:31:34.559
you know world he says and if rightly so

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:36.240
he values loving relationships family

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.120
and friends so like

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.480
it's like this thought i'm letting

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.200
everyone down inspires this action to

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.559
push people away because you know

00:31:42.559 --> 00:31:44.960
as we said before this is experiential

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.559
avoidance this is

00:31:46.559 --> 00:31:49.919
trying to alleviate you know

00:31:49.919 --> 00:31:51.760
things felt thoughts and feelings or

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.039
whatever in life

00:31:53.039 --> 00:31:55.600
by taking actions that work in the short

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.320
short term

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.080
but eventually move us away from the

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.679
things that we that give our life

00:31:59.679 --> 00:32:01.600
meaning and color and all that stuff

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.519
so all right so we have that we have you

00:32:03.519 --> 00:32:04.880
know i'm pushing people away i'm letting

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.320
everybody down if you look at the next

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.440
picture

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.919
um oh sorry yeah okay yeah so let's push

00:32:09.919 --> 00:32:11.519
people away isolate and cry in the top

00:32:11.519 --> 00:32:12.960
left quadrant which cry

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.399
i don't think i don't know maybe again

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:16.000
it's your this person's matrix if you

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.200
think crying is something you shouldn't

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.000
do

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.760
uh don't do it i think you should cry if

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.120
you feel like you have to cry

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.360
but um so they have this other thing so

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.480
you know the other way to do it they

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.120
have the

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.640
in the top right quadrant is you know

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.159
they have the same thing the thought i'm

00:32:28.159 --> 00:32:29.440
letting everybody down

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.039
so instead of pushing people away and

00:32:31.039 --> 00:32:32.480
isolating he's

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.840
you know they say maybe you know

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.039
something an action that would be in

00:32:35.039 --> 00:32:36.559
line with your values would be to share

00:32:36.559 --> 00:32:38.080
your feelings honestly with

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.399
your family friends so that they can

00:32:40.399 --> 00:32:41.519
they might be like dude

00:32:41.519 --> 00:32:42.559
what are you talking about you know

00:32:42.559 --> 00:32:43.760
you're killing it you're not letting us

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.200
down you got to work we understand that

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.480
you know we're working with you here

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.880
you know so it's like again you it's

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.480
almost like you know i i hate to say it

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.679
because it's kind of like overused but

00:32:51.679 --> 00:32:53.200
it's like you know the red pill blue

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.799
pill situation where it's like

00:32:54.799 --> 00:32:56.320
i have a thought i'm letting everybody

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.399
down now if i don't have that space but

00:32:58.399 --> 00:32:58.720
you know

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.559
like if i'm just like i feel bad and i

00:33:00.559 --> 00:33:02.320
just kind of like animal rabbit react to

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.760
like oh like you know a rabbit sees a

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.039
fox it runs

00:33:05.039 --> 00:33:06.640
that's our same nervous system so like

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.640
you know we i'm letting everybody down

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.960
we take that quick you know uh knee-jerk

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.640
reaction move that's just kind of like

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.720
i'm just gonna i don't push people away

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.320
i can't be around people right now

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.919
because that that you know

00:33:17.919 --> 00:33:19.360
helps you know quote unquote in the

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.960
short term when in reality there's

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.320
another action we could take that would

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:22.799
be

00:33:22.799 --> 00:33:24.559
maybe even more uncomfortable than the

00:33:24.559 --> 00:33:26.320
thought but then after we do it it's

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:26.799
like

00:33:26.799 --> 00:33:28.799
you know we're moving toward this is a

00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:30.559
towards move we're moving towards the

00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:32.159
things we value by not you know we're

00:33:32.159 --> 00:33:33.039
feeling bad

00:33:33.039 --> 00:33:34.720
but it's like are you gonna let the fact

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.159
that you have a thought you don't like

00:33:36.159 --> 00:33:37.760
dictate your entire reality and all of

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.039
your actions or if you

00:33:39.039 --> 00:33:40.799
if you act strictly on thoughts you

00:33:40.799 --> 00:33:43.120
don't like then you're probably going to

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.200
do things that you know typically don't

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.399
do well and again that's you know you

00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:47.600
could well then what about this it's

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.880
like yeah but as a general rule if

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.320
you're avoiding uncomfortable things

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.760
that could potentially lead to

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.760
things you value over and over and over

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.279
again on a daily basis

00:33:55.279 --> 00:33:56.559
you are going to alienate yourself and

00:33:56.559 --> 00:33:58.399
i'll show how we can almost like split

00:33:58.399 --> 00:33:59.919
away from like this even the thought of

00:33:59.919 --> 00:34:00.720
like

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.519
values becomes a fantasy so again a big

00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:05.279
part of this work is finding of this act

00:34:05.279 --> 00:34:06.159
matrix

00:34:06.159 --> 00:34:08.399
is finding out or figuring out more of

00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:10.320
these toward moves right this is the

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.599
away and towards line we're talking

00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:12.079
about

00:34:12.079 --> 00:34:13.599
what are some of these towards moves we

00:34:13.599 --> 00:34:16.079
can we can make that will actually help

00:34:16.079 --> 00:34:18.399
move you towards what matters to you

00:34:18.399 --> 00:34:19.520
which is kind of weird when you think

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.359
about how much time we spend

00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:23.040
not doing that or at least even

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.520
attempting to move ourselves towards

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:28.000
being able to be around the things we

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:28.879
say we value

00:34:28.879 --> 00:34:30.720
right and it's like how much thought

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.079
have you even given this i know i never

00:34:32.079 --> 00:34:33.760
really gave i mean i kind of had a loose

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.159
idea you know like a you almost like in

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:37.760
the fast and furious stuff like family

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.520
is everything bro and it's like

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.800
your family's sick dude i'm not gonna

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.720
lie it's awesome but it's like it almost

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.159
becomes like you know is it is it a

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:45.679
generic thing of a sense of the things

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:47.359
you value or have you really thought

00:34:47.359 --> 00:34:48.960
about the things that pop up for you

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.399
that you feel like if you were doing

00:34:50.399 --> 00:34:51.119
every day

00:34:51.119 --> 00:34:52.800
or you were around that every day would

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.240
give your life

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.839
meaning to the point where you feel like

00:34:55.839 --> 00:34:57.200
you know life's this thing that's

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.200
blossoming around you rather than like

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.880
you know you just slowly dying in an

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.640
apartment um

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.560
all right so and this is the idea i was

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.920
talking about before of like

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.320
being so tunnel visioned into like the

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.760
left side of this thing of just like

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.359
negative inner experiences and taking

00:35:11.359 --> 00:35:12.640
those actions that like we become

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:13.839
fragmented

00:35:13.839 --> 00:35:16.480
so again if you're i highly recommend

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.000
just watching this because i think the

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.839
visual helps but if you're not what i

00:35:19.839 --> 00:35:21.280
did was i split that

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.760
whole ax matrix into two halves so it's

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.280
like you know we when we come

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.560
just to show like when we become

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.400
preoccupied with managing our thoughts

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.320
memories and painful emotions

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.400
we stop being able to attend the

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.960
immediate needs of our life situation

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.440
the very things we ourselves deem to be

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.560
important

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:41.440
so again it can be some if you're so if

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.400
you are so

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.760
whacked out about this thought i'm

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.079
letting everybody down right you can

00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:47.280
you you don't have the distance you're

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.119
not observing the thought you are fully

00:35:49.119 --> 00:35:51.040
fused with it you think it and then you

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.480
are in your reality

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.200
literally letting everyone down dude

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.640
these people that you do

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.640
actually value which is why the thought

00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.680
is so painful

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.760
i'm letting everyone down again you

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.040
haven't communicated that thought

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:03.520
because

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.200
they could easily make that disappear by

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.960
being dude no you're not here's why and

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.839
you're like oh should i never thought

00:36:07.839 --> 00:36:09.040
about that appreciate that

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.960
instead you lock into your little you

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.079
know brain

00:36:12.079 --> 00:36:13.920
shitty uh action cycle where it's just

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.200
like i'm letting everybody down

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.760
get away from me get away stay away from

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.520
me you don't know you know that [ __ ]

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.800
and it's like

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.240
yeah you can do that you're just gonna

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.680
feel worse and you actually are gonna

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.359
start letting everybody down if you push

00:36:25.359 --> 00:36:26.800
your whole family away because you can't

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:27.520
handle

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.960
your own internal thoughts and feelings

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.880
like it has to be done man

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.880
it has to be done it's hard i know it's

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.000
easier said than done

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.680
no [ __ ] i never said it wasn't it is

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.440
easier said than done still has to be

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:37.839
done

00:36:37.839 --> 00:36:39.359
you know what i mean it's like cutting

00:36:39.359 --> 00:36:40.880
the grass easier said than done

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.160
someone still has to [ __ ] do it you

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.599
can't just easier said than done it's

00:36:43.599 --> 00:36:45.040
like cut the [ __ ] grass dude

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:48.079
you have to do it um yeah and this is

00:36:48.079 --> 00:36:48.720
like

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.800
this is the reason why and i can attest

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.160
to this personally it almost feels like

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.000
we willfully live

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.079
unfulfilled lives and it's drawn i

00:36:56.079 --> 00:36:57.599
haven't drawn here where it's just

00:36:57.599 --> 00:37:00.000
you know if you're so this is kind of if

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.240
your values are so eclipsed by

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.680
your personal struggle and the

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.200
short-term actions you take we've talked

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.320
about this already 100 times

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.160
experiential avoidance

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.839
painful thought or feeling i don't have

00:37:09.839 --> 00:37:11.200
the mental flexibility to kind of

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.040
observe my thoughts sit with my feelings

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.320
and then you know again writing this

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.760
stuff down as i said before helps big

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.000
time of like taking track of this like

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.520
i do feel bad about stuff all the time

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.040
what exactly is it you start writing it

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.320
down like oh it's this

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.079
here's like one or two things that

00:37:24.079 --> 00:37:25.599
constantly come up for me

00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:27.280
let me address them head on rather than

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.880
keep like avoiding things or trying to

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.160
like you know i'm gonna move or i'm

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:30.960
gonna do this

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.000
you know so this is what we're talking

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
about right

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.599
so you know again this stuff and this is

00:37:35.599 --> 00:37:37.280
what happens if we're so like

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.320
you know bogged down by this little loop

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.280
of like taking

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.200
actions to avoid our feelings and pain

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.720
so what happens is you know

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.560
the stuff that should define our lives

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.040
becomes almost the fantasy content of

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.560
those must be nice talks with our

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.440
co-workers

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.800
who just stopped talking to us or

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.839
stopped inviting us to lunch because

00:37:53.839 --> 00:37:55.680
it's like dude you're a [ __ ] bummer

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.359
you know it's like that's [ __ ] up it's

00:37:57.359 --> 00:37:59.200
like yeah that's just that's just what

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.560
it is man if you're

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.680
every time you meet someone you're just

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.599
like [ __ ] dude [ __ ]

00:38:03.599 --> 00:38:05.839
oh it's like people eventually are like

00:38:05.839 --> 00:38:07.920
yo bro like you're bumming me out which

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.280
it is true you know and if someone's

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.240
doing that to you he's like yo bro

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.440
you're bumming me out

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.880
so it's like how can we figure out and

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.280
you could

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.480
[ __ ] you i'm sharing my feelings

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.720
honestly and it's like yeah

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.480
okay sure enough but it's like there

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.560
also should be some room for

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.240
uh like some sort of reciprocal action

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.680
there if that's the case you know

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:26.800
like if you're just like sharing your

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.240
feelings honestly to someone but never

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.359
hearing how they feel

00:38:29.359 --> 00:38:30.880
maybe you're just kind of unloading on

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.040
somebody so you know there's definitely

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.400
you know room to learn and grow and if

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.079
that's what you are doing fine man it's

00:38:36.079 --> 00:38:37.280
like you know again i always say it

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.880
nobody tells us how to do this [ __ ] and

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:41.200
all we can go off is the [ __ ] we see

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.720
and the worst part is we don't know that

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.200
it's [ __ ] up because we only emerge in

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.079
a certain context

00:38:46.079 --> 00:38:48.160
and that's our reality so it's like it

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.560
takes a lot of mental reserves and you

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:51.280
know

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.040
it takes a lot to be able to be in your

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.480
context and somehow

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.320
by yourself through whatever if you're

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.680
exposed to other things or you just

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.680
realize like this is kind of [ __ ] up

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.200
most people can't do that so it's like

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.880
you know it makes and that makes sense

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:03.920
like why would you

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:05.440
that's just what everybody around you

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.440
does um

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.079
so again it's like you know this idea of

00:39:10.079 --> 00:39:11.839
living about to me for a long time that

00:39:11.839 --> 00:39:12.160
seemed

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.280
almost like a fantasy it's like what do

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.720
you mean a value like you can't live

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.320
like a value and it's like dude

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.160
you yes you can because you can just

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.320
decide what you value and just

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.320
even if your life is an unsuccessful

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.880
attempt to move towards the things you

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.160
value

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.000
i still think that's better than just

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.040
being like i'm letting everybody down

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.160
you know and then your wife's like all

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.280
right dude like what the [ __ ] you've

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.320
been bullshitting around or your husband

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.839
or whatever it's just kind of like

00:39:35.839 --> 00:39:37.440
dude like what are you doing i can't

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.119
talk about it get away it's like

00:39:39.119 --> 00:39:40.800
you know that you can only do that [ __ ]

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.720
for so long all right so let's take it

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.640
home here what's

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:46.240
all right so here's here's the final

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.839
part and i i really like this and again

00:39:47.839 --> 00:39:48.320
for the

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.680
for the person who wrote this i thought

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.400
this was pretty cool um

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.760
and there's this little circle in the

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:54.880
middle this is the one we saw in the

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.560
very this is like the you know the self

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.320
circle right so this is a couple more

00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.599
questions to think about you know we'll

00:39:59.599 --> 00:40:01.040
finish this thing off

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.400
um so something to think about is like

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.200
you know if you're like this is

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.160
impossible

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.599
it's like all right for you as an

00:40:05.599 --> 00:40:07.599
individual who gets to decide

00:40:07.599 --> 00:40:10.160
who and what are important to you right

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.040
the answer is

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.560
me and who's the person who experiences

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.640
all the stuff down here even when nobody

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:17.839
else can i'm talking about the bottom

00:40:17.839 --> 00:40:18.560
quadrant

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.160
who's the person who experiences all the

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.839
stuff down here even when nobody else

00:40:21.839 --> 00:40:22.400
can tell

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.839
anything is going on me or you

00:40:25.839 --> 00:40:29.040
whatever right and who's the person who

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.760
gets to decide how you use your hands

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.359
and feet voice time and energy me it's

00:40:35.359 --> 00:40:36.000
it's you

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000
you get to decide ultimately if you have

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.760
told yourself you don't

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.920
well you do you're just deciding to tell

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.280
yourself that you don't

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.280
and it's like you know i'm trying to

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.319
think of it i always like to think of

00:40:46.319 --> 00:40:47.680
exams be like [ __ ]

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.440
i have four kids i have to work i do

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.839
this it's like okay that's fine that

00:40:51.839 --> 00:40:53.200
then that can be you can have people who

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.160
have cancer

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.240
it's like yep how are you relating to

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.079
that reality are you relating to those

00:40:58.079 --> 00:40:59.839
you can always change the way you relate

00:40:59.839 --> 00:41:00.960
to your thoughts

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.240
so i hate this job you can still change

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.599
your thoughts about you know it's like

00:41:05.599 --> 00:41:07.760
i'm stuck here for life i'm doing this

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.200
yeah but are you going to let that get

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.160
in the way of the things that you

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.000
personally you know value

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.760
it's uh that that is a personal choice

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.200
and again it's i don't want to say that

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.640
to be like a [ __ ] but it's like

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.560
you know if you lack the resources or

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.160
knowledge or like you know learning

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.200
these kind of psychological

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.720
flexibility skills and yeah it's not a

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.400
possibility it is an impossibility but

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.440
this the point of this

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.599
is to give as many people as possible

00:41:27.599 --> 00:41:28.960
the psychological tools

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.200
and resources so that they can be in

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.040
situations they feel like are all

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.880
encompassing and like you know almost in

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.160
like a

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.000
[ __ ] like boethius in that one book

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.599
where it's like fortuna's wheel

00:41:39.599 --> 00:41:40.720
i've talked about this before where it's

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.240
just like things are just happening to

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.520
me and i'm just a

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.480
helpless person being blown about by

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.400
larger forces and it's like

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.680
yeah you can have a discussion about

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.440
that and there's you know yeah yeah

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.160
there's some

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.560
validity to that but it's like you can

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.920
and you get to

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.400
and only you can change the way you

00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.280
think you know so

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.480
they say it the best in this thing it's

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.800
like yes that's like there's a you

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.960
right at the center of your life you're

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.319
the one who gets to decide

00:42:06.319 --> 00:42:08.000
who and what are important to you you

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.839
could have written anything down in that

00:42:09.839 --> 00:42:10.640
you know

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.240
bottom right box in terms of what you

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.800
value but you didn't you chose to put

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.319
those specific things that you either

00:42:16.319 --> 00:42:17.839
thought about or wrote down right

00:42:17.839 --> 00:42:19.440
you could have written anything but you

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.040
didn't you put those things and only you

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.960
can actually experience the stuff that

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.480
goes on inside of you in the other box

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.200
so it's like

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.880
only you can experience that nobody else

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.560
can be inside your head so that means

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.640
only you have the power to respond to

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:31.599
that inner stuff

00:42:31.599 --> 00:42:34.000
and only you can choose how you use your

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.440
hands feet voice time and energy

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.839
just like i said right so we get we get

00:42:37.839 --> 00:42:39.440
a lot more control of our lives than we

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.200
think we do especially when we

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.640
get caught up in one of the these stuck

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.920
loops and again this is still taken from

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.200
the article i mentioned

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.480
um especially we get caught up in these

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.920
stuck loops you know of like you know

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.280
i'm letting everybody down push people

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.160
away

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.599
it can feel like our lives are shrinking

00:42:51.599 --> 00:42:53.359
down around us why it's because

00:42:53.359 --> 00:42:55.200
we're so tunnel visioned out that like

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.440
we are eons away from the things we

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.319
value and a lot of

00:42:58.319 --> 00:42:59.920
times people do this thing like once i

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.599
get this thing under control i'll move

00:43:01.599 --> 00:43:03.119
towards those things i value and it's

00:43:03.119 --> 00:43:04.160
like

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:04.960
yeah you're not going to get your

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.160
thoughts feelings and memories under

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.359
control sorry they don't go anywhere

00:43:07.359 --> 00:43:08.880
they're just inside of you

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.680
um again you know whatever so large part

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:12.880
of this work will be

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.800
you know you know we'll all be doing is

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.560
learning ways to tap back into that

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.560
level of control we actually have over

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.160
our lives so that you can do what

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.040
matters to you

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.880
that you can do what matters to you you

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.400
can figure out what matters to you and

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.040
you can

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:28.079
at least try to move towards that you

00:43:28.079 --> 00:43:30.480
anybody can do that i'm sorry any

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.319
negative nellie's like

00:43:32.319 --> 00:43:34.160
anybody you get that you get to decide

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.520
whether you move towards the things your

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.240
value

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.440
whether you move toward the things you

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.520
value or you don't sorry you just do

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.880
and you might not be able to move

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.400
towards them as fast or as much as you

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.200
want

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.200
but that's part of the process of like

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.280
you know figuring that out and trying to

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.240
do more and more and more

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.599
again the i don't know what the other

00:43:49.599 --> 00:43:51.359
option is it's just to be miserable if

00:43:51.359 --> 00:43:52.640
you want to be miserable

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.160
hey you know again that's kind of

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.920
callous whatever but i

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.359
i've i've met a lot of people who are

00:43:57.359 --> 00:44:00.480
just like yeah dude

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:01.920
yeah i get it dude but yeah that's just

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.680
not how it works and it's like

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.520
how explain it it just doesn't it's like

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.200
okay that's not really an explanation

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.240
but sure

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:10.079
um all right so that that's where we

00:44:10.079 --> 00:44:11.440
finish it with the circle you know when

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.800
you have this quadrant make sure to put

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.520
the circle

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:15.520
with you inside of it so that like you

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.520
know this kind of helps you

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.040
tie this all together because there is a

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.880
u at this and and it's like you know

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.160
we're not all going to be on the right

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.119
side of this or like

00:44:23.119 --> 00:44:24.960
you know here's my values i'm only doing

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.960
moves that push me towards my values

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.240
we have a little we have like you know

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.800
we have a little little tethers into all

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:31.599
of this stuff you know

00:44:31.599 --> 00:44:33.520
we we have a little you know line into

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.800
our values we're always going to have

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.000
things and thoughts and feelings

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000
popping up on us that kind of suck um

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.599
we're always going to make moves that

00:44:39.599 --> 00:44:41.359
you know could be quoted as a way moves

00:44:41.359 --> 00:44:42.640
not perfect obviously that's going to

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.640
happen but again it's like can we

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.480
somehow increase the ratio of towards

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.000
moves than our way moves

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.119
right so again towards moves are just

00:44:51.119 --> 00:44:54.079
things you do that move you towards the

00:44:54.079 --> 00:44:55.520
things you value

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.839
and away moves are things you do that

00:44:57.839 --> 00:44:59.760
move you away from the things you value

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.880
pretty simple right um

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.040
all right so and again unless we grant

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.560
this is the u circle this is why i like

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.240
it unless we grant ourselves authority

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.319
over ourselves to tell ourselves what to

00:45:10.319 --> 00:45:10.720
do

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.079
and how to live in a way that we

00:45:12.079 --> 00:45:14.160
personally find meaningful then we are

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.880
doomed to just always inhabiting this

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.400
reality of being like things aren't

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.000
right or things are unfair

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.760
blah blah blah and you know and again

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.280
this is for like people who have a weak

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.160
sense of self because

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:25.839
i i could at certain points what do you

00:45:25.839 --> 00:45:27.200
value my life

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.800
i don't [ __ ] know so i was like you

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.240
know that's kind of that's

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.000
the stuff of a weak sense of self man

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.440
it's like you know like

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.440
how do you feel about this i don't know

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.720
how do you feel i don't know it's like

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:37.839
almost to the point where

00:45:37.839 --> 00:45:39.440
it's almost become so scary people

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.960
become so like kind of nervous to even

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:41.520
like

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.119
offer a glimpse in themselves because

00:45:43.119 --> 00:45:44.640
you know you can just get swatted down

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:45.839
like well here's something i thought

00:45:45.839 --> 00:45:47.839
people like [ __ ] idiot you it'll

00:45:47.839 --> 00:45:50.480
so you know people can kind of just move

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.079
around as like you know almost like a

00:45:52.079 --> 00:45:53.520
jellyfish on some level where they're

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.680
just kind of like you know i'm here

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:56.960
i'm not going to offer any parts of

00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.240
myself because i don't want to suffer

00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.680
the consequences then you can kind of

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:00.880
lose touch it's like well

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.079
you know what do you value and you've

00:46:02.079 --> 00:46:04.720
spent so long you know at let's say like

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.079
you know a job or in a certain

00:46:06.079 --> 00:46:07.520
relationship or you just kind of let the

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:08.160
other person

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.160
steer your little life ship for so long

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:12.079
you cannot actually like lose

00:46:12.079 --> 00:46:13.920
track of what's actually important to

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.839
you and that's a you know

00:46:15.839 --> 00:46:17.520
that's a weird place to be and again i

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.839
say that personally have inhabited

00:46:19.839 --> 00:46:21.680
personally having inhabited that realm

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.040
of just being like i don't know what the

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:23.680
[ __ ] about

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.720
i just really don't um you know so this

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.160
this kind of thing is just good for

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.680
people who have a weak sense of self

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:30.960
you know and if you're like do i have a

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.000
weak sense of self probably don't

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.920
something becomes kind of apparent

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:36.400
um i mean really if you can't fill this

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.680
thing out in terms of like you know what

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:38.880
do you value then yeah

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.240
that's like well what are you what are

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.920
you doing you know it's like that

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.599
i would say you know that that would be

00:46:43.599 --> 00:46:44.960
a sign of having kind of like a weak

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:46.480
sense of self

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.000
um so this is a good place to start just

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.760
simply figuring out what's important to

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.760
you and then trying to be around that or

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:52.880
bringing whatever that

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:55.520
is that you value into your world pretty

00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:56.400
simple start to

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.240
pretty simple place to start figure out

00:46:58.240 --> 00:46:59.520
like you know

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:01.119
who are you as a person and you know

00:47:01.119 --> 00:47:02.400
what do you actually want to do with

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.160
yourself rather than just like

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.920
driving along a highway and being like

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:07.200
who am i and what do i want to do with

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.400
myself

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.839
all right so here's the task right this

00:47:09.839 --> 00:47:11.200
is the homework and again this is pretty

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.200
much like a mega first group but

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.640
i'll do this obviously in more detail

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:15.839
people and people be able to bounce

00:47:15.839 --> 00:47:17.280
stuff off each other

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.680
um for the next few days uh you know or

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.200
weeks or whatever

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:23.119
try to keep this system up towards and

00:47:23.119 --> 00:47:24.720
away in your mind it's as simple as this

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.480
you can write down the act matrix i i

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:27.599
highly recommend it

00:47:27.599 --> 00:47:29.200
or just simply keep them in your head

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.640
and again writing this stuff down and

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.240
it's not going to transform your reality

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:33.760
or nothing that's going to happen

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:35.520
but just simply keep this stuff in your

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.800
head and just see if you can notice

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.480
yourself making towards moves

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:39.760
and away moves through throughout your

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:42.160
days right so really if

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.359
like if you're just like you know i

00:47:43.359 --> 00:47:45.280
don't feel like doing any of this just

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.200
think about the stuff that you value

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.559
just try to think about it try to think

00:47:48.559 --> 00:47:49.440
of four things

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.119
three things five or one it doesn't

00:47:51.119 --> 00:47:53.359
matter and just think

00:47:53.359 --> 00:47:54.720
notice yourself if you have to do a

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.240
little uh mindfulness app on your phone

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.040
it'll ding

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.280
you know every like you know hour or so

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:00.640
or just pay attention when you're about

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.240
to do stuff just be like i do it a lot

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:03.680
with like food right now

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.520
like i was eating like a pig during

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.440
covid and i was like all right let me uh

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:08.960
let me slow this down so i started you

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.400
know to try to like eat a little better

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.760
keep track of stuff

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.119
and it's like dude every time i'm about

00:48:13.119 --> 00:48:14.559
to eat i just i'm like is this a tour

00:48:14.559 --> 00:48:15.440
doorway meal

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:17.040
i'm like it's a way and again and this

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.720
is like uh

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:19.760
oh it's like you know it's like

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.440
everything we do can pretty much be

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:22.880
boiled down into the system

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:24.400
and it's like you know it's a pretty

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.640
simple start to like try to get some

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:28.160
sort of you know to try to push your

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.760
ship in some sort of direction if you

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.280
feel like you're just kind of hopelessly

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.160
orbiting

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.520
you know the same old [ __ ] all the time

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.680
it's like well and this is an example

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.880
too it's like you know and there's no

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.079
like good or bad i'm not saying like

00:48:38.079 --> 00:48:39.599
well if you don't eat right then

00:48:39.599 --> 00:48:40.960
that's a way to move for everybody it's

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.640
like no it's like you know even even the

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:43.839
thought what am i going to eat for lunch

00:48:43.839 --> 00:48:45.520
can be boiled down into a tortilla away

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:46.160
it's like in this

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.079
example you know like you're an adult

00:48:48.079 --> 00:48:50.079
you can eat whatever you want for lunch

00:48:50.079 --> 00:48:50.480
you know

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.240
any day you can go to lunch and just eat

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.480
anything right you get to decide that

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:56.400
you know you could eat 16 donuts for

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.520
lunch if you wanted to

00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.440
but let's say you were an actor and

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:00.800
you're trying to gain a lot of weight

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:01.359
for

00:49:01.359 --> 00:49:03.359
for a roll 16 donuts in that case might

00:49:03.359 --> 00:49:04.800
be a toward move

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.079
and if you're an actor trying to lose

00:49:06.079 --> 00:49:08.000
weight then 16 donuts would be an away

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:08.640
move right

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.000
so none of this is good or bad

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.760
inherently it's just up to you

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:14.480
what are you trying to do and how do you

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.000
evaluate the actions you take

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.599
in terms of bringing you towards your

00:49:17.599 --> 00:49:19.440
values right it's not that donuts will

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:21.119
get to decide if it's a twitter way move

00:49:21.119 --> 00:49:22.880
it is you

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.480
so in some of these moves the tours and

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.240
aways will be super easy to see others

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.359
will you know

00:49:27.359 --> 00:49:28.480
be a little harder a little more

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.000
difficult just just see what you can

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.760
keep track of and see

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.839
if that helps you even just by again

00:49:33.839 --> 00:49:35.520
listing what you value that's almost the

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.119
easiest thing list what you value

00:49:37.119 --> 00:49:38.880
and then you can just easily funnel your

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.800
every you know as many decisions as you

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.240
can be conscious of because you know you

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:44.480
will just go into autopilot we all do it

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:47.280
um see if the actions you're making or

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.359
tours are away the things you value

00:49:49.359 --> 00:49:51.520
and you can even do act matrices for all

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.960
the aspects of your life you know you

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:54.160
can get one that's just go

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:55.839
you know goal oriented and specific to

00:49:55.839 --> 00:49:58.800
that but i think the first one would be

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:01.280
a generalized holistic holistic matrix

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.040
of which like stuff you value and

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:05.200
you know design of your life so again

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.440
step one design matrix step two

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.200
spend a few days noticing towards an

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.960
away move step three report to the

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.160
discord if you want

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.480
compare and learn from others and the

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.079
link will actually be in the description

00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:17.680
this time to the discord i put a really

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:18.960
shitty link in last time i

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:19.920
i don't know what it well i think it

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:22.319
like expired like immediately um so i'm

00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:23.599
gonna get a good link and put it in the

00:50:23.599 --> 00:50:24.480
discord

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:26.079
and that's pretty much it this is a

00:50:26.079 --> 00:50:28.400
quick one that was something that popped

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.319
up i'm like damn people should probably

00:50:30.319 --> 00:50:31.760
think about this is kind of helpful to

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.440
me so there it is

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.920
and the group should start um towards

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.960
the end of july

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:41.839
so we're getting there all right

00:50:42.839 --> 00:50:45.839
adios
