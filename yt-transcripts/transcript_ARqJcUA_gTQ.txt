00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.209
been away for centuries well as long as

we could detect the world of viruses

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.930

let me tell you something even if we

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.510
accept the inflated death numbers

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.480
especially from Italy well if you look

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.240
at the statistics ninety percent of the

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.640
deaths were all people who were all

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.990
ready terminally ill in the hospital

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.670
expected to die in his second and of

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.640
course a certain percentage azam of the

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.470
world that's in that situation is gonna

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.630

what do not start with what's going on

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.569
down there yeah what wasn't yeah what

00:12:21.569 --> 00:12:24.300
was that chuckling okay listen I've been

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.319
in jail I'm sorry the United States

00:12:27.319 --> 00:12:40.800
Mexico police and a few others never

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.810
have I seen something as challenging as

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:49.439
this mofo number one there's no glass on

00:12:49.439 --> 00:12:52.199
the windows and we're in tropical

00:12:52.199 --> 00:12:55.680
goddamn Caribbean [ __ ] jungle or the

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.850
mosquitos come out in clouds so thick

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.459
that you know Satan is about to eat you

00:13:02.459 --> 00:13:05.160
alive and well this it's almost the same

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.529
thing so you can escape there's no like

00:13:07.529 --> 00:13:10.980
walls what there's no glass how they

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.809
keep you in those bars or the whistling

00:13:12.809 --> 00:13:18.170
with rusted iron if there was only

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.040
something I don't care

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.950
I maybe only said maybe 74 but if I

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.800
can't bust some glasses by elbow to get

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.070
out of a old jail then something's wrong

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:33.060
with it no iron rusty looks like about

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:37.110
you know from the 16th century and the

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:40.020
Spanish first conquered the khari

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:44.970
Indians in dimension how long did you do

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:48.630
down there how long really in jail four

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.390
days that's not however it was not a fun

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:54.810
in four days yeah I mean listen I think

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.420
four days Dominican probably jail is

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.510
like 30 days in a Mexican jail by the

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:04.040
way I would recommend above all else

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.710
Mexican jails for misdemeanors I mean

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.020
they're gonna whack in people you know

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:14.190
raping somebody's sister if [ __ ] like

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:18.090
that no misdemeanor to [ __ ] you know

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:21.270
drunken public neither of which by the

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:23.940
way are illegal in Mexico I'll try to

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.410
think of something later but it

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:33.420
indicates the yes where were we what was

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.690
the question

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:44.510
oh yeah oh yeah so now for a misdemeanor

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:48.090
offense which is again anything less

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:52.770
than murdering okay this is misdemeanor

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.530
meaning no big deal okay we'll work it

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:59.100
out that's the Mexican system of justice

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:03.180
we'll work it out you may you know do

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.300
reparations to the parents of the dude

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.720
that you shot in the head because you're

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.390
on acid and thought he was Satan

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.150
whatever whatever who cares [ __ ] happens

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.820
we all understand that make reparations

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.470
to the parents or the wife or the

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:23.160
children okay is that not a same goddamn

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:28.040
system of justice yes yes duh of course

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:33.040
we'll never catch on in the world

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:37.990
I capitalism and what do you think we CD

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:41.470
like communism or the capitalism no I

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:47.830
don't like if the only isn't there's

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:50.680
only one ISM there's only one and that

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:57.810
is racism I wish that would explain the

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.000
arguments that I have with my wife

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.150
frequently

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:06.370
no no individualism people there is no

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:11.830
other ISM it's you your life your shoes

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:16.720
your jeans your unique experiences which

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:22.450
separates you every [ __ ] second of

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:24.520
the day from everywhere else in the

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.020
world I am John McAfee

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.780
god I hope don't although maybe listen

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.090
to dude if you are one of its wits right

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:35.830
now because I could grow a [ __ ]

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.170
goatee on that face change that

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.330
hairstyle we do have the things I would

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:44.530
I would I would dye the hair blonde is

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:47.380
what I did ago T and it's doing that

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.380
it's not that was not dark then I would

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.380
get some utensils and darkened oh yeah

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.270
yeah I got for some clubs I would [ __ ]

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:58.360
everyone on the goddamn planet as long

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.980
as my jeans would keep my face body and

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.480
impact would you say guys like us who

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.820
naturally grow goatees just get more

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.040
[ __ ] or like what do you think is one

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.820
of the reason is there I mean it tickles

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:15.940
does it not it itches it's in the way

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.949
what do you [ __ ] do with it when if

00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:20.440
you don't have a goatee you can shave

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.690
and the goddamn door we all know that

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:25.540
mmm try it with a goatee [ __ ] me we

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.910
tried in the dark turn on the lights and

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.400
see what happened it won't be pretty

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:35.140
so no so no it's not advantageous other

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:40.060
than more [ __ ] baby heard that what you

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.600
gonna do Oh

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.309
we're talking about goat cheese and

00:17:46.309 --> 00:17:51.350
[ __ ] and I'm insisting that men with

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:54.559
goatees get more [ __ ] you might have

00:17:54.559 --> 00:17:56.869
technically you have a small experience

00:17:56.869 --> 00:17:59.720
with men do you agree or disagree with

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:04.149
that it's the pirate flag of facial hair

00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:11.230
I'm sorry sure so I go excuse us huh

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:14.149
she's not responding to me because she

00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:18.320
knows I got a quite another question for

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.909
you what's your what's your spiritual

00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:22.609
meaning I've observed you're a spiritual

00:18:22.609 --> 00:18:26.269
man what's your spiritual leaning in if

00:18:26.269 --> 00:18:30.200
I had I would go with the cargo cult I

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:34.359
think they're waiting for stuff to come

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.859
do you know there is a religion called

00:18:39.859 --> 00:18:42.830
the cargo cult they're waiting for like

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:45.109
airplanes to drop like rice and stuff on

00:18:45.109 --> 00:18:48.919
them look what happens this is somewhere

00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:54.649
in western and eastern Fiji close close

00:18:54.649 --> 00:18:59.119
to the shipping lanes and because of

00:18:59.119 --> 00:19:01.450
weather conditions cargo boats

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:06.609
frequently run aground capsize or lose

00:19:06.609 --> 00:19:10.190
substantial parts of their cargo which

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:12.830
washes ashore on this island

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:20.080
and so jackpot for for almost 50 [ __ ]

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.389
legend and the outside world you know in

00:19:23.389 --> 00:19:25.340
the Fijian language of course is not

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.700
cargo cults it's probably my mom's up

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:29.929
god

00:19:29.929 --> 00:19:32.869
whatever it is yeah other people call it

00:19:32.869 --> 00:19:34.159
the cargo call what do you think would

00:19:34.159 --> 00:19:35.960
happen if like a container of

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.480
flashlights washed up on the shore but

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.580
they would probably figure out a way to

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.499
either use them or worship

00:19:42.499 --> 00:19:47.169
I don't worship on the I worship Father

00:19:47.649 --> 00:19:51.049
it's Fiji you ever seen the Fijian woman

00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:53.239
you don't want a gun in flashlights at

00:19:53.239 --> 00:19:56.210
night you want total dark

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:58.400

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:03.730
toy

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.920
yeah yeah see that washing up on shore

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.600
to the tribe flesh

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.700

occasions where I could someone from

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.380

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:05.630
actually get one Mossad agent rather

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:07.760
than that if I had a quarter of a

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:10.390
million dollars and the world was not

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:14.690
trying to kill me like what unless Jan

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:17.210

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:01.160
your thoughts on decentralized oracle

Networks do you think they are a good

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:04.730
idea also what are your thoughts on

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:06.980
chain-link a decentralized and Oracle

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:08.810
network I've ever spoken to Sergey

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:11.600
nazarov CEO of chain-link if so what did

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:20.060
you two discuss never going to address

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:22.790
any specific personality nor hey forget

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:30.580
if it product nor religion nor leanings

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:34.220
decentralization um what people are

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:35.740
missing about this entire

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:39.610
decentralization issue is that it is

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:44.860
decentralization that allow us to have a

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:51.230
permissionless trust system without it

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:54.560
it can't happen it can't explain that so

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:56.510
what's that mean if you decentralized

00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:59.900
why don't you need trust it's not like a

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:04.070
fiat currency let's look at let's look

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:06.860
at a decentralized icon suit like long

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:10.850
arrow right no Niro I don't have any

00:46:10.850 --> 00:46:12.670
[ __ ] idea who you are

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:15.890
right work you're maybe talking to me in

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:18.680
code about some shipment of drugs which

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:23.240
I don't know um but do I need to trust

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:26.840
you no we got a [ __ ] smart contract

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.420
somewhere and in that smart contract it

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:32.510
says okay here's the money I put the

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:35.570
money out now we have a way of verifying

00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:37.070

for deep [ __ ] here like heads heads of

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:37.040
crime syndicates around the world to

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:40.490
come on their knees what do you think we

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:42.680

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:49.910
god of these of such things let my be

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:50.789
doing hours

00:48:50.789 --> 00:48:53.219
[ __ ] without getting caught under worse

00:48:53.219 --> 00:48:55.739
and you know I need a quarter from your

00:48:55.739 --> 00:48:56.519
love lunch

00:48:56.519 --> 00:49:00.419
okay and mom I just said I'm smart now

00:49:00.419 --> 00:49:02.999
I'm gonna soon that you do have that

00:49:02.999 --> 00:49:05.279
much money and and you will send it to

00:49:05.279 --> 00:49:08.130
me so let me continue now this is how

00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:10.069
all right

00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:15.539
there exist tens of thousands of people

00:49:15.539 --> 00:49:20.369
today in the world who no longer uses

00:49:20.369 --> 00:49:23.849
banks credit cards cash or anything I'm

00:49:23.849 --> 00:49:24.739
one of them

00:49:24.739 --> 00:49:28.289
Janice is one of them we can't have back

00:49:28.289 --> 00:49:31.199
and credit cards not for perhaps them

00:49:31.199 --> 00:49:34.769
that might be the little cause

00:49:34.769 --> 00:49:38.279
nevertheless don't use tens of thousands

00:49:38.279 --> 00:49:42.809
don't you don't eat them nothing in this

00:49:42.809 --> 00:49:47.130
world that you need is out of reach of

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:51.959
being purchased by croteau and no talent

00:49:51.959 --> 00:49:55.739
that you may have is out of reach or

00:49:55.739 --> 00:50:00.869
being paid in crypto when people come to

00:50:00.869 --> 00:50:04.919
me and ask to promote something or to

00:50:04.919 --> 00:50:08.909
consult on an issue when the crime

00:50:08.909 --> 00:50:12.809
families beg for how do I do this more

00:50:12.809 --> 00:50:21.179
legally there you go for years I excused

00:50:21.179 --> 00:50:24.630
once you do privacy coins and I

00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:26.279
recommend Mon Niro

00:50:26.279 --> 00:50:30.659
write that down M o n PR o it's the most

00:50:30.659 --> 00:50:33.390
widely used privacy coin one of the ten

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:37.519
coins and no one has yet broken it and

00:50:37.519 --> 00:50:42.229
know what money or do is to Kotal

00:50:42.229 --> 00:50:47.789
privacy anonymity and security the

00:50:47.789 --> 00:50:49.199
security part only if you have some

00:50:49.199 --> 00:50:51.239
goddamn common sense and they learn how

00:50:51.239 --> 00:50:55.849
to protect whatever assets you may have

00:50:55.969 --> 00:51:01.240
melero now what's missing distribu

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:08.680
heated exchanges no I did one and we're

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:11.310
still in beta of that we've been in beta

00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:17.200
unfortunately my apologies we started

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:20.530
out just with the etherion chain GRC 20

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:22.170
all the way up to e rc

00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:27.970
1440 we added tron finance now we're

00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:31.090
adding Bitcoin mm-hm

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:33.910
cross chain transactions in the beta got

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:35.710
you when we finished early this summer

00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:38.230
we'll have cross chain with every token

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:41.010
now what's the difference between a

00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:45.100
distributed exchange and they

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:47.680
centralized exchange the centralized

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:50.470
exchange like finance or any other will

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:55.380
have to conform to government's demands

00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:58.900
or be shut down on him like China -

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:00.520
you're really gonna shut down every

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:02.710
exchange in China very simple Gavin

00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:05.830
address shut you don't roll off

00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:08.700
electricity set the building on fire

00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:12.430
arrest everybody else hmm a thousand

00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:15.580
ways so doesn't matter if you have a

00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:19.180
privacy coin if in fact the centralized

00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:22.240
exchanges that know who you are as

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.670
you're transacting business can still

00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:27.190
tell the feds yeah okay this is Sam

00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:30.460
Smith and he did this transaction in

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:31.350
Valero

00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:35.110
who cares if moment' was private if you

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:38.620
have to give info to the exchanges my

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:43.390
exchange McAfee Dexcom still in beta so

00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:46.930
beta true do not bet more than a dollar

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:50.860
and 40 cents on that exchange right now

00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:52.960
if you want to try it out although no

00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:57.670
one's you lost anything yet we don't ask

00:52:57.670 --> 00:53:02.860
for anything okay I see no AML nothing

00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:05.650
that's from a name you don't ask for

00:53:05.650 --> 00:53:09.070
your name we don't ask for your IP

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:12.580
address your email address we don't look

00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:16.500
for documents we you

00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:21.299
and it's in smart contracts on the

00:53:21.299 --> 00:53:22.200
blockchains

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:25.470
okay and because his own smart contracts

00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:29.789
it can never be shut down ah so you can

00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:31.200
send a dollar 40 right now and get

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.150
myself some own arrow on the McAfee

00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:35.519
Dexcom no no there is not on there yet

00:53:35.519 --> 00:53:37.890
oh no let me give you one more time we

00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:39.480
started with just for this room

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:42.480
we got you we started with aetherium

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:43.829
moved

00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:48.599
we added Tron then we added finance now

00:53:48.599 --> 00:53:53.130
we're adding Bitcoin so wouldn't you be

00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:57.660
a central force of that Dex could you

00:53:57.660 --> 00:53:59.670
own that deck so you down all that money

00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:01.410
or something their own do you understand

00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:07.890
its I'm trying to figure out how you can

00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:10.170
start one of those just a FCS you see if

00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:13.349
the SEC or the IRS snatch it to me up

00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:16.289
and goes alright shut it down I have a

00:54:16.289 --> 00:54:19.319
function I should God Himself could not

00:54:19.319 --> 00:54:22.740
shut this down without first changing

00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:25.769
the laws of mathematics now if you can

00:54:25.769 --> 00:54:28.319
get a God to do that please ask him I

00:54:28.319 --> 00:54:29.450
can't

00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:32.160
that's it why can't you just start them

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.769
up and you that's pretty tired instead

00:54:34.769 --> 00:54:38.880
listen once you start a smart contract I

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:42.779
gotta get one it's there and I worry

00:54:42.779 --> 00:54:44.309
about to let you go we're gonna let you

00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:46.279
go but we know you're a libertarian dude

00:54:46.279 --> 00:54:49.160
yes that's alright

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:52.829
do you support Donald Trump I don't

00:54:52.829 --> 00:54:55.500
support any any personnel matters who

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.720
the president is quite frankly you know

00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:00.210
we're into a different arena which could

00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:02.339
go on for hours of discussion between us

00:55:02.339 --> 00:55:04.740

there's our system people it's a it's

00:55:08.849 --> 00:55:10.970
like an automobile with the frozen

00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:14.819
