00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.540
to drink anymore there's a huge social

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.670
pressure to do it is a huge social

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.680
pressure to drink I when I was in

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.910
college and when I got out of member

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.050

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.800
kind of weary when porn stars are that

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.220

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.800
about that yeah I don't like high

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.750
production value so I started thinking

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.370
about this lady's life and like how

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.320

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.560
just want to see like a weird couple

yeah I'm like girls having a whole

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.260
career about it I start think about all

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.760
the gonzo porn and all this stuff and

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.370
like the fact that she'll be like like

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.470
waterlogged and bloated in four years

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.050
and you talk about my baby I mean dude

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.000

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.750
and makes shitty grainy 40 year old porn

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.040

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:54.920
the champs do

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.709
yeah love a game that's long ago that's

00:08:57.709 --> 00:08:58.999

00:08:58.999 --> 00:09:01.189
these girls like the guy so much they

00:09:01.189 --> 00:09:02.839
leave the glory hole yeah I don't think

00:09:02.839 --> 00:09:04.160
that this applies I mean it's a thing

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.749
I'm saying is it's a fantasy of yours

00:09:05.749 --> 00:09:08.679
it's not a fancy it happens right then

00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:11.239
during the during the glory hole scene

00:09:11.239 --> 00:09:15.699

00:09:20.689 --> 00:09:22.579
like through the wall but well you want

00:09:22.579 --> 00:09:25.100

in Sally's work I don't know extensive

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.620

you're thinking a second but I should

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.460
say of course I'm not signing off on all

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.620
of the aspects of this because there's I

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.200
think a lot of it's dubbed hmm in that

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.330
there's a lot of hard cuts it's it's but

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.430
it's just a lighting the light here the

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.350
great Matthew loved Sally Aires lighting

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:39.810
I love the light kind of like is it

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:45.390
bright is it like like just a very

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.640
intense spotlight so like though the

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.170
light it's almost like a religious

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:51.810
painting you know there's milling about

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.720
herbs you're so satanic you know how was

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.580
that satanic dude to say it's a

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:09.570
religious painting oh because even he's

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.090
an artist he paints with very dramatic

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.320
it's you know the one saving the kid

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.640
about to get his head cut off

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.510
he Abraham Isaac anyway it's kind of got

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:23.010
that feel to it it's almost like a very

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.200
intense spotlight and then nothing just

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.610
like you can see right into her butthole

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:36.900
Salieri keeps it clean nobody likes that

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.610

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:45.910
like I don't even need notes oh yeah I

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.560
was gonna crush what was your first time

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.170
I was at the Harrisburg comedy zone how

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.290
did you do bomb really blacked out not

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:56.020
on not drunk just like the nerves Wow

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.600
just purely adrenaline I was holding a

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.000
mic down like at my bellybutton took you

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.220
down I was just standing there talking

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.370
and people were like we can't hear you

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:11.130
lift the mic up and I was a Gulf [ __ ] I

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.839
don't remember the only thing I swear to

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:16.270
god I don't remember any of them the

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:17.830
only thing I remember was listening to

00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:21.280
three 6 mafia in my car before I went on

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.380
yeah that's what I remember blacked out

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.930
and once I go onstage I did I do

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.170
remember a lady in the front being like

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:34.720
motioning for me to lift the mic I don't

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.880
remember the gear either one time one

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.030
time early in my career I did wear a

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.460
blazer to an open mic that's a good look

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.590
I did try to wear a blazer doing that so

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:48.630
[ __ ] blazer with jeans

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:54.910
because I give the spotlight on me also

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.440
it was funny because you know not that

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.000
I've evolved that much but back then my

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.880
material was mostly like [ __ ] retards

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.630
am i right

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:04.210
it's wearing a blazer and jeans being

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:08.440
like [ __ ] black women stink that was

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.030
like those are some big that was a big

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:12.280
chunk of my material was it really no no

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.230
I'm just saying I was going yeah you

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:18.280
know it is you come going coming in yeah

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.950
brand new comma here in 2000 [ __ ] 10

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:22.480
obviously I wasn't coming up with

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.110
nuanced material was like did you do you

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:27.250
remember the first time you did really

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:31.360
well and that felt like no I don't

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.280
remember the first time I did well I

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.200
remember the first time I did very bad

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.660
and then didn't do it for like a year

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:41.110
maybe two after mm-hmm and then started

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:45.790
showing up again doing okay I used to

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.260
have a joke that I thought was gonna

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.750
murder about like teachers having sex

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:52.030
with students and I was like dude it's a

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.980
girl teacher has sex with a high school

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.360
student it's just nothing but high fives

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.100
I'm like how far can you slide that down

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.380
I was like any girl suck a baby's dick

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:02.550
and the whole crowd was like oh stop

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:05.800
yeah I mean half much it was just stolen

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.620
memes because I like thought I was the

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.170
first guy to discover memes although I

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.240
was early into the meme game sure I was

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.460
on the main board and I found memes like

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:19.000
in like 2010 I was hitting me yeah so

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.970
I'd show up like yeah I remember the

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.830
memes what will you talk about like when

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:24.760
your girl gets your phone

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.250
now that was I mean this is 2010 man

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.320
who's in 2010 means this is like an

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:34.210
awkward penguin this is like trying to

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:38.190
think of the old memes the originals

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.020
it's like there was like one that was

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.550
like a baby that was hat like ah

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:45.820
and it was like felt sick sucks

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.800
tits anyway it was like it's just a

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.880
picture of a baby I don't remember those

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.100
jokes I don't I just remember that would

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.810
be like the inspiration for what I would

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.140
write down look at memes online

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.840
like this is funny this is I'll just do

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.900
that it's Sofia funny yeah must have

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:09.000
smashed how's Carlos meme see it just

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.090
stealing me yeah it did get fun for a

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.280
while cuz these dudes the Harrisburg

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.930
commies done like open mic would be like

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.610
packed because I think we're on the guys

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.010
sold coke that's just so like all of his

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:21.720
friends would show up and that's when I

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.040
started to do well because I was like

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.080
the best one of the open mic errs yeah

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.540
so like all the all their friends would

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.760
show up and then be like no you gotta

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.230
stay and watch this guy he's really

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:42.180
those are the days no I'm saying I

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.650
remember that starting it starting out

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:45.180
doing stand-up is like the most like ah

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.400
it's like literally like a if you start

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.170
out and do it you kind of touch

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.450
psychosis a little bit for like a while

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:53.610
yeah I remember like you get a whole

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:55.260
weird set of thoughts you do it you do

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.830
well and I must be the best and you do

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.830
bad and you're like I'm a piece of [ __ ]

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:03.540
well that that is a hundred percent

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:06.930

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.660
do yeah do like five shows a week just

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.550
did five shows if I have one of those as

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:14.760
bad I'll be like I [ __ ] suck and then

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.140
you know it's most of the times you have

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.230

depressing yeah what's your whole

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.540

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.910
I have faith in myself

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.280

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.860

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.480
well mm-hmm but there it's not yeah

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.460

like [ __ ] out doing a set it's like

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.930
[ __ ] yeah well sometimes yeah like if

you if I have like a showcase set so

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.710

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.360

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:45.330
just say [ __ ] you mm-hmm and now you got

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:46.830
it now I just have a bad set because now

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.330
I'm just these two people are talking in

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:49.830
the front and that's the only thing I'm

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.530
thinking about in my head is them and

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.390
I'm just talking I'm just saying my set

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:57.720
yeah yeah full autopilot disconnect when

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.760
you do that when you go in like you know

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.110
I live in Queens so it's like a [ __ ]

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:03.240
hour to get to the show like walking and

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.740
trains and then you get there and you

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.470
just go into autopilot and do like

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.400
material you've been doing for five

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.680
years yeah it's like well that was that

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.660
was my entire day it was just totally

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:15.500
wasted yeah so you started to feel bad

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.180
yeah why did you bump up your day once

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:22.020
you get your day hyped up what do you

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.090
mean if you I mean if you're doing a ton

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:25.500
of stuff during the day and hit stand up

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.910
yeah whatever get a stack double use bro

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:30.870
yeah I mean I yeah

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.060
stack double use all day long throughout

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.500
time you go to the thing you like I've

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.940
stacked so many [ __ ] w's there's

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:36.990
nothing anyone can do

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:38.610
yeah sometimes I have you know I'll do

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:40.110
podcasts and stuff like that during the

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:44.490
day shows yes I've done via my manager

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:46.500
that feels good that's get like shows

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:50.040
and stuff yeah stack some dubs during

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:56.010
the desk that I mean I can stack as many

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:57.540
double users I want during the day it

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.070
has nothing compared right stand up

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:01.290
that's the only thing that would matter

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:03.360
it's just so disproportionate the way

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.950
that things affect yeah but it doesn't

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:13.920
that doesn't matter but no I did that

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.480
last week it's like I hit the all night

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.620
I went to the gym dude hit the

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:18.960
elliptical things are good if I if I had

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.120
a bad set that night just fried wouldn't

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.740
matter yeah yeah I wonder that I wonder

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.270
if you can disconnect from that and

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:25.290
still not like I wanted

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:26.640
you just would start to suck if you're

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.250
just like yeah whatever probably yeah I

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:31.140
think that's where you see people start

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.420
to suck they're just like okay with but

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.990
not having a good set yeah and then they

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:40.010
just hang out for ten years it could be

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.480
tiger woods you know he was that was

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.920
this whole thing of like constant

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.210
improvement and that's where he fired

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:47.040
Butch Harmon because butch was like just

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.210
keep it the same

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:49.170
well that's the thing it sucks about

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:51.090
stand up you can be getting better and

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:52.200
like you were saying someone will just

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.330
[ __ ] it up for you so now you have to

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:55.920
carry the burden of that all yeah well

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.750

Warren aka Pocahontas he spelled it like

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.900
completely Pocahontas focuses tough

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:34.210
spell that was that Pocahontas TAS TAS

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:36.050
Pocahontas is a tough spell

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.240
I would misspell it right now show well

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.710
I've seen the victim the movie on Disney

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:41.510
like 50 [ __ ] times yeah I can see the

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:43.310
lettering pretty clearly yeah but the

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.670
yeah he it was like Elizabeth Warren aka

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:49.370
Pocahontas trashed her about something

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:51.320
trash Bernie Sanders then trashed Mike

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.039
Bloomberg

00:28:52.039 --> 00:28:53.389
then it's like I don't know maybe

00:28:53.389 --> 00:28:54.919
they're all fighting right now I detect

00:28:54.919 --> 00:28:56.029
a little infighting yeah

00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:57.499
it's classic older brother maneuvers

00:28:57.499 --> 00:29:00.619
dude I saw that that's all older but

00:29:00.619 --> 00:29:02.059
he's literally entered older brother

00:29:02.059 --> 00:29:04.100
moves into the public debate and like I

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.379
think it's [ __ ] people up well they

00:29:06.379 --> 00:29:09.080
are borin and Bernie are kind of talking

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:09.950
[ __ ] right now

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:11.840
dude you can't not well they had to

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.450
someone called you MIDI if someone call

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:15.739
if someone was like I don't think Mike

00:29:15.739 --> 00:29:18.619
B's jumping in Bloomberg is bent at at

00:29:18.619 --> 00:29:20.210
attacking Trump I think oh well I'm sure

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:21.229
he's attacking Trump but I'm saying

00:29:21.229 --> 00:29:22.609
Warren and Bernie are fighting each

00:29:22.609 --> 00:29:24.590
other he's right about that there they

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:27.710
are in fighting yeah yeah because Mike

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:29.029
B's about to get caught in the fray

00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:30.739
I don't think many Mike deeds yes doing

00:29:30.739 --> 00:29:33.019
anything I would piss me off so bad he

00:29:33.019 --> 00:29:35.509
is no no chance I guess I thought he was

00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:37.129
gonna win when I heard that he entered

00:29:37.129 --> 00:29:38.869
and then O'Connor was like you know he

00:29:38.869 --> 00:29:40.489
tried to do this before I was like I

00:29:40.489 --> 00:29:44.570
didn't know I felt like a senator as

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:46.759
Center Democrat would like run away with

00:29:46.759 --> 00:29:49.580
this but it's not how do you hit with

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:52.129
mini Mike baby yeah yeah that's crush

00:29:52.129 --> 00:29:53.570

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:10.309
tarnishing the station's reputation well

00:30:10.309 --> 00:30:11.809
they got it also there also I would

00:30:11.809 --> 00:30:13.340
imagine like kind of psychos for the

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.700
most part so I'll be like [ __ ]

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.279
someone's got a like Lincoln style

assassinate him via calling him gay oh

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.119
yeah cuz they would get taken out just

00:30:23.119 --> 00:30:24.470
like John Wilkes Booth for it but

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.779
somebody has to do it yeah someone one

00:30:26.779 --> 00:30:29.330
of the parties do it on the stage well

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:30.679

on the stage she jumped that was okay

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.179

00:31:02.179 --> 00:31:03.650
going like super hard on him they might

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:04.640

that airliner

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:16.170

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:17.640
gave him pretty good I'll give him that

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.290
he gave a good [ __ ] speech he was

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:25.460
like I wish I was dead with the Iranian

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.330
commander that gave the order to shoot

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:28.290
down that plane

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:31.470
oh they cast a passenger plane yeah and

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.630
he was like he had to give a speech news

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:35.640
like his statement was like I wish I was

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:40.470
[ __ ] dead right now why'd they shoot

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:42.050
it down cuz I don't know they just saw a

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:44.190
[ __ ] blip on the radar they thought

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:47.490
it was a US response so they hat they

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:49.830
still haven't like they admitted it so

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:51.540
they lied about it for three days and

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.030
this is what's motivating the revolt

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:55.770
what they're like no we did yeah yeah

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:58.080
yeah they find over our airspace and

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.960
someone shot him down as well think we

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.880
shot anybody down what was Freight what

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.920
was funny was right away the news didn't

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:08.400
report it as clearly shot down yeah they

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.900
were just like man a Boeing crashed in

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:15.630
Iran this week a Boeing passenger plane

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:19.440
crashed after takeoff in Iran that's

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:19.860
weird

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.530
that'd be a wild coincidence yeah well

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:24.510
seems like a no-win situation because

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:27.000
it's like you have you know who's er the

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.130
supreme super president or something the

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:32.070
Supreme Leader supreme salieri

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:38.760
as a provider Salyer there's a lot of

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:53.610
like old men totally what happened there

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:55.620

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.270
stick on the Iran think because I do

00:37:57.270 --> 00:38:02.580
think it is but there is something funny

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.830
about the situation of Iran thinking

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:07.140
they can lie about it yeah look it's

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.620
it's it feels like grandparents learning

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:12.090
how the internet works for the first

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:15.750
time we're like oh you can't you know

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:17.460
and they're like cuz when you imagine

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:19.590
when they get that information mm-hmm

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:21.960
they're like oh [ __ ] what happened then

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.490
this Supreme Leader's like I will just

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:26.370
tell the people it's whatever was the

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:31.680
landing gear malfunction but I told like

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:35.850
just data from the flight and like it'll

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:37.230
be fine because you're so used to

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:39.600
repressing people oh yeah and O'Connor

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:40.920
O'Connor me we're just talking about

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.200
that like we were laughing about how

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.550
like they were cleaning it up they were

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:46.080
cleaning up the wreckage like right away

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.730
sure and everyone was like what are you

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:49.790
doing

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:53.340
like don't touch it we need to figure

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.270
out what happened they're like now we

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:56.520
gotta clean this up it's gonna leave

00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:01.410
[ __ ] everywhere right away don't even

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:03.270
look into how it crash that's so yeah

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:04.740
that's got to be a nightmare for those

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:07.290
regimes with the internet just like [ __ ]

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:09.690
cuz back that conversation up the

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:11.040
changes head there at some point

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.930
somebody's like clean it up as fast as

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:18.360
you and they blow up a [ __ ] jet full

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.800
of people and they're right [ __ ]

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:24.660
hurry up that up dude just get it off

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:29.160
the ground then there's like two so

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.480
there's upper management like two

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.980
degrees down somebody sticks a

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:33.420
microphone in their mouth it's like what

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:37.530
are you doing it's like I'm just trying

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:39.210
not to get killed they're killing

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:45.539
everybody it would be a farce it is

00:39:45.539 --> 00:39:47.039
and I think that everybody wrote off the

00:39:47.039 --> 00:39:48.479
internet after the Arab Spring because

00:39:48.479 --> 00:39:50.609
they're like we'll see we tried to have

00:39:50.609 --> 00:39:51.989
somewhat didn't happen but I think that

00:39:51.989 --> 00:39:54.869
was that was like gotta give it time

00:39:54.869 --> 00:39:57.059
you know it's like these the regime's

00:39:57.059 --> 00:39:58.739
still you know what time the internet

00:39:58.739 --> 00:40:02.489
yeah good you mean like for good cuz the

00:40:02.489 --> 00:40:03.989
Arab Spring ended up being kind of bad

00:40:03.989 --> 00:40:06.359
right it didn't work out so they like

00:40:06.359 --> 00:40:10.079
after they shoot everybody Muslim

00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:15.689
Brotherhood took over in Egypt you know

00:40:15.689 --> 00:40:18.419
like ultra-conservatives took over in

00:40:18.419 --> 00:40:20.969
every country like yes the youth is

00:40:20.969 --> 00:40:23.789
rising up it was just like dictators

00:40:23.789 --> 00:40:26.880
that was such a capture also I don't

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.279
know anything so that's it's gonna be

00:40:29.279 --> 00:40:31.019
funny too this is a dictator like so

00:40:31.019 --> 00:40:32.099
what do they got going on is like the

00:40:32.099 --> 00:40:33.359
internet do they got all the information

00:40:33.359 --> 00:40:35.699
about everything and you're like I just

00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:37.380
like close it out of our country and

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:38.999
then we can just sit here and like hit a

00:40:38.999 --> 00:40:40.649
button and be like let's open the

00:40:40.649 --> 00:40:41.969
internet back up there and Iran yeah

00:40:41.969 --> 00:40:45.149
[ __ ] this come from yeah so easy to do

00:40:45.149 --> 00:40:45.899
that kind of [ __ ]

00:40:45.899 --> 00:40:48.539
I mean I'd imagine here cuz we like

00:40:48.539 --> 00:40:49.769
[ __ ] about like the Russian

00:40:49.769 --> 00:40:51.749

00:40:56.159 --> 00:40:56.789
Internet

00:40:56.789 --> 00:40:59.219
yeah other countries like North Korea if

00:40:59.219 --> 00:41:01.079
North Korea saw YouTube they'd be like

00:41:01.079 --> 00:41:04.019

00:41:04.019 --> 00:41:06.329
that's how we metal in elections yeah I

00:41:06.329 --> 00:41:09.209
mean that we like literally yeah man

00:41:09.209 --> 00:41:12.289
it's because we're the best

00:41:12.289 --> 00:41:15.149
yeah we're doing number one dude I mean

00:41:15.149 --> 00:41:18.149

00:41:51.509 --> 00:41:52.709
Farsi that's how you can tell the

00:41:52.709 --> 00:41:54.809

one of those tweets that really [ __ ]

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:21.760
annoyed me like I was looking at like

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.260
responses to that tweet that when Trump

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.090
wrote that their response would be like

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:28.190
if only he respected protesters and

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:31.340

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:15.560
but perfect the other kind of the other

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:16.910

interesting times they're fun times Wow

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:42.500
you stand with solo mania the great

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:45.710
Salieri and solo well I think what we

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:50.480
should do is ditch oil altogether yeah

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.300
ditch will go just green energy and then

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.100
invade countries that use oil make you

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:56.900
can't use this [ __ ] anymore you guys got

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.940
to go green energy that's the way to use

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:01.040
our military properly yeah but then

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.330
nobody would you wouldn't need to do it

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:04.100
literally if you brought the price of

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:06.680
you know solar down - are we gonna fuel

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.820
our military huh

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.430
yeah well secretly but we'll go around

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:11.089
there you mother

00:44:11.089 --> 00:44:12.890
[ __ ] need to use green energy only

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:15.619
that's a we dispose of this oil give it

00:44:15.619 --> 00:44:17.150
to us it's illegal to have this it's

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:18.589
true we should go full world

00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:20.359
dictatorship we should we should

00:44:20.359 --> 00:44:22.700
literally get all of the world's oil

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:24.710
supply just for our military

00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:26.749
mm-hmm only the United States military

00:44:26.749 --> 00:44:28.369
can use oil everybody else has to use

00:44:28.369 --> 00:44:33.200
[ __ ] wind the IRA man

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.210
type dudes the guy free like steampunk

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:39.650
type [ __ ] enemies we went around and

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:41.779
used our military to force people and

00:44:41.779 --> 00:44:43.910
they like adopting sustainable resources

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:46.099
they'll be perfect but we're gonna burn

00:44:46.099 --> 00:44:51.529
this oil how could you do this without

00:44:51.529 --> 00:44:53.299
we I want to get I want to keep our

00:44:53.299 --> 00:44:57.200
death grip on the world yeah yes weird

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.839
leftist liberal war hawks we are we only

00:44:59.839 --> 00:45:01.369
we think the world only responds to the

00:45:01.369 --> 00:45:04.430
[ __ ] bayonet okay so how would you

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:05.960
propose to do this well I'm saying you

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.400
don't need to have a death grip that

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.920
people will gravitate towards freedom so

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:12.440
what you do is you bring the price of

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.660
solar and all the things that you'd need

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:16.910
to come along with it down nobody's

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:19.670
gonna pay extra for oil but what if the

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:21.349
guys who own all the oil companies are

00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:23.809
offering you personally 300 million

00:45:23.809 --> 00:45:26.269
dollars to not do that what are you

00:45:26.269 --> 00:45:35.539
gonna do perfect it's great to see flip

00:45:35.539 --> 00:45:37.849
right away I mean that's a tough one

00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:41.630
that's a good you're a senator you're

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:54.650
the president I have like I had a lot of

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:56.150
times now on a making decision about

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:58.279
what to do Shane has made me more aware

00:45:58.279 --> 00:46:01.460
of transparency about my motivations

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:04.369
from doing something is that why this is

00:46:04.369 --> 00:46:05.900
where you know that's what was your

00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:07.640
motivation well what I'm saying is about

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:11.089
the 300 what was a 300 million yeah the

00:46:11.089 --> 00:46:12.469
first thing that would pop into my head

00:46:12.469 --> 00:46:14.239
would be like somebody would find out

00:46:14.239 --> 00:46:22.190
mmm therefore I can't do no yeah but

00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:24.890
also they are gonna find out and you'll

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:27.310
still have 300 million dollars everybody

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:30.470
very openly knows that the oil lobbies

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:35.990
are keeping that you know but who cares

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:37.730
if you if you're getting you know

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:40.400
million dollars those days where it's

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.920
like like 65 degrees here the other day

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:45.440
you got like a wild bank account and

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:48.920
you're just kind of like it's cool sorry

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:51.850
sorry everybody

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.310
yeah I do wonder that if we are going in

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:57.200
a full [ __ ] tailspin does it make

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.670
sense that you can't just like rip [ __ ]

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:00.260
out of the ground and blast it up in the

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.600
air and be like that's fine right it's

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:06.380
cool whatever no big deal yeah start

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:08.750
cracking [ __ ] baby has like

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:14.240
earthquakes now encourage you to think

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:17.810
about those consider is that you know we

00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:19.250
had an ice age right I'm not saying

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:23.120
climate change no no no everybody stop

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.560
it that's not where this arguments going

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:26.090
you're saying it's real just not because

00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:27.890
of our no what I'm saying is if we had

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:31.010
natural climate change which has

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:32.780
happened in the past which will happen

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:34.850
again sure we would do something about

00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:38.810
it okay we would not let Isis a climate

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:42.770
denier I'm not absolutely warming

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:44.180
happening I think we should be proactive

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:46.250
and how do I know that how do you know

00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:47.840
that how do I know that global warming

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:48.770
is definitely happening

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:50.000
interesting I'm taking that position

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.100
Matt and I refuse to fall for facts but

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:53.720
no you're saying you're saying that it

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:55.490
could all be a farce no I'm not saying

00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:57.440
it's a farce it could no no you're

00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.210
saying we could be wrong not not even

00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:00.560
remotely what this argument could be

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:03.050
getting no no because I think you're

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:04.280
gonna really reject the idea of a

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:06.890
technological solution to the problem

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:10.550
that was crazy agree with that okay cool

00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:13.100
we just got it we've just got a dragon

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:20.150
gamer like the idea of [ __ ] ski free

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:22.490
on that thing dude and what I would say

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:24.830
how you gonna manually cool we're gonna

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:27.560
you could've tried you try on there like

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:28.820
on The Simpsons like when they do like

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:30.710
the [ __ ] thing that blocks our side a

00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:32.150
lot of ways of pulling carbon out of the

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:33.530
atmosphere we got to start doing that

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:36.320
but my point to you is I think a lot of

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.810
people see manmade climate change

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:40.610
and think oh we can't we got to stop

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:42.710
tampering [ __ ] Greta thern girls dude

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:46.400
I don't know man I kind of like the idea

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.200
flying over the Middle East and a blimp

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.000
just like shooting [ __ ] flames out and

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.010
it give us your [ __ ] oil dude yeah

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:54.920
solar wind let's go yeah oh my god like

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.080
an awesome god yeah dude convert your

00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:01.430
convert if you're our God do you hear

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:05.210
that Muslims you better fear our God so

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:08.660
you were saying that series I'm still

00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:10.370
unclear as you're positioned he said

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:12.940
climate change the host a hoax but

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:14.870
technology's gonna fix it no matter what

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:19.310
so don't stress none of that is accurate

00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:21.650
some of attacker I do not believe global

00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:23.300
warming is a hoax yeah I do not think

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:24.470
that nobody should be worried about it

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:26.180
but I do think that there will be a

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:28.490
technological solution to it so always

00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:30.050
my stuff about ice ages and things well

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:32.120
because I thought your argument was to

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:36.260
say we need to stop making progress so

00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:38.000
to speak we need to like go back a lot

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.190
of people would be like unplug your

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:42.170
microwave leave zero carbon footprint

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:43.760
that's the way we got to live in harmony

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:48.470
with nature coming out of your microwave

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:51.020
using microwave a lot yeah do you love

00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:58.700
it of course microwave reheated in the

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:00.320
microwave I've been using a straw to

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.870
drink coffee because of my teeth

00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:05.330
what's happen to your teeth they I over

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:07.280
brushed the front so like if I drink too

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:11.360
much coffee there's no name goes right

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:14.300
to your brain yeah well you're saying

00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:16.760
that bad chompers now - yeah you have

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:18.230
you brush your you brush your gums too

00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:21.260
hard yeah I used to in the past I did it

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:23.810
I did the same thing gotcha but you

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:24.980
think we can just sit here and rape the

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:28.160
earth your gums can't handle a

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.990
toothbrush you think this was a mile of

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:33.230
ice over England at one point yeah we're

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:34.390
not letting that happen again

00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:36.230
we're not gonna ever let that happen

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:37.730
again hell no I don't think it's gonna

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:41.990
happen we accidentally globally warmed

00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:44.240
that is a you know we were trying to

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.250
solve other problems global warmed a

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:47.780
little bit yeah we're gonna need to

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:48.890
solve that problem

00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:51.990
mmm we can

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:54.810
oh yeah so you definitely are saying

00:50:54.810 --> 00:50:57.240
that we know the idea of ice ages itself

00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:59.550
is because you seem split between two

00:50:59.550 --> 00:51:03.930
positions no I'm just trying yeah I gave

00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:05.940
you I thought you were making a

00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:07.440
different argument than the one you were

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.450
making gosh I was trying to come into it

00:51:09.450 --> 00:51:11.640
and like that's that's the key argument

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:18.510
for climate change denial is a better

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:20.250
example moving forward I don't know my

00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:22.140
question I don't know dude I'd be lying

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:23.700
if I I don't know and I don't have any

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:25.890
facts yeah and if it turned out that

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:29.070
everyone was just joking yeah and then

00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:30.060
at the end they'd be like dude this

00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:32.339
[ __ ] [ __ ] thought the world was

00:51:32.339 --> 00:51:36.420
ending because we used gas I would be

00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:37.770
like oh [ __ ] yeah I'm an idiot well to

00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:39.690
be totally honest yeah yeah it's like

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:42.690
I'm like well Alex Jones said it's not

00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:45.230
happening Leonardo DiCaprio said it is

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:47.760
that's as far as I know I just know

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:50.220
actually knowing well what about this

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:54.839
that is it a fact of physics that if you

00:51:54.839 --> 00:51:57.599
put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere

00:51:57.599 --> 00:52:00.450
will create a greenhouse effect mm-hmm

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:02.310
so if we buy that then it's just a

00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:04.589
matter of how far along are we right now

00:52:04.589 --> 00:52:08.490
yeah and but the larger point is at a

00:52:08.490 --> 00:52:10.170
certain point if you buy that fact we'll

00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:12.030
have to do something about it so we

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:14.910
might as well start figuring it out yeah

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:16.890
act as if it's happening whether or not

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:19.050
you agree with the facts true that I

00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:21.150
agree with I'll be tightened I'm faking

00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:23.480
the street yeah we're taking out co2

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:26.880
true a lot of companies doing it yeah

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:30.380
yeah I hope it doesn't make sense

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.490
logically in my head I'm like well you

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:34.890
can't just keep Boston stuff and burn in

00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:36.599
toxic stuff but we're also gonna run out

00:52:36.599 --> 00:52:41.400
of oil when like a century you think so

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:44.070
yeah II think we'll make it yeah yeah I

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:45.270
mean we're like actually there's not

00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:46.589
enough it's my world

00:52:46.589 --> 00:52:49.980
how come gases and spiking it it will it

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:52.440
has before yeah well that's what

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:55.170
fracking is is going deeper and finding

00:52:55.170 --> 00:52:57.210
more oil is it or is it like isn't that

00:52:57.210 --> 00:52:58.500
gas they release there's that oil

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:01.410
fracking is you know it's natural its

00:53:01.410 --> 00:53:02.970
fossil fuels that's what I asked [ __ ]

00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:05.670
like that yeah but yeah it's oil

00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:08.249
soil deposits you gotta get deeper cuz

00:53:08.249 --> 00:53:10.230
they ran out of whatever was up top now

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:12.210
there's getting different stuff same

00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:15.539
soil it's fracking is petroleum I don't

00:53:15.539 --> 00:53:16.380
know enough about don't know the

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:18.809
difference but is there like some weird

00:53:18.809 --> 00:53:20.789
gas or maybe is a byproduct I forget

00:53:20.789 --> 00:53:25.140
maybe but the way I was told was

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.420
fracking is just going deeper and trying

00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:29.789
to get more because though it reserves

00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:32.099
up top are already going that's what you

00:53:32.099 --> 00:53:33.599
know that's what I was told that could

00:53:33.599 --> 00:53:35.099
be totally inaccurate you think are we

00:53:35.099 --> 00:53:36.660
could be wrong and it's this is all like

00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:38.160
stuff happening in outer space as

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.239
affecting the temperature of our planet

00:53:39.239 --> 00:53:43.319
yes solar flares I don't know what do

00:53:43.319 --> 00:53:44.400
you know about black holes I don't know

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.019
nothing you don't know anything about

00:53:46.019 --> 00:53:48.359
event horizons yeah I thought you liked

00:53:48.359 --> 00:53:51.180
outer space space guy well I mean I know

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:52.529
of them I suppose

00:53:52.529 --> 00:53:56.819
so what happens but what size star has

00:53:56.819 --> 00:53:58.650
to die in order to create a black hole I

00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:00.180
don't know three times the size of the

00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:02.819
Sun okay

00:54:02.819 --> 00:54:06.480
talking red giants bro watch out three

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:08.339
times the size you know time stops in

00:54:08.339 --> 00:54:09.829
template on an event horizon

00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:12.390
I've heard that do you know how that

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.839
works

00:54:12.839 --> 00:54:17.190
no either there's a supernova from a

00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:21.890
white dwarf and then time stops

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:25.109
yeah the star expands yep tracks you

00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:26.609
know on itself if it's not three times

00:54:26.609 --> 00:54:28.769
bigger than the Sun it just forms like a

00:54:28.769 --> 00:54:31.380
weird I figure what it's called a red

00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:35.369
door so I'm sort of weird like blue blue

00:54:35.369 --> 00:54:36.660
door if there's a blue guy in there well

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:38.339
it starts it starts to snow pretty big

00:54:38.339 --> 00:54:40.380
of those girls I don't know what do you

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:42.029
think the great Sally a V you would say

00:54:42.029 --> 00:54:43.619
they say black holes you and I wanted

00:54:43.619 --> 00:54:45.119
the middle of all of our universes it's

00:54:45.119 --> 00:54:46.650
that gravitation it's the pool of black

00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:48.499
holes that keeps the stuff moving around

00:54:48.499 --> 00:54:52.380
okay how's it feel to know that I know

00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:56.220
way more than good McCusker just you

00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:58.440
tried to dam that's your to know against

00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:03.289
him albedo did I climb it you fixed it

00:55:03.529 --> 00:55:05.880
you thought he was a space expert you

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.529
came in here and just said things like

00:55:07.529 --> 00:55:11.099
event horizon guess what I've been

00:55:11.099 --> 00:55:14.779
watching a lot of Chris D'Elia on

00:55:14.779 --> 00:55:17.579
Sheamus rolled his eyes at me why the

00:55:17.579 --> 00:55:19.320
fighter and the guard just highly

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:21.510
recommended yeah he's great so funny

00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:24.180
yeah thanks that's a good I've been

00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:26.790
watching cheer on Netflix it was so

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:28.620
boring cheer on Netflix you would say

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:31.680
that it was pretty good cheers Cheers

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:35.960
the hottest kids every time I come I

00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:40.040

member so far that's good dude you would

00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:27.660
it would it would behoove you so much

00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:28.860
when I get it

00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:31.260
the group will bring you yeah you the

00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:33.660
problem is nobody uses it properly every

00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:35.130
yeah you're thinking the way you're

00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:36.540
thinking of people using it just like

00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:37.920
hanging with your buddies getting stoned

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:39.990
is you goofing around you just smoke it

00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:41.640
and it's just enough don't go too crazy

00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:43.350
and close your eyes and meditate it

00:56:43.350 --> 00:56:44.820
students the most it's like the best

00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:46.110
thing you possibly yeah it's like

00:56:46.110 --> 00:56:47.820
drinking it drinking a nice cold beer

00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:49.860
out out you know sitting out on total

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:51.630
opposite energy no no no please please

00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:53.450
don't be you're so negative all the time

00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:56.490
you are so you just get a nice man just

00:56:56.490 --> 00:56:58.710
how efficient ice-cold [ __ ] Miller

00:56:58.710 --> 00:57:00.540
High Life just sitting there the

00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:02.730
meditation did the I mean there's a lot

00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:05.240
to there's a lot to be had there mm-hmm

00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:11.790
what I'm hearing you talk okay all right

00:57:11.790 --> 00:57:13.770
no I was just saying there's yeah you

00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:15.450
can get that ice-cold beer nice cold

00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:17.640
beer out there on a Friday night just a

00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:21.650
pair of jeans just fit just right yeah

00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:24.240
beers it's the opposite energy there's

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.520
nothing challenging about having a beer

00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:28.410
what's the what's the goal of the meetup

00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:32.520
group so the goal would be so this is

00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:33.010
this is

00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:36.250
go so I want to replace Phil people who

00:57:36.250 --> 00:57:37.300
can't get therapy because it's too

00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:39.820
expensive the ideas thank God I did not

00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:46.150
just say I hate why I hate it but then

00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:50.050
he was like therapy yeah yes it sounds

00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:54.250
like a nice thing yeah the goal is so

00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:55.960
when I get done it was just like to get

00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:58.120
high well you guys are ignorant to plant

00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:59.500
minutes and of course you got something

00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:01.390
you guys probably call wheat I call it

00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:02.770
cannabis you're ignorant to plant

00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:04.510
medicine in the liquid form it's just

00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:06.820
barley and hops yeah you guys but you

00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:08.050
probably call it just booze if it's

00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:10.390
actually barley well maybe we can get

00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:11.860
into the history of intoxicants that

00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:14.100
came with agricultural revolution

00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:17.320
taymiyah all those destroyed the

00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:19.020
traditions that I'm touching

00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:21.880
exactly yeah you know you're all about

00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:23.740
it I mean I'm just as spiritual about

00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:25.690
booze apparently they say that booze

00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:27.450
came from when they were preserving

00:58:27.450 --> 00:58:30.130
mushrooms in honey they would last for a

00:58:30.130 --> 00:58:35.830
while and the honey would you know I'm

00:58:35.830 --> 00:58:38.080
gonna [ __ ] that saber-toothed up I'm

00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:41.590
going out by myself but yeah that's the

00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:44.590
idea once I get done school I'm gonna

00:58:44.590 --> 00:58:46.960
open like a I want to get some I got to

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.550
get some sort of professional space and

00:58:48.550 --> 00:58:51.250
I'm gonna open a practice that is gonna

00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:54.460
be kind of in blury territory but it'll

00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:55.720
be for people who can't really afford

00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.880
therapy and it said 1,150 bucks they'll

00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:59.800
be 40 bucks an hour and the idea was you

00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:01.450
meet one-on-one for like X amount of

00:59:01.450 --> 00:59:03.600
sessions and then you start entering the

00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:05.890
like small doses of weed while you're

00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:07.390
talking and then you do like a larger

00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:09.160
one and then once after about like six

00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:10.900

go on back to do it and you wouldn't

00:59:21.610 --> 00:59:23.170
create a splinter cell full of people

00:59:23.170 --> 00:59:24.250
who are just taking care of each other

00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:26.260

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:54.910
Salieri I'm still trying to find my

01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:57.130
thing the Holy Spirit hasn't spoken to

01:02:57.130 --> 01:03:00.520

please I'm telling you I don't like who

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:19.150
I'm becoming I never like who I am on

01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:34.120
this no I was just saying it's when

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.470
you're around people that are really

01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:38.860
good at something that shows you you

01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:40.300
know it's like I'm not there but I want

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:42.190
to be good at something I don't have

01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:46.240
like I have the drive to you know be

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.370
good but I haven't found that thing yet

01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:55.150
yeah no no I know your ambitions are

01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:57.130
exceeding your talent right now you

01:03:57.130 --> 01:03:58.240
gotta get you some you gotta get your

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:03.190
talent up your talent sucks I'm talking

01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:06.910
about like just I mean no that's just it

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:10.330
I think it's an accurate you know it's

01:04:10.330 --> 01:04:11.620
just an act that's like when you look

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:13.780
around right it's like your stay

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:16.060
it's just on a different level no but

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:19.270
look at something like McKeever and the

01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:20.860
way that McKeever writes our direct

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:23.730
something it's like alright and so

01:04:23.730 --> 01:04:26.050
that's not it you know what I've tried

01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:27.930
to do anything's better director

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:32.590
McKeever or the great Salieri could do

01:04:32.590 --> 01:04:34.330
it you think the key we should get into

01:04:34.330 --> 01:04:35.950
pornography it would probably be very no

01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:37.960
but I'm saying if I was like John make

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.460
make it look like this

01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:42.760
Salieri yeah you think we're just master

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.890
I mean you think anybody some schmuck

01:04:44.890 --> 01:04:46.930
from Philadelphia can just replicate

01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:51.340
what the great Venetian Sal yeah yeah

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:52.690
that is the worst feeling when you're

01:04:52.690 --> 01:04:54.160
floating around being like I have all

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:57.730
this energy to do something and you in

01:04:57.730 --> 01:05:00.490

tried to paint the shapes but it looks

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:44.950
like a three-year-old did it it's so

01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:46.780
different when you look at the way her

01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:49.750

hitting that thing oh yeah they're like

01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:14.810
the fact that it was coming out of a

01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:16.280

you're Nath Lee - you need a sleep

01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:06.110

01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:17.750
something there's some kind of football

01:24:28.969 --> 01:24:32.719

pants yeah oh I should just not do it

01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:14.330

01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:16.370
[ __ ] I forgot my pants at the locker

01:27:16.370 --> 01:27:17.570
room like I'm gonna have to wear the

01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:24.470
same pants I guess every game a little

01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:25.940
bit like during the week yeah when

01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.680
you're practicing like let's say it was

01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:28.990
like rainy that day you just have a

01:27:28.990 --> 01:27:32.180
soggy pair of pants in the locker Oh

01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:33.680
especially during fall it's all coming

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:35.150
back to me right now like during

01:27:35.150 --> 01:27:37.340
two-a-days so it would be like a hundred

01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:39.740
degrees outside just humid as [ __ ] and

01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:41.630
you're wearing like already soaking wet

01:27:41.630 --> 01:27:44.870
pants oh yeah I did when I was doing

01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:47.540
demos 8 a.m. it's already [ __ ] 75 and

01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:50.510
muggy dude I was working demolition I

01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:51.950
remember I was like all right I'm gonna

01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:53.930
cut down on my laundry load so I'm going

01:27:53.930 --> 01:27:56.510
to take my dirty pants off throw where's

01:27:56.510 --> 01:27:58.400
some gym shorts to work and then as my

01:27:58.400 --> 01:27:59.540
pants are already dirty I might as well

01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:01.340
start the day with dirty pants like so

01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:03.560
I'm not ruin another pair of pants dude

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:05.060
I warm in this summer stop put him in

01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:07.190
the trunk overnight I put them on and I

01:28:07.190 --> 01:28:09.680
could like they were like stiff yeah I

01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:12.140
could feel like [ __ ] crawling all over

01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:14.900
me my brain they were that dirty it was

01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:16.850
just like I could feel the filth on me

01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:19.520
all day and I just like stood there on a

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:21.350
construction site next to a machine all

01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:24.050
day it was just like all [ __ ]

01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:26.210
grabbing myself and being like that's

01:28:26.210 --> 01:28:27.590
terrible it was like the feeling of

01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:29.330
dried sweat 8-8 first thing in the

01:28:29.330 --> 01:28:31.490
morning yes 7:30 pulling it over and

01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:33.230
it's sitting them all day I definitely

01:28:33.230 --> 01:28:35.900
have a rationale yeah disgusting how the

01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:38.780
[ __ ] people used to do that because I

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:41.030
was like dude I'm 1776 they used to wear

01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.750
clothes for like

01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:43.940
a week at a time I should be able to

01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:46.040
handle this and it was just dude not at

01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:47.780
all oh the history podcast is getting

01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:49.640
there I'm just gonna do the rest of it

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:51.350
in the last movie so I gotta finish

01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:53.900
tomorrow I got finished this book but uh

01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:56.480
yeah please please excuse me pardon

01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:00.260
you're excused I will say this the first

01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:02.810
battle he was in it got rowdy but they

01:29:02.810 --> 01:29:06.320
did pretty nice because I had only read

01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:08.210
like his Wikipedia at first so that's

01:29:08.210 --> 01:29:09.770
that's my understanding of what happens

01:29:09.770 --> 01:29:12.830
towards the end of this but it he's got

01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:14.300
like a shitty rumor about him where he

01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:16.610
kind of like pushed out a couple times

01:29:16.610 --> 01:29:20.060
or like maybe wasn't Thomas Francis more

01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:22.340
you haven't been listening to the it's

01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:26.740
okay history podcast on patreon

01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:31.790
but now the first battle is [ __ ] he

01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:33.830
pulls down dinner puss out he's [ __ ]

01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:35.840
like horse got hit with a shell he got

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:38.390
[ __ ] knocked out yeah it seems weird

01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:40.340
that he would have post out yeah he

01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:42.980
didn't I mean it's that alone is enough

01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:44.570
to be like right this guy was a monster

01:29:44.570 --> 01:29:46.700
yeah and then keep going back into

01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:49.280
battles like your horse got ripped in

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:52.400
half from a shell he got like knocked

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.600
out and then the rumor cuz the

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:56.060
journalist hated him because he so they

01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:57.680
were like he was drunk he fell off his

01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:59.270
[ __ ] horse the drunk drunk Irish

01:29:59.270 --> 01:30:05.990
piece of [ __ ] there was 1864 he fell

01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:08.390
from his mount cuz he had been consuming

01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:14.300
whiskey that's that that podcast hurt I

01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:16.040
didn't hear it it's tough to listen to

01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:18.050
the comedy standard or Comedy Cellar

01:30:18.050 --> 01:30:21.380
interviewed them and I don't know I'll

01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:23.570
talk to them about it before I you know

01:30:23.570 --> 01:30:25.520
put it on blast on the cast but like

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:28.100
yeah even there's like a weird thing

01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:29.750
where these people think that they can

01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:32.180
talk to these guys yeah like you think

01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:34.610
and I have it too like where I just want

01:30:34.610 --> 01:30:36.290
to talk to somebody that has a problem

01:30:36.290 --> 01:30:38.150
with maybe like there's a middle ground

01:30:38.150 --> 01:30:38.930
here like you're definitely

01:30:38.930 --> 01:30:40.700
misinterpreting what I'm doing so like

01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:43.340
let me try to explain my side but

01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:44.720
they're there they're out of it

01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:46.250
they're not even gonna give you an inch

01:30:46.250 --> 01:30:48.020
yeah they're not gonna give you one

01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:50.180
benefit of the doubt on anything you've

01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:51.170
ever said or done

01:30:51.170 --> 01:30:53.210
you're also conceptualizing everything

01:30:53.210 --> 01:30:55.150
through like this weird lens of power

01:30:55.150 --> 01:30:56.980
yeah they're constantly like I'm on a

01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:59.110
powerful platform in it yeah I don't

01:30:59.110 --> 01:31:00.550
know man I got I get weird [ __ ] like

01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:02.110
that in my school and they're like how

01:31:02.110 --> 01:31:03.520
do you deal with issues of power between

01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:06.190
you and the students it's like I just I

01:31:06.190 --> 01:31:07.810
don't flex on them dude I don't what the

01:31:07.810 --> 01:31:09.940
[ __ ] do you mean power I would love that

01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:12.400
look more clearly defined yeah I'm not

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.960
like rolling up in that yo you got to do

01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:15.490
this right now it's like I'm like hey

01:31:15.490 --> 01:31:17.320
what's going on okay but there's still

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:18.910
power than room I'm like dude I guess

01:31:18.910 --> 01:31:20.580
man is gonna be [ __ ] weird about it

01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:23.050
yeah there's a usual power differential

01:31:23.050 --> 01:31:26.020
right now in this room of course around

01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:29.020
Shane so get off my dick for you Tom I

01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:30.970
hate you saw my intangible power without

01:31:30.970 --> 01:31:33.700

01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:34.930
your did you caught him with a power

01:31:34.930 --> 01:31:37.450
abuser Oh first of all no I'm not

01:31:37.450 --> 01:31:39.280
relaxing second of all yeah he's a POW

01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:40.300
he's in power

01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:43.840
yeah it's cuz even seems a manipulator

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:46.090
of spirits a hundred percent

01:31:46.090 --> 01:31:50.110
Stephen slow down something in my school

01:31:50.110 --> 01:31:51.610
what's that Joe

01:31:51.610 --> 01:31:54.550
everything's is a power struggle I think

01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:56.920
this is a unique case it's changed so

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.540
it's like you know so you think Seth's

01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:01.960
right what change is a big powerful oh

01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:05.460
is that is that the power-hungry white

01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:14.470
yeah but he does those guys view the

01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:17.470
world through that like the haves in the

01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:20.530
have-nots just absolute the neo-marxist

01:32:20.530 --> 01:32:22.900
yeah what's the context of this like

01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:25.510
what podcast was he on he was on the

01:32:25.510 --> 01:32:28.150
comedy sellers podcast okay because he

01:32:28.150 --> 01:32:30.640
called he just wrote an article calling

01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:33.040
the owner of the county seller dumb that

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:35.170
was the article was he doesn't he was

01:32:35.170 --> 01:32:36.370
like the comedy sellers owner doesn't

01:32:36.370 --> 01:32:37.690
understand racism

01:32:37.690 --> 01:32:40.870
he is dumb no not his fault

01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:43.810

01:32:43.810 --> 01:32:45.130
mention I'm a comedian here's my book

01:32:45.130 --> 01:32:49.750
yeah he's not a community he doesn't it

01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:51.900
wouldn't be tenable for him to maintain

01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:54.700
his journalistic integrity and also

01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:57.160
participate in cops why he can't do

01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:58.840
comedy otherwise he'd be killing it I'm

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:01.540
sure that's what he said yeah he said he

01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:02.800
doesn't do comedy or get involved

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:05.020
because it wouldn't be you think it

01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:07.240
would not be tenable the way his way to

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:08.800
hear his voice

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:10.840
Benjamin Franklin wait till you hear

says Simon Says Simon Says ox/y it's

01:33:17.409 --> 01:33:18.820
wild that's weird

01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:20.829
they literally at one point are like oh

01:33:20.829 --> 01:33:23.079
yeah why don't you uh cuz you know he

01:33:23.079 --> 01:33:25.059
hates capitalism it's like part of his

01:33:25.059 --> 01:33:27.130
life yeah but they're like yeah why

01:33:27.130 --> 01:33:28.510
don't you write all about all this like

01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:31.059
you you write what he's like I write for

01:33:31.059 --> 01:33:34.000
comedy journalism and workers Oh looks

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.320
like I write for comedy in for the

01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:37.059
laborers like what do you mean the

01:33:37.059 --> 01:33:41.079
laborer is like the workers okay he

01:33:41.079 --> 01:33:42.730
writes for the workers over his jobs

01:33:42.730 --> 01:33:45.099
before he was a journalist probably

01:33:45.099 --> 01:33:46.690
never had one has he ever done any sort

01:33:46.690 --> 01:33:49.179

anybody who has yeah I was like I find

01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:54.579
it funny that he writes for the workers

01:33:54.579 --> 01:33:58.059

01:33:58.059 --> 01:34:00.579
workers kinda like me well that's the

01:34:00.579 --> 01:34:01.780
other thing and the only thing he's ever

01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:05.619
done is taken jobs that's like his

01:34:05.619 --> 01:34:07.659
career well that's the funny I remember

01:34:07.659 --> 01:34:08.889

01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:39.810
blackface

01:35:39.810 --> 01:35:41.890
well labor union in Philly is

predominantly black nice so here I like

01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:44.890
that

01:35:44.890 --> 01:35:46.360
grinding up if he went to the labor

01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:47.800

it does sound no benefit he's probably

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:13.780

01:36:13.780 --> 01:36:16.320

01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:41.950
once about the consequences yeah they're

01:36:41.950 --> 01:36:43.510
the ones that are complaining about the

01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:44.980

01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:02.890
poking holes in people's political

01:37:02.890 --> 01:37:06.880
ambitions or whatever yeah judy judy was

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:08.230
like every time i'm getting harassed

01:37:08.230 --> 01:37:15.040
online yeah also what bothered me at all

01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:17.770
about like even trying to have a

01:37:17.770 --> 01:37:19.990
conversation with them is like you're

01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:22.120
just then they were like why don't you

01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:23.530
just stick around the cellar for like a

01:37:23.530 --> 01:37:25.270
week and then you know see how we do

01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:26.710
things here and it's like just don't

01:37:26.710 --> 01:37:28.810
appease this person yeah why are we

01:37:28.810 --> 01:37:31.510
letting them terrorize us yeah why are

01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:33.220
we letting some guy that just wrote an

01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:34.840
article about just literally wrote an

01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:36.099
article calling you racist

01:37:36.099 --> 01:37:37.989
and um and you're gonna be like hey man

01:37:37.989 --> 01:37:40.510
I think you got this wrong let me let me

01:37:40.510 --> 01:37:42.969
show you how we do things here it's like

01:37:42.969 --> 01:37:44.530
dude he's gonna [ __ ] if there's no

01:37:44.530 --> 01:37:47.019
way he's gonna come back and be like you

01:37:47.019 --> 01:37:49.389
know what I was wrong dude he's gonna

01:37:49.389 --> 01:37:51.280
just bash you again he's gonna do it

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:53.409
more he's gonna scan every single facet

01:37:53.409 --> 01:37:54.909
of what you're doing and they just try

01:37:54.909 --> 01:37:56.829
to tear you apart because he can't ever

01:37:56.829 --> 01:38:00.070
concede ever because that's his entire

01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:02.559
identity yeah he could never be like

01:38:02.559 --> 01:38:05.530
yeah you know that was a maybe he's not

01:38:05.530 --> 01:38:07.059
racist like I was wiling out a little

01:38:07.059 --> 01:38:07.629
bit there

01:38:07.629 --> 01:38:10.030
well that's I'm Tony if you if you it's

01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:12.280
a very like you either believe that [ __ ]

01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:13.959
or you don't it's there's no room for

01:38:13.959 --> 01:38:15.909
being like like I could see what you

01:38:15.909 --> 01:38:17.169
guys are saying with this but I don't

01:38:17.169 --> 01:38:18.309
know if it's like that it's just like

01:38:18.309 --> 01:38:20.289
you either buy it all in or you're

01:38:20.289 --> 01:38:22.419
[ __ ] a piece of [ __ ] you buy in they

01:38:22.419 --> 01:38:25.809
it seems to me like they buy in entirely

01:38:25.809 --> 01:38:28.629
on this ideology and then they're like

01:38:28.629 --> 01:38:32.139
this is just a baseline morale you know

01:38:32.139 --> 01:38:34.869
belief this isn't like crazy that I'm

01:38:34.869 --> 01:38:37.209
doing this this is the only way and

01:38:37.209 --> 01:38:38.859
there's there's no room for there's no

01:38:38.859 --> 01:38:40.419
room to acknowledge the fact that like

01:38:40.419 --> 01:38:42.039
like they'll be like I'll acknowledge my

01:38:42.039 --> 01:38:43.119
privilege but none of them acknowledge

01:38:43.119 --> 01:38:45.309
the fact that they're building like a

01:38:45.309 --> 01:38:47.379
weird social hierarchy around this stuff

01:38:47.379 --> 01:38:48.909
and also benefiting from it they never

01:38:48.909 --> 01:38:50.079
if you're as soon as you bring that up

01:38:50.079 --> 01:38:52.119
about like how their social life is tied

01:38:52.119 --> 01:38:53.439
into this sound like they all kind of

01:38:53.439 --> 01:38:56.139
check each other they just get like what

01:38:56.139 --> 01:38:56.769
are you talking about

01:38:56.769 --> 01:39:00.369
[ __ ] weirds him out yeah whatever

01:39:00.369 --> 01:39:04.059
yeah it's yeah at one point no gnomes

01:39:04.059 --> 01:39:05.679
the guy who owns the cellars like I'm

01:39:05.679 --> 01:39:07.329
not that he's like you think I'm racist

01:39:07.329 --> 01:39:09.699
just because I'm white and he's like all

01:39:09.699 --> 01:39:12.099
whites are racist inherently we all

01:39:12.099 --> 01:39:15.639
benefit we all collude in racism I'm

01:39:15.639 --> 01:39:18.639
racist he says that it's just like just

01:39:18.639 --> 01:39:23.829
relax it's totally original sin it's

01:39:23.829 --> 01:39:26.949
crazy yeah anyway anyway yeah that was

01:39:26.949 --> 01:39:29.229
grinding my gears a little yeah I did

01:39:29.229 --> 01:39:31.149
[ __ ] man I don't I don't like that or

01:39:31.149 --> 01:39:32.829
any poison the whole split those

01:39:32.829 --> 01:39:34.510
supposed to be workers versus the

01:39:34.510 --> 01:39:36.219
bourgeoisie so but he's cutting a

01:39:36.219 --> 01:39:37.389
difference between white and black

01:39:37.389 --> 01:39:40.269
workers then there was an article in the

01:39:40.269 --> 01:39:42.159
Washington journal oh my god I read it

01:39:42.159 --> 01:39:43.479
and not in the Wall Street in Wall

01:39:43.479 --> 01:39:45.070
Street Journal not not Washington Post

01:39:45.070 --> 01:39:46.539
now I'm saying that because people think

01:39:46.539 --> 01:39:47.979
you're all right because you read a

01:39:47.979 --> 01:39:49.960
journal

01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:52.840
but did you read the journal there was

01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:56.710
big girl from socialists against the New

01:39:56.710 --> 01:40:00.040
York Times is thing the 16:19 project oh

01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:01.990
yeah oh that's what this interview was

01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:04.620
about okay Noam was commenting about the

01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:07.630
16:19 project and that and that's why he

01:40:07.630 --> 01:40:09.910
wrote that article actually but there's

01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:11.980
a socialist that disagreed with the

01:40:11.980 --> 01:40:14.470
16:19 project saying that by viewing

01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:16.090
things through white black lens you're

01:40:16.090 --> 01:40:18.160
missing the actual distinction in the

01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:21.910
world which is worker bourgeoisie and in

01:40:21.910 --> 01:40:23.770
your you're in flaming strife between

01:40:23.770 --> 01:40:28.960
the workers yeah yeah just like dude

01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:30.910
[ __ ] find something you like do it

01:40:30.910 --> 01:40:31.390
every day

01:40:31.390 --> 01:40:33.790
try not bring the [ __ ] newspaper not

01:40:33.790 --> 01:40:35.860
you I'm saying yeah general I'm talking

01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:37.810
to the general populace dude the holy

01:40:37.810 --> 01:40:39.970
boy yeah it's like to talk about large

01:40:39.970 --> 01:40:41.320
swaths of people with cool [ __ ]

01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:44.080
French words proletariat and the oil

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:47.050
truth the holy holy polloi so you could

01:40:47.050 --> 01:40:48.520
you could literally ignore all the [ __ ]

01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:49.960
and just try to like make more money

01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:55.330
than you spend and you know like the

01:40:55.330 --> 01:40:57.280
whole thing of to each according to his

01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:59.200
ability is something according to his

01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:01.060
means I'd like to be the guy like

01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:11.380
determining what your ability is you

01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:16.630
could be doing more they get to do that

01:41:16.630 --> 01:41:19.090
there's a person in the communist place

01:41:19.090 --> 01:41:20.830
who's in the communist right no I mean

01:41:20.830 --> 01:41:22.570
if you make a statement like that

01:41:22.570 --> 01:41:24.670
somebody's got to decide right if you're

01:41:24.670 --> 01:41:26.860
pulling your weight I mean other than

01:41:26.860 --> 01:41:28.300
that I could just take everybody at face

01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:29.530
value it's like this is the most I could

01:41:29.530 --> 01:41:33.460
do I mean what is it how does that work

01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:34.420
you're just trying to like are you

01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:35.740
trying to make enough to compete with

01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:36.940
other countries you're trying to just

01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:38.710
feed yourselves like where does it where

01:41:38.710 --> 01:41:40.630
do people get the chill do people get

01:41:40.630 --> 01:41:42.880
the chill do people get to chill in the

01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:44.920
communism yeah it's less about the

01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:47.440
person and more about the plaintiff

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:51.700
state so anyway yeah I was trying not to

01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:53.830
really bring that up yeah I made I just

01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:55.810
don't even like talking about that stuff

01:41:55.810 --> 01:41:57.700
mhm cuz it's just it's just a bad look

01:41:57.700 --> 01:41:59.860
like I'm never gonna like if I saw him I

01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:01.930
wouldn't be like hey [ __ ] you [ __ ] it

01:42:01.930 --> 01:42:03.019
would just be like amen

01:42:03.019 --> 01:42:04.909
that's that guy hey I already dealt with

01:42:04.909 --> 01:42:06.739
it before with other filly you know yeah

01:42:06.739 --> 01:42:09.319
people see them and they're like either

01:42:09.319 --> 01:42:11.029
ignore you or they look weird and you

01:42:11.029 --> 01:42:12.799
feel weird and it's like all right now

01:42:12.799 --> 01:42:14.779
we don't yeah great I think there are

01:42:14.779 --> 01:42:17.119
some people that do really well engaging

01:42:17.119 --> 01:42:20.149
with somebody like him somebody that has

01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:23.209
whether that's a Simon's belief or

01:42:23.209 --> 01:42:26.089
anybody on the diametrically opposed

01:42:26.089 --> 01:42:27.979
side of the political spectrum there's

01:42:27.979 --> 01:42:28.939
some people that are very good at

01:42:28.939 --> 01:42:31.129
engaging and I think that's and they

01:42:31.129 --> 01:42:33.169
have the tolerance to do it but then I

01:42:33.169 --> 01:42:34.579
think in the other side there's just

01:42:34.579 --> 01:42:36.889
like hey make your position more

01:42:36.889 --> 01:42:38.659
palatable to everybody else just go be

01:42:38.659 --> 01:42:40.639
you would you yeah what you're doing and

01:42:40.639 --> 01:42:42.739
I think that that's I would have no

01:42:42.739 --> 01:42:45.319
tolerance to actually engage the what

01:42:45.319 --> 01:42:47.929
was funny is gnome brought down just a

01:42:47.929 --> 01:42:49.729
black comic to also talk to him and

01:42:49.729 --> 01:42:51.949
every time the black comic spoke to Seth

01:42:51.949 --> 01:42:54.889
he was like absolutely and then would go

01:42:54.889 --> 01:42:56.569
and if anybody else talked to him it was

01:42:56.569 --> 01:43:01.010
like you are wild that's my school yeah

01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:02.329
don't literally be you'll be talking

01:43:02.329 --> 01:43:03.619
about something and then notice like a

01:43:03.619 --> 01:43:04.999
black person will say something and

01:43:04.999 --> 01:43:07.309
they're like see that's that's one

01:43:07.309 --> 01:43:08.989
[ __ ] person yeah that's the weird

01:43:08.989 --> 01:43:10.459
thing with Allied dome it's like when

01:43:10.459 --> 01:43:12.109
they're like you have to be an ally it's

01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:14.539
like so you're telling me I need to just

01:43:14.539 --> 01:43:16.099
be like a total Cinco fan to like

01:43:16.099 --> 01:43:18.169
whatever population just be like it's

01:43:18.169 --> 01:43:20.599
just it's a instead of a negative bias

01:43:20.599 --> 01:43:22.399
it's a positive bias so you're just like

01:43:22.399 --> 01:43:24.109
yeah I believe all XY and Z and it's

01:43:24.109 --> 01:43:25.069
like I don't think that helps people

01:43:25.069 --> 01:43:27.379
yeah everyone were being like yo Matt oh

01:43:27.379 --> 01:43:29.179
if I was like dude [ __ ] in this

01:43:29.179 --> 01:43:30.889
happen they're like oh dude [ __ ] it's

01:43:30.889 --> 01:43:32.719
not your fault bro everyone was doing

01:43:32.719 --> 01:43:34.249
that around me I'd be like yeah it

01:43:34.249 --> 01:43:36.079
wouldn't help me it would not help me to

01:43:36.079 --> 01:43:38.629
have people just positively by us to be

01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:41.389
like I just don't want Matt's wrath I

01:43:41.389 --> 01:43:43.219
don't want to be perceived negatively by

01:43:43.219 --> 01:43:44.629
Matt therefore I'll agree with whatever

01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:46.339
the [ __ ] he says no matter what it does

01:43:46.339 --> 01:43:48.469
not it's not a real thing yeah it's not

01:43:48.469 --> 01:43:50.269
something to actually help people that's

01:43:50.269 --> 01:43:51.529
what an ally is you're supposed to be

01:43:51.529 --> 01:43:53.419
like I just believe anytime a new story

01:43:53.419 --> 01:43:55.069
hits you're like I already know what I'm

01:43:55.069 --> 01:43:56.569
thinking because there's a group of

01:43:56.569 --> 01:43:58.489
people I want to appease very badly

01:43:58.489 --> 01:44:00.439
therefore here's my thought and it's

01:44:00.439 --> 01:44:03.409
like okay same thing when like a young

01:44:03.409 --> 01:44:04.760
black kid gets shot and there's a whole

01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:06.109
other group of people who are like he

01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:09.229
was a thug really he was not a thought

01:44:09.229 --> 01:44:12.739
show us the rest of the footage he was

01:44:12.739 --> 01:44:14.269
doing before that you should be mouths

01:44:14.269 --> 01:44:15.019
and all

01:44:15.019 --> 01:44:16.579
it's the opposite ideas like will rather

01:44:16.579 --> 01:44:18.559
be negative mean automatically negative

01:44:18.559 --> 01:44:20.119
I'm gonna be automatically positive yeah

01:44:20.119 --> 01:44:22.159
so can try to help it either yeah

01:44:22.159 --> 01:44:24.349
so I agree look it's all about the

01:44:24.349 --> 01:44:26.090
conscious manipulation of reality dude

01:44:26.090 --> 01:44:28.909
you have to assume your godly powers and

01:44:28.909 --> 01:44:30.139
just be out there and swirling in the

01:44:30.139 --> 01:44:31.730
chaos is all you can do if you're not

01:44:31.730 --> 01:44:32.929
doing that you're bullshitting bro

01:44:32.929 --> 01:44:35.239
you're not confronting reality head-on

01:44:35.239 --> 01:44:37.579
and thinking for yourself you're out of

01:44:37.579 --> 01:44:40.070
the [ __ ] way your move over

01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:44.960
