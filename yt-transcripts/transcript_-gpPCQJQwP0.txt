a little postgame conversation dude

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.510
we're sitting here with the cameras like

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.509
to wrap it up how do you feel it that

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:07.740
was good how do you feel I think we're

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.809
on the verge of something big yeah I

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.790
think these cams they [ __ ] suck that

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.519
episode they did indeed I so I just I do

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.680
it I do kind of enjoy how you have a

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.430
another dimension to obsess over I did

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.680
yeah well you do imagine watching your

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.119
playback and like I'm not gonna watch

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.019

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.820
one cuz that's yeah yeah just watching

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.160
and it's like I hate the face I make

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.079
when other people are talking to me why

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.120
I can't hide my face and [ __ ] so like

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.059
when you started googling Sasha strokes

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.100
I was like I know well that's that's

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.989

I can do better I could have made that

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.359
episode I got that's that's a good at

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.909
that's a champions attitude but I'm glad

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.090
we had to delete the first episode and I

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.170

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.430
[ __ ] on it was shitty they were

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.960

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.200
I don't to be like this is bad true it

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.200
is corny it sucks yeah I'm I just

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.640
started there and I'm gonna be like hey

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.920
we should [ __ ] delete that cuz it's

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.610
embarrassing

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.939
yeah tell him or just [ __ ] take your

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.920
money you know to where it's like the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.270
sketches are were and we're good no you

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.860
know what the [ __ ] you know what I mean

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.950
that's some like it's weird now because

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.240
we're transitioning from late just

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.710
people's random youtube channel so like

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.299
then because they'll become Network so

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.820
you know more or less so it's like so if

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.079
you're on ABC and one of this a couple

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.520
of shows suck but I get it the whole

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.520
network has slanted in a certain way you

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.020
know if this was

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.590
slanted to the left I would be fine yeah

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.540
it's slanted to the right so now I'm

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.760
actually like you're not see I'm worried

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.430
about my [ __ ] career yeah you know I

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.710
don't think I'm genuinely I I don't

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.090
think it is but it's something I care

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.450
about so much that like it's a risk I

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.370
hear you dude every once well I'm like

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.660
if the world ends I'm not gonna be able

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.520
to do like if if there's a war I can't

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.650
do stand-up like I get worried about

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.260
losing standup reduced in dude that's

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.700
yeah I literally sometime when I hear

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.710
about financial collapse I'm like yes

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.170
yeah let's go dude it's riding a horse

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.850
the trash can lid dude I'm like this is

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.850
gonna be fun the [ __ ] sword or just

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.590
like stock pot I like the stock fun

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.820
I mean I've talked about this before but

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.320
it's like I get stoked on that kind of

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.920
[ __ ] I'm kind of an apocalypse ed I mean

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.450
I don't want it to occur but if it did

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.250
you know I make them I'd make the most

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.970
of it yeah I I would hate it I mean I

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.410
was looking suck ass the apocalypse yes

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.430
everything would shut down nothing would

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.890
work I know it would just blow yeah but

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.340
if he you know thanks New York future

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.850
due to be tight so I mean it's a third

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.209
world country I'm scribing you could get

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.740
a horse and a shield yeah true live in

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.560
[ __ ] central Africa that's true but

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.480
um yeah this show is I would take two

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.920
[ __ ] money of course I know I mean

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.090
I've thought about it and I'm taking the

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.090
money and I think we can me and John can

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.920
make it good I mean first sketch we did

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.290
was good I'll probably agree to to like

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.350
if he did it get more views and other

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.000
ones it's just it kind of million views

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.020
in threes I didn't know how many they're

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.120
getting me how many really yeah the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.040
other ones suck in one video they made

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.130
was funny it was like this old dude that

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.750
like played the national anthem in the

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.610
office I mean everyone stand up and then

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:06.690
there's a dude across the hall that

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.620
wasn't standing up yeah he was like yeah

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.000
yeah close-ups on his face where he's

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.010
like stand the [ __ ] up easy man [ __ ]

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.330
coward then he walks over the guys in a

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.650
wheelchair yeah he was like I'm sorry

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.590
that was Ben

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.730
once you say you're out to make

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.760
conservative humor kind of started like

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.980
it's hard if you're pumping that out all

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.530
the time if you just do what's funny to

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.490
you you know what I mean that's a whole

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.450
different thing and that's another thing

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.880
I'm worried about is if we do what's

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.490
funny and it makes fun of the right are

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.400
they gonna let us do it they should and

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.650
that's what I mean that's what let's try

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.360
to be neutral you got yeah and you're at

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.000
least slightly right leaning not all the

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.010
way to like or just do you want you

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.600
things funny and if it falls on the

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.770
right it falls on the right if it makes

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.030
one of those people makes me but if they

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.950
have it this is a show that's electro

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.080
designed to be right-wing yeah true true

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.300
but I feel like a Daily Show put out a

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.250
sketch making fun of the left like hard

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.830
yeah they wouldn't know they were never

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.750
all you gotta do is funny all you have

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.520
to do is man you dude are you about

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.870
[ __ ] free speech or what they're

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.820

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.130
I've ever seen in my life

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.320

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.039
fight I never wanted well this is the

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:22.930
place also that thrives on the most

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.720
dense of politics you know what I mean

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.060

know but it's enough that like that was

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.930
exactly what I was afraid of was hmm

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.790
people were taking it and being like

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.210
you're normalizing racism and like

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.089
you're normalizing [ __ ] with the

00:09:15.089 --> 00:09:17.490
press and like it's like no dude my

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.740
character is a trump supporter who's a

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.380
[ __ ] [ __ ] yes and did something good

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.640
and the press is trying to

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.480
sensationalize it and and when when did

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.920
the Liberals all of a sudden get so

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.810
beholden to the press it's like in the

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.700
1960s or like don't trust anything the

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.810
process now they're like you should

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.570
respect the press like and [ __ ] Obama

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.490
was trying to arrest journalists that

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.690
was going on the whole time using the

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.600
presidency so it's like dude you can

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.850
[ __ ] forget about that [ __ ] I just

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.589
that whole thing of like then become

00:09:46.589 --> 00:09:48.900
they just read the [ __ ] paper and go

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.270
like yes and that that's all the thought

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.940
that goes into it cuz it's like yeah you

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.040
know the press is an important machine

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.850
it has abused information for sure does

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.190
it yes yeah but is there journalists who

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.690
are there journalist who are good yes

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.540
yeah but it's like to be like to make

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.339
fun of the news and call out the ones

00:10:08.339 --> 00:10:11.790
