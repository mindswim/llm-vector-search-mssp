00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.210
das sled - I got a suit a little mini da

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.790

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.010
hard right I got a little insight into

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.490
the dossier dude bro who slid it I mean

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.170

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.140
good dog dude it's a great dog he

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.990
apparently dude dude it's so funny the

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.810
parallels between like like the large

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.400
political structure and then this little

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.440
you give this little [ __ ] group of

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.780
people a little bit of power basically

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.000
so if someone obviously found the cast

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.190
right headlines trip to [ __ ]

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.140
someone's alerts if someone was on

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.120
Twitter and was like so then they

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.870
[ __ ] made in so there we had this we

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.240
had like a student like geez call like

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.770
the graduates - I figured the [ __ ] it's

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.570
called but it's some sort of student

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.180
council type set up with [ __ ] adults

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.800
which is hilarious yeah being a student

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.210
council in college means you're

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.160

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.520
whistle blowers part of the council I

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.370

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.050
so he's in the council so the members of

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.980
the council and that there's the

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.540
president sitting at the top and there's

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.590

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.350
young girl she's cool she's like the

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.790
Pres the price is cool never had a

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.980
problem with the press the press is a

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.860

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.800
somebody from the student council thing

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.700
[ __ ] found it crafted a confidential

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.610
document to bypass the rest of the

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.520
[ __ ] student council body and go

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.560

creating factions it's awesome I mean

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.170
that they're built for [ __ ] political

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.600
extremism of course so it was so [ __ ]

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.190

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.660
top secret Doug funnie document like

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.060
envelope sitting out in crayon

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.550
don't listen confidential

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.380
they're like no no this is a confident

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.790
literally said confidential on the spot

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.700
yeah on the [ __ ] it was a Dutch oh

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.290
they permitted it from when I heard I

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.610
think was a printed confidential

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.230
document that's what I'm hearing on

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.060
that's what I'm hearing somebody

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.610
actually slid a Doss I think I mean

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.080
that's that's what I'm getting so as a

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.520
journalist I out like I said this is the

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.919
[ __ ] print something out that's over the

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.780
like under the age of 50 I mean I've

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.070
said that a hundred times in terms of

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.750
like top-secret CIA I might give this

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.610
yeah these are top-secret documents why

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.200
the [ __ ] are they printing these things

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.380
well nowadays that make sense to print

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.060
versus keeping it online I guess back

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.540
then to like you all I guess now tell

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.430
your friends your secret yeah they don't

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.990
write it down well they even like what

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.850
the MKULTRA [ __ ] it's like why are they

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.350
why would they write this but again at

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.669
the time they're probably like you said

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:25.440
they were like they didn't think the

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.910
internet would really come out although

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:27.900
they probably knew about the internet

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.020
like 50 years ago be either way they

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.120
created the das dude and the das [ __ ]

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.190
apparently and then like I'll see these

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.870

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.460
different process dude yeah gonna be

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:15.570
about that life to have a sacred

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:17.730
conversation I had last night with a

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.660
comic that disagrees with us Oh

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.630
basically the they're like I know you're

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:28.920
not a bad person but I think that your

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.320
listeners don't know that and some of

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.110
your listeners take it too far and like

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.270
have you seen the reddit or like online

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.640
or all this stuff and I'm like so I

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.190
create content and then I'm responsible

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:42.570
for the YouTube comments

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:45.420
how you think this works yeah how you

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.220
think creating [ __ ] works that I'm

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.180
responsible now for the comments online

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.890
for something I've made what are we

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:54.570
[ __ ] pastors how would that be

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:55.080
possible

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.310
we sick actually yeah that's [ __ ]

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:59.580
that's that's the argument now that's

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.470
one of the arguments especially the

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.110
local people I've had this conversation

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:06.410
with local people yeah that are that

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.790
publicly came out against us of course

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.459
is that they know we're not bad people

00:17:11.459 --> 00:17:15.089
but they're afraid that we kind of stoke

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:17.069
the flames of hate so why isn't that

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:18.689
that why is that not their public take

00:17:18.689 --> 00:17:21.179
on the situation because they need to

00:17:21.179 --> 00:17:24.329
stoke the flames of righteousness we

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:26.579
disagree we disavow his racism and

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:28.620
homophobia well it was all very personal

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.240
stories they're telling about you in -

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.310
yeah yeah a lot of made-up personal

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.800
stories yeah what are they talking about

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.880
well we know you're not a bad person

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.410
they go into public forums and say

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.420
literally quite literally

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.400
make accusations to convey that you are

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.650
in fact a bad person oh this was a great

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:46.950
line this is crazy bro yeah so we were

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:48.810
talking about like all these things and

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:51.150
I was like there was one girl who

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:55.020
literally said I called her a sand

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.510
n-word yes she tweeted that and I was

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.880
like I would [ __ ] never say that I

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.780
would never say I don't say that sure

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.310
it's just not in my I don't I don't know

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.350
it's not a roll off the tongue I don't

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:09.360
know utility belt I don't like that one

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.590
for you yeah but I was like I would

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.360
definitely never call like it I would

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.040
never say that that's [ __ ] sane and

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.390
the person I was talking to was like

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.340
yeah I didn't think that sounded like

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.080
you I thought that was kind of crazy and

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.580
I was like well what about that person's

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:21.990
accountability who said that

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.300
where did they will they ever be held

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:26.580
accountable for coming out [ __ ]

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.500
tweeting while I'm going through a

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.470
[ __ ] national shitstorm for sure a

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.120
local comic coming out and just being

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.280
like well not a [ __ ] comic but coming

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.750

it's like holy [ __ ] yeah man what are

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:41.820
you doing and then the person I was to

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.110
having this conversation with was like

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:46.590
well I'll [ __ ] I'm trying to remember

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.920
how she worded it it was like oh if it's

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.240
just because she didn't tell the truth

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.670
doesn't mean she was lying that's what

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:56.040
they [ __ ] said to me just because she

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.720
didn't tell the truth doesn't mean she

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.220
was lying she was like maybe it was

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.540
somebody else and she thought it was you

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.430
that had said that to her so I mean

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:03.890
maybe she wasn't lying and I was like

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:07.080
this is baffling this is crazy that we

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.590
have to talk like this yeah so I can

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.090
just come out and be like you called me

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:15.390
the n-word yeah exactly like well I

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:16.560
wasn't lying

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.570
we're not the big holy [ __ ] I yeah my

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.040
bad on that yeah yeah I'm telling you

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.140
these are they're trying to push their

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.510
little thing she saw an opening thought

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:27.030
she could go viral awesome [ __ ] yes all

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:28.770
it is these are these aren't people if

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.690
they were really really truly concerned

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.550
with the welfare of humanity oh and now

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:34.140
there was a particular what other [ __ ]

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.030
is pretty funny cuz I had the same

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:37.530
conversation with somebody else about it

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.560
and that person was like well I don't

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.780
remember you I just remember you and

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.820
like or people like in your orbit kind

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.850
of bullying her online like on Facebook

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.370
or something what's your orbit and he

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.320
was like I the I was like did you see me

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.130
call her the end

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:55.110
word yeah Facebook is out what you're

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.640
trying to say he was like no I just

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.590
remember it was something like you kept

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.170
calling her a white woman and I was like

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:02.550
it's cool yeah yeah yeah I definitely

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:05.400
called her that yes yes I was joking

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.170
with the opposite I was making fun of it

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:11.040
because in my opinion at the time her

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.600
entire identity was wrapped around the

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.240
fact that she was of Middle Eastern

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.010
descent yeah I was like you're a white

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:21.750
lady shut up that's the opposite

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:22.200
actually

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.150
I was really pointing out if you want to

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:25.830
be honest about it the fact that she

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.660
does in fact indulge in white privilege

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:31.350
and also gets to double dip into the

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.630
world of I'm also oppressed yeah I

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:35.340
pointed out that hey based on your

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.560
appearance I think you might have some

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.110
white privilege so maybe stop claiming

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.420
victimhood while also reaping the

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.150
benefits of white white privilege

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.740
because that is a double standard that I

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.690
don't like yeah so that's what I was

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:50.280
calling her a white lady for some other

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.340
[ __ ] [ __ ] well well that you

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.760
called the n-word dude yeah yeah yeah

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.360
the n-word

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.290
I was like you're a white lady yeah and

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:02.610
they were like well I think I remember

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:04.110
you called her a white lady it's like

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:06.300
yes I did do that definitely did not

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.180
call her a sand n-word yeah you [ __ ]

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:13.710
psychos yeah but that's the world of

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:17.310

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.670
people start creeping up to that old

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.130
thirty year old mark and you start

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:37.890
looking around the old open mike yeah I

called me the n-word yeah that's that is

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.480
in saying there's there's no there's no

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.220
recourse for it there's no anything of

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.750
course no recourse for that does it was

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:52.980
they never you know is it there maybe

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.140
she wasn't lying or just because she

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.400

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.370
goes off in the Clinton body

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:32.370
whoa overall like we were talking about

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:33.900
all this stuff in the press and you know

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.030
but what I was telling them on my food

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.290
the left

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.510
you know the quote-unquote left it is an

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:41.940
offshoot of the right which is like the

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.250
the impulse through like to create

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:46.860
economic machinery military people

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.590
typically call fascism the left doesn't

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:51.780
stand alone by itself if that makes

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:52.790
sense

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:54.480
you understand what I'm saying these

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.740
people are like I'm from the left and it

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:57.780
like if you think about it realistically

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:00.750
it's like it can only offshoot off of a

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.400
gigantic economic machine which

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.180
typically stems from yeah you know

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.310
economic machinery that comes from

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.990
whatever people it's or eclis it's been

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:14.400
conquest okay you know I'm saying so

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.370
waiting start over so quickly so we're

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:19.890
synched I'm just saying that when people

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:21.010
talk about the left first

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:23.350
it's not really a left verse right it's

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:25.390
just like if the right quote unquote or

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.670
to collapse say like the conservative

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:29.140
economic machinery that [ __ ] everybody

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.630
hates the left would [ __ ] shrivel you

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:33.160
know it's like the idea of social safety

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.620
nets all this stuff it only exists in an

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.390
area and something that can create

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:40.030
abundance yeah so so you'd all these

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:41.740
whiny crybabies and it was they're just

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.120
so out of touch with like the actual

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.430
struggle against nature and like

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:47.140
securing like housing and all this stuff

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.060
they go into this weird [ __ ] almost

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.650
like a hallucination like delusion kind

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:52.720
of thing which is good in order to

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.460
navigate the space create it now it's

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:56.020
like you do need to left but they're

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.400
like we are our own thing and we're

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:00.040
gonna break away it's like ya know well

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.690
you you can't I spent like especially

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:03.280
like the people's lifeforce being like

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.870
they're like satisfying their own

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:07.330
creative impulses once you shut down

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:08.770
people's ability to do that like they

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:10.210
say like with communism like we all get

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:11.350
the same amount of stuff no matter what

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.450
it's like that kind of I could be like

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:14.560
that would be cool if I'd never do

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:15.910
anything but people are gonna freak out

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:16.930
because if you go show up everyday

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:18.160
everyone's wearing the same gray sweat

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.270
suit or even you know you wear whatever

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:21.100
you want yeah it's like it just really

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:23.460
doesn't [ __ ] work yeah the same way

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.590
brutal dictatorship doesn't work tell

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:29.230
that to my [ __ ] Islanders bro who the

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:36.550
Tropic O's true that this isn't a thing

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:38.140
that can break away this is you in the

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.330
lift driver this is awesome it was this

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.040
the lift driver you that broke this out

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.930
this is me isn't my own you hit the lift

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:45.550
driver with I hit him with this how did

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:48.580
he feel one star now he was digging it

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.380
he was did I'm telling you like I don't

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:53.140
understand how he was actually talking

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.600
about how anti-fog like the same tactic

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.450
as Nazi youth of like she's like shout

00:25:58.450 --> 00:25:59.800
it he's got his brown shirting shouting

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:00.910
it out in the Senators and be like you

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:02.350
can't say that you can't say that over

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:04.000
there so we're just talking about that

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.110
and I was like yeah it is funny though

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:07.420
because like in the reality of the

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.760
situation in terms of like if the

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.610
economy were to collapse show me those

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:15.070
people who are still hardcore you know

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.340
like still pushing that same [ __ ]

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.870
whereas like a slight perturbance and

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.520
their little stand-up scene causes them

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.380
to slightly capitulate to you being like

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.790
well i don't think it's you necessarily

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:27.010
you understand I'm saying yeah like

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:28.420
there's a duplicity there's like they're

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.980
so duplicity the whole thing where it's

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:31.600
like there's talking all the [ __ ] and

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.760
they see you and they're like now

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.900
they're saying something different

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.790
which one you believe you if you really

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:39.370
are like I'm so fired up on justice for

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:41.110
all and then they see you and they're

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:43.270
not like [ __ ] you dude like if you were

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:45.940
a rapist yeah like if you're like say

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.760
you like a child molester yeah I would

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.560
be like [ __ ] you you're a [ __ ] child

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.870
molester I go on social change the

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:55.360
[ __ ] doubt it you don't think I want

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.490
you at rot if your cholo bruh

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.800

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.400
the football program he would jam to

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:37.150
pieces if you're really about something

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:38.830
that's what I'm saying like if your mom

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:41.890
was about it bout it dude he was no he

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:43.960

let pederasty you go say that yeah Joe

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:50.980
Pye practiced what he preached

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.740

Joe Pauly these guys claim to be about

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:11.980
social justice and then again when they

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.050
see you and they're like what's really

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:15.760
funny about it is there's like one kid

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.330
particularly well he's a grown man kid

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:22.930
yeah he's a very grown man he's an adult

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:25.060
that she's still like I'm at the open

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:31.210
mic I told on him but uh he he came out

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:32.500
with like a big thing like

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.710
three-paragraph thing talking [ __ ] some

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:38.290
story about me outing my friends

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:41.530
sexuality on stage yeah actually he

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:43.570
didn't say it was my friend host I sure

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:47.770
regardless or goes he never said [ __ ]

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:48.360
before

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.620
until the SNL thing and then he tweeted

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.940
that out and now he now it's a big

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.430
problem but last like and so last night

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:55.690
when I saw him I was just like [ __ ] I'm

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:57.580
not even literally I'm not gonna talk to

00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:59.800
this person at all and I'm sure he felt

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.050
the same way but before that I didn't

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:03.580
know that's how he felt and I would have

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:04.750
been like hey what's up man and he would

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:07.480
be like hey and that would it like yeah

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:13.030
so I don't know it's it's but why why

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:14.650
were they quiet about that in the first

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:16.480
place they feel as if you pose some sort

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.580
of threat to like their comedy career

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:22.150
they felt it was necessary when I got a

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:24.700
platform that big that they felt that

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.250
they needed to tell everybody that here

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:28.930
were some transgressions we remember

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:32.740
from an open mic in 2016 that I remember

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.910
not even that like you want stage comedy

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:39.340

doing comedy yeah he's in the crowd and

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:43.960

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.780
this forever and then in 2019 I'm gonna

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.570

mary book search histories wouldn't help

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:50.330
me right now I searched the lady who did

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:51.740
you see that racist lady against the

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:54.740
Asian no oh my god dude it's so [ __ ]

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:56.420
funny well should be I mean right so

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.220
people are gonna be like it's not funny

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:00.490
it's hard this is why it's funny okay

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:02.990
there's a lady this white lady who

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:05.960
parked over the line like like three

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.090
feet over the parking spot line sure

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:09.260
and then there's Asian ladies like

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.600
filming the argument and the white lady

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.730
is so [ __ ] who's arguing the white

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:15.050
lady the white lady in the asian lady

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:17.210
are arguing and she's filming the asian

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:20.750
lady's car is backed up and because the

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:22.280
white lady's car is parked so far over

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.020
the line in the parking spot it's like

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:26.180
[ __ ] up her spot and the white

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:27.920
argument and so they're just classic

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.570
argument it's hard enough it's already

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:31.940
hard enough from it's already hard she's

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:33.920
trying to pull in now there's a barrier

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.109
yeah someone's in her designated lines

00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:37.609
exactly and the white lady's in the

00:41:37.609 --> 00:41:39.440
lines and the white lady's like oh shut

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.700
up so you're saying it's wrong for a

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:42.260
white lady to make it extra hard for an

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:44.570
Asian lady to park is that what you're

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:45.800
saying no that's not the point of this

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.630
that's not why it's funny but that is a

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:49.190
funny angle it's not funny I'm saying

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:51.020
you're I'm trying to get what you're

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:51.320
saying

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.150
it is funny no what's funny is just the

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:54.440
way the white lady reacts she said oh

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:57.200
[ __ ] you you can't even drive she

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.300
reacted that way she does dude she goes

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.330
straight to racism and it's

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:06.020
Oh ooh get out of here we don't even

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:09.380

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.420
[ __ ] you gotta watch it it's great

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:13.220

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:16.760

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.800

you what the lady say when she the lady

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.290
films from the very beachy ghosts in the

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:26.300
very beginning like hey yeah yeah she's

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:29.990
like hello you are in my spot I mean

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:32.270
dude if someone came up to my window

00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:34.310
filming me they might get the worse side

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:36.800
of me I mean I probably wouldn't I'm

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.150
obviously that's not I'm not gonna hit

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:39.500
something with that I did get the [ __ ]

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:42.080
away from my car are we allowed to

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.060
repeat racial slurs that we just saw I

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:45.890
don't know it's a patreon bro everything

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:48.680
you want so the but no I'm saying if

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.099

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:08.690
on like the board somewhere I people saw

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:15.260
the lady yeah that well you know what

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.240
sucks - it's like and this is something

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.040
I've been dealing with - it's like damn

they got her names of course she blue

00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:25.580

00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:27.680
raspberries I don't know if I should

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:31.180
play this it's pretty it's pretty Brooke

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:42.800
impression sucks he'll it's uh she blew

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:45.589
her she went she did that she's an adult

00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:47.690
who did that as a reverse very drunk

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:50.630
dude it sounds like an old drunk lady

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:53.300
she she's hopping in like her Honda

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:56.089
Civic it's lady's hammered bro thinks

00:43:56.089 --> 00:43:57.500
she's MC hammered I think she's MC

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.900
hammered that's like it that sounds like

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:02.540
an old drunk lady you like [ __ ] yeah

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:05.810
[ __ ] yeah yeah I mean again or she's

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:08.780
just a [ __ ] psycho yeah my crazy love

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.359
you unhinge psycho see you she went yeah

00:44:11.359 --> 00:44:14.000
cause she over parked like

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.080
that argument is or is weird though yeah

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.760
taking your camera out right away and

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:20.750
just because I'm saying

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:22.070
you parked over the line that's why I'm

00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:24.170
skeptical that lady kind of freaked out

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:26.120
also that's why I'm see if someone came

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.890
up like this like excuse me over line I

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:31.580
did get the [ __ ] away from open my door

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:32.900
and how it would bother me a lot I did

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.460
probably open my door again now that I

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:35.600
know I have [ __ ] anger issues I

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.920
probably oh we don't need to weaken how

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.570
much time we have 15 minutes this is

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:43.220
this is something that was making me

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:45.260
laugh dude well first of all I should

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:50.060
have never played dude it's that is

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:54.560
funny I know the reason I brought it up

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.330
was because if that was if we released

00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:57.980
everybody's little recent searches I

00:44:57.980 --> 00:44:59.510
like watch that this morning like I

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:03.890
searched well the problem and here's the

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:06.350
problem it's do we want to go down the

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:08.990
realm of constructing false selves to

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:10.250
interact with each other with which

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:12.110
we'll obviously fall apart and create a

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:14.330
bunch of neuroses or do we allow people

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:17.540
to express themselves genuinely and then

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.490
have other people say genuinely like hey

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:21.920
what you're doing sucks here's why I

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.510
think it is and you can say well here's

00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:25.040
what we're doing and then you can have

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.630
it out that way is to genuine people

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:28.940
rather as people who are like operating

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:31.100
under partial [ __ ] false selves and

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:33.350
people who are like using thing it's

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:35.600
just it's not a good route to go it's a

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:36.950
bad way to [ __ ] do it and I'm

00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:39.860
watching this in action people having to

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:41.840
kind of like and again it's that just

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.550
because you're like [ __ ] around and

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:44.630
it's like all we're saying [ __ ] that

00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:46.850
people don't like just because you do

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:49.070
that it's like if you're gonna make oh

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:51.020
that is synonymous with a bad person

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:53.620
it's like okay yeah this is weird

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.880
sure so it's like do you want to go the

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.350
route of sit fall selves or do you want

00:45:57.350 --> 00:45:59.030
to go people being genuine and open and

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:00.680
then leaving it up to that person is

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.930
real we're just real dogs so I'm trying

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:05.720
to say there's too many cats not enough

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:08.150
dogs but it's it's a bad if this is like

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:09.710
they're tryna this is a prescription for

00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:11.300
people as a whole that trying to put out

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.760
to basically be like no you were but

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.560
combating racism by saying you by your

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.510
skin color are inherently evil blah blah

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:19.550
it's like it's just a bad [ __ ] way to

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:22.010
go I agree it's like a it's a it's not

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:24.110
going to work if you're truly combating

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:26.140
racism but if I were to be like I'm

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:27.540
combating

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:29.790
you know whatever bite is going around

00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:31.320
and like it be I give and be like all

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:32.790
right I'm gonna go combat inner-city

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:35.550
poverty by going and pointing out and be

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:37.500
like what the [ __ ] is that what the [ __ ]

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.360
are you guys this is [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.730
they bet get the [ __ ] out of here

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:43.890
so either way [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:46.650
but what this search is a search history

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:49.200
things making me laugh the search

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:54.120
history is making me laugh because we

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.070
did a Douglas Mary book and he was

00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:58.800
talking about he goes through like all

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.630
the different points of oppression and

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:03.480
he was talking about homosexuality and

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:04.860
he was like it's weird because he was

00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:07.530
like it's a weird point of identity to

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:09.390
be that guy okay and obviously it wasn't

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:11.880
their choice it wasn't them who were

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.110
like I guess what I'm gay people like

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:15.780
you're [ __ ] gay but it is funny

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:18.330
thinking about if heterosexuals had to

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:20.340
identify by their internet search

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:23.750
history mmm as their whole identity I

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:30.060
don't think you would be very hetero but

00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:31.950
it's also like I would identify some

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:35.280
yeah it'd be a weird so for some reason

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.620
these peoples whole identities build

00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:39.120
around their mind would be like here I

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:45.420
say sexual picadillo stuck incest gay

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:48.030
people stuck incest guys I'd be a stuck

00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:51.450
in I don't know I don't know how me and

00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:53.580
my mom would deal with that that's what

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.290
I'm saying if everyone had to face their

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:57.690
life if you had to live by your search

00:47:57.690 --> 00:47:58.920
history that's what he's saying and

00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:00.930
that's where I was last after or you

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:02.190
could just be like what are you but I

00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:03.630
cried to leave it my whole identity this

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:05.520
morning dude

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.880
but yeah mine yeah it's just like people

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.440
are living by their entire their online

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:12.450
identity I know I am

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:15.090
what do you mean that [ __ ] is your real

00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:17.130
identity that's basically being like

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:20.730
you're gay therefore [ __ ] you ba ba ba

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:22.230
ba ba ba yeah there's really they're

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:24.720
like here's we don't agree with we solve

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:27.900
yours so [ __ ] you yeah or just like we

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:30.510
don't agree with how you relate it it's

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:32.610
like you know maybe if you you know if

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:34.830
you think [ __ ] like if you think weird

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:36.540
shits funny or [ __ ] that people think is

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:39.000
bad is funny if you think I'm the fabu

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.650
subjects are funny that's what I'm

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:41.400
saying

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:44.100
maybe you do comedy why do you think

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:46.110
taboo subjects are funny because they're

00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:47.880
uncomfortable just tickles it just it's

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.380

literally the humorless

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:33.720
that's the humorless Ness the degree of

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.490
humor lessness we're dealing with people

00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:37.590
thought they projected what they want

00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:38.970

us on that show somebody this is what

00:50:58.580 --> 00:50:59.990
brought me to it was I was on the reddit

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:01.100
and somebody was like mother nature

00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:03.140

00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:07.369
funny who's really funny she's saying

00:51:07.369 --> 00:51:08.300
that's what white boy is that what you

00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:10.369
said white boys last night no I hadn't

00:51:10.369 --> 00:51:11.900
watched it yet okay I was calm white

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:12.410
boys

00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:14.590
I was calling them white boys because

00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:17.510
that's what remember when uh when Black

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:20.140
Panther came out it's like I saw a young

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:22.400
african-american kids taking pictures

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:24.920
with the Black Panther poster and it

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:26.990
felt nice to see that representative so

00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:29.260
like when I saw those young white boys

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:31.369
taking pictures and from the Joker

00:51:31.369 --> 00:51:33.470
poster I felt like wow we talked about

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:35.180
that last time how the Joker's white

00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:37.250
Black Panther yes I told Charles that

00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:39.440
when I got to when I got to heal me was

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.290
like dude mckusker called because you're

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:44.210
called Joker the white the white men's

00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:47.240
black Fayette there's the white in cells

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:50.240
black it's true that finally for sure

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.010
finally some representation dude of us

00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:53.960
twisted bros I'm like did I just like

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.190
that because of my cultural identity

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:57.650
dude true like I had to like step back

00:51:57.650 --> 00:51:58.160
from it

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.380
I couldn't step back how it's amazing

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:02.840
you got to go see it do you'll be funny

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:04.520
if black people started treating Joker

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.350
the way white people treated like get

00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:10.040
out you have to see it it's the best

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:11.030
movie ever

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:13.820
I give black people started pandering to

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:16.010
that to the Joker I'd be like ten out of

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:17.420
ten it was the best movie of all time

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:19.520
oh so [ __ ] I can't I've never met I

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.380
couldn't it was such a twist at the end

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:22.550
I didn't see that coming

00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:24.770
what is that when white people pretend

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:26.600
to get out was the best movie like again

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:27.710
this is the this is the fall

00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:29.030
self-construction we're dealing with

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:30.740
where it's like what other movie did you

00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:31.820

00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:40.400
out exactly it's like why didn't you

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.040
tweet about that publicly what was there

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.660
nothing to gain there's all the people

00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:46.250
who are like oh my god you just got to

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:47.960

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:50.840
where were you when the departed came

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.730

00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:54.920

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:02.020
that what do you have to gain from that

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:04.369
yeah and then it makes me sound like a

00:53:04.369 --> 00:53:05.809

00:53:20.719 --> 00:53:23.599

00:53:29.359 --> 00:53:31.699
like no yo it wasn't necessary to give a

00:53:31.699 --> 00:53:33.979
standing ovation or like be like you

00:53:50.059 --> 00:53:51.890
social movement that's in my lift driver

00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:53.239
also pointed out he goes think of the

00:53:53.239 --> 00:53:54.979
hippies dude nonconformist what do they

00:53:54.979 --> 00:53:57.859

[ __ ] happens he's like this will blow

00:54:00.979 --> 00:54:02.989
over it's it's a groupthink mentality

00:54:02.989 --> 00:54:05.089
they all do this they freak out they all

00:54:05.089 --> 00:54:07.309
kind of like you know coalesced on the

00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:09.469
one thing every so many years and then

00:54:09.469 --> 00:54:10.969
they breaks up and they find the next

00:54:10.969 --> 00:54:12.499
thing the groupthink into and he's like

00:54:12.499 --> 00:54:15.009
watch this your old path yeah of course

00:54:15.009 --> 00:54:17.839
is what it is [ __ ] Paul Revere's like

00:54:17.839 --> 00:54:19.579
us [ __ ] blazing down just two dudes

00:54:19.579 --> 00:54:22.569
tip of the spear just out here riding

00:54:22.569 --> 00:54:24.979
but they did it saying again my point is

00:54:24.979 --> 00:54:28.009
like how forgiving can you be cuz it's

00:54:28.009 --> 00:54:29.509
like you you've literally and it's not
