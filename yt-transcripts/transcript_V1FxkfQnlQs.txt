WEBVTT

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.879
we're here we're back with the unnamed

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.879
scientist dude a lot of people how

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.040
people were like who is this guy

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.389
that's like dude he's the [ __ ]

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.519
unnamed scientist you can't you know you

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.340
can't just out himself in the scientific

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.800
community and be banished dude no I'd be

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.500
a pariah on the podcast with an

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.789
international racist

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.810
I can't I'm gonna have that associated

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.519
with my name I'm like he's racist of

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.009
Robin you can't have that man and it's a

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.530
I think it adds to the mystique as well

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.690
you could be Neil deGrasse Tyson do for

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.940
all you know I could be the white Neil

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.219
deGrasse Tyson true so so a couple

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.020
updates from the front line first of all

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.610
Matt did you report yourself to public

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.030
health

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.460
are you kovat positive nope nope nope

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.829
not go of it positive I didn't report

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:50.930
myself

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.340
my-my wife was the first one to get sick

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.440
and she tried to call them and they're

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.910
like dude stay home like you don't have

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.190
Co vid sorry

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.140
yeah just based on her symptoms day yeah

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.340
they were just like dude you don't have

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.439
cook they don't come out you're fine

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.200
oh yeah stay home don't pick something

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.520
up belt you know that's something else

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.020
you know I mean if you come to the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.670
clinic you're more likely to get

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.530
something yeah they swab the baby and

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.850
she just has like some sort of like

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.340
nasty nasty cold so that's I think

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.110
that's what we all have like I think my

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.280
wife has a sinus infection from

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.890
allergies I mean I probably did have

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.259
kovin champed it and then the baby just

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.900
since I passed it probably degraded down

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.329
to like metonym a virus whatever exactly

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.640
your bit your baby's immune anyway cuz

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.560
she's a black conservative right exactly

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.810
it's lambs blood on the door dude stops

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.460
and tracks so you know again talk to

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.649
public health if you have questions also

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.640
a quick

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.210
suck my dick to all my enemies here so I

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.390
might be a bit of a [ __ ] but the fact

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.060
is that the the dark running your public

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.180
health unit is also a bit of a [ __ ] so

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.920
this is this is sort of the level of

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.450
intelligence that you guys have to deal

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.909
with okay and if you're gonna talk [ __ ]

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.509
on the reddit do a quick google first

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.520
it's it's especially touchy as relates

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.770
to personal protect

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.370
of equipment so just as a reminder this

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.370
virus is spread by droplets if you're

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.080
hoarding [ __ ] in 95 masks you are

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.160
compromising the health care of

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.260
frontline workers the the procedures

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.500
that aerosolize the virus okay including

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.980
things like intubation are restricted

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.030
and have aerosol precautions but for the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.410
most part surgical masks goggles and

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.050
you're kind of good so here you're Matt

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.610
you were saying your aunt's on the front

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.530
lines

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.510
oh she swab and my question is when you

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.640
just said aerosolizing himself so if I

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.560
sneeze I've been told the sneeze can

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.030
hang it hover in the air for like a

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.250
couple hours is that true no so that's

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.470
not that's not true I mean to the best

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.900
available evidence so this is this is

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.710
CDC and and who guidelines and so

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.880
droplets spread including things like

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.580
sneezing coughing you know who knows

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.170
farting I don't know if farting is an

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.820
aerosol izing body movement but you know

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.440
that's that no that's all producing

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.020
droplets so it's not airborne three

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.470
micron viral particles which we worry

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.560
about with things like for example well

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.770
intubation is what's intubation so that

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.390
that's sticking a tube down someone's

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.350
neck okay so you you know that you have

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.890
pressurized gases in there for the

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.440
particles are prone to to becoming

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.570
aerosolized but you know even in that

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.970
circumstance so for example n95 masks 95

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:05.250
are validated to filter out 95% of I

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.730
believe it's up to three micron is size

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.670
particles okay so even in that setting

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.530
you know unless you're on the [ __ ]

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.049
International Space Station there is

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.390
some susceptibility it's never going to

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.010
be 100% the the article that was making

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.180
the rounds and sort of scare mongering

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.979
was a experimentally induced

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.539
aerosolization of virus which we found

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:39.539
there was viable viral aerosols at the

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.030
three-hour mark but again that was an

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.240
experimentally induced aerosolization it

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.370
was not a [ __ ] sneeze stop hoarding

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.430
the n95 stay the [ __ ] home you know

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.199
don't put frontline workers at risk

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.990
based on misinformation and don't

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.419
propagate it do a quick Google search I

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.729
think they did like a like a simulant

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:00.690
like they did basically like a

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.090
Mythbusters and sent it with some sort

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.229
of they'd like to send it into the air

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.030
but it wasn't a cough and like I'm

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.889
guessing like a breeze would like kind

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.080
of send this stuff kind of scattered

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.820
yeah for sure you know and that's what

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.610
you'd like that's why we're it's helpful

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.330
to remember the two meters or the 6 feet

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.340
you know perimeter but that's not a

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.190
[ __ ] you're not a bubble boy with

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.039
that with that perimeter so there's

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.449
there's all sorts of confound errs and

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:32.550
but a sneeze is not considered an

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.900
aerosol izing event okay so so what

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.400
would what would actually so how people

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.479
get into them is touching their face

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.870
basically yeah so foe might and so if

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.120
you the the virus is viable at even 72

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.300
hours on on surfaces such as like

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.760
stainless steel so you know there's some

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.580
common sense precautions especially when

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.090
you receive your your Amazon delivery to

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.789
leave it for example in the garage a

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:07.320
couple days let the virus die off and go

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.440
from there you know it's it's desperate

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.900
and I you know I'm not here to fear

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.460
monger and we'll get into it a little

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.150
bit but one of the the huge issues is is

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.919
PPE personal protective equipment

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.190
shortages for for frontline dogs and

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.729
nurses and you know it's so desperate at

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:29.400
this stage that people are begging and

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.139
dating things like goggles masks and

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:36.570
giving that you know three a three-day

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.760
window for the virus to die off and then

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.060
reusing them

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.060
damn yeah it's it's [ __ ] I have a

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.910
small bubble bags from making hash I

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.210
might it's at once donated at micron but

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.510
oh my face beekeeper yeah that sucks man

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.500
I've read an article in the Atlantic

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.180
last night about it and they were

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.160
talking about how there's some

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.169
prediction saying like 22 million people

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:02.470
in America are gonna die yeah well I

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.980
think it was 2.2 million yeah yeah and

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.310
that's the the Imperial College model so

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.680
there's a few you know there's there's

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.410
these [ __ ] and God bless them right

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.540
they're doing their job but these ivory

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.290
tower epidemiologists that you know wage

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.150
intellectual war on Twitter you know

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.160
these keyboard warriors with their

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.380
different projections and different

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.130
models and let's let's be aware of the

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.530
error bars right this is all

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.770
hypothetical but yeah it's sort of worst

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.440
case scenario according to the Imperial

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:44.490
College model is that approximately 2.2

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:48.010
million deaths in the states if we were

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.080
to do if if you guys were to do

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.700
absolutely nothing okay

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.770
include log jam from the Haas then

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.450
includes like non covet deaths of people

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.919
who just like can't get to the hospital

00:07:56.919 --> 00:07:59.830
- right well it's it's kovat know and it

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.200
doesn't not its kovat attributable

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.440
deaths so then that does not account for

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.880
externalities which is a huge but that

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.729
doesn't account for the [ __ ] you know

00:08:09.729 --> 00:08:12.550
the small business owner owner that offs

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.860
himself because he didn't get a paycheck

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:20.320
right yeah exactly so know that is co

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.430
vid attributable deaths damn 2.2 million

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.289
they worked up and they were doing

00:08:26.289 --> 00:08:27.880
models before any of this stuff happened

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.780
didn't they they've been like whoa I

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.190
think we're gonna have a pandemic and if

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.620
we did they ran these numbers prior to

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.490
this stuff even hidden yeah well I mean

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.010
I guess there were stars and [ __ ] -

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:42.880
exactly yeah so SARS prompted a lot of

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.360
sort of federal funding for pandemic

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.890
response but that was mostly scrapped

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.490
in 2018 whatever I mean that's a huge

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.530
political discussion and I don't know a

00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:00.930
lot about it but since that time yeah

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.610
there's all these these different models

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.550
that are based on a huge number of

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.870
unknowns the the more recent one that's

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.420
that's had a lot of headline coverage is

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.490
the so called Oxford model and that is

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.790
is looking at herd immunity and the

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.250
headline was you know up to 50 percent

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.520
of the UK may already have had exposure

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.910
to tick Ovid 19 and we simply don't know

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.680
yeah what are they basing that I keep

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.030
see I keep hearing people being like

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.980
dude look 80% of people already have it

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.900
they don't know it's like how do I look

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.390
along with that yeah so it well by

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:42.000
sitting in [ __ ] armchairs you know to

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.090
twiddling their mustachio so that that's

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.010
the thing right is that we just we don't

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.970
have the data to to make these types of

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.350
conclusions and and they're useful and

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.060
they're good sort of thought experiments

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.420
but they're they're not empiric by any

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.040
means so really in order to get at

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.440
exposure the the test that we need so

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.840
you know a little digression here so

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.480
there's there's the PCR test and I'm

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.130
again I'm not trying to nerd out too

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:15.110
hard but that tells us about active

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.600
viral replication in the presence of a

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.310
virus and that's your swab the other

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.500
tests that are coming down the pipe and

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.260
well are commercially available for a

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.980
bro shoot other companies are the

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.290
serology based tests so that will tell

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.320
us whether or not you've been exposed

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.070
recently or in or ever exposed to this

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.450
this virus by looking at your body's

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.840
antibodies generated against kovat 19 so

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.340
that will tell us about historical

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.770
infections and people that have cleared

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.420
the virus and therefore would be swab

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.740
negative right they don't have any

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.050
active replication but they have

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:03.160
evidence of immunity so to get at any

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.940
sort of conclusions as relates to to

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.690
population exposure we need antibody or

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:12.160
serology testing and that's just coming

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.030
down the pipe now

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.130
oh sweet there so that means there

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.020
really have no idea when people say that

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.940
so if anyone says that it's just their

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.890
kind of [ __ ] yeah I think models and

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:22.720
guessing Dan yeah it's [ __ ] little

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:27.370
guys and tight pants so I'm looking at

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.440
the numbers right now it's like China's

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.540
at eighty one thousand cases three about

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.370
three thousand deaths

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.530
Italy's had eighty thousand about now

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:38.290
eight thousand deaths America has had as

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:41.650
many cases almost as Italy with a

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.050
fraction of the deaths so they start

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.060
saying there's gonna be 2.2 million in

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.790
America it's like how yeah yeah no

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.880
that's say how that's with sort of

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.720
totally uncontrolled spread and but it

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.300
I mean it's it's the Atlantic broke that

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.130
like that was on the table the Atlantic

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.380
was like I mean it's either gonna be

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.900
like 2.2 million or you know it won't be

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.490
that bad it's like giving yourself a

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:10.630
pretty wide berth though dude we're all

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.790
doctor well he's just fine yeah nice

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.190
guess it's like yeah it's you know

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.170
millions or a couple hundred a couple

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.090
thousand it's like it's kind of [ __ ]

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.580
yeah America's a burgers got it about G

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.850
of deaths right now not too bad not too

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:26.920
bad and I'd say not bad right now so

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.410
it's like but the the thing everyone's

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:30.580
wondering or at least that's what

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.600
they're saying is like all right well

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.460
this is just a beginning like the next

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.720
two weeks is when people are going to

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.480
start getting [ __ ] absolutely and and

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.070
the other the other thing is that those

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:44.700
data of CO vid attributable deaths are

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:49.870
huge under estimates because the CDC

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.180
data will only be for our swab positive

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.360
patients so that is people that and the

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.150
the number of so even though efforts for

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.720
example in New York City there's so in

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.090
the past eight days there's been more

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.100
testing in New York than there has been

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.500
and South Korea to date for the entire

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.660
country so they're yeah they're ramping

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:16.500
it they're ramping up testing but the

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:21.910
population infection is probably ten to

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.910
a hundred times more than the number of

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.320
positive swaps right so we're only

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.200
getting at a a small fraction and there

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.440
and covet attributable deaths formally

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.209
speaking are people that that swab pause

00:13:34.209 --> 00:13:37.630
that for the virus right and and that

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.899
will be a small small portion games have

00:13:40.899 --> 00:13:42.370
you go you were in New York and get

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:43.480
rushed in the hospital and when you

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.800
can't breathe they're just gonna like

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.089
just they're not even take down a

00:13:46.089 --> 00:13:47.320
swabbie or they're just going to let you

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.070
just kind of so each each public health

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:55.269
unit has its own guidelines know if

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:57.310
you're if you're in sort of you know

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.019
respiratory distress there they're going

00:13:59.019 --> 00:14:03.220
to swab you but you know locally and and

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.300
in in many different jurisdictions

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.910
because we're running out of the the

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:13.450
swabs and the reagents the indications

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:15.610
for testing for kovat or narrowing so

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:19.180
for example in your case you you know

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:23.350
your co vid positive and your your

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:25.779
daughter when she went to the clinic

00:14:25.779 --> 00:14:28.360
with was swab to rule out and they do

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.040
like a panel but one of the things which

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.760
is common sort of influenza RSV more

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.490
common viruses than COBIT if those came

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:37.600
back negative

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:42.880
then they would like likely and in your

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.850
area to covet tests because we're sort

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.940
of rationing scarce resources here so

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.740
that makes sense yeah they did they did

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.870
a total panel of like viruses and stuff

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.750
and it came up that she did have some

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:56.470
[ __ ]

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:59.170
but it wasn't be [ __ ] so yeah we're

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:00.490
pretty pleased I was pretty pleased

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:02.709
about that no I I knew I had a little

00:15:02.709 --> 00:15:04.089
something more than like a little cold

00:15:04.089 --> 00:15:06.339
because I was I was jacked out actually

00:15:06.339 --> 00:15:07.770
I'd be curious what you think about my

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.089
if you listened to the war mode but what

00:15:10.089 --> 00:15:12.430
I did was I induced a fever and myself

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.370
by taking an extremely hot bath and got

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.529
my up 200 degrees and dude I felt better

00:15:17.529 --> 00:15:20.399
the next day man I think I felt good

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:23.199
yeah as we Rogen about that one heat

00:15:23.199 --> 00:15:25.150
shock proteins and

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.089
and and curative saunas I don't know

00:15:28.089 --> 00:15:30.610
like a you know I'm I'm not I don't know

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.920
that the field but I don't know that

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.890
there's a whole lot to support

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:37.540
I mean it's undeniable dude that's what

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.570
your body does as a defense but I

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:41.620
kick-started it before the virus the

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.850
virus was like alright we still have

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:44.950
time before the organic fever and I was

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:47.980
like yeah alright check this out yeah I

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.620
mean hey I'm ready is a great block yeah

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.480
I'm telling you I do feel a little

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.430
better I haven't been sleeping at all -

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.500
which is I don't understand dude like

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.810
before I had a kid if I got like two

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:00.850
5-hour nights of sleep in a row I was

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:02.470
like I kind of felt like I was about to

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.990
get a cold and like I should have just

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.300
like total pneumonia right now second

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.580
sleep for like four hours right it's

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.790
true like yeah and that's like in terms

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:17.230
of protection standard stuff you gotta

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.240
get get a good sleep you know eat

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.870
properly make sure that you have good

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.910
cardiovascular reserve you know these

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:26.920
are these are the most important things

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.160
as you know as opposed to people [ __ ]

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.140
stockpile and start piling on

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.750
chloroquine and and stuff like that so

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.920
you've heard a little bit that so

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.000
chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.910
two agents that are used in logic

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:49.830
disease so they're actually as I recall

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:53.380
like microtubule inhibitors so they

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.709
they're immunosuppressive

00:16:55.709 --> 00:16:57.850
immunosuppressants because i don't allow

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.760
you know white cells to sort of mobilize

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.339
though the cyberking storm yeah exactly

00:17:03.339 --> 00:17:05.319
so we got that's the idea to prevent

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:09.780
that so Trump blasted to the nation that

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.179
that we you know we had we had a

00:17:13.179 --> 00:17:18.670
promising treatment based on and I go

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.970
and and listen I think that there's a

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.670
huge amount of orange man bad Trump

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:27.840
derangement syndrome that's that's

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:32.020
that's unhelpful so he you know maybe

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.650
his job is to sort of inspire hope I

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:38.049
don't have a clue

00:17:38.049 --> 00:17:41.200
but anyhow he he touted this as a

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.380
potential cure based on a [ __ ] study

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:48.429
of 40 patients some from a French

00:17:48.429 --> 00:17:51.490
Journal where the author of the paper is

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:54.360
the editor-in-chief and it was a non

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.240
randomized open label study so like a

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.669
really poorly controlled shitty study

00:18:02.669 --> 00:18:05.110
yeah well that's what sucks man he sucks

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:06.760
is they don't teach you that you don't

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.350
learn that till you go to like graduate

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:09.820
school and unfortunately because it's

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.370
like I would read anything the paper or

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:13.390
like because it what happened you have

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:14.710
like you're saying like the scientific

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.679
journals which again not all a lot of

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:19.539
them are [ __ ] even you know the

00:18:19.539 --> 00:18:20.890
newspapers a lot of it's [ __ ] but

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:22.809
even the scientific journals which the

00:18:22.809 --> 00:18:24.070
newspapers take a lot of their

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.350
information from can be [ __ ] - so

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:27.909
it's like sure you have to have like a

00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:29.970
basic understanding of statistical

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.559
probably how to judge a study like your

00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:33.880
sayings for what do you say it was for

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:38.789
200 participants no 4406 of which were

00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:41.950
excluded from the analysis like a

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:44.830
garbage study so they exactly that's

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.380
like 40 people in it and then you're

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.760
saying like the validity it's written by

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.580
a guy who the study was done by the guy

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.350
who's supposed to be fact-checking it as

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.840
to in terms of the journal itself then

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.580
the news grabs that and I like check it

00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.590
out we got a cure and it's like dude if

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.090
they adjust to each people how to read

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.250
statistic just a basic I have a very

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.049
very basic understanding of statistics

00:19:05.049 --> 00:19:07.059
and it's helped me so much just back

00:19:07.059 --> 00:19:09.460
whoa is this valid you look all you have

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.929
to do is look for two seconds that study

00:19:10.929 --> 00:19:13.539
design you're like oh this is 200 people

00:19:13.539 --> 00:19:16.600
you're like okay so yeah maybe not yeah

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.399
and even if you're approaching things

00:19:18.399 --> 00:19:21.789
with a bit of skepticism like like I

00:19:21.789 --> 00:19:24.520
think any you know conspiracy theorists

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.080
worth the worth of salt would bring to

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.909
the table I'd be like yeah and I was so

00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:30.490
sure about that like and so and

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.610
unfortunately like you know

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:35.350
unfortunately since then there's a

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.690
Chinese study that's that's better

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:39.970
powered and that was randomized which

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.549
found that there's no benefit now they

00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:45.299
were just looking at hydroxychloroquine

00:19:45.299 --> 00:19:47.590
without the addition of another agent

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:49.539
called azithromycin but still it's it

00:19:49.539 --> 00:19:50.980
don't look good

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.080
looks like that doesn't it looks like

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.030
hot baths might be might be more

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:58.230
effective than [ __ ] hydroxy clerk

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.400
yeah that's that I mean that sucks

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.990
tonight now you should publish that just

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.919
be like nf1

00:20:02.919 --> 00:20:05.620
now I had a hot bath I cleared my kovat

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.890
I mean I sure yeah and what yeah I mean

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:11.770
it's what sucks watching like I'm split

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.179
on it because then I watch a bunch of

00:20:13.179 --> 00:20:16.480
grown-ups like blame Trump for this and

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.720
it's like dude like I mean sure I'm sure

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.299
there's a ton of like dipping and dive

00:20:22.299 --> 00:20:24.580
in you know trying not to look bad and

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:25.960
pushing the blame off and all that

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.820
political spin on all this [ __ ] from

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.520
both sides but watching adults like mmm

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.500
save us from this it's like he can't

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.080
nobody can't know exactly nobody [ __ ]

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.910
ken's to stay home and do your thing and

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.070
you know ya know if you don't believe in

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:40.630
it go work I guess we just don't go

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:42.250
around any kind of geezers or people who

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:44.260
are immunocompromised and everything

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.100
you're fine yeah yeah I mean it's all

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.210
you can do and do people are gonna

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.419
[ __ ] die that's like people can't take

00:20:51.419 --> 00:20:53.740
you know the hard truth of things it's

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.840
like hey the president's not gonna save

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.669
any of us a bunch of geezers are gonna

00:20:57.669 --> 00:21:00.700
bite the dust we can maybe maybe have it

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.040
be less geezers well yeah I think the

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.200
jury's the jury is a little bit out on

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.270
you know so there there is reasonable

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:10.120
evidence for for lockdowns right sure

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.299
but but you know we're not there there's

00:21:13.299 --> 00:21:17.320
less discussion about sort of the

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.240
uncomfortable externalities so what's

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.860
what's pretty cool for me so you know

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:26.110
[ __ ] like you know the the the the

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:30.309
prominent journalists that tend to be

00:21:30.309 --> 00:21:32.440
sort of left-leaning right so it's it's

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.200
interesting when you come across you

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.000
know governor for example it was like

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.760
hey like I would rather die than see my

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.410
children's and grandchildren's economy

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.470
crumble so haven't haven't looked at

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:49.540
those data but it would mean like

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:53.110
setting up [ __ ] like convalescent you

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:56.370
know stadiums where you just paddies and

00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:00.040
yeah also like it's it's grim there's no

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.840
doubt about that and I also just thought

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.300
of this is that Senator going to die

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.860
I'm gonna die from kovat anyway I

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.110
wouldn't die it's like well you [ __ ]

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:09.550
won't because you likely have like a

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:11.650
five acre property with a ton of food

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:14.950
and [ __ ] ya know for sure if you can if

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:16.690
you can't there's a lot of geezers who

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:19.360
would fully bite the bullet on this one

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.370
in big [ __ ] it I don't care well that's

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:23.920
the thing it's hard to say and so you

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.600
know that's a maybe an ageist

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.580
perspective and and the other you know

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:31.930
the other important feature here is that

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.970
it is not a disease exclusively of the

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:35.500
elderly but if you look at death curves

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:39.970
I mean if you're if you're less than 60

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:40.900
or in pretty good shape

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.780
you know ya mus you're unless you're

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.970
like you have some serious serious neck

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:47.410
stuff going on exactly

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:49.990
yeah serious health [ __ ] or I mean also

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:51.940
to their like I think you're Thomas last

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:53.830
time there's just some people who have

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.660
been treating their bodies like you know

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.070
not a temple dude they've been treating

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.640
their bodies like a public [ __ ] YMCA

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.860
it's like I would scare me man if I was

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.660
out you know smoking like three packs of

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.820
cigarettes a day and doing whatever else

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.000
and you know I'd be nervous man yeah so

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.190
now's the time to cut that [ __ ] out and

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:14.530
the only dude I think we're going to

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:19.390
this is going to the options now are

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:22.660
like isolation is superpower or kind of

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:28.600
like multinational socialist country

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.520
yeah it's it's that's the two people

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.560
there's no yeah there's no real middle

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.810
diversion pass yeah there's no middle

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:36.310
ground really dude it's like I mean

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.050
maybe there is I'm obviously I don't

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:39.340
know all the political options but it

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.750
does seem like that's the way we're

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.910
going it's one of the other dude yeah

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:45.490
well it's it's interesting I'm on sort

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.740
of both sides and you know not spend too

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.450
much time there cuz I don't know enough

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:52.540
about it but watching the you just talk

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:56.950
I just talk about it bro yeah yeah be

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:01.260
called a [ __ ] on reddit it's so the

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:05.410
the the opposing perspectives so so

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:07.720
Trump's approach you know from a

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.380
political perspective which isn't

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:15.480
totally off-base is that the the Chinese

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.799
have a lot of

00:24:17.799 --> 00:24:20.049
responsibilities here in that there was

00:24:20.049 --> 00:24:24.850
active suppression by the CCP you know

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:26.289
on the order of two months while

00:24:26.289 --> 00:24:28.690
American nationals were we're coming to

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:31.629
and from Wuhan and spreading disease

00:24:31.629 --> 00:24:35.679
right and if anything you know like from

00:24:35.679 --> 00:24:38.230
your psychology perspective we all have

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.049
[ __ ] borderline traits right and in a

00:24:41.049 --> 00:24:44.440
scenario where [ __ ] is happening to us

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.289
we want someone to blame right and

00:24:47.289 --> 00:24:49.269
that's where we're trump derangement

00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:51.909
comes in like if you look at the facts I

00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:54.070
mean there's no doubt that there was

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.679
there was a lot of [ __ ] bashed

00:24:56.679 --> 00:24:58.629
especially by the CDC early on they

00:24:58.629 --> 00:25:02.980
[ __ ] distributed faulty tests like MP

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.859
swabs that were were not working there

00:25:05.859 --> 00:25:09.639
was the FDA delayed approval from Roche

00:25:09.639 --> 00:25:13.899
and and other private manufacturers so

00:25:13.899 --> 00:25:16.840
there was a whole lot of bureaucratic

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.059
[ __ ] but who was the first country

00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:23.159
to shut down travel from Lewin I know

00:25:23.159 --> 00:25:27.039
what's wrong right like I don't know I

00:25:27.039 --> 00:25:29.230
mean it's it's hard it's hard to say

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.359
there's no doubt that that there you can

00:25:31.359 --> 00:25:35.409
grab [ __ ] sound clips that you know

00:25:35.409 --> 00:25:37.989
as always that make people sound like an

00:25:37.989 --> 00:25:41.559
[ __ ] but if like you can't you can't

00:25:41.559 --> 00:25:44.320
point fingers at one guy it's a failure

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:48.159
of the establishment including you know

00:25:48.159 --> 00:25:51.039
career infectious disease dogs right

00:25:51.039 --> 00:25:53.019
yeah well it's immaturity dude it's just

00:25:53.019 --> 00:25:55.179
massive him it's as mass immaturity to

00:25:55.179 --> 00:25:58.509
be like the one person I the think of a

00:25:58.509 --> 00:26:01.919
an issue as complex is like planning the

00:26:01.919 --> 00:26:05.019
solution and you know containment of a

00:26:05.019 --> 00:26:06.879
global pandemic there's just people are

00:26:06.879 --> 00:26:08.619
going to [ __ ] things up figuring that

00:26:08.619 --> 00:26:11.009
out like it's that's I can't like I

00:26:11.009 --> 00:26:13.509
can't send an email without [ __ ] it

00:26:13.509 --> 00:26:15.730
up four times before I send it so it's

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:17.850
like you expect anyone to expect the

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:21.700
rolling out of suppressing a virus to be

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.090
seamless and flawless is a child is a

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.609
total child to think like oh well then

00:26:27.609 --> 00:26:29.409
this thing and this was [ __ ] it's like

00:26:29.409 --> 00:26:31.270
yeah dude it was [ __ ] up

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:32.920
[ __ ] they got [ __ ] up a guaranteed and

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.600
it's like but yeah I mean you do have to

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.309
I guess think about like how much

00:26:36.309 --> 00:26:38.020
negligence people can take but it I

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:39.610
don't understand people fall into this

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:41.200
thing where they're like the people that

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.670
I like would have handled it perfectly

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:44.650
and they always are perfect and that

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:46.840
person is always wrong and it says that

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.340
doesn't set off any alarm bells in my

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:50.440
head that I live in a universe where one

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.450
group of people are always wrong and the

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:53.980
people that I know are always right it's

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:55.840
like dude you're [ __ ] 50 grow the

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.530
[ __ ] up

00:26:56.530 --> 00:27:00.130
yeah I hate I [ __ ] hate that it's

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:01.750
like nobody knows what the [ __ ] going

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:03.760
over right now no kind of figure it out

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.830
that this they've had there's there's

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:10.330
[ __ ] like me who are responsible for

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:14.620
huge cities leading the the screening

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:19.570
effort and I wouldn't want someone like

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:21.550
me in charge you know what I mean and

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:23.410
and that's sort of the best that we can

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:27.790
we can muster at this point so no

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:30.640
exactly and I mean it you could you can

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:37.030
find left-leaning media with you know

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:40.390
reports the travel bans are racist and

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:42.580
and this is this is so racist and

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.020
there's you know it's not going to be

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:49.179
worse than a flu so you know it's just

00:27:49.179 --> 00:27:53.470
so hypocritical and and and frustrating

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.840
like you're well who knew I knew the

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.150
young left love their old racist parents

00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:59.679
so much because they are bracing the

00:27:59.679 --> 00:28:02.710
lockdown that's that's nice to say I

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:04.570
thought you hated your mom and moms and

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:06.250
dads for all the insensitive jokes

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:09.670
around the table yeah there's they've

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:11.679
been taken it's funny because my feeling

00:28:11.679 --> 00:28:14.170
of it is that a lot of people who veer

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:16.030
to the right are a lot more likely to be

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:18.550
like as is [ __ ] [ __ ] buyers is

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:19.179
nonsense

00:28:19.179 --> 00:28:21.370
then people to the left are taking the

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:24.460
virus more seriously but on some level I

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.320
don't know there's definitely some kind

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.520
of weird disconnect but ya know not up

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.200
people needed not to [ __ ] up and it's

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.730
like dude this [ __ ] sucks

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:37.720
[ __ ] badly and you know hopefully I

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.429
mean it's one of those things I rail

00:28:39.429 --> 00:28:40.870
about this in school all the time where

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:42.029
it's like

00:28:42.029 --> 00:28:43.559
because you know the thing about all the

00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:46.019
people who are just rapport before this

00:28:46.019 --> 00:28:48.479
and like I you know who look I I think

00:28:48.479 --> 00:28:50.219
about that every now and again I'm like

00:28:50.219 --> 00:28:51.299
what the [ __ ] are they doing right now

00:28:51.299 --> 00:28:54.419
like that must be just insane offering

00:28:54.419 --> 00:28:58.379
man yes I post on on the physician you

00:28:58.379 --> 00:29:02.059
know Facebook group from a [ __ ]

00:29:02.059 --> 00:29:05.580
pathologist it was like yeah you know

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:08.190
we've been doing a lot of autopsies from

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:11.669
from suicides already just yeah and

00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:15.019
there's lots of data out of the stars

00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:18.619
like the the first you know copy one

00:29:18.619 --> 00:29:22.769
about the harms of isolation like what

00:29:22.769 --> 00:29:24.599
it you know is just the Geneva

00:29:24.599 --> 00:29:26.309
Convention you've not [ __ ] allow for

00:29:26.309 --> 00:29:29.249
this solitary confinement like one of

00:29:29.249 --> 00:29:32.309
life rule an unusual torture well dude

00:29:32.309 --> 00:29:34.349
think about like people like I live in

00:29:34.349 --> 00:29:35.849
Philly and I had a guy walking down the

00:29:35.849 --> 00:29:37.889
street just like you see people who are

00:29:37.889 --> 00:29:39.359
as homeless and they're like that

00:29:39.359 --> 00:29:41.639
they're like Raggedy and like I dude I'm

00:29:41.639 --> 00:29:43.049
like I'm crossing the street dude I'm

00:29:43.049 --> 00:29:44.669
like I'm you know it's like I'm not even

00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:46.919
I'm not if I see someone who looks like

00:29:46.919 --> 00:29:48.109
they've been sleeping outside

00:29:48.109 --> 00:29:50.249
instinctively I'm like ah [ __ ] dude that

00:29:50.249 --> 00:29:52.559
guy probably has the virus yeah I see

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:55.289
like a bedraggled man I'm like god I'm

00:29:55.289 --> 00:29:57.029
out of here yeah just he's gonna be like

00:29:57.029 --> 00:30:01.379
[ __ ] that dude no it's it's yeah and

00:30:01.379 --> 00:30:04.080
yeah definitely steer clear I mean it's

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.749
sad right because it's sort of the the

00:30:06.749 --> 00:30:08.609
underclass that that's probably gonna

00:30:08.609 --> 00:30:13.169
suffer most I the the essential workers

00:30:13.169 --> 00:30:15.229
it's it's funny but like you know nurses

00:30:15.229 --> 00:30:18.089
nurses are not getting enough [ __ ]

00:30:18.089 --> 00:30:18.950
respect

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:24.349
these people are inadequately protected

00:30:24.349 --> 00:30:27.179
so you know so to to people's point like

00:30:27.179 --> 00:30:30.330
CDC guidelines are compared to for

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:34.469
example South Korea or other East Asian

00:30:34.469 --> 00:30:37.739
countries far more liberal and the type

00:30:37.739 --> 00:30:42.960
of PPE then than them so these there's

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.690
already tons of reports of infected

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:49.409
frontline workers and in terms of body

00:30:49.409 --> 00:30:52.850
on body time nurses are

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:55.130
spending the most amount of time right

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:57.590
with affected patients and these aren't

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:59.299
exactly rich people and other people

00:30:59.299 --> 00:31:01.190
like [ __ ] you know unit clerks

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:04.389
Hospital cleaning staff the list goes on

00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:08.000
that are that are really heroes and sort

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.820
of unsung unsung heroes as well yeah

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.049
I've always been a fan of nurses I've

00:31:12.049 --> 00:31:14.120
always said they're watching my answer

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.409
nurses they always will have a special

00:31:15.409 --> 00:31:16.580
place in my heart especially when you

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:18.679
have a baby and they just like the first

00:31:18.679 --> 00:31:21.200
two days they just show you how to do

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.970
everything you're like oh my god I love

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:26.990
you so much thank you so much it's it's

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:28.909
no coincidence that that's sort of a

00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:32.539
poun genre yeah yeah there's special

00:31:32.539 --> 00:31:39.379
people so [ __ ] hot yeah man the I

00:31:39.379 --> 00:31:41.120
don't know I mean it's just one of those

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.970
things that it kind of reinforces this

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:45.740
is where I'm kind of this is where I

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.029
butt heads in school a lot where it's

00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:48.710
like like we were doing like narrative

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:50.870
therapy yesterday it's all about

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:52.490
reframing people's sense of themselves

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:54.769
so it's like if you're homeless push

00:31:54.769 --> 00:31:56.419
back against a narrative that like you

00:31:56.419 --> 00:31:58.279
should be ashamed to be homeless and you

00:31:58.279 --> 00:31:59.929
know all this stuff and you know I'm

00:31:59.929 --> 00:32:01.340
hearing people being like basically the

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.750
idea is it to tell people it's not their

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:03.889
fault and you know I don't think it's

00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:05.750
people's fault fault necessarily they're

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:07.250
homeless

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:09.350
but you'd sit there and you know do all

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:11.450
this [ __ ] of like yeah man like it's not

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:13.100
your fault they're like a pandemic comes

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.659
and it's like oh [ __ ] you're [ __ ] like

00:32:14.659 --> 00:32:16.580
okay sorry we're gonna stop pretending

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:19.070
now because you're a [ __ ] now so it's

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:22.129
like I don't know that for in terms of

00:32:22.129 --> 00:32:23.779
my school it's like there's a rubber

00:32:23.779 --> 00:32:25.519
meets the road aspect I feel like that

00:32:25.519 --> 00:32:27.710
kind of gets cloth over it's like oh you

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:29.059
haven't been saving money again there's

00:32:29.059 --> 00:32:31.429
people who are just literally poor who

00:32:31.429 --> 00:32:33.080
don't have money to save and there's

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.100
people who have a little bit of money to

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.110
save but they don't and [ __ ] it up so

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:37.159
there's a difference so I was like oh

00:32:37.159 --> 00:32:38.840
maybe you've been [ __ ] up your money

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.730
doing dumb [ __ ] and now you're

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:41.090
[ __ ]

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:43.659
versus you does that make sense yeah

00:32:43.659 --> 00:32:46.820
there's an underlying behavioral pattern

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:48.860
that could be getting punished hard

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.000
right now and that's not saying if

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.559
you're poor it's your fault but if

00:32:51.559 --> 00:32:53.750
you're like have some money you spend it

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.340
on [ __ ] or you're gambling or

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.440
whatever and now you're only gonna [ __ ]

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.820
what am I gonna do it's like well you

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:01.250
kind of [ __ ] up your money dude yeah

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:04.039
yeah it's what we and we have you know

00:33:04.039 --> 00:33:05.690
it's part of our culture rate we're

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:06.550
consumerist

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:08.980
and a lot of us a lot of people live

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:11.350
paycheck to paycheck and I feel I feel

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:16.660
for so bad because we from the sort of

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.550
hallowed halls you know our ivory towers

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:21.520
say everyone must isolate and and shut

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.640
it down and in quarantine but for a lot

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.940
of people that like that's almost not an

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:33.450
option like the money is so short and

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:35.950
yeah the majority people don't have a

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:39.040
month worth of money to live off of so

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.050
I'm not like talking [ __ ] on people I

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:43.480
think one in five US households are now

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:47.380
affected by job loss yeah it's [ __ ]

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:51.420
nuts so in in Canada they've there's a

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:55.120
like a ubi universal basic income that's

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.780
coming in two thousand dollars a month -

00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:01.030
yeah like that'll get you by I mean

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:02.530
especially if you're not I did if you're

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:05.020
not paying taxes for people that are on

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.600
the dole not sorry so I would

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.630
distinguish that from from you know the

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:12.970
Liberty bond or whatever the [ __ ]

00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:16.060
Yang's thing is we're not everyone is

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.130
eligible but for those that are on the

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:21.780
dole are getting that so hopefully the I

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.800
what's the story in the States if

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.650
they're gonna give us like 1200 bucks

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:29.950
and be like here you guys go thanks but

00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:31.929
no I think they're uh I don't know I was

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:34.210
looking into it yesterday and I saw a

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:35.679
thing Bernie Sanders was saying we're

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:37.570
like there was part of the hang-up

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:40.120
according to him was that there was

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.400
people being like well some of the

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.350
stimulus package should be adjusted if

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:46.300
you're already poor you shouldn't get

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.010
like that you shouldn't get more than

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:49.900
you are already getting that's when

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.820
Sanders was like dude come off of it

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:53.860
please like stop being a [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.919
for just a second people have 400 extra

00:34:56.919 --> 00:35:02.650
bucks for among which is true but again

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:03.640
it this is where I'm torn between

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:04.720
because it's like yes we obviously

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.250
should take care of everybody you know

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:07.750
we have all this food people shouldn't

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:09.520
be starving I fully fully understand

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.290
that but there is that little germ

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.210
inside me like though like bible

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:15.370
thinking where it's like Cain and Abel

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:16.510
you shouldn't push your [ __ ] brother

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:18.550
off a cliff and there's like there are

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:19.420
Reaper

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:22.530
for personal actions and people have are

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:25.660
confronted every day with a bunch of

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:26.950
tiny little decisions they have to make

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:28.660
and either they can drown themselves out

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:29.920
and all the [ __ ] and all you know

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.630
the cell phone and kind of not being

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:33.549
conscious of it at all but it's like if

00:35:33.549 --> 00:35:35.260
you do that and it's kind of float along

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:37.000
along the current and [ __ ] like that

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
this happens you're [ __ ] yeah that's

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.530
what I've always been trying to bring up

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:44.530
that kind of like real world scenario

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:46.030
we're like dude we live in and we're

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:47.380
kind of living in like a bubble we've

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:48.970
been living in a bubble now we have it

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:52.030
just a tiny taste dude of like you know

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:54.670
living with it oh [ __ ] yeah like like

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:55.750
the fact that we can [ __ ] die

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:58.059
whenever so it's not even an issue most

00:35:58.059 --> 00:35:59.349
of us can be like I'll probably make it

00:35:59.349 --> 00:36:01.299
to him like 70 60 and not even think

00:36:01.299 --> 00:36:04.030
about it yeah well I mean your you know

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:06.609
your your job is recession-proof right

00:36:06.609 --> 00:36:09.760
you guys will be you'll be podcast and

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.799
yeah you know into the end of the

00:36:11.799 --> 00:36:16.510
apocalypse I would gladly dude captain

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:21.730
of the Titanic but you know for the four

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:24.520
other people that are that are driven by

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:27.220
a consumers culture and you know that

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:30.130
that are told they need the the newest

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:33.880
jeans and [ __ ] like that I do I mean it

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.319
might be in harsh this is the thing that

00:36:35.319 --> 00:36:38.650
I have a hard time verbalizing this and

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:40.540
I feel like I'm being dickish when I say

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.130
that but there is an element of truth

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:44.829
where it's like you know all that meth

00:36:44.829 --> 00:36:46.660
all you know the chicken little skies

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:48.730
falling [ __ ] if you don't you know or

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:49.869
whatever if you don't do this stuff

00:36:49.869 --> 00:36:51.670
you're supposed to do you know it's like

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:53.619
this [ __ ] [ __ ] happens and it's a you

00:36:53.619 --> 00:36:55.030
know I'm not shaming people who only

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:56.619
make like 10 bucks an hour like you

00:36:56.619 --> 00:36:57.970
couldn't you'd work all you want it

00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:00.910
you're still [ __ ] for this but yeah I

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:03.690
don't know man I feel like this is gonna

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:06.819
accelerate like the other view and like

00:37:06.819 --> 00:37:08.319
in people that are talking about you

00:37:08.319 --> 00:37:11.559
know externalities or you know too bad

00:37:11.559 --> 00:37:13.480
like don't you know don't don't tread on

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:16.960
me don't munch on me type of is that

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.400
like yeah well you know what I'm gonna

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.280
go back to work and unless you have so

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.869
like we do in Canada there's something

00:37:22.869 --> 00:37:24.220
called the quarantine act which is being

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:26.160
used sort of half-heartedly for

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.390
returning travelers but unless you can

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:30.789
coerce me to stay at home from

00:37:30.789 --> 00:37:34.359
legal perspective [ __ ] you like my

00:37:34.359 --> 00:37:36.579
immune systems okay I'm not gonna die

00:37:36.579 --> 00:37:40.449
probably right so yeah I mean it's

00:37:40.449 --> 00:37:43.479
interesting but there there are guys

00:37:43.479 --> 00:37:45.999
that are gonna you know will accept

00:37:45.999 --> 00:37:48.099
death rather than sort of crippling the

00:37:48.099 --> 00:37:48.640
economy

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.429
I don't know but big guy big names you

00:37:51.429 --> 00:37:53.349
know Buffett and Gates and people say

00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:56.559
that that a recovery is possible but

00:37:56.559 --> 00:37:58.689
it's the consumer conference confidence

00:37:58.689 --> 00:38:02.410
is as low as it was in 2008 like shit's

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:04.689
hit the fan you know but it's [ __ ]

00:38:04.689 --> 00:38:06.339
said I've seen so many of these before

00:38:06.339 --> 00:38:08.169
Matt I mean it definitely is going to

00:38:08.169 --> 00:38:10.749
it's gonna [ __ ] people up dad dude and

00:38:10.749 --> 00:38:12.279
like there is a ton of health data in

00:38:12.279 --> 00:38:14.469
terms of like recessions with like

00:38:14.469 --> 00:38:17.380
you're saying suicide spike domestic

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:19.059
violence spikes like it they're like

00:38:19.059 --> 00:38:21.640
heart attacks like all of these other

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.439
health things do spike up as well

00:38:23.439 --> 00:38:26.919
mmm-hmm it's at like so for example like

00:38:26.919 --> 00:38:29.769
I had to call a patient the other day as

00:38:29.769 --> 00:38:31.630
I didn't endometrial biopsy she has

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:33.849
[ __ ] ovarian cancer endometrial

00:38:33.849 --> 00:38:37.719
cancer and I had to call her and be like

00:38:37.719 --> 00:38:41.079
oh like [ __ ] sorry you know there's not

00:38:41.079 --> 00:38:42.669
gonna be a surgery in the foreseeable

00:38:42.669 --> 00:38:45.459
future here's this this alternative you

00:38:45.459 --> 00:38:48.159
know high-dose progestin strategy that

00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:50.529
we've randomly sort of come up with here

00:38:50.529 --> 00:38:53.529
as a temporizing sort of band-aid well

00:38:53.529 --> 00:38:55.659
this thing is [ __ ] growing in you you

00:38:55.659 --> 00:38:56.619
know what I mean and those are the

00:38:56.619 --> 00:38:58.419
stories that you don't hear about like

00:38:58.419 --> 00:39:00.729
you hear about the the 80 year old on

00:39:00.729 --> 00:39:04.229
the vent which is tragic obviously but

00:39:04.229 --> 00:39:06.579
you don't hear about all the yeah the

00:39:06.579 --> 00:39:08.589
externalities so it's gonna get a piss

00:39:08.589 --> 00:39:09.909
you off when you hear people be like

00:39:09.909 --> 00:39:11.919
this is basically common cold we're just

00:39:11.919 --> 00:39:13.079
freaking out for nothing

00:39:13.079 --> 00:39:16.959
yeah well it pisses me off to the extent

00:39:16.959 --> 00:39:20.529
that like that happens but III think

00:39:20.529 --> 00:39:23.109
that there is a discussion around like

00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:25.659
convalescence and what what the

00:39:25.659 --> 00:39:28.299
appropriate approach is going to be so

00:39:28.299 --> 00:39:30.939
there's real high-level policy

00:39:30.939 --> 00:39:35.400
discussions around the opt-in or opt-out

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.569
strategy as relates to do not

00:39:37.569 --> 00:39:41.049
resuscitate and do not intubate so it's

00:39:41.049 --> 00:39:44.010
a right now it's a

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:47.490
opt-out approach where you have to have

00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:49.650
advanced directives saying that you

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:51.090
don't want a tube down your neck you

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:53.870
don't want people to push on your chest

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:55.790
they're gonna be thinking about

00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:58.800
instituting the converse that's so many

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.420
[ __ ] people are gonna be coming in

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:05.730
you know dead it's pretty grim that's

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:07.920
grim and like that conversation is heard

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:10.440
great older like the woman's crying and

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.930
[ __ ] and you're like yeah [ __ ] that

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:14.520
[ __ ] sucks and the well with the

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.890
economy thing the economy falling out

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:19.170
this is my disconnect with that because

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:20.820
you know there's like well as virus what

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:23.010
the [ __ ] most people are gonna live when

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:24.240
they start like what the economy of that

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.280
fails were [ __ ] it it's like and this

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.440
is again I keep taking you know kind of

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.020
I think uncharted waters but neither of

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:33.930
us are economists but it's like we seem

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:35.760
to have plenty of food and building

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.460
materials so we're not going like we

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:41.280
wouldn't die per se but it seems to be

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.080
an issue of resource allocation so it's

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:46.050
like if the economy got [ __ ] so hard

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:48.090
we're like we were [ __ ] up it's like

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:49.950
we still have we're still throwing out

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:52.140
tons of food so it's like I don't think

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.600
we would all die no it's it's not a

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:58.740
life-or-death thing right now dude it's

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:00.420
lifestyle lifestyle or death ah

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:06.150
that's [ __ ] good but like yeah I

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:08.430
don't know like you know this is [ __ ]

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:15.470
way above never tell myself that dude

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:19.170
[ __ ] start I've seen the economy

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:21.060
drops down and did you know it [ __ ]

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:21.540
sucks

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:23.610
but it's like do you know how to grow a

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:26.520
potato like what would you I'm doing it

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.690
this summer I'm gonna get a big trash

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:29.190
can and just fill it with dirt and just

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:32.760
throw potatoes so what if like global

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.800
supply chains collapse yeah that's the

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.860
thing that's that's good okay I have two

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.050
big dogs I'll be irate so that's that's

00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:41.700
the problem with so we have a ton of

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:43.170
foods and farms but it's the supply

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:44.790
chains that would collapse without the

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:47.460
profits and then you know and that and

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:48.660
this is part of you know like you said

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:53.539
like it's either [ __ ] like global

00:41:53.539 --> 00:41:56.140
you know multinational state or

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:59.509
isolationist sort of republics and

00:41:59.509 --> 00:42:01.789
that's a good thing so you know we prop

00:42:01.789 --> 00:42:05.180
up we prop up our auto manufacturers

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:07.640
despite how [ __ ] shitty they are with

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.739
bailouts and stuff like that

00:42:09.739 --> 00:42:12.079
because from a national defense

00:42:12.079 --> 00:42:15.319
perspective we need to have that we need

00:42:15.319 --> 00:42:16.670
to have that facility we need to have

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:19.180
that infrastructure but when it comes to

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:25.039
pandemics and the the brutal irony of of

00:42:25.039 --> 00:42:27.440
the swabbing infrastructure is that all

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.809
the [ __ ] NP swabs are produced in in

00:42:29.809 --> 00:42:34.549
northern Italy the epicenter of the so

00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:37.160
when we talk about supply chains and how

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:40.099
this followed from all of this like

00:42:40.099 --> 00:42:44.719
there that you know country first sort

00:42:44.719 --> 00:42:49.279
of Independence or self-sufficiency is

00:42:49.279 --> 00:42:51.349
going to be an important discussion in

00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:57.349
Canada we [ __ ] shipped a 12 tons of

00:42:57.349 --> 00:43:02.359
PPE to to China well they wear at their

00:43:02.359 --> 00:43:05.239
peak and now we can't get masks for

00:43:05.239 --> 00:43:06.709
frontline workers there's there's

00:43:06.709 --> 00:43:08.989
people's you know CDC has guidelines

00:43:08.989 --> 00:43:11.809
around using [ __ ] bandanas do you know

00:43:11.809 --> 00:43:13.640
like those things are 12 tons of those

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:17.749
things it's a [ __ ] ton like our national

00:43:17.749 --> 00:43:20.209
reserve and then you guys gave that up

00:43:20.209 --> 00:43:22.489
to China and then now you'll get China

00:43:22.489 --> 00:43:24.229
how about those masks and there's being

00:43:24.229 --> 00:43:28.400
a so right now China I mean dude I

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.319
honestly the debts canceled bro I don't

00:43:30.319 --> 00:43:31.309
give a [ __ ]

00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:33.529
put me on put me on the economic squad

00:43:33.529 --> 00:43:35.239
I'll go over there myself like yo get

00:43:35.239 --> 00:43:36.589
you remember how you guys thought we

00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:39.619
owed you money yeah the [ __ ] out here is

00:43:39.619 --> 00:43:42.650
cancelled but we'll see you know America

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:45.380
like the thing is you like you know the

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.989
world's brightest you know it is still

00:43:47.989 --> 00:43:50.180
the city on the hill right it is still

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:53.239
the city of or you know Philadelphia is

00:43:53.239 --> 00:43:54.680
still the city of brotherly love

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.599
so do two thing a quick digression there

00:43:56.599 --> 00:43:58.369
this is so [ __ ] funny I was reading

00:43:58.369 --> 00:44:01.630
how so a lot to be learned from the

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:05.059
Spanish flu epidemic and a contrast

00:44:05.059 --> 00:44:08.010
between Philadelphia's approach

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:10.500
what was the other and some other big

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:13.860
cities approach but anyhow with the peak

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.869
of the flu Philadelphia held it like a

00:44:15.869 --> 00:44:21.750
morale parade went crowded with people

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:23.070
when was this

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:26.640
it was st. Louis so this was nineteen

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:31.290
eighteen eighteen they held a [ __ ]

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:34.740
massive parade and and the the contrast

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:37.260
between them and st. Louis Zoo who had

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:41.270
locked down and that you know from a

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:44.100
case study perspective it's pretty

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.410
compelling evidence really or the

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:48.390
utility of lockdown

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:50.490
what's the paper quote again well it's

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:54.450
it's just a it's you can look at CDC's

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:57.960
1918 pandemic and historic timeline is

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:04.290
the Google Data there but it's funny to

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:06.000
all their sons and daughters are still

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.340
here being like [ __ ] that dude I'm going

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:11.040
outside [ __ ] this we should have a

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:16.200
perfect oh man that's too [ __ ] funny

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:19.200
yeah but they the vaccine like you know

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.240
American exceptionalism the vaccine I

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.970
think will come out of the states yeah

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:26.400
you know that's where the brains urban

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:29.160
and like it's a you know it is a little

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.050
bit a little a little too little a

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:34.230
little too late type of thing but once

00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:39.140
the once private enterprise like Roche

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:43.050
starts manufacturing stuff thermo Fisher

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:44.430
is the other big one that's producing

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:46.530
all of these diagnostic kits you know

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:48.090
things are things are gonna go well

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:51.060
right in New York has ramped up so so

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:53.609
quickly as well so hopefully there is a

00:45:53.609 --> 00:45:55.680
vaccine in sort of within 12 months

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:58.440
because otherwise if this is going to be

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:02.880
a drawn-out miserable [ __ ] time other

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:06.660
than listening to Matt and chains dude

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.250
with the [ __ ] unnamed scientist dude

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:10.050
it's funny too because I get a lot of

00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:11.340
people who reach out to me like dude I

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:12.840
love those they're [ __ ] awesome you

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.730
know you ever see the good stuff you

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:17.100
always see the best yeah I got a bit of

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:20.310
both but you know I I think it's

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:23.370
I hope it's helpful and and and you know

00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:25.350
literally from a public health

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:28.410
perspective with with your with your

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:34.040
reach if we can get sort of cooler heads

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:37.020
you know just just talking and being

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:39.840
open to discussion and I think from that

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.750
perspective it's it's been really useful

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:43.860
well do you called a couple things

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:45.750
before they're publicly last time it was

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:48.300
the wasn't airborne it was particularly

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:50.670
it was you know particulate or whatever

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:54.150
matter the fact that heat kind of

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:55.470
crushes it which now they're looking at

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:56.430
the climate you know you sent me that

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:58.620
they're looking at the climate patterns

00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.840
and how the Cova will change with

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:02.190
climate patterns for the summer and

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:04.290
warmth and there was there was a couple

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:05.610
other things that you know it wasn't

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:07.230
that weren't being reported on and they

00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:08.970
came out like two days after you know

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:10.110
you told me all that stuff which is

00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:12.870
awesome yeah it's it's helpful for the

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:15.450
polls but yeah I got my finger on the

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:18.660
pulse for the dogs I got my ear on the

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:22.050
the rail track there so keeping people

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:24.840
informed you made all right Ben

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.990
so thanks for having me on and we'll

00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:30.860
we'll touch base and I look forward to

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:37.800
