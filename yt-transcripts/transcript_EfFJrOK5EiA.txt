00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.239
you have true antiques or you're just

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.920
out here selling stuff as antiques

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.719
probably some of my stuff is pretty old

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.640
i saw a lot of guitars and music stuff

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.160
well they have to be 100 years old to

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.280
classify as an antique

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.960
true in most realms well

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.159
i want to keep it up and up you know

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.560
what i mean

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.920
uh yeah so i'm not i can't really think

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.920
of any antiques that i have stuff so you

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.479
don't have antiques

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.080
i i can't think of anything i've even

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.080
classified as an antiques beyonce but

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.799
you're selling under the antique banner

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.799
it's fraudulent no i'm not

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.520
not not knowledgeably anyway yeah 100

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.680
years is a rule every year bumps up a

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.560
year to be technically an antique

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.799
i'm selling furniture and so i don't i'm

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.600
not in the antique category at my point

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.040
well i only look at antiques and i

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.799
connected you through the antique realm

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.840
and you've just defrauded me

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.200
okay let me look

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.960
you know when you find the home page

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.240
there it doesn't really okay

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.360
all right

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.520
i'll i'll find it right i know i know

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.119
the coat rack which probably isn't

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.960
antiques

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.880

looks like about 300 an hour this

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:55.440
conversation is worth more than the

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.120

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.919
homophobic uh thing but you are the
