basketball coach he's a basketball coach

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.780
to coach Carter coach card yeah I think

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.430
we straighten those boys out think he

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.110
was a black conservative - that's a

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.849
coach Carter because I remember for a

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:57.380
while I was registered Republican

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.789
because this guy was like you registered

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:00.380
a vote and I was like no and he was like

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.729
I'm running as a Republican I was like

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:02.840
we're all signed went up before whatever

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.520
you want he's [ __ ] Carter was running

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.800
yeah bro so he was running for some sort

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.630
of a politician I don't dude it was a it

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.060
was a while but I will say this any any

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.919
coach Carter out there any like strict

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:15.620
black disciplinarian coach is a black

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.660
conservative I would say secretly yeah

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.160
at least almost every coach is a

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.010
hardcore [ __ ] conservative I got

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.389
through that liberal White's

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:25.310
in the NBA there's that guys like

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.720
Popovich and

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.539
Kerr I could see that yeah I do thinking

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:32.120
about quality black Bobby Knight Coach K

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.520
what's he was he not a guarantee they

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.400
love Trump oh dude a million percent I

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.680
think every coach I think you might be

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.060
honest on with that and I think it's

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.190
that's cuz they're kind of dictators

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.639
exactly but also every elite athlete

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.100
loves Trump dude I think Tom MacGregor

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:18.680
curious

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.240
definitely all coaches I would say

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.470
almost every football coach 99% football

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.370

like you know Kobe would have been like

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.880
there's a theory in psychology called

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.010
object relations where like there's

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.260

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:17.880
exactly

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.740

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.270
on with the cast I don't know the cat

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.910
silly silly do know those band you know

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.350
those brand of shoes that are like the

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.520
squiggly

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.550
like toes yeah so these are that brand

00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:00.600
but since people obviously looks like

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.030
really weird for that they made them so

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:04.470
than your feet Yeah right like that but

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.850
you don't have to like just never get

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.250
[ __ ] ever again in your life yeah or I

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:09.780
feel like guys that have those toe shoes

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:14.250
have huge dicks maybe it's a theory

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.320
maybe I don't know a lot of micro

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.700
birders who are walking around with

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.730
those toe shoes maybe so just throwing

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:21.210
that out there

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:23.250
what were you talking about Oh Coby yeah

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:26.510
I'm at the gym never forget my best

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.280
legend exactly so

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.930
so dude I'm at the gym and I see their

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.190
parent Li there's a baseball coach

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.560
someone in baseball I think died as well

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.570
so they're throwing him on there yeah

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:37.950
yeah this guy is dead I don't know if he

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.750
died it on again it was on mute but then

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:40.830
they kept like they kept interviewing

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:42.390
this baseball team how Kobe showed up to

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.690
it one time oh it was a pitcher for the

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:47.340
Angels I think which is kind of

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.750
unfortunate there was a picture for the

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:49.500
angels died too

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.050
yes he on the copter no I he had died

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.040
before but it was like you know he was a

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.750
athlete he's an angel in the outfield

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:11.040
now 2020 party time

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.890
no I don't know I don't know so when I

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.180
don't know I think it's a [ __ ] up

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:16.770
heart or something that's that's a Mike

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:17.730
shouldn't make fun of that I have

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:21.420
rhythms as well but what I'm saying

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.980
echoing is killing me have you heard

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.180
that I haven't heard it at all you'll

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.430
hear it so I'm at the gym I'm breaking

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:27.060
my record

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.710
I feel like I'm at the pinnacle I'm at

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:30.540
the height of my sports career so you

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.750
know yeah um I I get it I'm a legend as

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.550
well so I'm like running I'm doing nine

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:36.870
on the treadmill slowly back down to

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.250
four again take it a nice two-minute

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.560
break and I look at the TV and they

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.090
literally that guy was there's a quote

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:43.320
and it was like this week's not about

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.230
sports this week's about life it's like

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.110
what the [ __ ] you guys talking about

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:52.590
like oh this is a weird you got 24 hours

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.410
to fill and every one of those pundits

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:58.350
is looking for their 30-second viral

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.630
like oh I heard up talking about this

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:02.610
yeah which some of them were really

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.230
[ __ ] up to watch like I watched Shaq

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.410
yeah dude that was so sick Brahma said

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:10.440
yeah LeBron being sad is very sad yeah

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.330
well that was legitimately their friend

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:14.010
yeah of course but then you know it's

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:17.730
like [ __ ] Jimmy Fallon cried yeah be

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.340
run once that's see that's the problem

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.960
that's where it's hard to put a pin in

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.330
it cuz it's like again I know well

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:25.950
there's like regular dudes never [ __ ]

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:27.570
yeah and who knows what the [ __ ] their

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:30.030
relationship was but it is it's odd and

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:34.200
you can I don't know it's weird to be a

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.870
cynic during that like that type of

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.760
thing but when people are like crying on

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.270
TV it's always like what you don't

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.400
exactly we doing there and I agree it is

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.800
there a reason you're doing that I'd

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.170
much rather be like man I'm so [ __ ] up

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:49.800
man

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.840
I had to call my boss and [ __ ] work

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.220
from home that no you don't wanna be

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.320
that yeah awesome dude

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.280
that would be nice I don't know what the

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.180
f are you serious he died Frick turn on

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:07.530
TV no no no no it was it was sad but it

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.090
was like it's like you were saying like

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.310
that's a guy I mean I watched I've

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:13.380
watched kobe bryant for it i don't know

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:16.950
how many hours my whole life you know so

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.080
it's like i've seen him a lot I'd

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.150
probably watch Kobe just as much as any

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.950
other athlete sure you know what I mean

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.080
hmm so it's not like yeah I see where

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.880
that is but as far as people being is

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.200
gonna be a hot take but I would like to

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.430
say that I'm totally neutral and

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.200
subjective it's like I saw it was like

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:31.980
that sucks

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.920
yeah that's also how I yeah I was in the

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.960
car I was driving back I was in the car

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.640
for like hours and I was just like damn

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.960
I can't believe Kobe done I just looked

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.640
at the internet the whole car ride yeah

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.430
well so that it's a race issue now so

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.050
now like people making fun of Kobe diet

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:47.610
well then they're that that was a weird

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.440
time when people became like start to

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.820

really oh yeah that was right we talked

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:03.420

he was saying that

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.360

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.830
just sits in a parking lot yeah

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:13.850

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:20.140

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.550
looks like a simulation then you go in

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:33.410
and then these these same animals have

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:36.500
the audacity to criticize some you know

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.850
some drone strikes in the Middle East

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:39.410

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:43.820
bomb some [ __ ] schools in order to

get this I mean I I honestly you see

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.120
this and you're kind of like you can

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.070
start doing the [ __ ] way in the hands

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:50.990
really I don't know this is maybe it's

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.530
worth it

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:53.540
everyone's laugh everyone's having a

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.790
good old time to build that very diverse

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:58.010
and vice versa no need to build a wall

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:00.430
dude they're trying to get our top golf

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:02.690
had to cover for the golf block the

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:07.100
balls dude and then there was the

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.140
[ __ ] comedy place was it was like you

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:10.370
go through like almost like a maze of

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:12.170
[ __ ] and then it's like boom weird a

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.330
little comedy club behind curtains he

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:15.590
filled every show pretty much for the

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:20.780
most part and was the room loud wall a

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.490
little bit of music but I mean you know

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:24.230
an old vet like me I wasn't bothered by

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:26.150
it now it's like riding a bike it was

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:28.550
nothing just got back on road what do

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:31.130
the crowds weren't bad really except for

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:32.810
the last show felt like that would be a

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:33.740
horrible

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.779
that's what I thought it was gonna be

00:26:35.779 --> 00:26:37.270
like straight casino crowds

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:40.250
wasn't bad was not a bad round it was

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:43.850
bizarre but the last crowd got [ __ ]

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:46.010
live so I this is the fifth one so I'm

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:48.350
like no you're in cruise control I'm

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.720

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:00.620
so it was like they started heckling the

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.909
first you can be damned they're the

00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:04.130
worst breezily heckling yeah so then I

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:05.809
was like okay so this show doesn't like

00:27:05.809 --> 00:27:07.220

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.600

00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:59.930
driving around I think personally that's

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:01.490
one of the most coveted positions of

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:06.110

this lowlife I mean the fact you the

00:33:49.849 --> 00:33:52.129
fact that there's a rumor I don't know

00:33:52.129 --> 00:33:53.509
if it's true that they commit suicide

00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:55.879

committing suicide yeah that's all

00:34:00.259 --> 00:34:01.519
because they probably find out the

00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:02.690
secret to life and all right done

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:04.729
yeah done did it I step out in front of

00:34:04.729 --> 00:34:08.960

coming down through the highest suicide

00:34:10.399 --> 00:34:12.440
earth yeah I don't know if that's true

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.809
but that's that's a rumor I've been told

00:34:14.809 --> 00:34:17.329
that that's fair yeah we passed him I

00:34:17.329 --> 00:34:18.589
just looked at I'm like first of all

00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:20.720
such a teeny anesthesiologist sir up

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.309

00:34:23.809 --> 00:34:26.359
got the tools yeah it's like you ever

00:34:26.359 --> 00:34:28.099
hear about like what's it called it was

00:34:28.099 --> 00:34:30.559
in London London had all those think

00:34:30.559 --> 00:34:32.690
there was they had a lot of suicides

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:34.579
back when it was called town gas or

00:34:34.579 --> 00:34:37.309
something so back in the day they sent

00:34:37.309 --> 00:34:38.960
this gas into these little ovens and you

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.039
can just stick your head in the oven and

00:34:40.039 --> 00:34:42.289
kill yourself that's how Sylvia Plath

00:34:42.289 --> 00:34:42.740
died

00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:45.230
Sylvia Hat they had it what the [ __ ]

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:46.609
it's called it was a certain type of gas

00:34:46.609 --> 00:34:49.279
I think it was odorless too so you could

00:34:49.279 --> 00:34:50.720
just pop your head in there it fired up

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.129
and like tons of people are killing

00:34:52.129 --> 00:34:54.049
themselves and they're like well people

00:34:54.049 --> 00:34:54.919
are gonna kill themselves they're gonna

00:34:54.919 --> 00:34:56.059
kill themselves whether they finally

00:34:56.059 --> 00:34:58.160
switched out town gas suicides dropped

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.930
they stopped significantly that's the

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:00.980
whole thing yeah you have an easy

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.930
suicide just sitting in your kitchen at

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:04.640
all times that's the one guy found out

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.740
because they're like I mean dude take

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.420
away hang on Spiller still gonna sign

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:09.770
I'll kill ourselves the numbers drops

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:11.690
severe no one wants to kill themselves

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:13.910
with a knife first

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:15.859
yeah we're short not to cutting the

00:35:15.859 --> 00:35:20.390
wrists as a weird one tub well it's also

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:22.579
two suicides not like a sound like a

00:35:22.579 --> 00:35:24.799
lifelong mission it's like a surge of

00:35:24.799 --> 00:35:26.839
depressive yeah energy that you're just

00:35:26.839 --> 00:35:27.589
like

00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:29.359
yeah so if you don't have if you have to

00:35:29.359 --> 00:35:30.979
like you know research it as time goes

00:35:30.979 --> 00:35:32.599
on there's a chance you won't do it but

00:35:32.599 --> 00:35:33.739
that was that was a study because they

00:35:33.739 --> 00:35:34.939
were like dude you could take away town

00:35:34.939 --> 00:35:36.319
Cass and people are still want to kill

00:35:36.319 --> 00:35:37.549
themselves and they're like oh actually

00:35:37.549 --> 00:35:40.430
our bad on that one suicides dropping

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:42.829
why it dropped a lot yeah

00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:44.359
turns out with suicides a little harder

00:35:44.359 --> 00:35:48.410
people sit it out yeah most times sure

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:49.759
because you know when you're very

00:35:49.759 --> 00:35:50.869
depressed you don't to make an effort

00:35:50.869 --> 00:35:54.769
trill the house I think we've said it

00:35:54.769 --> 00:35:55.939
before they're trying to kill yourself

00:35:55.939 --> 00:35:58.729
and live in that's a tough one unless

00:35:58.729 --> 00:36:00.319
you stick your head in the oven and you

00:36:00.319 --> 00:36:03.709
live there you're good me if you failed

00:36:03.709 --> 00:36:05.599

00:36:05.599 --> 00:36:07.939
just like you just keep going about your

00:36:07.939 --> 00:36:09.680
day just like that was weird I tried to

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.430
do that earlier

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:11.779

00:36:11.779 --> 00:36:13.249

00:36:13.249 --> 00:36:17.719
attempts under their belt yeah that's

00:36:17.719 --> 00:36:18.890

appropriate accent I don't just force

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.420

putting to get like if if one of the

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:25.750
possibilities of a perfect apology for

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:27.310

600 dead I think what's going on that

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:02.800
means but obviously we think and my

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.310
brother they're trying to roll out a

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:08.650
global vaccine so they're trying to tap

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:11.530
a global market with vaccines so it's

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:12.850
like all the crows are crowing a virus

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:14.080
it's [ __ ] spreading like wildfire

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.550
there's a thing on Netflix apparently

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:17.410
about this how like diseases could

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.090
spread any like if this disease spread

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:20.770
New York would be dead in ten seconds

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:23.860
blah blah blah blah but again if you

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:25.600
were to be able to fear monger enough

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.450
and then you now like many documentaries

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:29.890
about a guy trying to come up with a

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:31.720
vaccine yeah and like Bill Gates is

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.400
apparently like he's like aw plug me

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.230
into Bill Gates and then we'll sell this

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:37.660
thing to all the countries so now

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:39.250
there's people do they get this is just

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:41.260
a rise to global capital so now there's

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:42.550
people saying like I Oh selling

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:43.990
oxycontin to America was pretty tight

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:48.520
but what if we could make everybody have

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.620
to take vaccines that we sell somebody

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:51.730

own cookies and then be able to the

00:42:52.359 --> 00:42:54.339
local lodge to take in the money rather

00:42:54.339 --> 00:42:55.959
than who the [ __ ] makes those cookies

00:42:55.959 --> 00:42:57.939
and they last forever - don't load it

me you know again I'm not an anti-vaxxer

00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:01.660
but it's like also let me see the

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:03.760
ingredient you're taking steps you're

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.410
getting close well it's where it begins

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:06.819
no they start asking some questions this

00:48:06.819 --> 00:48:08.619
is what pisses me off all down you find

00:48:08.619 --> 00:48:10.510
it you can't even ask questions about

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:12.430
vaccines because you're a quote-unquote

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:14.109
anti-vaxxer which is what a construct of

00:48:14.109 --> 00:48:15.609
the media who is what beholden to

00:48:15.609 --> 00:48:16.990
billionaires so I was like if you're

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:19.210
like well what's in that vaccine they're

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:20.770
like oh you're now a [ __ ] dude

00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:23.170
drinking out of a [ __ ] survival straw

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:24.940
sipping puddles and [ __ ] that would

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:27.339
exist tight yeah that's awesome but it's

00:48:27.339 --> 00:48:28.599
like no no I just want to know what the

00:48:28.599 --> 00:48:30.250
[ __ ] you guys are injecting in my body

00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:31.869
so everybody knows the patreon money is

00:48:31.869 --> 00:48:33.849
eventually going to go towards a

00:48:33.849 --> 00:48:36.250
compound well you're definitely going to

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:39.099
become survivalists well dude if you

00:48:39.099 --> 00:48:40.780
think about it I need a generator for an

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:42.760
Xbox we're hedging our bets we're doing

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.680
good because if [ __ ] does hit the fan

00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:46.660
again there are dudes who have straws

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:48.790
that you can drink a puddle with yes

00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:52.030
that's unique the dogs are full squad

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:54.520
mm-hmm we are a good we can put together

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:56.740
a good compound for sure

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:58.480
an elite combat and that's where you and

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.340
me are gonna have trouble that's where

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:02.440
it's gonna be a lot like Animal Farm how

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:05.920
do you feel a bit of a you know Stalin

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:09.130
Trotsky type situation how we go ahead

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:12.610
guess I'm stuck you're more of an

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:15.280
idealist I'm more of a we gotta kill

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.090
that [ __ ]

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:19.750
I should be well then good thing too

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:21.310

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.980
side together why you know I'm gonna cut

00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:41.200
your head off as soon as you're gonna

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.090
construct an event and blame it on me of

00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:45.700
course ball swag big time people asked

00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:46.960

Foods and like could I like who would I

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.710

if [ __ ] did go down down during it would

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:40.180

gonna quote Hoss in the skeet so he's in

00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:11.490

these people that Rogan might not be the

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:28.130

Norman I was actually talking about it

01:05:13.619 --> 01:05:15.960
cuz he you know I'm not saying he gets

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.940
like anxiety but you know it's it is on

01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:19.710
kind of like I felt we're just kind of

01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:20.579
defending Ari

01:05:20.579 --> 01:05:22.380
just a second ago which is another thing

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:23.730
I didn't want to like publicly defend

01:05:23.730 --> 01:05:25.859
Ari yeah cuz I don't think that's

01:05:25.859 --> 01:05:28.079
helping sure but I think it is kind of

01:05:28.079 --> 01:05:30.029
important for people and and again I

01:05:30.029 --> 01:05:31.349
don't want to talk about it now cuz I

01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:32.700
wasn't talking about it before until I

01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:34.680

[ __ ] I feel like you felt that way

01:05:38.369 --> 01:05:39.690
I've always felt that way the entire

01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:41.910
time but you were you were more so in my

01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:44.309
opinion trash and dudes who are kind of

01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:46.710

01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:49.170
that were taking that route bro taking

01:05:49.170 --> 01:05:51.240
it safe taking that little like yeah

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.130
even if you're not [ __ ] openly

01:05:53.130 --> 01:05:54.539
defending someone definitely don't

01:05:54.539 --> 01:05:56.069
[ __ ] trash him like that I'm saying

01:05:56.069 --> 01:05:59.579
even well even if you were like I think

01:05:59.579 --> 01:06:03.059
I may have trashed Kathy Griffin I for

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:04.890
the trumpet beheading pic I'd like to

01:06:04.890 --> 01:06:10.890

01:06:10.890 --> 01:06:13.109
headed our leader dude what do we make

01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:14.549
fun of her for I think I don't think

01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:15.839
we're actually offended that she cut off

01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:17.279
films I definitely was not offended

01:06:17.279 --> 01:06:18.660
think we laughed about it I definitely

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.190
was not the closest I've come to being

01:06:20.190 --> 01:06:27.900
offended was always tweet and then I

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:29.970
realized I had been had I thought he was

01:06:29.970 --> 01:06:31.230
serious I'm like man this guy really

01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:32.640

someone dies he tweets something like

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:44.670

the games on beat him up dude

01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:50.940

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.900

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.870
can get philosophical about it and be

01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:08.340
like well the thing that's important is

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:09.600
like showing people that comedians

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.740

out yeah he he did yeah well he did this

01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:30.090
thing where you're talking about

01:10:30.090 --> 01:10:31.950
electricity and like how lightning works

01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:33.840

put his whole thing out there yeah but

01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:45.840
basically he was explaining why

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.670
lightning seeks you out due to your

01:10:47.670 --> 01:10:49.740
conductivity is if you go outside you're

01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:50.880
probably gonna get struck by lightning

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.200
