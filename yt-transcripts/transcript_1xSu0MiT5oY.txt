WEBVTT

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.080
all right what up dude what's going on

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:10.290
not too much okay

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.150
yeah use your mouth right to your phone

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:21.090
you're a little quiet yeah yeah you get

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.990
up in that dude I need you to get up in

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.449
there perfect perfect perfect

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.400
but yeah so I I wanted to I wanted to

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.289
hit you up because you uh I was talking

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.600
to you on the on the patreon about you

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:45.750
said you did ketamine treatments okay

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.989
how what was that what was that like to

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.940
the doctor's office I had done previous

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.770
treatments and everything depressions

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.500
everything so they offered the ketamine

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.660
treatment they did the first one for

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.850
free just you kind of get a feel this

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.790
you'll actually get anything out of it

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.890
they pretty much tell you that most of

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.450
people will know after their first

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.189
injection or their first excuse and

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.560
whether or not it works for them so I

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.259
did the infusion it's about 45 minutes

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.530
long the first one wasn't really that

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.840
crazy this is like the lowest dosage my

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.650
tolerance for pretty much every

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.930
medication is very high like you the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.579
initial one wasn't it D really much

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.729
anything but I did notice you know

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.210
noticeably afterwards a good feeling you

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.720
know more happiness more contentment

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.310
there's a little bit more freeing

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.970
afterwards I guess during it was the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.740
first one it wasn't really going into

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.689
the actual K hole the first one that was

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.079
into that consciousness oh my mom was in

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.369
the room cuz you need to have someone

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.280
Drive you out of there you can't drive

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.810
afterwards you need to have you know

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.180
someone to you know take you um so she

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.500
was in the room for the first one just

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.680
cuz I wasn't sure how they know so the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.689
first one was kind of a just because I

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.239
didn't have the full experience the next

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.069
time they injected me was pretty much

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.470
what I expected out of it was I

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.950
she went into the K hole the best way to

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.590
describe it for me would be kind of like

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.530
a spaceship in your mind for me it was

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.980
like a giant black battleship everything

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.390
was black you know I couldn't see

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.620
anything couldn't make out details

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.530
anything mom but essentially it kind of

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.230
felt like a battleship in my mind you

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.860
know you know captain of I guess well I

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.800
was just kind of sitting in there all

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.410
these thoughts just your [ __ ] head

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.990
you really can't control what's what

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.430
you're gonna think what you weren't

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.300
going to think I had thought never had

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.870
in my entire life during it I had

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.760
murdering people and [ __ ] at one point

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.610
what you're totally immobilized you're

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:13.170
totally immobilized still there so

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.820
really realize and you kind of keeping

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.760
focused on keeping your eyes closed and

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.860
keeping in the zone and then you're

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.870
pretty much fine but you can open your

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.459
eyes and you'll kind of realize you're

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.280
some well you just feel so [ __ ] woozy

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.890
and out of it it's like you know so you

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.300
said you're having thoughts of like

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:45.900
killing people and [ __ ] oh [ __ ] hold on

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.330
say there you go I lost you for a second

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.790
so we were saying it was it was a second

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:58.830
time weird like violent thoughts like if

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.900
I hurting people and like hurting myself

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.230
and stuff I mean only last like two or

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.519
three minutes they don't you know pretty

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.380
[ __ ] intense from never having those

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.450
thoughts before in my life sure I'm like

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.019
holy [ __ ] [ __ ] this is pretty crazy

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.239
afterwards I felt [ __ ] fantastic I

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.190
fell like perfect I felt so happy so

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.140
content I don't have any negative

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.479
[ __ ] thoughts in my head I was like

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.210
holy [ __ ] you know

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.919
eventually the ketamine is [ __ ]

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.690
purged whatever thoughts I had at the

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.330
time of hurting myself or you know being

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.949
[ __ ] angry and fun kind of damn dude

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.490
so you so the first time they kind of

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.050
just hit you with a little like just to

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.910
see how you react basically which is I'm

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.350
surprising give that to people for free

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.970
as like a free sample that's pretty wild

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.259
I mean I'm sure can cost them [ __ ] $10

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.960
for a vial they're charging 375 for an

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.940
injection sure so they're making money

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.340
regardless that's a penny out of dollars

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.050
of them so they're gonna give it away

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.970
then get a person in there to get the

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.919
full treatment for like two thousand

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.780
dollars and that was totally legal

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:29.419
probably four or five so sodapeta state

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.180
it's legal and then is the first time he

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.550
said it was just it was pretty mild and

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.870
the second time you entered the

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.570
battleship and then just went to like

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.539
went into the darkness yeah pretty much

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:50.090
just like a [ __ ] giant that's pretty

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.880
much the same similar feeling you know

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.260
the rest of the treatments that are all

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.389
the same I have the same you know kind

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:57.949
of feeling in my head of being total

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:00.470
blackness the battleship just kind of

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.780
cruising around having all these come at

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.090
me I mean trying to you know kind of

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.669
direct some sauce to [ __ ] you're trying

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.280
to work on but you know you know rushes

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.479
through and it's kind of like you can

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.680
only do so much to focus on one thing so

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.909
how many times how many treatments well

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.560
how many like times as you go for the

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:25.099
whole treatment I did they recommend you

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:29.360
do four to six treatments and the issue

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.599
really with it is once the price how

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:35.960
long can cost about two thousand dollars

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.960
for total treatment it only lasts a

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.950
couple months you

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.930
three months in terms of alleviating

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.170
depression and in terms of alleviating

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.970
pressure really only lasts two to three

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:58.970
months you know you did you do ketamine

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.260
before that or was that your first time

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.690
doing it no I've done other psychedelics

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:08.030
so how did you think he compared in

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.820
terms of like alleviating depression to

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.010
like say I don't know what you did like

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:17.660
mushrooms or acid helped quite a bit

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:25.160
with my depression I had done that that

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.330
helped quite a bit I had a good

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.300
afterglow from my LSD trip for like 2 or

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.940
3 months it was a pretty similar

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.790
experience for a significant less cost

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:42.530
and yeah but I mean a lot of the

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.380
literature on just like psilocybin is it

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.970
usually it'll be like six to eight

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.970
they'll have like the results last for

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.450
like up to like eight months typically

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:56.750
and there's there like the stuff I've

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.100
read there's there's like four or five

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.630
they're always really small studies but

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.190
they say they lasted for like six to

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.660
eight they would retest people like six

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.850
to eight months later and they would use

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.410
like the brick back depression scale

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.850
because that's crazy expensive do I mean

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.980
it's cool it's in like a center that's

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:32.930
[ __ ] tight well do they have like

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:34.370
afterward they have like support

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.080
services afterwards there's just kind of

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.849
like they just pump you in and out like

00:08:37.849 --> 00:08:41.080
Wolverine they're like alright later

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.200
it's such a weird

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.210
King so many thoughts and feelings and

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:57.950
you're just kind of realizing how

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.980
insignificant [ __ ] is in the world you

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.110
go back out and do it it's like wow this

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:07.490
shit's like [ __ ] weird dude you top

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:15.020
off the battleship yeah well so you

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.030
would say you had to give it a positive

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.920
review say it works it's just a little

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:34.730
pricey long-term or doing pretty well

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.560
financially and you can afford it

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.390
um initially it's kind of expensive but

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:39.860
maintenance I mean it's only plain like

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.050
600 bucks every you know month or two

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.570
okay so after that it's about damn it's

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:49.060
that's pretty [ __ ] pricey dude yeah

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:53.770
you know they either recommend that or

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:04.340
oh the it's like the yeah it's like the

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:11.480
milder electroconvulsive stuff well I

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.070
guess it'll also it will probably get

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.960
cheaper - as more of them open up I mean

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.340
I think it's probably they're probably

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.900
like kind of politically yeah I don't

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.490
know what the permits are like for the

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.320
ketamine place but I'm sure like local

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.940
politics come into play there's only so

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.350
many permits that come out so they can

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.000
kind of get like a little monopoly for

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.060
the meantime yeah and certainly recently

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.850
they had some article come out of the

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.290
federal government and started looking

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:34.940
for the FDA it started looking at any

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:47.330
exploit actually sending that's pretty

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:47.660
cool

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.220
how and so you're saying over how is it

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.320
now overall would you like in terms of

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.030
you know mine how's that your depression

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:58.070
everything overall now how do you feel

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.560
like you're like your Center have your

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.270
symptoms been like kind of a you know

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.400
abetted by this do you think you like

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.600
how do you feel overall now

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.610
yeah I think overall definitely positive

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:10.839
for like long-term my depression

00:11:10.839 --> 00:11:13.000
everything and if we feel way better

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.910
than I had thought prior to doing it so

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.470
like long-term indefinitely as a

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:23.680
positive overall impact but did you have

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.480
you tried like SSRIs and all that other

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.569
stuff

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:44.199
nothing yeah that's interesting man yeah

00:11:44.199 --> 00:11:45.699
hopefully in gear like you said it would

00:11:45.699 --> 00:11:47.709
be pretty I mean again if you can

00:11:47.709 --> 00:11:48.940
already you already know that you can

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.069
handle I would imagine what I imagine

00:11:51.069 --> 00:11:52.720
would be like large doses of ketamine so

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.130
I'm sure if you got your hands on some

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.139
mushrooms you'd be able to kind of champ

00:11:56.139 --> 00:12:05.920
those yeah but I want to do in

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.540
Philadelphia is start a thing where it's

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.970
like just kind of like a peer-to-peer

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:10.750
place

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.089
all you need is a space and kind of let

00:12:13.089 --> 00:12:14.800
like I mean it's kind of sketchy because

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.079
you'd have to like the materials for

00:12:17.079 --> 00:12:18.310
doing it you'd have to have people to

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:19.899
secure them on their own and kind of

00:12:19.899 --> 00:12:21.519
like word of mouth I guess share them

00:12:21.519 --> 00:12:23.470
but start a place where it was like you

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.110
would have more instead of like like the

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.399
place you're describing like just like a

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:29.380
you know you walk which if it's good it

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.730
exists but you walk in they hook you up

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.019
the transfusions like all right later

00:12:32.019 --> 00:12:32.860
Thanks

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.329
but have a place that's more of like a

00:12:34.329 --> 00:12:36.670
kind of like a group like a you know

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.620
peer-to-peer support with people who are

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.180
taking these substances who can actually

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.040
like support themselves through the

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.329
support each other through the process

00:12:43.329 --> 00:12:44.949
you're not just like any room alone

00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:51.189
freaking out exactly with you yeah it's

00:12:51.189 --> 00:12:52.600
like with peer you know with peer to

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.920
peer group therapy so you're not just

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.019
like what you don't just like rattle

00:12:56.019 --> 00:12:57.519
your cage and oh god I feel better now

00:12:57.519 --> 00:12:58.870
but it's like I I feel like that stuff

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.370
takes like week to week and you know you

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:01.750
meet you have a little bit of community

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.670
it's kind of so I want to try to start

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:18.339
something like that here that's why I

00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:19.690
like mushrooms because it's like

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.000
kind of you can't fake them like you

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.350
know yours all these weird research

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.300
chemicals and you know with ketamine LLC

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.580
all this stuff but with mushrooms it's

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:28.900
like you're either or mushrooms they're

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.760
not you really really can't fake those

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.290
things so I would like to kind of do it

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:32.890
with that

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:34.540
how does we how do you how does weed

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:35.950
help you at all does it do anything for

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:40.110
you not really we pretty much every day

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:43.210
it's not the point pretty much doesn't

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:55.150
affect you yeah I do

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.980
that's kind of my pattern I go I go in

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:58.600
and out I'll like do it for a while I'm

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.130
like these awesome then I'm like is I

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.320
just feel like slow now and I'll stop

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:15.220
then I'll go back and I go okay well

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.710
nice man that was cool yeah cuz I was

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:18.880
interested in that cuz I never really

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.320
[ __ ] with ketamine and now the like

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.550
you can just walk into a place and

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.110
they'll just hit you with it I mean

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:37.060
that's pretty [ __ ] wild yeah I'll

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.710
think about it I'm [ __ ] terrified of

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:46.270
needles but I will so it is so in you

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.770
said it wasn't clean as I like I went to

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:49.660
get Mike my weed card off I figured it

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:50.800
would be like it's some kind of a

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.200
reputable doctor and the guy I went to

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.430
it was like a [ __ ] juggle though I

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:57.120
was like what the [ __ ] is this

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.000
terrifying but yeah I'm gonna look into

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.680
that that's pretty cool I just I figured

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.880
I'd hit you up and see what it was about

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.470
and then you said pretty much the

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:08.080
specifics it was just kind of hazy like

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.580
you went in it was like a battleship

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.589
kind of scenario and a bunch of like it

00:15:11.589 --> 00:15:13.089
was more of like a cathartic thing with

00:15:13.089 --> 00:15:16.120
like more of like deeper lurking darker

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:23.410
thoughts just coming out my brain it's

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:24.880
kind of pretty much putting the world in

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.070
the perspective as opposed to how I've

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.010
been kind of dealing it you know I need

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:31.960
to do things now everything needs to be

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.970
done

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:36.129
affective as opposed to being having

00:15:36.129 --> 00:15:37.839
this imminent doom that was coming on

00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:39.540
gotcha

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.490
what's cool man dude thanks for uh yeah

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:43.959
