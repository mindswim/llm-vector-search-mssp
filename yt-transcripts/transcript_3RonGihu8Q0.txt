audited pretty hard

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.600

to it yeah not bad it's [ __ ] that

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.239

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.000
it it wasn't bad oh you're saying that

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.680
was a rough one in terms of like bu of

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.360
[ __ ] like yeah I mean at the time

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.560
when you're getting crossed you're like

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.360

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.879
you listen to it you're like no I'm not

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.120
well I've said it before it's an it's an

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.840
easy it's an easy question people like

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.879
especially the thrown around white

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.599
supremacists pretty heavily it's like

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.760
well asked me if I worry about the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.599
future of the white race give you an

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.040
honest answer don't really care about it

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.120
that much I'm not worried no I haven't

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.360
thought about it until you brought it up

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.920
now I'm like wait I'm like are we under

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.159
siege am I being

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.120
truthful I never thought about it until

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.480
I heard it's a pretty easy thing it's

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.560
it's a weird thing to assign to somebody

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.560
there a white supremacist like I'm not

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.120
really like did I secretly like code

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.120
1488 in my [ __ ] text or something I

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.200
don't know about we might that would be

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.239
that would be no I never did you did

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.040

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.959
didn't know what they were and I was in

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.159
sixth grade I didn't know what it was I

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.760

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.000
like the really bad to let anyone what's

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.959
that the coolest symbol I've ever ever

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.560
seen but yeah man no that is a uh hammer

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.840
hammer and sickle is a cool one if you

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.560
can draw it hle comes out pretty cool

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.720
bet I'll give the commies that that is a

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.840
tight [ __ ] symbol I wish we had a

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.560
symbol America Eagle we got the Bal no

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.000
but I mean like a a logo you know we

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.319
don't have like a Nike check like all

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.560
the other true totalitarians you get a

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.920
Nike check when you get that yeah we

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.799
don't have one you get let like Twitter

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.439
verified yeah like China has like a star

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.720
do they a star with like stars kind of

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.599
around it nice and they go hammer and

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.680
sickle too within the star which is now

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.959
we're talking even cooler damn and then

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.959
they kill like 80 million people no

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.680
problem tight they were figuring stuff

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.120
out to be fair you got a billion people

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.479
if you kill 80 million that's you know

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.680
they look man those are Co numbers

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.919
trying to figure it out exactly yeah but

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.240
how did how did ma kill a bunch of

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.759
people what happened did they not like I

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:24.919
mean I'm sure they literally killed them

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.880
but they also like starved them there's

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.759
like food programs and work programs I

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.680
think they I think caught a nasty virus

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.880
and people didn't take the necessary

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.560
they probably did they probably did not

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.080
socially distan I think socially

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.080
distancing was physically

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.639
impossible uh and then I think in World

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.199
War II I could be wrong I think they cut

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.919
they opened a dam mhm they were just

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.199
like we got to slow down these [ __ ]

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.479
Japanese coming through here and they

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.160
were just like all right open that Dam

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.120
so they can't cross and it just flooded

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.800
like millions of people died flooded

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.039
some of their own yeah they opened their

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:58.840
own Dam to like [ __ ] it up I could be

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.880
wrong it's just a story I'm remembering

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.880
off off the dumb dude Dam I'm just

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.720
spitting off the Dum bro I didn't I you

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.160
know you know me I'm not a I like

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.639
history I'm not a huge history buff but

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.759
I'm I'm more of a weather man I've been

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.160
I told you I was researching the weather

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.720
dude dude it is I might try to become an

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.160
amateur meteorologist you don't need

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.280
that many I mean you know it' be nice to

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.720
have a Doppler but I can always like

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.160
check out the local channel the Dopp how

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.120
would you get a

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.400
Dopp oh I'm not going to get one I'm but

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.880
I can if I have like a hygrometer um

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.400
somebody to measure wind speeds and I

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.840
can just like observe different types

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.560
clouds like dude if I see a Nimbo

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.520
cumulus or cumulus nimbus there you go

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.440
careful bro cumulo cumulo Nimbus I think

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.199
it's cumulo Nimbus there are cumulus

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.440
right yeah cumulus clouds there's a

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.000
strat cumulus like depending on the

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
different levels Stratos up there yeah

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.319
or if I'm watching the Doppler and you

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:47.080
see the red mixed with the with the

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.800
green oh boy careful what happens then

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.880
they run tors 95% of the time it's going

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.560
to be extreme weather but yeah there's

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.319
5% chance you're going Tado touchdown

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:00.240
yeah dude but I was reading on the fueta

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.800
scale how where where would you rank the

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.800
tornadoes you funny you talk about fueta

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.520
bro fueta was actually growing so fueta

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.919
lived in a uh a town almost a village

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:11.520
excuse me one more days fuga that was

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.960
the first thing came what we're talking

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.680
about fua I was talking about his the

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.240
area was going to get bomb that he lived

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.560
in funny thing was there was uh dense

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.160
fog covering that so they didn't bomb

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.639
that town and they instead I think they

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:26.599
bombed Nagasaki I think instead of the

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:28.560
town that fua lived in and then since

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.199
they spared him he ended up become like

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:32.080
a heavy contributor to meteorology oh my

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.360
god dude wait Vegeta was Japanese yeah

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.160
what the [ __ ] that's crazy I never even

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.400
you didn't think well probably because

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.520
you don't think about that kind of stuff

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.039
I didn't think the Japanese were into

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:42.319
tornadoes yeah bro it's a land of the

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:43.800
gods they have nothing but natural they

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.000
never have tornadoes dude they have

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.840
earthquakes like crazy Japan is land but

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.039
that wouldn't be the might get a too

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:51.560
well I think he got out of Japan of

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.120
course I think he left his course I just

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.360
never for some reason the Vegeta scale I

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.319
never I swear I think they have [ __ ]

00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:59.800
who did you think did it I just never

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.160
thought about yeah dude I didn't even

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.599
realize that that was a partner I

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:03.400
thought you were messing around I

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.039
thought you were just saying like you

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:04.919
don't even think about that kind of

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:07.000
stuff I literally never thought about

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.520
that kind of stuff yeah he's from Japan

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.400
dude wow Veta scale he's from Japan and

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.840
uh he definitely invented It in America

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.120
oh for sure he had it was it's like the

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.680
feta slash someone else scale too we're

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.199
I don't think many other places get

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:24.680
tornadoes like really like us yeah look

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.440
Japan gets Europe doesn't Europe doesn't

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.599
get too many uh it says uh tornadoes in

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:33.720
Japan are like rare but they're not like

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.280
unheard of you know like they happen

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.240
every now and again they get [ __ ] with

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.840
weather yeah yeah yeah they're typhoons

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.000
cause can cause tornadoes what typhoons

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.960
can cause tornadoes what you want what

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.479
you want a big wave or tornator well uh

00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:50.000
typhoon's not a big wave big old wave

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.159
it's like a big storm you're thinking

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:56.080
tsunami oh okay whatever also a Japanese

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.310
word true

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.680
[Laughter]

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.800
that's the only way you can describe a

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.479
humongous wave coming at you is a very

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:06.159
wavy like tsunami you're thinking

00:08:06.159 --> 00:08:07.680
typhoon you're thinking big waves it

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.000
does result in big waves I think a

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.879
typhoon is just a hurricane in that

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:13.639
hemisphere in the ocean doesn't it Go

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:16.479
the opposite direction I swear to god

00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:18.199
dude I'm the weather man you don't [ __ ]

00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:20.080
about it's just a it's just you thought

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.520
typhoons were big waves because of like

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.240
water rides being named

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.879
typhoon 100% I know that's why it's just

00:08:27.879 --> 00:08:30.639
the name of a a tropical py clone like

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:32.479
in that part of the that part of world

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:35.279
so an ocean tornado no it's no like a

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:37.039
like a like a hurricane it's the same as

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:37.919
a

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:41.479
hurricane right below a hurricane oh

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:43.760
okay so yeah I don't even wor I'm I'm

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.200
more of a stormchaser if I hear about a

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.920
typhoon I'm stormchaser I call

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.880
stormchaser dude I love

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.399
tornadoes I call that you got to call it

00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:53.720
on air dude I I did call it on air I

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.080
made it clear that I was I called it on

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.000
air I called on air that I was tornado

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.240
chaser tornado chaser because I didn't

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.000
even have to deck out the Chevy Cruise

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.160
my weight alone in

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.079
it I didn't even have to weigh down the

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:09.240
cruise it would just spin your Chevy

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.440
Cruz in the Gravitron levels you're just

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.600
be

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.279
like damn this thing's [ __ ]

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:18.399
strong what is it on the Vegeta scale

00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:20.279
but yeah man the um I love I love

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:22.680
YouTube and some F5s oh you are

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.560
stormchaser I love F5s YouTube I I I was

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.959
on a kick for like months of just

00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:28.800
watching tornado [ __ ] dude they're

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.880
awesome they rule literally awesome

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.560
that's the way to describe them no yeah

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.680
they are awesome they are awesome

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.160
terrifying dude it's pretty [ __ ] nuts

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.480
man but yeah they uh it was funny though

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.959
because they got into all the history of

00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:42.480
like how weather well they talked about

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.000
like the invention of like weather

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.519
forecasting which goes back to like

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:47.560
Aristotle I think he was you know back

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.720
then he had a couple misses people were

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.839
giving it a shot back then a hard shot

00:09:50.839 --> 00:09:52.839
Aristotle had he called a couple things

00:09:52.839 --> 00:09:54.519
I've been pissed lately every day I wake

00:09:54.519 --> 00:09:56.600
up it's [ __ ] hot out I know I'm done

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.800
dude well if you were paying attention

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.200
to low and high pressure systems you

00:09:59.200 --> 00:09:59.880
know

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.560
high pressure low pressure is bringing

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.160
some cold so such a

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.760
[ __ ] well you can dude uh Da Vinci

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.600
apparently started the hygrometer Da

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.920
Vinci left a a thing of wool outside and

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.200
he would weigh it and he was like damn

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.480
this thing's heavy on some days and he's

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.200
like oh the air has water in it it's

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.640
like holy [ __ ] so then the dude the

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.160
stories of weather inventions are so

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.240
[ __ ] funny there was uh Da Vinci did

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.720
the hygrometer Aristotle tried to do he

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.480
he he got some weather swag but he also

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.120
was like and the [ __ ] Sun revolves

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.600
around on the earth and people were like

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.640
like [ __ ] lost that one but idiot he

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.079
start that's where the term meteorology

00:10:35.079 --> 00:10:37.519
came from it's like meteorology the ter

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:39.160
the word meteor back then was just like

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.959
[ __ ] in the sky it's like oh [ __ ]

00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:42.120
there's meteors and it would be like

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.360
stars [ __ ] or like you know whatever

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.880
it was like clouds and [ __ ] damn um I

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.560
told you that time I've said it on here

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.079
I have so been a couple times one time

00:10:50.079 --> 00:10:51.680
me and my friend were smoking weed

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.600
laying in the back backyard and we saw a

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.600
shooting star and he was like is that

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.079
really like a

00:10:57.079 --> 00:10:59.440
star I've never forgotten it I was so

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.600
high that I was like dude I think like

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.120
this the dumbest understanding of

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.880
science I've ever heard in my life like

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.680
I was like you have no grasp at all of

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.480
like what's out there it's a meteor yeah

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.120
yeah dummy or a meteorite I I quit

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.160
whatever that difference is meteor

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.399
meteorite meteorite is smaller I don't

00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:21.360
think that's true okay that's fine not

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.720
about what's smaller meteorite crashes

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.639
to the Earth yeah meteorites go in the

00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:26.560
atmosphere smaller once it burns to the

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.079
atmosphere sure come on no too small we

00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:31.360
just disintegrate what part are you

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.839
talking about like Stratosphere what

00:11:32.839 --> 00:11:33.720
part are you talking about the

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.839
atmosphere do you know how okay so

00:11:35.839 --> 00:11:37.000
you're talking about hanging pretty low

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.839
to the Earth then well literally hitting

00:11:38.839 --> 00:11:40.480
the Earth reaching the meteorites would

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.440
get in the atmosphere and hit Earth no

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.120
doubt yes small definitely got whittel

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.560
down by the stratosphere some them know

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.279
the stratosphere is like 4,000 degrees

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:49.120
but the air particles are so far apart

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.920
you wouldn't feel it going through there

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.440
you know that's pretty neat that's you

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.360
know dude the book is just just facts

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.920
dude it's just it's just Loosely

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.839
connected facts also yeah I'll I'll eat

00:11:58.839 --> 00:12:00.200
the meter right thing I didn't know that

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.680
I took a chance that's all right well

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.079
you were very bold in your stance on it

00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:05.519
dude all the great weatherman all the

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:06.720
great dude

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.720
G

00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:13.240
galoot [ __ ] uh John celsus John

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.160
Celsius whatever his name is joh cels

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.639
dude for real there's it's like John

00:12:17.639 --> 00:12:19.480
Claude Celsius and there's a dude whose

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.279
name was Fahrenheit the dude who was

00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:24.160
Fahrenheit did uh our whole system

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.440
Fahrenheit system is based on the

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.320
freezing point of water it's like the

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.760
difference between ice and the

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.160
temperature of his own body you know was

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.480
like 98.6 de and then the guy who did

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.000
Celsius originally had uh the freezing

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.199
point of water was 100 degre Celsius and

00:12:38.199 --> 00:12:39.959
the boiling point was Z degrees and as

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:41.199
soon as he died they were like you let's

00:12:41.199 --> 00:12:43.440
flip that around [ __ ] so stupid idiot

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.519
so stupid the first thermometer had no

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:46.880
numbers so I still don't know which one

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.480
we we're Fahrenheit we're Fahrenheit the

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.360
rest of the world Celsius rest everyone

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.160
else and and the scientists within

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.800
America like we also do Celsius because

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.079
it's just much it's an easier thing

00:12:56.079 --> 00:12:58.600
because it's like 32 212 you know

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.399
whatever but the uh although it feels

00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:04.600
like Celsius is a little

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.639
it's not as accurate you know really it

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:11.120
feels like cuz the numbers are

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.199
small like ours is Fahrenheit is much

00:13:15.199 --> 00:13:18.800
more like it's 78 degrees but I bet

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.880
could be wrong

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:24.399
here but like if it's 22 degrees Celsius

00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:27.040
what's 22 22 well think about the it's

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.720
got be like 80 degrees no it's like

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.399
no it's like 70 22 that's 50 would be

00:13:33.399 --> 00:13:37.600
100 degrees you think about it 71 71

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.800
what all right wouldn't 50° Celsius be

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.880
100 degrees Fahrenheit it's basically

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.360
double isn't it I don't think 22 boiling

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.639
point 100's boiling point so you'd think

00:13:47.639 --> 00:13:51.800
it'd be somewhere like double it 50 is

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.360
122 yeah basically some change we don't

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.800
know what's going on dude I know

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.759
everything about the weather right now

00:13:57.759 --> 00:13:59.800
you know less than me some now no I

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.800

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.759
hipped you to [ __ ] dude the first

00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:06.000
thermometer had no numbers it was just

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.880
like it would get hot you would just see

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.880
like a Mercury would stick out you're

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.680
like yeah that wouldn't really do you

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.680
much good look at that' be like yeah I

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.399
knew it was hot hot as [ __ ] this stinks

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:19.440
like check dude dude original weather

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.279
there's actually an award for amateur

00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:23.880
weather forecasting that they they give

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.279
out every now and again so I might try

00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:26.399
to I'm going to try to like that's

00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:27.639
Lifetime

00:14:27.639 --> 00:14:29.800
Achievement yeah but it's tough dude

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.120
again again when you have the Doppler

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.800
going dude that was another thing the

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.120
Doppler I think I told you this the

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.079
Doppler was a military invention some

00:14:37.079 --> 00:14:38.920
British guy was like can we please get a

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.360
[ __ ] laser beam to shoot planes out

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.040
of the air yeah and they're like ah

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.800
here's radar they won't shoot them

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.800
they'll tell you where they are they're

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.920
like fine and they're like damn why are

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.320
the clouds [ __ ] like you know

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.360
different colors and [ __ ] and they're

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.920
like and they figured out that like you

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.000
know when clouds are going this way

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.560
versus that way some weird [ __ ] but it's

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.240
pretty tight that's awesome yeah dude

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.240
they were they started going into the

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.320
different military history of weather

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.680
and how the uh like I told you about the

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.120
Russian thing and all the other stuff

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.480
the uh D-Day was they were like dude

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.160
give us a we need a three-day grace

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.920
period for x amount of humidity low tide

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.399
at a certain time um C you know can't

00:15:11.399 --> 00:15:12.959
rain for like three days and that they

00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:14.560
hit it right on the head and then like a

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.320
week later it just a horrible storm came

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.639
and washed the docks dude it pretty

00:15:17.639 --> 00:15:19.360
[ __ ] nuts it's awesome pretty [ __ ]

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.399
tight but the uh yeah most inventions in

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:25.440
technology are based around War yeah

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.079
like throughout just smashing people

00:15:28.079 --> 00:15:30.240
yeah like World War I yeah for sure but

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.199
no that was uh there was one other thing

00:15:32.199 --> 00:15:34.120
too in terms of the weather was [ __ ]

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.519
it was killing me so [ __ ] funny but

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.720
either way I forget but dude I'm all

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.600

I'm I'm more I'm just more of an

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:55.959
instinctive weatherman true you know I

00:15:55.959 --> 00:15:57.800
Feel It In My Bones yeah meteorologists

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.839
like me you know guys who do the farmers

00:15:59.839 --> 00:16:03.199

we'll see dude a lot of Great Men also

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.399
have you know stuff to do with the

00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:10.680
weather it just happens that way I don't

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.839
know

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.279
what yeah man oh dude this is the thing

00:16:15.279 --> 00:16:16.279
I wanted to talk about so there

00:16:16.279 --> 00:16:17.800
apparently there were two ships it was

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.399
the SS Adelaide or something and the

00:16:21.399 --> 00:16:23.040
actually I think I have it right here

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.440
let me see God damn it Michi stop

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.600
texting me stop texting me what the [ __ ]

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.279
does sches want dude the Stockholm and

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:30.440
the Andrea did you ever hear about that

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.079
what happened dude so this is around the

00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:33.600
time of the Titanic they were two the

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.319
anre Adora was a luxury liner they were

00:16:36.319 --> 00:16:37.880
again same everyone back then in a big

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.680
boat would just be like never going to

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.040
sink this thing yeah yeah and then they

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.839
would go out so the Stockholm was a

00:16:42.839 --> 00:16:44.000
thing from Sweden that was just a

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.240
[ __ ] barge that would supposed to

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.160
just crash through icebergs yeah and

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.360
they had radar at this point but it was

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.240
foggy and apparently the radar was like

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.360
kind of shitty back then so they

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.519
couldn't really for some reason they

00:16:53.519 --> 00:16:54.720
couldn't see until someone was like kind

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.040
of close I don't know if like someone

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.519
threw off the signal so these guys both

00:16:58.519 --> 00:17:01.560
pil both captains were just like we'll

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.959
be fine what the CH we're in the [ __ ]

00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:04.319
ocean we're not going to [ __ ] crash

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:06.360
we're going to hit so they [ __ ] they

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.079
were just flying through the middle of

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:10.039
the ocean Like This Ss stockhom that's

00:17:10.039 --> 00:17:11.799
like basically like maybe not as big as

00:17:11.799 --> 00:17:13.760
a Titanic but like a big luxury ship

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.439
with like I think a thousand people on

00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:18.160
it maybe dude just going going go all of

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.559
a sudden they see blips they come up on

00:17:19.559 --> 00:17:21.679
each other's radar and they're like how

00:17:21.679 --> 00:17:23.240
close is that ship and then they there's

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.600
in dense fog they can't see anything

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.199
they're like try to steer so they're

00:17:27.199 --> 00:17:29.520
trying to both move and they the won the

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.720
uh the Adela D whatever thing was called

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.000
the Italian ship Italian ship in the was

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.240
like you know it was like you know if

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.520
you're on the right side Italian you

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.400
turn left Italians have bad luck with

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.799
cruise ships yo exactly dude so they

00:17:41.799 --> 00:17:43.480
came they made a weird move where it was

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.919
like [ __ ] it we're going to pull over

00:17:44.919 --> 00:17:46.520
into this port but apparently like it

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.760
was like no turns it was like Jersey

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.960
laws like no turn on red kind of [ __ ] so

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.160
like it was weird that they turn this

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.600
way so the Stockholm was like oh [ __ ]

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.600
here's some on our radar we're going to

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.640
turn this way too and they just both

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.240
appeared out of the fog right as they

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.039
were like boom and the

00:18:00.039 --> 00:18:01.400
pierced a hole in this thing like

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.360
immediately people were sleeping like a

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.480
Royal Caribbean just boom killed like I

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.039
think it was like maybe like 80 people

00:18:08.039 --> 00:18:10.360
just instantly died and then water just

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.720
rushed in water just rushed into this

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.640
thing and you know luckily they didn't

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.960
have enough uh whatam a lot of their uh

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.600
Whatchamacallit like Escape boats or

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.600
whatever got trashed but the SS

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.520
Stockholm happened to have all their

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.799
[ __ ] still fine good it was made [ __ ]

00:18:24.799 --> 00:18:26.760
hit icebergs so that ship was fine had

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.919
an ice breaker so exactly so it let all

00:18:28.919 --> 00:18:30.679
their ships out and they got actually

00:18:30.679 --> 00:18:32.240
only the people I think only like a

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.480
couple hundred people died when it

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.559
should have been all the ship sunk the

00:18:35.559 --> 00:18:37.320
ship it's still they it's still sunken

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.919
right now but they uh there was like a

00:18:38.919 --> 00:18:40.240
friendship that happened to be passing

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.600
that like they got all the people off

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.360
for the most part nice but dude being on

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.320
a cruise ship and all of a sudden

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.600
like holy [ __ ] in the [ __ ] ocean in

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.440
at night in the F scary dude the thing

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.960
was like people were swimming there was

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.400
they took on so much water on the bottom

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.600
people were like dude they they got

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.480
[ __ ] up oh just on a [ __ ] Cruise

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.880
dude and he just especially back then it

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.080
must have been a tough business back

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.200
then too because a lot of people were

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.480
taking like cruises in terms of like

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.240
coming from like Italy and Ireland on

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.320

went down with the ship the captain I

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.360
don't think I think I don't think he had

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.960
the honor I don't think he no I would

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.760
dude I would bail on that so I'd be so

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.679
mad of somebody imagine somebody like

00:19:38.679 --> 00:19:40.080
suggesting that to you if you were the

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.280
captain yeah like while the ship saying'

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.960
be like are you going to uh that would

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.799
be a full like dude [ __ ] you on his yeah

00:19:47.799 --> 00:19:49.520

to make sure the lifeboats are operating

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.320
I'll be right back yeah peace but then

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.720
it's like dude I don't know I guess yeah

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.240
I guess you know would word travel that

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.400

00:20:05.159 --> 00:20:06.320
do you think that still applies in the

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.559
military now it should apply to any boat

00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:09.919
true like if you're on one of those like

00:20:09.919 --> 00:20:11.400
paddle boats in like Central Park in

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.080
like the pond I might start taking that

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.240
into driving if I'm driving the car

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.679
someone hits me and I'm like in a thing

a person of color if I had to guess

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.200
because they made Frederick Douglas a

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.640
bit of a [ __ ] why would they why

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.840
would a person of color make Frederick

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.440
Douglas a [ __ ] well a white person

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.000
you think it was like an Indian guy no

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.760
I'm saying a white person would never do

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:52.679
that uh or wouldn't shouldn't be allowed

00:27:52.679 --> 00:27:55.240
to make Fred I think actually Ethan Hawk

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.159
helped direct it as well I think that

00:27:57.159 --> 00:27:58.960
was all he was his message

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.480
need to know Fred Frederick Douglas was

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.840
a [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah Frederick Douglas

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.640
was an arrogant [ __ ] was he a dick in

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.039
the show he's kind of an arrogant

00:28:06.039 --> 00:28:08.360
[ __ ] he's the man but he's still

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.960
like I don't know you'd be surprised

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.320
well to be me I mean the the show

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.080
doesn't claim really to be historically

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:18.960
accurate yeah yeah but it's kind of true

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.320
I just heard a Douglas quote today and

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.559
he was talking about how like you know

00:28:21.559 --> 00:28:24.519
in order to keep people liking their I

00:28:24.519 --> 00:28:26.559
think this was Doug to keep people like

00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:28.279
being a slave they have to be ignorant

00:28:28.279 --> 00:28:29.760
and not be able to read so maybe he was

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.360
just kind of sick of like being the only

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.840
dude knew how to read that no he's like

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.360
cocky he's like arrogant like I look

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.440
good [ __ ] like that he was fly he was

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.760
pretty fly in the show he's like

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:44.360
fly lots of lots of babes yeah dude I

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.640
mean dude imagine back then he was I get

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.080
it Frederick douas was definitely

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.880
probably the man SW swaged out for sure

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.039
but I'm saying you've got to see the

00:28:51.039 --> 00:28:52.279
show they make him like an arrogant

00:28:52.279 --> 00:28:54.120
[ __ ] versus [ __ ] up dud yeah who

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.240

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.160

finally we got an Indian in the white

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.760
house we need an Indian we needed a

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.720
powerful

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.079
so this is something they've attacked

00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:30.920
her for not attacked but like you know

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.240
Drew trying to took away some of her PO

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.319
Thunder were they is she not black I

00:42:35.319 --> 00:42:36.400
think people are trying to say she's

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.559
half she's

00:42:38.559 --> 00:42:40.559
Jamaican

00:42:40.559 --> 00:42:42.760
Jama really she like I'm a vice

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.440
president now are we allowed to do

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.800
Jamaican accent I I think I think uh I

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.599
think you can yeah totally I think as

00:42:49.599 --> 00:42:50.880
long as you don't put on the hat with

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.599
like fake dreadlocks that's that's why

00:42:52.599 --> 00:42:54.400
you can still do Jamaican is so many

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.599
white people the people that police does

00:42:57.599 --> 00:43:00.000
Chad Hanks is goat dude that guy rules

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.359
he also did a pro Biden Jamaican boy

00:43:03.359 --> 00:43:05.800
dude I was so hyped for that uh Chad

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.040
Hanks rules Chad Hanks track one Chad

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.920
one and uh the problem the reason we're

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.280
still allowed to make fun of Jamaican

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.440
accents is because all of the rich kids

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:18.359
that police cancel culture all the

00:43:18.359 --> 00:43:20.920
Improv kids were Rich so they went to

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:24.839
Jamaica as kids every single anti-canc

00:43:24.839 --> 00:43:27.440
culture kid has a picture of them as a

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:30.640
girl with cornrow and hookah shells or

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.920
puka shells in their hair dude so you're

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.599
allowed to stay the bum CL Boy The Boy

00:43:35.599 --> 00:43:37.319
true because they won't get you on that

00:43:37.319 --> 00:43:39.680
because if they do you'll go you

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.599
basically did black face with your hair

00:43:41.599 --> 00:43:43.119
did a little bit ago did you ever hear

00:43:43.119 --> 00:43:46.000
the argument against uh why what the

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.319
[ __ ] was it so there was an argument

00:43:47.319 --> 00:43:48.359
saying like all right well if black

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:49.800
women throw like blonde wigs in their

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.240
hair all the time why can't a white

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:53.119
chick throwing some braids and the

00:43:53.119 --> 00:43:55.119
argument against it is like Somewhere In

00:43:55.119 --> 00:43:58.119
Like New Guinea or something

00:43:58.119 --> 00:43:59.400
there's like black people with blonde

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.319
hair they're like see there's some

00:44:01.319 --> 00:44:04.280
people there therefore it's you can only

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.480
have hair that you're ancestors head

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.680
it's kind of yeah it's the kind of the

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.839
thing so like well technically there's

00:44:08.839 --> 00:44:10.680
like people over there it's just it's

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:11.800

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.680
days to get our racial complaints out

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.559
true before Biden takes office and then

00:44:20.559 --> 00:44:22.000

00:45:07.599 --> 00:45:10.440
aspect of it odd as a system of like

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.559

the only thing I M because I was

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.480
thinking about it as I got that's not a

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:10.440
stereotype that's just the truth exactly

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:12.960
come on man if you if you doubt me check

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.280

about how white first off it was a it

00:50:24.599 --> 00:50:26.960
was a misquote Hitler didn't write this

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:29.920
but that was that doesn't let deshun

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.040

it's off the hook I'm was saying I

00:50:36.079 --> 00:50:37.920
didn't say I didn't use a bad analog Des

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.200
Shawn Hitler I I wasn't saying I'm

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.640
saying I can't you careful saying that

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.440
Deshawn Hitler wasn't able to Desa

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:45.480
Hitler San Jackson Jackson careful

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:47.280
saying Des Shawn Jackson wasn't supposed

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.880
to quote Hitler but Desa Jackson was

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.359
Defensive he

00:50:51.359 --> 00:50:53.520
accidentally didn't quote Hitler he was

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.799
trying to quote Hitler that's what's

00:50:55.799 --> 00:50:57.079
funny about it people like he didn't

00:50:57.079 --> 00:50:58.480
even quote Hitler that Hitler didn't say

00:50:58.480 --> 00:50:59.680
that it's like well he thought Hitler

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.200
said that who said it who who's I don't

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.680
know it was gibberish it was made up

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:04.000
gibberish just like Mark it was just

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.440
like Hitler yeah car Mark no he's like

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:09.079
Hitler Hitler said that it was something

00:51:09.079 --> 00:51:10.280
about like white people are going to be

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.720
shocked when they find out the true Jews

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:13.000
are black and they've been treating him

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.760
bad and which it's like first off Hitler

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.599
would have this is crazy because Hitler

00:51:17.599 --> 00:51:19.559
didn't treat who he thought the true

00:51:19.559 --> 00:51:22.079
Jews were pretty good you know he wasn't

00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:24.000
like being nice to the real Jews I

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.200
wonder what Hitler yeah how do you think

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.720
Hitler like felt about black people back

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:29.480
then maybe Hitler he wasn't a big fan

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:32.480
really he wasn't not at all no I don't

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:33.920
think who you like better I think he

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.200
liked the whites the most he like who

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.599
did Hitler like better Jewish people or

00:51:37.599 --> 00:51:39.200
black people be honest truthfully I

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.440
think he liked black people more than

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:42.760
Jews sick I think he really had a he

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:43.960
didn't know the truth if he known the

00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:45.680
truth then I think perhaps Hitler did

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.839
know the truth you think so and that's

00:51:47.839 --> 00:51:49.079
why he was trying to get he was like get

00:51:49.079 --> 00:51:50.920
these imposters out of

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:53.480
here we got a couple more

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.920
days black people are the only people to

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.319
beat Hitler at the Olympics to beat

00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.400
[Laughter]

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:00.599
yeah that would have been a fun day

00:53:00.599 --> 00:53:02.880
though what the German Olympics so the

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.280
Germans CR I just watched the thing in

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.799
the 36 I believe Germany's medal count

00:53:06.799 --> 00:53:10.480
won the 1936 Olympics Stoners Google

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:13.000
that look it up try not to be too biased

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.240
dude I think the metal count the US was

00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:19.000
second really that's what's

00:53:19.359 --> 00:53:22.359
up yeah man exactly right bam who knows

00:53:22.359 --> 00:53:25.240
1936 Olympics like me and why just that

00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:27.680
year by nine gold medals they won yeah

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:29.200
they were killing it yeah us came in

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:32.040
second with 24 Germany had 33 I think

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.400
there was like but some of the events

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.280
were like riding a horse through like a

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.440
swamp it's not fair they were just doing

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.280
wild events German [ __ ] yeah just

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:42.119
Absolute German [ __ ] yeah dude yeah

00:53:42.119 --> 00:53:43.760
I was reading a little Beyond Good and

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:45.760
Evil by but there were quotes I will say

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:47.680
this and a lot of people point to this

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.599
that like Owens was over there and he

00:53:49.599 --> 00:53:51.319
was like I've never been treated better

00:53:51.319 --> 00:53:53.000
so there was [ __ ] like that but that's

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.359
because was that what Deshawn Jackson

00:53:54.359 --> 00:53:58.160
was quoting yes no Des Jackson's you can

00:53:58.160 --> 00:53:59.520
probably find deshun Jackson's quote

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:00.480
Yeah find out what he was actually

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.920
quoting for

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:05.480
serious he was quoting farakhan who I

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:07.839
think in turn was quoting Hitler so he

00:54:07.839 --> 00:54:09.240
was paraphrasing desan Jackson was

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:11.440
quoting Hitler accident like he was

00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:13.880
trying to damn that sucks when you're

00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:15.480
trying to quote Hitler and you I mean a

00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:17.559
Faron quote a Faron quote is good too

00:54:17.559 --> 00:54:18.599
but it sucks when like you're trying to

00:54:18.599 --> 00:54:19.799
quote Hitler what are you trying to do

00:54:19.799 --> 00:54:21.599
there L you trying to act like he wasn't

00:54:21.599 --> 00:54:24.079
quoting Hitler no I appreciate your

00:54:24.079 --> 00:54:27.079
loyalty your brand loyalty

00:54:27.079 --> 00:54:28.640
get it no it was like a Snapchat or his

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:31.559
Instagram St from his Instagram it said

00:54:31.559 --> 00:54:33.640
it's a a book and it says Hitler said

00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:35.640
and it was highlighted it says because

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:38.040
the white Jew knows that the Negroes are

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:40.160
the real children of Israel and to keep

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:42.680
America secret the Jews will blackmail

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.400
America they they will extort America

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.280
their plan for world domination won't

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:49.359
work if the Negroes know who they are

00:54:49.359 --> 00:54:51.040
the white citizens of America will be

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:53.200
terrified to know that all this time

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:54.280
they've been mistreating and

00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:55.880
discriminating and lynching the children

00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:57.559
of Israel

00:54:57.559 --> 00:55:00.480
oh so okay he was just quoting

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.799
farakhan fair enough literally it says

00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:04.599
Hitler said that was a Hitler quote that

00:55:04.599 --> 00:55:06.520
he posted he what he thought was a

00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.280
Hitler quote he tried to share was that

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:10.440
a Hitler quote the true question it was

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.680
not a slander Hitler basically heed

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:16.200
Hitler yes that's such a weird Twist of

00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:18.640
logic look Hitler said uh yeah that

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:20.400
wasn't actually Hitler so he's fine he

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.400
like footnoted his his like bibliography

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:26.520
was like Hitler page 32

00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:29.039
yeah it was like Jew get your [ __ ] it

00:55:29.039 --> 00:55:31.799
wasit bestseller knock it the [ __ ] off

00:55:31.799 --> 00:55:33.599
je could you cut it out I'm trying to

00:55:33.599 --> 00:55:36.160
run a damn country all those books are

00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:39.160
like get your [ __ ] [ __ ] now [ __ ]

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:40.559
yeah yeah yeah how to be a kick-ass

00:55:40.559 --> 00:55:42.480
woman that was Hitler's first book it

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:45.119
was like 10 ways to be a kickass

00:55:45.119 --> 00:55:47.760
Nazi uh so he was quoting Farrakhan but

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.880
he was like look man even Hitler knew

00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:52.039
the truth about Jews and black people

00:55:52.039 --> 00:55:53.960
yeah and then everybody was like no you

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:56.640
can keep your job and then he got hurt

00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.160
and hasn't done [ __ ] really yeah desun

00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:02.880
Jackson sucks damn dude I mean what was

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:04.359
his point to show like look Hitler knew

00:56:04.359 --> 00:56:07.680
the truth his point was the Jews of good

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:10.160
the Jews aren't the true Israelites

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:11.480
that's what deshun Jackson was trying to

00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:13.520
say the black people were the true Jews

00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:15.319
and that white people who were lynching

00:56:15.319 --> 00:56:17.520
them were going to be pretty upset when

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:19.559
they found out they were lynching Jews

00:56:19.559 --> 00:56:22.520
which I think is pretty funny to imagine

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:23.960
well I'll be some dude in the South that

00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:27.000
just lynched a black guy for crime being

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.480
like you telling me he was Jewish oh my

00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:32.119
God I wouldn't have done

00:56:32.119 --> 00:56:34.319
that I'm just so uncomfortable by this

00:56:34.319 --> 00:56:35.799
conversation dude is now a new

00:56:35.799 --> 00:56:37.960
Progressive and a liberal it's like what

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.280
do I do when black guys are doing

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.359
racially unsavory things I'm just going

00:56:41.359 --> 00:56:43.920
to be silent this isn't my time true I

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:45.680
don't like when Des Jackson it that's

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:47.680
like a bug in a Westworld Bots software

00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:49.839
when you're like I don't know what to do

00:56:49.839 --> 00:56:51.680
about this I'll just be quiet when the

00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:53.359

00:56:53.359 --> 00:56:55.960

be upset that we gave up on the Trump

00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:19.119
chain we were never really on it uh

00:58:19.119 --> 00:58:21.079

[ __ ] up here you can have it I know it

00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.880
sucks to reward people for such Behavior

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.760
we had to board up all the waas just in

00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.079
case they lost [ __ ] cuz white people

00:58:45.079 --> 00:58:47.319
were going to go break

00:58:47.319 --> 00:58:50.000
Wawas yeah and then the true Israelites

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.559
would probably come in and steal some

00:58:51.559 --> 00:58:53.079
[ __ ] chips and

00:58:53.079 --> 00:58:57.799
[ __ ] true Israelites do [ __ ] love RI

00:58:57.799 --> 00:59:00.480
it is funny it is a funny reaction to

00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:03.240
being like I my whole entire like I'm

00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:05.160
I'm threatened my whole entire existence

00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:07.280
is threatened on like the you know my

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:10.160
racial makeup I'm going to go now take

00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:12.599
consumer goods yeah I'm going to I need

00:59:12.599 --> 00:59:13.960
you know what for this I will take a

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:16.520
large TV and I'll still be mad and it's

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:19.720
like no we're even [ __ ] you got the flat

00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:22.400
screen true it's not enough dude deal it

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.000
it's just a strange reaction man it's

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.200
it's a you know it's not it's not

00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:27.160
talking that I'm not talking about the

00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:28.880
true Israelites looting targets what I'm

00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:29.799
talking about about the white guy who

00:59:29.799 --> 00:59:31.760
breaks the window and I'm talking about

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.640
it's just funny that we had to board up

00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:35.520
all these shops just in case the left

00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:37.680
lost yeah and then we all have to sit

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:40.119
there and be like how bad is the right

00:59:40.119 --> 00:59:41.480
yeah it's like we literally were

00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:43.559
threatened with violence in this country

00:59:43.559 --> 00:59:46.200
if the left didn't get their way yeah

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:47.799
that seems like a problem to me pretty

00:59:47.799 --> 00:59:50.160
bad granted I'm good I don't want [ __ ]

00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.760
to continue I hope Trump shuts the [ __ ]

00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:53.880
up I even if he did get cheated which is

00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:56.520
a massive crime pry [ __ ] okay I don't

00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:59.400
care I don't want to deal with it I'm

00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:04.079
lazy Let It Go but rewarding people by

01:00:04.079 --> 01:00:05.559
threatening everybody with violence is

01:00:05.559 --> 01:00:07.880
bad and I think that's what we just did

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.559
yeah in my opinion I think you're right

01:00:10.559 --> 01:00:12.000
what's also too it's like dude to get

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.359
caught up in the spectacle of it and

01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:14.480
just be like I mean that's the other

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.520
thing too it's like I don't have a if I

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.599
had a restaurant right now it's not

01:00:16.599 --> 01:00:18.599
really a spectacle true if you guys shut

01:00:18.599 --> 01:00:20.559
down right now and I'm like dude get the

01:00:20.559 --> 01:00:21.920
[ __ ] out of here that's that's a weird

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.960
thing too about people are getting so

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.559
comfortable I'm friends with the guys at

01:00:24.559 --> 01:00:26.039
the stand and I talk to them a lot

01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:28.760
they're like we need to [ __ ] open I

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.960

think also with the co thing I think

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.720
people will relax on it I think it to me

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:44.400
it seemed a lot like the left was just

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.319
trying to exacerbate problems you know

01:01:46.319 --> 01:01:47.640
what I mean like everybody was like we

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.160

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.920

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:26.240
we just forget about it and move on

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:27.599

and meanwhile it's just like you know

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.480

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:37.079
hundreds of thousands of people which

01:04:37.079 --> 01:04:39.160
again it's like I don't think they did

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:40.319
they haven't killed 100 thousand yet

01:04:40.319 --> 01:04:42.359
apparently they didn't kill that's that

01:04:42.359 --> 01:04:43.720
was the big argument apparently Trump

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.920
didn't go into any wars so it's like

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.720
Trump was that was that because of trump

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.440

he was setting the stage that's the

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.520
other thing too it's like was that

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.079
