00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.640
yeah i'm here to bully chad not a lot of

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.320

me don't worry

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.920

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.959

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.239

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.760
picturing stanhope through the whole

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.799
thing so it's funny

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.120

great when this comes out that's a bold

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.599
stance to take either way like

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:57.680

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.800

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.560
every podcast i go on yeah these drinks

oh just uh some shitty

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:18.080
comedy club is like a friday saturday

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.199
very porky's

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:22.479
it was like a country western like

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:25.520
dance club but they did comedy

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.840
and they put you up on the premises and

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.720
it's they go

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.240
just a cinder block

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.840
it should have been a walk-in like

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.759
cooler or something but there's a cinder

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:36.560
block

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.680
gray with a bed and a tv nothing

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.599
the only thing walking distance was

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:42.800
going down like a

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.000
a highway where with no sidewalk for a

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.240
mile to a waffle house

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.720
or wait for the kitchen to open at night

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.000
and i remember just sitting there

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.520
because there's nothing to do nowhere to

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.039
go and i was sitting in that room

00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:56.160
watching a

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.560
all-day marathon of one of those uh

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.000

blended in my walls were gray cinder

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:10.400

[ __ ] i was like yes

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.840
this is the best prank perfect

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.559
when we read stanhope's first or the

00:22:40.559 --> 00:22:42.159
second book that we read

00:22:42.159 --> 00:22:43.919
about the audiobook john helped

00:22:43.919 --> 00:22:46.159
specifically i highlighted all the gay

00:22:46.159 --> 00:22:48.000
chapters for you to read because i

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.640
thought it'd be funny

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:54.640
i had to read all the gay stuff

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.799
well gay people are probably more uh

00:22:56.799 --> 00:22:58.960
likely to listen to your voice

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.159
yeah that was an idea

00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:06.880
no i saw you and i was like we had

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.600
some kind of gay phone sex idea what was

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.400
the idea

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.360
for you for to do gay erotica audio

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.080
books

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.919
you were going to write them and uh

00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:17.360
submit them and i was going to read them

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.440
for audible

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.520
i think that's a good idea [ __ ] you

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.120
would have made a million dollars

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.200
very easy well maybe we'll make half

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.640
that now yeah

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.280
i'll write one yeah but they get because

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.679
i i remember having really funny ideas

00:23:31.679 --> 00:23:32.559
that

00:23:32.559 --> 00:23:35.520
you know how they make uh cartoons for

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.039
children but they actually

00:23:37.039 --> 00:23:39.039
steer the dialogue towards adults as

00:23:39.039 --> 00:23:40.400
well yeah this would have

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.919
we were gonna i was gonna write gay

00:23:41.919 --> 00:23:43.760
erotica but so

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.880
so people that would get the joke see

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.520
where

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.720
chad check he's

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.520
many people

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.520
like overcompensate if they know they're

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.880
going to a comedian's house

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.159
ask uh

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:41.760
shane because it's you were here at the

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.280
beginning

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.359
and now i'm like like it's a where are

00:34:45.359 --> 00:34:46.639
they now kind of thing like

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:49.919
what has happened since you left here

00:34:49.919 --> 00:34:52.560
like what's different here than when you

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.760
left because when you said

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.520
last time i saw you as patches of hair

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.200
and i thought wait

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.320
when i was a young comic i had

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.440
alopecia areata where from stress like

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.280
clumps of hair would come out and i

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.720
immediately thought of that when you

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:07.280
said

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.040
oh wait no yeah when i shaved this

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.800
shaving chunks out yeah

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.320
in fact i think i took a chunk out the

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.680
first night i was here which was enough

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:14.560

28 days uh news blackout and for a while

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.640

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.280
cutting a chunk of doug's hair out every

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:21.680
night

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.720

yeah but i realized i have not left here

00:35:40.079 --> 00:35:42.079

00:35:42.079 --> 00:35:43.520

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:35.760
let's take a quick break

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.720
no i'm still in eugene smoke valley

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.200
waiting

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.599
uh waiting for the fire to come over the

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:42.319
hill

00:41:42.319 --> 00:41:44.720
how close is it to you it's in

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.079
springfield so

00:41:46.079 --> 00:41:48.880
it'll probably do a bunch of math and

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.280
losing

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.680
once it gets in there and it smokes all

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.920
that meth up in springfield it'll it'll

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:00.880
probably

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.440
just fizzle out after you know burning

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.079
bear

00:42:04.079 --> 00:42:05.839

00:42:05.839 --> 00:42:08.000
little projects it never finishes before

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:08.960
it gets there

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.200
it's possible they might try to get help

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.480
and then they could

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:15.119
send a hot garbage sack over to warn the

00:42:15.119 --> 00:42:17.839

it was it

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:24.480
didn't go well that was one i thought

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.079
but then there were others i tried i

00:43:26.079 --> 00:43:26.400
know

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:29.200
this doesn't sound i tried to read my

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:29.599
read

00:43:29.599 --> 00:43:31.359

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:00.559
a normal conversation yeah

00:53:00.559 --> 00:53:01.599

00:53:01.599 --> 00:53:03.920
introspective norm please let me know

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.079
but still a little goofy yeah oh yeah

00:53:06.079 --> 00:53:06.960
you can put some slapping

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.200
you wrote him perfectly artie lang could

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.920
probably do it

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.480
there was one one thing i had to ask you

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:16.559
about james

00:53:16.559 --> 00:53:18.160

everybody doesn't like that guy

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:22.960
apparently

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:25.359
that's a bummer norm would probably do

00:53:25.359 --> 00:53:28.240
it he just asked

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.480
yeah i told you there's been too many

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:33.760
unanswered texts so i'm not going to

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.400
assess

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:36.640
my best friend i can't tell him you got

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:38.079
a gig to do

00:53:38.079 --> 00:53:40.160
his voice but you feel like you need

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:42.800
some pointers and then have him say

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:44.480
how would you say this and then he reads

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.319
it to you and we record the whole thing

00:53:46.319 --> 00:53:48.160
again again i would have no problem

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:50.240
calling him a single party consent state

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.760
if you can get him to read it on the

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:52.480
