and welcome to the

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.759

that is online in virtual um the first

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.920
module the thing that i'm starting with

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.679
that i'm going to kick this all off with

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.800
is acceptance and commitment therapy

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.199
why well i happen to be researching it

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.560
right now and

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.840
i can say without a doubt it's been the

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.960
one of the most helpful things i've ever

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.880
learned about in practice practiced

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.160
practiced told myself no more redos i'll

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.000
sit here and redo this thing forever if

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.040
you let me

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.800
so there's going to be some glitches

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.079
bear with me

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.960
um yeah this thing's been easily the

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.559
most helpful thing i've ever done for

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.160
myself personally

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.520
it has i mean the benefits to it

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.120
and i came into it knowing nothing about

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.640
this you know you went to social work

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.399
school for two years

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.359
and where was this but you know i'm not

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.640
gonna

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.760
be a negative nancy um but yeah this has

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.400
been

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.159
i've been trying to meditate forever and

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:07.840
you know to know a veil i would just sit

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.520
in a chair and be like

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.960
you know like am i breathing right and

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.040
doing act and learning because act kind

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.280
of breaks mindfulness down in a way for

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.479
me personally

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.280
that i was able to get it to the point

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.320
where i was able to start like

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.080
meditating i'm able to start

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.720
you know like what being in the present

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.200
moment

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.200
actually means rather than like a cool

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.040
instagram post like to actually

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.640
do that and act out of that frame rather

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.280
than kind of

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.920
lost in your head and you know all this

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.439
sounds very general but act

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.720
in my opinion gives you very basic um

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.520
and digestible bits of information that

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.119
you can implement in your life

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.799
that can and this is the target this

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.560
little quote right here

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.159
this an act is trying to teach us like a

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.159
very basic uh

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.079
set of skills to improve our life

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.600
there's nothing vague about it

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.479
it's very direct and very explicit so

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.159
here's where we're trying to get to

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.840
at the end of all these learning modules

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.280
there'll be a few

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.119
so think of a person who is able to

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.319
experience both

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.000
pleasant and painful thoughts and

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.560
emotions without struggle or defense

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.040
who at the same time can stay in the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.480
present moment

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.080
meaning paying attention to what they're

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.959
actually doing and be mindfully aware

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.120
of self narratives that might interfere

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.560
with effective action

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.480
and who can also connect with core

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.080
personal values in life

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.319
and direct problem-solving efforts in

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.160
line with those values

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.000
this is where act can get you or at

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.640
least push you towards this

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.239
i mean let's let's think about this is

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.000
like uh let's think about the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.920
alternative so think of a person who

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.519
cannot experience both pleasant or

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.360
painful thoughts and emotions

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.040
without struggle or offense so all day

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.720
long you know you're just doing

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.760
something you screw it up and you're

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.000
like

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.160
god i suck and now you're literally just

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.599
being like i do suck

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.560
oh my but at the same time can can't

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.080
stay in the present moment so you're at

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.000
a thing you're trying to enjoy a party

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.239
or a moment you start being like

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.080
damn my brother's so much more jacked

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.280
than me

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.040
god and now you're just in your head you

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.319
can't enjoy you're not in the present

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.959
moment

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.319
and you're not aware of the self

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.840
narratives the stories you're making up

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.599
about yourself the evaluations you're

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.120
calling yourself a loser

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.280
and you believe it therefore you're

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.959
taking actions to prove you're not a

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.560
loser you're you're like if i get the

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.040
new

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.280
uh bmw 946 then my family will know i'm

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.120
not a loser and you're working overtime

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.400
i was like dude what are you doing come

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.280
to the party look

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.879
i gotta get this car i need to prove

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.720
that i'm not a loser

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.400
and then you have no vet your values

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.680
yeah you think family's important but

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.959
you've got to prove that you're not a

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:37.840
loser

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.440
this is you know maybe this sounds kind

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.959
of crazy but it's like

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.799
think of a person who's able to just

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.920
experience that one thought like man

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.640
it's like

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.400
i suck and just go huh

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.400
interesting thought anyway what was i

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.319
doing today oh yeah

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.040
i'm recording psycnol why because i

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.879
would love for there to be

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.400
a big public

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.040
suppository of information designed to

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.720
help people out of ruts

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.280
people that don't have access to a

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.000
therapist

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.599
or maybe they went to a therapist and

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.200
therapist was kind of weird which a lot

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.560
of them are

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.079
and you know i'm not saying people

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.120
shouldn't go to therapy i think it's

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.560
awesome i've done it

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.799
helped me tremendously but not everyone

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:21.840
can do it and

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.639
not everyone likes it so here let there

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.160
be something that

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.120
can just help people that's valuable um

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.120
or i could be a little squirrely weirdo

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.400
and be like

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.240
people think this is cool this is what

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.840
act is trying to tell you how to do

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.240
what do you actually value and just move

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.000
towards that and your weird little

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.560
anxieties your depressive you know poor

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.600
me funks

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.360
just kind of melt away without having

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.120
being like blasted by like

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.639
let's take you on these pills and then

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.160
your bad thoughts will stop with these

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.440
if they don't stop try these spills

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.800
combined with this practice and look at

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.240
yourself in the mirror tell yourself

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.520
you're the best

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.280
nah man act doesn't really mess with

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.000
that act is like jedi training

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.120
which is like you know if you know the

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.280
difference between jedis and siths

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.919
jedi's believe that a lot of our

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.840
destructiveness comes from our

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.400
um the power of our emotions and it's

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.000
not like we cut off from our emotions

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.720
but

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.360
in order to kind of control our emotions

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.320
we need to

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.400
be we need to engage in a more

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.919
harmonious

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.919
um interaction with everything around us

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.759
that's why jedi's you kind of just

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.520
you're not like running from it or

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.120
trying to control it you're just letting

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.800
things be what they are

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.720
and moving in a direction that you

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.479
personally deem

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.720
worthwhile good valuable whatever

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.919
whereas the sith

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.880
wants to dominate control why because

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.199
when you're running purely on emotions

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.520
it you typically need to try to control

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.360
them because a lot of times they're very

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.479
unpleasant

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.400
and that ends in a lot of destructive

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.039
kind of darth maulish behaviors

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.680
um all right so i promised myself i

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.199
wouldn't ramble and guess what

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:59.280
too bad all right so here's a

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.319
really short summation of what act is

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:03.840
we'll get into these three

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.600
these things will be little separate

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.600
many modules but

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.039
all right so act acceptance and

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:10.720
commitment therapy

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.639
unlike a lot of other therapeutic

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.800
approaches operates on the idea that

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.319
psychological suffering

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:18.960
isn't some sick or abnormal thing to be

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.720
treated and cured

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.800
from the act standpoint things like

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.800
depression and anxiety are just normal

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.720
byproducts of the human mind

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.280
attempting to get rid of symptoms is

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.280
giving these inner experience

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.039
inner experiences power that they don't

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:35.440
deserve labeling something like anxiety

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.960
or depression as a symptom

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.880
rather than simply acknowledging it as a

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.400
fleeting experience

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.400
locks us into struggle with it a

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.080
struggle that we don't end up winning in

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.680
any sense in fact the struggle to

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.759
control our disordered thoughts and

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:48.560
feelings

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.280
very often ends up dominating our lives

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.599
demanding tons of time and energy into

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:54.319
fighting this

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:56.800
thing that we can't really touch or see

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.479
rather than living our lives

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:01.360
doing the things that we find meaningful

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.599
act treats psychological suffering as

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:05.280
something like the common cold

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.479
rather than leprosy rather than focusing

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:09.360
on our problems

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.919
act instead asks us to define the life

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:13.199
we truly want to live

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.039
while giving us the skills needed to

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:17.039
deal with and ultimately accept the

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:19.120
stuff that pops up in our minds as we do

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.000
so

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.400
weirdly this ends up reducing things

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.840
like anxiety depression

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.039
substance abuse etc as a byproduct

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:29.599
not that it goes away but it isn't just

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:31.440
as important once we start engaging in

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.039
meaningful behaviors

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:36.160
so what is the thing what are the skills

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.199
act gives us

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:39.360
to help us move in the direction we want

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.880
because typically when we try to

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.400
you know move in this direction these

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.160
directions we find valuable we you know

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.280
we start to get a little anxious we

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.800
start to get a little judgy we start to

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.759
be like you know

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.919
our self-conceptualizations pop up like

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:51.599
yeah well you know we we're not really

00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:52.639
the kind of person

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.720
all the rules that we make up how do we

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.840
just kind of

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.319
not ignore that stuff but just let it be

00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:00.160
just let it kind of pass

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.000
how do we do that psychological

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.080
flexibility and i'll get more in depth

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.360
in this but i want to give people a

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.560
heads up

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.639
psychological flexibility is a set of

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:09.759
skills that

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:11.759
it's half mindfulness skills so these

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:13.680
are the mindfulness skills right here

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.680
these are the behavioral skills so it

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.360
starts with being present focusing on

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.479
the here and now

00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:20.560
accepting this is this is one skill set

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.000
um more through the mindfulness

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.280
accepting the content

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.720
that kind of pops up in your thoughts

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.199
bodily sensations memories etc

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:29.199
being able to diffuse from your thoughts

00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:30.639
meaning you know

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:33.680
observe them without a thinking they're

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.760
necessarily true or just having them

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.360
dictate your behavior

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.039
and then working on kind of the way you

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.880
view yourself your self story

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.360
uh rather than being like a self i'm i'm

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.360
getting too far into it but

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.959
basically mindfulness behavioral stuff

00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:50.800
that's all you need to know when you

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.040
master this skill set

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.480
it has been found they've done like i

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.000
think hundreds if not thousands of

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.959
studies

00:08:56.959 --> 00:08:59.120
um this skill set while it doesn't kind

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.120
of focus directly

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.800
on you know uh the different

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.120
anxiety depression specifically

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.640
addiction specifically

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.279
it helps with all of them any kind of

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:13.200
even like better work performance if you

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:13.839
if you want

00:09:13.839 --> 00:09:16.080
better employees this works with that

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.880
it's what's called

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.680
trans diagnostic meaning it has

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.360
applications across

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.120
basically anything that has to do with

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.560
thinking and behavior so that

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.519
is a very brief introduction this is the

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:33.360
skill set we're going for

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.600
act helps us get it and i can say

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.519
personally i've put this stuff into my

00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:38.160
life

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.959
it's been nothing but a benefit like a

00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:41.839
huge benefit

00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:43.519
it's allowed me to kind of get out of my

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:46.000
own head and just do the things that i

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.399
actually like to do

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:50.160
and then just be more mindful about my

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.760
interactions with people in a way that

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.800
doesn't result

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.839
in just the nonsense that you know i had

00:09:55.839 --> 00:09:57.680
going on in life and you know i'm

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.839
i'm coming from a perspective of like

00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:01.680
you know 23 years old

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.240
crushed with panic attacks 26 years old

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.600
thought i'd get over the panic attacks

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.959
then i had wicked health anxiety

00:10:06.959 --> 00:10:07.839
thinking i was going to have a heart

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:09.760
attack for no reason all the time

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.079
um you know i'm talking anger issues i'm

00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:12.880
talking

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.800
general life confusion purposelessness

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.079
being drifting depression here and there

00:10:20.079 --> 00:10:22.640
um you know i'm on a pretty turbulent

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.160
lily pad over here and

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.640
i can say the ax stuff plus i would say

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.079
the passage of time you know i'm older

00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:29.440
and wiser now but

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.320
the act stuff specifically has helped me

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.120
tremendously

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.120
and i'm going to try to break it down

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.040
the you know the aim of it the skills of

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.600
it

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.680
the practices all of that into

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.720
digestible

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.200
bits and chunks and i'm excited to bring

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.880
this to people so

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.839
hopefully my shitty brain didn't make

00:10:47.839 --> 00:10:49.760
that too much of a mess to comprehend

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.760
and see you on the next one all right

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.120
now let's figure out how to turn this

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.839
thing off here we
