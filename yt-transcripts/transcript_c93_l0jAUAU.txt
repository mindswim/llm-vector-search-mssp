00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.570

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:54.419
bucks straight to your [ __ ] pocket

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.949
dude yeah it was unbelievable

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:57.720
so I'm driving last night there's still

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.669
this plastic undercarriage part that

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.530
like connects under the bumper I don't

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.490
know what the [ __ ] it is it's just

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.139
there's some plastic [ __ ] on my car it

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.630
has nowhere to go so I was driving and

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.180
it was like if I hit 45 it goes mmm but

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.710
it starts flapping real hard fly well do

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.030
what happened was this is literally

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.710
because I had just flown that day hope I

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.960
sped up and I was trying to get dude if

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.580
so would 40 35 45 50 it's flapping real

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.979
hard once I hit 65 miles an hour that

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.930
piece of plastic lit whatever has to do

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.120
with physics it gets lift and it's

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.560
suctions up to the top of the cars I

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.410
don't know like 65 70 it didn't flap but

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.030
I kept going back and forth between the

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.250
speed so much like that it bent down

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.560
into the form of a plow so the time I

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.970
got to my friend's house last night he

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.010
has a stone driveway I pulled up and

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.990
there's like four houses along that

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.120
stone dude it's like it's so

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.440
embarrassing I probably woke everybody

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.750
up here soften your car's making a noise

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.669
and you come like a stop sign yeah

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.310
people look at ya it's a camp or yes

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.770

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.150
too because I was like I was definitely

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.770

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.210
pieces of plastic to hold together zip

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.970

a little kid would do i hat I do not

have you know what I know what it is

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.100
I've actually been uh I've been doing a

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.990
lot of like self-hypnosis around my

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:11.520
shadow parts so I've been I've been

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.640
accessing what's the shadow part it's

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.940
just it's the it's like the subconscious

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.320
parts of your brain that kind of like

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.700
guide your behaviors in ways that you

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.530
kind of don't understand it so when you

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:24.360
see someone sit you're seeing someone

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.560
and like you know it's not all the time

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.560
but if if like somebody elicits a very

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.870
strong negative reaction in you there's

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:32.850
a large chance that that's a part of

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:34.740
your shadow archetype that you don't

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.480
like it all when they see that you like

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.220
hate it's like you know yes that just

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.810
bothers you naturally yes there's way

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.970
certain people act and I'm like just

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:45.090

here's pretty much how he killed himself

00:29:51.539 --> 00:29:54.429
yeah I would start making [ __ ] up - if I

00:29:54.429 --> 00:29:56.289
do die I think I found his love letters

00:29:56.289 --> 00:29:59.860
to all the male community who's gay

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:02.710
Shane was openly gay and strung I

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:03.880
wouldn't eulogize you and just

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.179
absolutely slander your legacy he was he

00:30:07.179 --> 00:30:12.039
was battling pedophilia he's a beautiful

00:30:12.039 --> 00:30:14.139
literally I would tarnish I would

00:30:14.139 --> 00:30:15.429
absolutely use the opportunity to

00:30:15.429 --> 00:30:18.220
tarnish your name so hard for eternity

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.480
why are you doing that he killed

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:19.990
yourself

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:22.809
well it's a punishment that's your but

00:30:22.809 --> 00:30:23.409

00:30:23.409 --> 00:30:26.639
yeah for disrupting my [ __ ] patreon

00:30:26.639 --> 00:30:33.220
disrupt I would actually get all I send

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.690
you like some real cheap flowers then

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:36.639

would take that is how I want to die I

00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:54.820
need to get you fed well that's kind of

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:55.779
the way to do it

00:30:55.779 --> 00:30:59.019
fed to wild animals is I mean that's the

00:30:59.019 --> 00:31:01.090
most animal you know it's the most

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:04.539
natural way to die alive yes I was a

00:31:04.539 --> 00:31:06.070
problem of dead bodies like what the

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:09.190
[ __ ] with them [ __ ] dude get the

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.019
years they're [ __ ] hungry

00:31:11.019 --> 00:31:12.909
apparently they say eaters don't attack

00:31:12.909 --> 00:31:14.679
men but it's like I don't know who told

00:31:14.679 --> 00:31:15.190
you this

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:17.350
I was with the wolf guys no no I was

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:19.509
rules don't attack men but fairly hyenas

00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:22.000
aren't known to attack men good it's

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:22.600
weird

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.220
why I don't know why they wouldn't but I

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.679
was reading a reading some young talking

00:31:26.679 --> 00:31:28.029
reading about his travels nobody deal

00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:29.529
yeah but he was talking about how the

00:31:29.529 --> 00:31:31.240
units were like they can't come up to

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.679
though if you leave like the guy like

00:31:32.679 --> 00:31:34.000
butchered some meat and forgot to like

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.320
throw it like the only way

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.419
so the eNOS came out they like started

00:31:37.419 --> 00:31:39.519
other boys with him ya know this was

00:31:39.519 --> 00:31:41.409
this was just like you know some other

00:31:41.409 --> 00:31:43.389
unis that they weren't boys with yet and

00:31:43.389 --> 00:31:44.830
they were like people they were like

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:45.909
yeah they don't really didn't won't [ __ ]

00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:47.169
with you and they were basically like

00:31:47.169 --> 00:31:48.850
there's like three European dudes like

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:50.559
watching these eanes crowd around him

00:31:50.559 --> 00:31:51.759
they're like yeah I'm gonna [ __ ]

00:31:51.759 --> 00:31:53.049
shoot this gun I don't give a [ __ ] with

00:31:53.049 --> 00:31:55.419
you guys yeah and they scattered hell

00:31:55.419 --> 00:31:55.779
yeah

00:31:55.779 --> 00:31:57.549
oh yeah I would feed you just some unis

00:31:57.549 --> 00:32:00.309
some dude got eaten by a [ __ ] Jaguar

00:32:00.309 --> 00:32:05.230
at the South Africa World Cup dude was

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:07.480
at he was with his friends

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.889
they've got tickets to the World Cup

00:32:08.889 --> 00:32:12.100
yeah he left his room to take a piss

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:16.720
outside watch Adam [ __ ] a big cat ate

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.129
him fair enough he like found him in a

00:32:18.129 --> 00:32:21.730
tree eaten what yeah that's a good way

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:23.409
to go I mean that is if you take a drunk

00:32:23.409 --> 00:32:25.269
piss just I don't know yeah I feel like

00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:26.679
they used to astonish me a lot more it's

00:32:26.679 --> 00:32:28.210
like I'm hearing people get eaten by

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:29.529
animals um I guess what they do

00:32:29.529 --> 00:32:32.169
animals eat stuff didn't eat mine animal

00:32:32.169 --> 00:32:34.360
is definitely like the worst way to die

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.370
you think it's gotta be I'd be kind of

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:37.659
involve what's happening I'd be alright

00:32:37.659 --> 00:32:39.700
well that while you're happening I mean

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.200
at least you're like you know you're not

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.850
just like getting hit by a [ __ ] bus

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:44.679
and peeled off the street it's like some

00:32:44.679 --> 00:32:46.059
animals at least you get some like

00:32:46.059 --> 00:32:48.669
nature aspect it's like alright well you

00:32:48.669 --> 00:32:51.220
know I I hear what you're trying to say

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:57.549
yeah like there's like a a part of got

00:32:57.549 --> 00:32:59.259
to hold you but I mean would you rather

00:32:59.259 --> 00:33:01.840
just like [ __ ] die of cancer for like

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.080
three years

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.549
yeah if you had a pick immediately yes

00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:09.290
you think I can't I will die of cancer

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:11.810
so yes I would choose that over like a

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:14.750
[ __ ] bear yes true I mean it'd be

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:16.640
pretty horrific anymore Oh be the scary

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.260
soon but if you slay all the time

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:19.460
like people that try to commit suicide

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.040
by like going into a zoo enclosure yeah

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.530
regret it every time okay so what if

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:25.940
they were like the doctor is like all

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.340
right you got cancer you have like me

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.430
about a month to live or here's a bear

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.500
you can fight this bear and live will

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.310
give you the cure

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:37.820
I mean I guess you'd have to how big

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:42.400
we're talking to grizzly Griz yeah

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.980
really getting mauled by a grizzly bear

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.630
you might be might be able to grin it

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:50.360
down like Davy Crockett all you do is

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.760
grin at a bear dude I don't think that

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.490

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:56.750

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.149
being mopping someone could hold a gun

00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:15.770

and a bunch of shake you like you mix it

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:15.470
up and then it turns like an amber color

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:16.610
and then you pour that into a rice

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:19.250
cooker and you just boil the alcohol off

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:20.960

about on the internet I said I can

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:53.059

me a couple times at school [ __ ]

00:36:01.369 --> 00:36:03.410
seeing halos and [ __ ] around whatever if

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:04.940
I get some real stone and sit in a place

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:06.650
like that I do it anyway if I'm not even

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:07.849
that stoned I'll start seeing like

00:36:07.849 --> 00:36:09.770
little blobs around people it's [ __ ]

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:10.069
weird

00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:11.900
basically I'm I have synesthesia like

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.450
Anya yeah definitely okay somebody do

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:17.210
you see people's like auras yeah what's

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:20.329
mine it's too dark although I do see a

00:36:20.329 --> 00:36:22.190
little let's dance as a shadow I'm not

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:23.450
gonna lie I'm not gonna be an aura liar

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:26.059
if there's a shadow behind you let's say

00:36:26.059 --> 00:36:31.400
you'd have a black or I come if I look

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.960
enough I've talked about this before if

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.760
I when I would used to go to church I

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.079
was looking at the priest everything

00:36:36.079 --> 00:36:37.700
goes black and white and the priest is

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.380
just in color and then it's just like

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.819
there's like a blob of light around them

00:36:40.819 --> 00:36:42.680
if I focus on a single person in a crowd

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:43.750
for a real long time

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:46.220
my vision black goes black and white and

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:47.359
then the one person looking at some

00:36:47.359 --> 00:36:47.750
color

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.910
that's like Schindler's List was that

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:53.690
what happens at one point what was just

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:55.910
the only color in the movie is this girl

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:58.369
she's a little girl with hardly or with

00:36:58.369 --> 00:37:00.920
a red jacket yeah she had Nazi now she

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:04.309
was a young Jew and she in there saw her

00:37:04.309 --> 00:37:06.829
was like damn that said ocean lair

00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:08.690

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:18.930
some in the parking lot I've been trying

00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:20.190
to figure out the collective unconscious

00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:23.880
but I know you're I know you're against

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:28.170
the collective unconscious I don't know

00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:30.180
I mean I do the unconscious is real I

00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:32.120
can literally I could I could lay it out

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:35.100
super easy for you but the collective

00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:38.280
unconscious that's one of them like is

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:41.040
that dude a hive mentality type thing I

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.650
mean yeah kind of like house so like

00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:45.150
when I so again I'm in I'm in Chicago

00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:47.340
I'm on the south side at the only white

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:49.530
person I'm in Walmart and it feel I feel

00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:50.100
weird

00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:52.230
I can feel other people feeling weird

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:53.460
and people just kind of like look it's

00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:55.950
just a weird [ __ ] vibe yeah that to

00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:57.390
me is a perfect example of it where

00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:59.190
there's just some unn like for some

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:01.770
reason we're just kind of like yeah sure

00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:03.330
everyone's weird there is almost there

00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:05.470
is a collective conscious

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:07.720
it oh I was in the sugar aisle Walmart I

00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:09.010
was like sweetie I proven to collective

00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:10.720
unconscious that's proving the

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.730
collective unconscious how not if

00:54:12.730 --> 00:54:15.099
everyone's just uncomfortable if but if

00:54:15.099 --> 00:54:16.300
the young comforts coming from an

00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:17.920
unconscious place I don't think it is

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:21.090
it's they're seeing a white guy even oh

00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:23.920
you mean like why why is it

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:27.640
uncomfortable cue like to see someone

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.740
different yeah like you're uncomfortable

00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:31.930
yeah I think that's just human instinct

00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:33.280
but it doesn't happen everywhere so I

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.930
guess that's what I mean an unconscious

00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:38.650
thought is instinct they're unconscious

00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:41.740
like feeling is purely instinct what are

00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:43.300
you talking about unconscious is instant

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:44.619
everything's instincts baby I mean this

00:54:44.619 --> 00:54:47.290
