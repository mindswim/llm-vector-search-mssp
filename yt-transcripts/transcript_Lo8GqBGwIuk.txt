he's been doing that he's been leaning

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.720
like the [ __ ] kaepernick i think was

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.800
somewhere else this is a quote

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.959
and why these days is everything so gay

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.280
gay rights transgender this and that i

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.879
say let folks get married if they want

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.040
and i'm not even close to a democrat and

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.560
then he ends it by being like uh what

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.159
you have between your legs determines

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.120
what bathroom you should you should use

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.799
cheers parentheses cheers

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.120
oh my god

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.120
yeah i gotta get to a kid rock concert

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.560
that's a concert i would say it's so

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.080
funny that he was gonna be sick did you

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.159

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.159
don't know like pulls up in attraction

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.159
yeah she's probably like [ __ ] who

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:57.840
dropped the drumsticks that could be his

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.319
condoleezza rice though it could be his

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.599
token [ __ ] she probably actually

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.120
likely she was probably taking a knee

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.319
during the concert and he was like get

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.560
the [ __ ] up on those drugs

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.519
get to that snare boy

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.080
yeah he's actually pretty he was killing

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.840
a demographic demographics wise he had a

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.599
black lady drummer he had a midge until

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:16.320
then

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.840
which is strong

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.440
because he can't get a new [ __ ] if he

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.120
got another one they'd be like yo bro

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.919

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:22.960
anyways

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.240
to be honest that would be the one thing

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.600
nobody would notice

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.680
if you got a new

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.960
[ __ ] would be like the undertaker in

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.639
the wwf there's been like 30 different

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.000
undertakers

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
finding big dumb guys kid rock midgets

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.840
thunder digger probably dies after every

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.120
monday night raw

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.000
he's like

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.479
[ __ ] smoke something

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:43.440
yeah

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.880
yo dude i i uh

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.440
we tried to hire a [ __ ] for a sketch

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.520
years ago really years ago and we had to

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.520
like go to a talent agency that only

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.479
like

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.560
you know they they deal with little

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.800
people the only deal that's it and i

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.240
like center the premise and the premise

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.120
was

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.160
it was like uh like we were like uh two

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.800
like fake sports agents that like we

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.880
like sent speakers out like go to like

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.720
these big events so it'd be like john

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.080
crook will talk at your event and then

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.440
you get there and it's a [ __ ] dressed

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.680
as john crook and like in the paperwork

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.520
it says lil john crook

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.440
and like which is we just have all these

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.120
all these uh ninjas that are dressed as

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.199
like famous people so we call this place

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.479
and we're like here's the premise we'll

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.639
pay like full price

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:26.639
and the price was it was a lot of course

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.000
it was a lot it was like our whole

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.880
budget and uh the lady was like i don't

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.639
really feel comfortable with this

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:33.840
premise

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.759
and i was like well aren't you the one

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:36.840
renting

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.199

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.080
to give somebody some work and she was

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.680
like no i don't think so and then she

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.919
hung up and then i put it on craigslist

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:46.960
and like

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.479
three days later some dude sent me a

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:49.600

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.680

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.400
down

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.479
and then he finally sends me an email

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.160
also it was like you must be able to use

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.840
rollerblades must be able to operate on

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.080

[ __ ] 26. this is i regret it but uh

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.120

and i'm 5'5

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.880
he was like i thought that would be

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.919
what the [ __ ]

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.560

in real life that's kind of funny she

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.880
was probably like kate what the [ __ ]

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.560
she's probably reading this sketch like

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.680
she's probably like this isn't a sketch

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.120
you're just [ __ ] with these guys just

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.639

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:31.240
like slowly following me

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:42.960
i don't see that many that's a lot yeah

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.039

where you're seeing two a year

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.720
what kind of [ __ ] you getting into

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.000
i'm trying to think maybe just on the

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.120
internet

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.560
no i see like

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.080
i don't think i see very many midgets

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.599
i've seen yeah maybe

00:07:55.599 --> 00:07:57.120
one maybe one a year i'll catch you

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.960
midge in the wild once a year and it's

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.479
like holy [ __ ] i don't see too many

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:02.160
[ __ ] people

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.599
which i'll tell you what when you do see

00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:05.680
them it's quite the jarring experience

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.120
well once you get out of school and you

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.639
don't really you know

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:09.680
like if you're in a restaurant or

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.960
something you just i'm gonna i'm gonna

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.080
be i'm gonna be super i'm gonna be super

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.840
gay right now yeah

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.599
that's i've been genuinely trying to

00:08:17.599 --> 00:08:19.759
stop saying that word [ __ ] yeah like

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:21.840
yeah no no no no no no here's what

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.879
here's why here's why i didn't say it no

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.960
no no this is this is the only one that

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.919
i'm like

00:08:27.919 --> 00:08:30.639
uh i feel like because because it's so

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:33.279
easy to say like i did it forever yeah

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:35.039
up till like last year

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.680
stop saying it yeah that makes sense let

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.919
me just cut that out no no it's [ __ ] you

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:43.440
you [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:46.000
yeah i uh i'm not trying to fight i

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.279
wasn't trying i know i know i know i was

00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:48.399
trying to actually have like a genuine

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:50.240
defense yeah no that was every time i

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.440
hear people complaining about a word i'm

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.200
like shut the [ __ ] up it doesn't yeah

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.720
like like when someone says [ __ ] and

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.680
someone's like you shouldn't say khan

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.920
it's like yeah you can say [ __ ]

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.080
but like so like but but the reason i

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.880
says because i saw some [ __ ] comic

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.720
on stage here's the thing if you say it

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.040
i'm like shane says everything

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.240
yeah and shane doesn't mean anything

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.920
except that one

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.600
man yeah yeah

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.959
i feel like shane says oh [ __ ] he

00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:14.160
doesn't mean it like he's just [ __ ]

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.240
around but like i saw a comic some

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.800
[ __ ] super liberal comic who has

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.360
literally made his career on being like

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.240
so like women should be more empowered

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.160
and then he called trump a [ __ ] like

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.000
three times yeah and i was like all

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.360
right well wait a minute so you just get

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.279
to pick and choose like yeah that's why

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:32.560
the [ __ ] that falls

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.320
when you're liberal you can make you can

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.080
say anything you want about trump and

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.440
this was this was a funny one this

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.120
weekend because there was a uh

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.279
convention in philly for republican

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:43.920
women there's like a women's republican

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.720
i guess convention i said that and uh

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.200
like liberal people were making fun of

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.120
it like they're they're probably all

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.680
here to suck black dicks and [ __ ] black

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.760
guys now their husbands are gone i was

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.800
just like

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.880
you know that's racist right yeah

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.720
wildly to be like

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.560
they're probably they just want black

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.880
dicks the worst kind of implications

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.800
that's bad yeah exactly the implication

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.399
is that it's [ __ ] bad and they're

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:10.000
it's like when they say like when trump

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:10.959
kisses

00:10:10.959 --> 00:10:13.680
[ __ ] mccain on snl and you're like

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.680
but you're that joke is that being gay

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.519
is you're making it seem like being gay

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:19.760
is bad yeah oh yeah they do that all the

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.519
time and then they're like well

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:22.720
yeah it's like well no it's we know it's

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.240
his worst nightmare it's like shut up or

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.040
they go before they go relax it's comedy

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.480
it's like yeah when it [ __ ] works for

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.839
them exactly yeah that's what's just

00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:31.120
hilarious

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.399

this girl and then she has a [ __ ]

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.480
sister and he cheats and starts like

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.880
hooking up with the [ __ ] girl

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.320

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.520
it's [ __ ] up

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.919
jesus it's called the other sister i'm

00:21:09.919 --> 00:21:11.679

totally like sometimes i'll see a movie

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.480
and i kind of like make up what it's

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.000
about if it's been a while but i'm

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.320
pretty sure he like

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.080
i am saying the two [ __ ] people

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.960
cohabitating there's a movie where

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.039
the other guy is talking about a regular

00:21:25.039 --> 00:21:27.679
lady and then cheats on her with her

00:21:27.679 --> 00:21:30.960
sisters [ __ ]

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.880
but he doesn't know i think he does i

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.120
think he's a rock guy who plays the guy

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.200
i don't know i gotta find out

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.720
and i gotta find out too this movie's

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.480
probably just like a coming-of-age tale

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.080
of two sisters

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.159
what do you think i am sam's about it's

00:21:44.159 --> 00:21:46.080
two [ __ ] people cohabitating that's

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.280
what it was right

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.120
i don't know it's a little girl what was

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.400
that movie where like they get a cup

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.159
they get a room together and they read a

00:21:52.159 --> 00:21:53.440
book on sex and they're like i want to

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.120
do number two nah this is the one where

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.240
sean penn falls with a [ __ ] cake

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.679
doesn't he fall down a flight of steps

00:21:59.679 --> 00:22:02.640
with the case milk the the court

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.679
and falls at the end of that

00:22:05.679 --> 00:22:08.320
there's a court tries to take away the

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.720
kid because he's [ __ ]

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.120
because she's

00:22:18.559 --> 00:22:20.720
that's a chameleon type twist at the end

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.360
of that other sister movie

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.799

00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:26.080

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.280
where

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.799
uh yeah this is where the two [ __ ]

00:22:38.799 --> 00:22:40.400
people get like a house together

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.000
i don't think anyone fingers a [ __ ]

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.280
person well i gotta be honest you might

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.120
want to [ __ ] package that idea and

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.440
send it to paramount or something

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.200
what happens in the movie where they get

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.200

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.880

got to watch it again because i'm

00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:02.320
convinced there's definitely a scene

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.240
where a girl smashes glasses and lays

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.840
down the guy like fingers her unbroken

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.200
glass and she might not be [ __ ]

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.400
though but

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.400
dude this is the best movie review i've

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.799
ever heard

00:23:15.039 --> 00:23:16.480

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.840

00:23:21.039 --> 00:23:24.320
fingers in a [ __ ] girl

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.960
what's what's this new one

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.039
little children that that movie is good

00:23:29.039 --> 00:23:30.799
middle children little children what's

00:23:30.799 --> 00:23:32.640
about like a

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.240
it's like a new mom and a new dad and

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.159
like they're both their spouses are busy

00:23:36.159 --> 00:23:37.280
and they start meeting up at the pool

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.400
like i think it's helen hunt and this

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.679
dude just [ __ ] the [ __ ] out of her

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.760
i just keep thinking you're just not

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.200
remembering like the little rascals

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:45.360
right

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.559
[Laughter]

00:23:48.559 --> 00:23:50.960
little children i highly recommend

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.559
it's also funny that every one of these

00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:55.200
movies you think the climax and point of

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.039
the whole vlog is just some people

00:23:57.039 --> 00:23:58.799
[ __ ] see it's like yeah and they hang

00:23:58.799 --> 00:24:00.640

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.240
[ __ ]

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.679
and then that's it then a bunch of stuff

00:24:03.679 --> 00:24:05.520
happens and yeah i honestly can't tell

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.799
you the ending of that movie i have no

00:24:06.799 --> 00:24:08.480
idea i'm like damn helen hulk gets this

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.400
[ __ ] [ __ ] out of her on a drying she's

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.919
like on a dryer and it's like

00:24:11.919 --> 00:24:13.919
doubling down on that vibe

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:15.919
you saw armageddon you know that's like

00:24:15.919 --> 00:24:17.760
about uh these guys on an oil rig and

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.000
then they get on mainland and uh a

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.080
meteor's coming and then

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.159
the guy uh puts animal crackers on his

00:24:24.159 --> 00:24:25.919
chicken

00:24:25.919 --> 00:24:27.440
that's the whole movie

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.960
that's the whole movie

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.559
that's really how my brain summarizes he

00:24:30.559 --> 00:24:33.120
[ __ ] her to a song that her dad

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.360
wrote

00:24:35.679 --> 00:24:38.400
what a nightmare [ __ ] damn

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.000
damn that's such a good way to remember

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.400
movies they're just just

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.000
the only thing that matters is the plot

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.360
until the first one is funny because

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.279
that is what monster's ball really was

00:24:47.279 --> 00:24:48.080
yeah

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.240
yeah that's true true the whole point

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.440

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.120

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.280
anal stuff stuff like that where you're

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.000
like

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.720

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.400
get like the guy the

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.560
government agent he was gay going about

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.000
his business and then he just [ __ ] the

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.280
[ __ ] out of some hillbilly it's like

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.560
[ __ ] yeah dude and that dude's like yeah

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.079
i'm gay too what's up yeah or like he

00:36:08.079 --> 00:36:09.359
punches him in the face immediately

00:36:09.359 --> 00:36:10.480
afterwards he's like you turn me

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.640
[ __ ] oh yeah see i think they

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.560
[ __ ] up i don't think that's

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.079
i think that's pretty realistic that's

00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:17.599
not the comment i thought that character

00:36:17.599 --> 00:36:21.119
sucked which character the gay detective

00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:22.480
really gay

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.640
he was like the least believable human

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.560
on earth really it's like i'm just an

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.320
obsessive [ __ ] i will say he's kind of

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.160
an oversight he was over acting a lot

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.520
something about that guy i really i

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.440
liked the show a lot the gay fisherman

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.800
though was pretty good i think that's

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.880
fantastic there's something real gross

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.839
about knowing he sucked dick with that

00:36:38.839 --> 00:36:40.640
mustache wasn't it it was like kind of

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.640
gross oh well that scene yeah where he's

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.960
[ __ ] the gay agents getting his dick

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.720
sucked with the

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.720
prostitute the male prostitute yeah and

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.480
he's like yeah you think that's [ __ ]

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:53.520
up think about drones or like yeah sure

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.000
i'm like dude this is not a real guy i

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.400
liked how the gay black guy his partner

00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.839
would get all mad at him and all fussy

00:36:59.839 --> 00:37:01.200
if like he was getting if he was [ __ ]

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.880
anyone else he'd be like oh you're a pig

00:37:05.359 --> 00:37:07.839
yeah gay guys i don't know i don't i

00:37:07.839 --> 00:37:09.200
guess i don't know enough about it to

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.640
really be like this is what they should

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.560
be but yeah i i it shouldn't be a

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.640
[ __ ] gay pride parade every day no it

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.240
shouldn't be a caricature of a person

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.480
yeah yeah my my issue always when i

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.160
remember like back like right after

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.839
college or like i guess when people are

00:37:21.839 --> 00:37:22.960
supposed to go to college because i

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.640
didn't but i there's like there was like

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.200
a timer girls would be like you got to

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.839
be my friend he's crazy and you're like

00:37:29.839 --> 00:37:31.839
i was just gay

00:37:31.839 --> 00:37:33.280
and i would be like that's kind of weird

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.560
that you treat him like a novelty

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.480
because he's get like yeah is he isn't

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.160
he's just like a regular dude

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.200
and then i'd meet them and they would be

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.480
like hey what's going on like yeah but

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.000
he's like when he gets drunk he's crazy

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.040

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:48.960
probably blacks out and does coke

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.359
so he probably does party pretty hard i

00:37:51.359 --> 00:37:53.040
mean gay people tend to party [ __ ]

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.560

white girls who are straight yeah

controversial but i was like the worst

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.079
thing about [ __ ] people hating gays

00:40:40.079 --> 00:40:41.599
is that we got to put up with [ __ ]

00:40:41.599 --> 00:40:43.599
bad gay comics

00:40:43.599 --> 00:40:45.040
true

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.400
we wouldn't have to [ __ ] do it if

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.839
people were just [ __ ] cool with gay

00:40:47.839 --> 00:40:49.520
people well they're dudes if you were to

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:50.880
just be [ __ ] cool about it and then

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.000
we don't have to [ __ ] listen to these

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.400
guys and pretend they're good true or

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.520

i've been trying to get better with that

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.520
though if i'm watching something i'm

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:43.200
like like there'll be like a line in

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.480
something where like especially when

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.480
people write dialogue for high school

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.880
kids and it's like you want to get this

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:50.560
d and it's like it's like a 50 year

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.160
old's writing yeah 15 year olds talking

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.920
it's [ __ ] brutal but i've been better

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.200
at just being like all right and letting

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.240
it go and it's kind of just trying to

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.680
get into the story of it but it's

00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:59.200
[ __ ] hard it's harder for like when i

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.119
stuff i watched neighbors too just to

00:48:01.119 --> 00:48:02.480
like

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.319
i mean i i was like five minutes into it

00:48:04.319 --> 00:48:05.680
and just playing him i didn't know where

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.119
my [ __ ] remote was i was just sitting

00:48:07.119 --> 00:48:08.160
on my couch

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.760
and i was like i was like i had my phone

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.319
on me and i started texting shane and i

00:48:12.319 --> 00:48:14.160
think shane mentioned it before to me

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.920
yeah and it was like

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.680
it was the it was the worst piece of

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:20.480
[ __ ] i think i've seen in years it was

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.800
the worst piece of [ __ ] i've ever seen i

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.400
told you about it because they had

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.720
because it was we talked about

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:29.599
how the ghetto asian girl now comedy is

00:48:29.599 --> 00:48:32.079
just white chicks acting like bros yeah

00:48:32.079 --> 00:48:33.760
yeah yeah you were telling me this

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.440
because it was off that show idiot

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.200
sitter or whatever on comedy central

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.640
that was just

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.559
that movie rough night same thing yeah

00:48:40.559 --> 00:48:41.839
it's just

00:48:41.839 --> 00:48:43.680
chicks being

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.200
ridiculous for approaches yeah like i

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:47.040
want to suck dick i'm gonna get drunk

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.800
inside let's go to this party there's

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.640
gonna be mad dicks at this party and

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:53.280
it's like there's no chance yeah

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.280
that that's how you operate or you'd be

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:57.119
at all you would be dead

00:48:57.119 --> 00:48:59.760
all the dicks would hear you say that

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:00.800
well you know what's weird it's like

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.119
that [ __ ] that invigorates [ __ ]

00:49:03.119 --> 00:49:05.359
boring women in like connecticut it's

00:49:05.359 --> 00:49:06.800
like some rich girl in connecticut who

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:09.119
has no personality she watches a show

00:49:09.119 --> 00:49:10.160
like that and she's like she'll

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.440
literally look at the youtube comments

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:12.880
they'll be like this is me and my

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.000
friends yeah

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.200
that's what they [ __ ] like this is

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.880
definitely us yeah so you know how

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.000
uninteresting you have to be like

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.760
there's a like we do shots at house

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.599
parties if you're interesting people go

00:49:21.599 --> 00:49:23.119
dude that's so you

00:49:23.119 --> 00:49:24.800
when they hear something when you're not

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.359
interesting you go that's so me yeah

00:49:27.359 --> 00:49:31.079
that's the [ __ ] difference

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.319
yeah the

00:49:32.319 --> 00:49:34.000
we were watching vice principals i

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000
watched vice principals this weekend and

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.079
caitlyn the first scene of him on the

00:49:38.079 --> 00:49:39.440
[ __ ] steps coming out she's like

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:41.680
that's just you

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.280
all right

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.720
see but that's that's better than

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:46.480
somebody going this is me because they

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.760
don't have a personality so they're

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:48.800
trying to

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:50.160
pull it from some [ __ ] like that and

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.280
then you have

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.200
you know just some girl on instagram

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:54.800
being like i'm just trying to get [ __ ]

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.559
up and suck dee and you're like no

00:49:56.559 --> 00:49:58.720
you're not you're just [ __ ] not yeah

00:49:58.720 --> 00:49:59.680
that's kind of frightening to think

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:02.240
about that there's people who are

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:03.839
like we're all i mean i hate to even use

00:50:03.839 --> 00:50:05.680
this term we're all above average like

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.520
creatively creatively speaking or

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:08.559
whatever yeah dude but there's some

00:50:08.559 --> 00:50:09.920
people who don't have really any

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:11.839
original thoughts ever and they kind of

00:50:11.839 --> 00:50:13.680
just float through jobs in life and then

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.680
they just see that see the girl like i

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:18.000
want some dick and they're like

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.440
i could adopt that as my personality i

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:20.880
guess like that's exactly right well i

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:23.280
mean that's exactly weird guys guys and

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.800
girls yeah exactly look at [ __ ]

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.240
barstool sports look at what that's done

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.200
to like

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.280
millions of men around america where

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.720
they're like saturdays are for the boys

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.280
it's like who are you exactly tell me

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.280
two things about yourself exactly well

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:38.839
my shotgun beers on instagram yeah and

00:50:38.839 --> 00:50:41.040
uh and i [ __ ] play the links dawg

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.880
that freaks me out when i see guys i'm

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:44.640
talking to and i'm like you're just like

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:46.640
a sponge of like popular stuff and you

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:47.760
just repeat it and it's like they're

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.440
just like what

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.680
yeah i guess that is a decent

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:53.200
understanding of what's happened to me

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:56.160
since then like i kind of just

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.839
because i would i would watch

00:50:57.839 --> 00:50:59.520
i would read books things like that and

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:00.480
be like

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.960
yes this is my personality now

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.240
like i would read a book and be like

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.640
that's how i think i'll do that for

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.000
and then uh yeah i think i've gotten to

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.520
the point where i'm just like this sucks

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:10.640
[ __ ] that

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:12.000
everything sucks yeah but that means

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.359
that that's that's your personality

00:51:13.359 --> 00:51:15.200
though well that's formed an actual

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.200
person my personality sucks so if i can

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.599
[ __ ] switch that one up yeah so this

00:51:19.599 --> 00:51:21.680
basement dwelling [ __ ]

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:24.319
[ __ ]

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.520
yeah you'll probably shake it off no i'm

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:30.240
just you'll get like uh you know because

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:31.680
you'll get a second one like a health

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:33.040
scare you'll have a health scare and pop

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.559
up be like yeah i'm better now it's a

00:51:34.559 --> 00:51:36.000
weird type of you'll lose all your hair

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.359
and wear a bandana for a month to be

00:51:37.359 --> 00:51:38.800
happy again it's a weird type of

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.720
cynicism though where it's like

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:43.599
yeah but i'm still better than everyone

00:51:43.599 --> 00:51:45.359
that's the shitty yeah she i used to do

00:51:45.359 --> 00:51:46.800
that shitty part i used to do that too

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:49.440
but now i like uh i find myself like i

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:50.880
give myself a little leeway now like i

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:52.079
like memes

00:51:52.079 --> 00:51:53.040
yeah

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:54.880
i always thought they were [ __ ] corny

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:56.240
but it's like once you once you let go

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.599
of that [ __ ] like thinking you're cooler

00:51:57.599 --> 00:51:59.280
or like you think you're some [ __ ]

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.440
[ __ ] poet laureate or some [ __ ] yeah

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:02.640
you start being like i'm just like some

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.319
some dude that likes corny [ __ ]

00:52:04.319 --> 00:52:05.760
sometimes yeah

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.280
defending language yeah that's what the

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.119
guy who likes barstool thinks no but

00:52:09.119 --> 00:52:10.960
that but i get it what i'm saying is

00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:13.839
that guy is very confident as a like

00:52:13.839 --> 00:52:16.240
he's like this is my per i am yes this

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.760
is the i am that guy it's like you're

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:20.079
not you [ __ ] you watched barcelo's

00:52:20.079 --> 00:52:21.200
instagram

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:22.240
feed

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.440
and then you're like saturdays are for

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:25.280
the boys you shotgun the beer

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:26.640
and then you like put your finger up at

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:28.160
a concert and then like you then you're

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.280
done

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.800
then you're like what am i now you just

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.240
then it's just quiet nights where you're

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:34.319
just like just a cave in your mind

00:52:34.319 --> 00:52:35.760
you're just like

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:38.319
just sad thoughts whistling through

00:52:38.319 --> 00:52:40.000
i i really think about that a lot it

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.760
freaks me the [ __ ] out whenever i go to

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.119
like that basically when i go to things

00:52:43.119 --> 00:52:45.200
with my girlfriend i have to go to like

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.880
like weddings where i'll meet guys like

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.319
that who like got out of school and went

00:52:48.319 --> 00:52:49.680
into an office and that's been their

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:50.720
whole life

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:52.000
and there's some guys like that who are

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.359
cool and stuff and i talk to the certain

00:52:53.359 --> 00:52:55.599
guys i talk to and i'm like

00:52:55.599 --> 00:52:56.559
dude i don't think you've ever really

00:52:56.559 --> 00:52:58.559
thought for yourself ever yeah it is a

00:52:58.559 --> 00:53:00.720
scary thing man it's [ __ ] weird dude

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:02.240
it's it's frightening like there was i

00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:04.319
knew dudes that like i would only like

00:53:04.319 --> 00:53:06.240
quote movies and stuff yeah that's the

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:08.000
best actually after high school and then

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.160
like when i saw them grow it's like oh

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.599
they don't even they don't

00:53:11.599 --> 00:53:13.040
even know

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:15.200
who they are like what they like or like

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:16.880
what is something to like i don't even

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:18.480
know but it's funny because they i've

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:19.760
learned they'll just look at you and be

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.520
like hipster and then they just move

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:22.960
along another thing it's just kind of

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:25.040
funny like [ __ ] hipster

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:27.119
i mean they have some

00:53:27.119 --> 00:53:28.720
points that on the surface it looks like

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:30.800
they're winning like if if i was to

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:31.760
argue with one of them they'd be like

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.520
what don't you live with like four other

00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:35.839
[ __ ] dudes in a shitty house

00:53:35.839 --> 00:53:39.040
like yeah like how's stand up paying you

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:40.480
like [ __ ] like that yeah but when that

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.880
stops happening it's a real good feeling

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:44.079
like when you like when you because

00:53:44.079 --> 00:53:46.319
you're gonna you're you're both gonna

00:53:46.319 --> 00:53:47.839
see success

00:53:47.839 --> 00:53:48.960
sooner

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:50.720
than most people would and then

00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:51.839
eventually you'll be like i don't even

00:53:51.839 --> 00:53:53.040
why would you even [ __ ] think about

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.160
dudes like that like dudes that like

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:55.839

00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:53.119
a newborn and they're [ __ ] crying all

00:57:53.119 --> 00:57:54.720
the time and like they're waking up all

00:58:10.559 --> 00:58:12.319

that i'm like that would be the one

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:29.920
