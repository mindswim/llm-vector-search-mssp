tendencies like she's always watching

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.660
sports that's all she does well it's

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.709
kind of cool that she doesn't share the

00:10:03.709 --> 00:10:05.570

really funny sense of humor I mean like

00:10:11.209 --> 00:10:12.709
her saying good that I was leaving it's

00:10:12.709 --> 00:10:14.839
[ __ ] funny yeah of course but when

00:10:14.839 --> 00:10:16.040

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.260
it's up if you had if you've gotten a

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.790
black guy's head and you were thinking

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.140
