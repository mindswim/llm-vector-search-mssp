there's a good point dude it is dude I

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.930
can't imagine watching sports and then

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.910
sitting around all day to hear people

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.709
talk about sports after watching us but

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.420

nowhere the NFL to slip into this like

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.650

was just going part owners on a team but

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.940
yeah that's an interesting also might

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:00.930
have been the deal they might have like

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.729

the world how much are they just blood

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.950
[ __ ] rap just Redoute it's like the

Monday night game was stealers bangles

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.060

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.630
presented by Genesis Snoop Dog's gonna

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.090
rap and it was just a snoop rap about

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.210
like being number one in football just I

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.450
just the cornea [ __ ] possible they mean

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.280
like just commercializing rap like that

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.530
just well you do it this is a one was

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.000
the point of rap this is a roomful of

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.669
like you know six year old white dudes

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.580
that's who any old white dude thinks of

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.169
a rappers like toe that old tell that

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.600
Snoop Dogg to get in there and say some

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.150
of those raps that'll win them over

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:57.450

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.930
people who wouldn't do the halftime show

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.370
I mean I don't think they were the 20 26

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:11.370
it's Garth Brooks again Garth Brooks

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.710
again yeah Garth was probably sitting

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.979
back like yes yes I'm gonna make

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:18.660
millions right now oh you thought you

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.750

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.310
controversy like this go back to who's

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.560
benefiting I think Garth got in

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.260
Kaepernick's a year early half of next

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.520
year was like I haven't played a half

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.310
time in a while I think he released his

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.930
song specifically to stoke the ire of

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.270
black football players so you be

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.090
Zubair to salute the flag I don't want

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.840

yes like the first black which white guy

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.270
attacked him viciously it was it Howie

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.080
Mandel was it John Madden

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:17.190

it was Oxford he went to an English like

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.940
Ivy League school yeah and he did it he

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.979
did like a keynote address full of a

00:07:53.979 --> 00:07:56.380
bunch of college students on his view of

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.120
mathematics and his view Terrence

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.800
Howard's view of math math Terri ology

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.139
bro he has a copyrighted the Terri Jean

00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:06.220
view of the universe what is it one one

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.280
times one equals two it's all based off

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.349
the fact that like he's trying to unite

00:08:11.349 --> 00:08:13.479
physics and mathematics and he was like

00:08:13.479 --> 00:08:17.200
the fact that mathematical theory

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.910
doesn't link up with physics so

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.770
basically if he was like 1 times 1

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.320
people say it equals 1 and he's like

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.150
yeah but that doesn't make sense because

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:29.349
if it was 1 pound versus 1 pound yeah

00:08:29.349 --> 00:08:32.409
that's four quarters basically here he's

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.200
talking anyone's a $1 times $1 but he's

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.219
like if you have four quarters times

00:08:36.219 --> 00:08:37.539
four quarters and you get he said some

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.310
number like four bucks or some [ __ ]

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.409
yeah so he was like and that's how they

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:44.200
use math to hold you down basically so

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.150
it's like and dude I I've had a 1 I've

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.190
had several $1 savings accounts and that

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.930
does explain why they don't compound

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.300
that well they're usually that's [ __ ]

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.900
[ __ ] Euclidian not

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.080
since - yeah [ __ ] me out of my person

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.760
over to the Trajan I'm gonna go to a

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.230
bank my do you guys follow that region

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.030
view where I can just be like it's a

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:03.260
dollar but technically I want to

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.730
multiply this fourth quarter you seen

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.490
that hustling the mathematician that

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.670
started that studying for 40 years

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.490
what'd he bust out the sacred flower of

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:17.000
uh God it was like not it's like this

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.980
ancient John it's like sacred geometry

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.990
[ __ ] where he was like the the secrets

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.090
of geometry are trapped in this

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:24.680
depiction Leonardo da Vinci spent his

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.270
whole life trying to do it in Terrence

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.040
hours like yeah well he believed in

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.480
straight lines that's that's where he

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.760
[ __ ] up he was saying all movement is

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.710
concentric circles he's like even when

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:34.850
you're making a straight line he's like

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:35.960
you're really curving you just don't

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.460
understand because we're trapped in a 2d

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.620
visual so he's trying to bring us all to

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.750
a three-dimensional awareness and also

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:46.310
show that one times one equals two all

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.620
right that's that he was like they're

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.870
like wool that's they're saying it's

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.540
like one which is like one Apple times

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.570
one occurrence and you just like yeah

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:57.770
now that's what they want you to believe

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.870
he's like it's really one and one

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:03.470
multiplication is just hyper addition

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.440
just like really just adding stuff

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.990
you're gonna tell me one zero times zero

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.000
and everyone's like yeah and he's like

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.660
yeah right dude it's one [ __ ] he's like

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.220
dude he this [ __ ] is [ __ ] he gave a

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.860
speech at Cambridge yeah mental room for

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.430
people Wow and most people they would it

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.060
was like a joke you see a couple times

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.340
they went in on in people's faces and

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.360
people were like what the [ __ ] but

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.590
everyone has raised their hand and asked

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.000
some acting questions you tell each

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.340
other [ __ ] was he he had a whole bunch

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.590
of visuals that he was going to put up

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.730
like what's uh Jessie smell that like

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:43.850
nah yeah pretty much people were like

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:46.040
one guy was like my brother's trying in

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.390
the music industry like will you listen

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.010
to his mixtape and he literally asked

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:50.570
him that question he was like you gotta

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.100
break into the music and it gave this

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.200
whole foul nice he did talk about acting

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.790
how he was like you lose a part of

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.410
yourself all the time and then you freak

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:58.610
out you don't even know who you are he's

00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:59.960
like but I always knew who I was he's

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.250
like this is gonna sound a little weird

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.500
but he's like when I was in the womb

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.160
first one well

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.699
[ __ ] he goes I was thinking about the

00:11:08.699 --> 00:11:10.620
sacred for the flower of life and I

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.120
remember saying to myself don't forget

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.519
don't forget he's like this is probably

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:16.709
a past life wow he's like I probably was

00:11:16.709 --> 00:11:19.079
studying this in a past life so he's

00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:20.670
like I remember sounds weird you guys

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.649
might not believe me he's like I was

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:25.290
conscious in the womb and I already had

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.699
this stuff all figured out he's very

00:11:26.699 --> 00:11:31.230
pro-life energy he's like they're

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.420
thinking in there killing Einsteins and

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.920
Pythagoras dude you can't be doing that

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.529
yeah basically every fetus is just like

00:11:37.529 --> 00:11:40.170
a interdimensional philosopher

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.990
mathematician damn dude how many babies

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:44.250
that got aborted do you think we're

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.220
aborted babies in their past life well

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:51.170
just keep getting aborted don't forget

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:55.819
was that flower one times one [ __ ]

00:11:55.819 --> 00:12:02.310
[ __ ] abort one plus one dude he's

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:05.040
like a groundhog day the movie just

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.209
constant constant you know you have that

00:12:09.209 --> 00:12:11.579
Terrence Howard do the voiceovers don't

00:12:11.579 --> 00:12:14.759
forget don't forget that be a sick Pixar

00:12:14.759 --> 00:12:16.560
yeah not like the story of like an

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.120
aborted fetus that like it's born into

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.170
another life and it's hastily

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.029
revolutionized mathematics for everyone

00:12:21.029 --> 00:12:27.420
oh yeah dude Terrence Howard on the

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.490
[ __ ] ball this morning i watch it on

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.939
the elliptical wow man he was way you

00:12:32.939 --> 00:12:35.040
hit the elliptical today oh yeah early

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:35.730
in the [ __ ] morning

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.589
I like set up Terrence Howard on my

00:12:37.589 --> 00:12:39.240
phone put my headphones in was listening

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.889
this guy just blood [ __ ] a room of

00:12:40.889 --> 00:12:43.079
Oxford and one later you started to

00:12:43.079 --> 00:12:44.220
argue with him but it season that he's

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.290
slippery as [ __ ] yeah Oh start hitting

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:47.339
you with [ __ ] that you're like first of

00:12:47.339 --> 00:12:48.899
all he's got a claim he was like solving

00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:52.800
this [ __ ] bro we can't talk because he

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.089
kept being like I've been studying this

00:12:54.089 --> 00:12:56.880
[ __ ] for 45 years I'm like how old is

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.680
this guy he's like so I started

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.360
seriously pursuing geometry when I was

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.089
four it's like alright dude [ __ ] liar

00:13:03.089 --> 00:13:06.689
don't call [ __ ] on the wound story I

00:13:06.689 --> 00:13:08.730
think the womb story might be a fib I

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.350
don't know I have I have friends who

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.120
claim consciousness while they were like

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.870
babies one friend who was very high on

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.899
cocaine who claimed to be a baby

00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:20.629
like fully aware of what was going on

00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:23.699
while he was high okay he was coked out

00:13:23.699 --> 00:13:25.110
of his mind and he started to tell me

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.089
the story of like when he was sitting in

00:13:27.089 --> 00:13:28.499
the playpen he was like who are all

00:13:28.499 --> 00:13:29.550
these people around me

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.369
damn dude also Freud did a lot of coke

00:13:32.369 --> 00:13:34.920
and he was real big into like early

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.300
childhood memories and [ __ ]

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.490
might be a side effect of coke I don't

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:39.839
know I've been doing some coke and I

00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:41.429
don't think that happens might not be

00:13:41.429 --> 00:13:42.540
doing enough I don't think I'm doing

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.490
enough I guess I gotta get into it you

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:45.839
gotta get it yeah you gotta step it up

00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:48.059
Freud was probably just nothing but fish

00:13:48.059 --> 00:13:50.189
scales dude yeah back then you got you

00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:53.850
copped that was straight from poppy they

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.269
were not stepping on that at all it was

00:13:57.269 --> 00:14:03.470
straight from pop yeah Ford was probably

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:07.879
train tracks dude oh yeah [ __ ] your mom

00:14:07.879 --> 00:14:11.850
your dad my mom it's pretty sick how

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:13.410
much coke II did I didn't even know

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:17.550
Freud was hitting the blow before he was

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:20.519
in it hard party time he his old version

00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:22.889
of psychoanalysis was that like one this

00:14:22.889 --> 00:14:25.050
was like the solution for everybody and

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:26.730
one day everyone would be doing it it

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:27.920
was he was like basically like

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.269
psychoanalyzed the world like it was

00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:31.529
gonna become a thing that like every

00:14:31.529 --> 00:14:34.110
single person did what coke no psycho

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:40.620
now I was probably close sick but I

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.600
liked your stuff on cocaine better what

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.720
was that yeah yeah it's funny to think

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.759
wait so he thought everybody was gonna

00:14:47.759 --> 00:14:49.559
psychoanalyze the world he was like this

00:14:49.559 --> 00:14:52.410
is what's going to raise us up out of

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.959
our animal stupor yeah everyone's gonna

00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:56.160
sit down because he's like you you have

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.720
to pass through the meat grinder that

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.819
his childhood and all the [ __ ] gets

00:14:59.819 --> 00:15:01.350
stuffed down in your brain he's like and

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.259
then you can spend your adult years

00:15:03.259 --> 00:15:05.220
working through all this stuff and he's

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.809
like this is gonna fix everybody and

00:15:06.809 --> 00:15:07.620
he's like we're gonna make this

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.149
accessible so everyone get here supposed

00:15:09.149 --> 00:15:11.399
to do it like three four times a week so

00:15:11.399 --> 00:15:12.689
that'd just been like another tour we're

00:15:12.689 --> 00:15:14.160
like you'd go to a second out I mean

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.079
he's if everyone did this probably would

00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:19.199
be pretty sick yeah but again that also

00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:21.629
sounds like the scheme someone coked out

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:22.980
of their minds being like yes and

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:26.759
everyone's gonna do and then I'll be the

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:29.249
guy that they go to yeah I'm gonna set

00:15:29.249 --> 00:15:31.949
up shops everywhere I would have shops

00:15:31.949 --> 00:15:32.790
every [ __ ]

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.980
Andriy everybody dude we're doing it and

go back to when I'm stressed I'd like

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:56.580
this weekend I watched Ken Burns Civil

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.680
War yet he always goes back to the Civil

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.870
War I'm like this is great really always

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:03.600
so you get stressed out you seek solace

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:09.210
in like Civil War learn about it really

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:10.740
yeah it's funny my cousin I told you

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:11.880
before my cousin got really into the

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.330
Civil War

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:15.140
yeah I wonder what that is I don't know

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.640
did you ever like while you were

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.900
watching this stuff like do you ever

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.370
like fantasize about being like a

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:21.810
general in the Civil War absolutely not

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:24.270
you never know you never fantasize about

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.120
battle or anything no okay I mean you

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.800
think about what it might be like but no

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.500
it would all it would always suck yeah

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.570
so you're never done I'm watching it the

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.310
whole time I'm watching or doing

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.230
anything with it I'm liking there's not

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:38.610
one moment of this that wouldn't have

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:40.890
just sucked ass so what do you think you

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:42.270
were getting out of it when you go I

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.850
don't know I think it's like any subject

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:45.730
I study

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:47.380
it's if I have a like that's why I liked

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.790
history so much because I always knew it

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:50.380
mm-hmm it's like if I have a base

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.910
understanding of something I can study

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.820
it pretty easily yeah so like yeah

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.620
where'd you get your base understanding

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:00.760
of history my mom taught fifth grade

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.010
when I was a kid and every year they

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:03.960
went to Gettysburg

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.640
so you just I would go on a field trip

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.980
with her class every year to Gettysburg

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.890
as he young man yeah you remember this

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:14.020

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.660
fifth grade or utero on the battlefield

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.760
mm-hmm and you're like don't tell us

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.410
like never forget this is the answer

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:23.919
Pickett's Charge it's cool someday

00:18:23.919 --> 00:18:25.120

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:30.730
documentary about Pickett's Charge yeah

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.799

00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:35.350
depressed mm-hmm I've been depressed

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:37.240
yeah usually you don't know it while

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.660
you're in it but you can tell when you

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.419

until you're out of it totally yeah

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.890
wears off I'm very cyclical with it but

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:55.360
while you're in it it's like all right I

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.120
think a minute I can feel it you know

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.390
yeah I'm more of a fright night I'm more

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:04.870
of a like dark night of the soul the

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:06.100
ones that I'll get points where I'm

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.260
mopey and I'm just like might where I

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:09.880
get hit in the nighttime vortex

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.919
real I go to lay down it's just like

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.840

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.620
I might have to switch to a flip phone

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.210
to be honest it's not a bad idea

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.390
I really am considering that there's a

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:30.190
strong correlation between my well-being

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.200
and how much I'm looking at all in my

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.790
screen time I get to screen time reports

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:35.710

tomorrow maybe someone said something

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.169

00:19:56.169 --> 00:19:58.990
of social media as being like maybe

00:19:58.990 --> 00:19:59.410

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.080
the nuke that is the newts funny you

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.570
you're getting like hate messages I just

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.580
go to a place twice a week where people

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.880
physically hate me literally people just

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.570
daggers just looking like oh yeah that's

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.070
tough it's tough to tell if it's real or

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.080
not sometimes you can tell obviously

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.700
it's real but sometimes it's like I said

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.110
in my head it's that person looking at

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:44.370
me are we still making eye contact

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.850
because I kept it - so the first week I

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:49.350
went back I was like kind of paranoid

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:50.790
I'm like that probably nobody knows and

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:51.900
like people would catch me in the

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.270
hallway and be like yo everybody's

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:57.540

right away they're like [ __ ] are you

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.390
doing it was my [ __ ] the industry

career you're out of the game you're off

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.350

this rage is and again maybe I'm

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:39.920
projecting I don't think I am is people

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.820
dealing with their own obscurity in the

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.610

it's a little too hot for a curb I think

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:57.020

00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:02.810

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.100

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.670
you seen that since she died on the show

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:46.040
they literally have literally had a fake

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.040
Roseanne's character died I think I

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.600
don't I could be wrong I think she owed

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:54.770
heed what yeah and now all those actors

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.540
are like mourning her on the show and

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:59.420
like she was so great and then I think

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.770
in real life they're like [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:03.140

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.330

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.860

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.320
small that's argument though what if

there are small pockets in Chicago of

00:31:38.419 --> 00:31:41.540
people that love Roseanne true maybe

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:42.740
there were some guys that were like hey

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.090
this is Trump country I still believe

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:46.340
small that story I do too I believe that

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:48.169
two Nigerians came and set and tried to

00:31:48.169 --> 00:31:50.090
hate-crime him because they loved Trump

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:51.140
so much because Trump obviously

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.380
distorted their minds it could be yeah

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:59.510
or maybe Trump's why yeah the kick him

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:01.520

kind of like they don't have anything

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:19.220

funny alright I'm trying be funny now

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:27.920
it's hard to be funny right now it's

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.960
really hard it's all because you said

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:34.099
bad things and it's funny though because

00:44:34.099 --> 00:44:38.060
uh it is interesting because you do kind

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:39.440
when you when you put out a ton of

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:46.040
[ __ ] just like negative [ __ ] so we

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:49.810
were just building a little bomb slowly

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:53.510
yeah it comes back man

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:55.930

started the October 1st is gonna happen

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:00.770
though what this is mine was not the

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:04.819
first I was so when I started comedy it

00:45:04.819 --> 00:45:08.150
was when podcasts if you were doing an

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:10.520
open mic you had a podcast hmm or send

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.530
said [ __ ] dumb [ __ ] yeah the whole

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:13.910
time so there's gonna be a whole

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:16.030
generation of comics now that have

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:17.960
hundreds and hundreds of hours of

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.750
podcasts yeah this is gonna be a pretty

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:22.940
regular thing of people being like oh

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:24.740
[ __ ] you said that on that oh you said

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:25.940
that on people are gonna go back and

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:27.710
start deleting this [ __ ] I think yeah

00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:30.069
that's the per is gonna be a great purge

00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:32.810
but I'm sure all these always freaks out

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:35.329
here downloaded [ __ ] it's like you can't

00:45:35.329 --> 00:45:36.589
get anything you can't really erase

00:45:36.589 --> 00:45:38.359
anything yeah it's in the chain it's in

00:45:38.359 --> 00:45:40.849
the [ __ ] collective memory so those

00:45:40.849 --> 00:45:42.470
Scotties of the world new people that

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:46.220
have podcasts you say [ __ ] you say

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:48.859
outlandish [ __ ] to act out like you know

00:45:48.859 --> 00:45:50.270
it's like when you start an open mic

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:52.310
yeah your first couple stand-ups you're

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:55.069
like oh [ __ ] gay people uh-huh and

00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:57.530
like just say you just say offensive

00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:59.150
things to try to get a real and this is

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:00.619
it's kind of the same thing with a lot

00:46:00.619 --> 00:46:01.609
of pocket not that that's what we were

00:46:01.609 --> 00:46:03.140
doing trust me yeah ours was very

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:05.270
nuanced true people are really missing

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:06.890
the nuance on how [ __ ] dude people

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:08.390
don't think obviously people think we're

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:10.040
too [ __ ] idiots obviously we're

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:12.140
genius playing 40 [ __ ] just authority

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:13.849
chests and people don't understand but

00:46:13.849 --> 00:46:15.079
that I you know I can't blame them for

00:46:15.079 --> 00:46:19.069
that yeah I you know but I do think this

00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:21.140
will be this is one of the first is the

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:22.670
landmark case of people that are going

00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:24.470
to start getting bought [ __ ] on Park

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:26.240
yes for sure I mean it's not even is

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:31.130
that politicians it's like oh yeah yeah

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:34.369
and it's like those young for a

00:46:34.369 --> 00:46:35.900
politician he's got black face dude

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:37.490
every young politicians gonna have some

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:39.920
watch think about the kids now growing

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:42.349
up doing this who are going to like you

00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:44.840
know studying political science we're

00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:46.880
gonna be politicians they're probably

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:48.650
just being like [ __ ] online they're

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:50.300
probably just storing [ __ ] of each other

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.950
it's just not they're probably people I

00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:54.380
have dossiers a black male being built

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:56.030
yeah if you're like a nasty little

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:58.190
[ __ ] and you're like 18 right now and

00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:59.300

rails a little bit but if the cast

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:48.290

00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:54.260
like a broken bone yeah it's coming back

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:56.810

unassailable and it's like if and then I

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:28.700

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:33.770

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:36.680
strange I'm like let me get the [ __ ] out

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.180
I was like I can't wait for break times

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:39.890
we have break time there's a creek near

00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:42.200
it yes I went in this pond i sat by the

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:45.850
creek and it was staring down this Creek

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:55.090
just pondering by the creek

00:53:56.950 --> 00:54:01.310
dude so I'm sitting there and I'm sure

00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:02.420
there's like a little fish in cinema

00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:04.460
cool little fish I come back from

00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:05.990
checking the creek out oh my oh my god I

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:07.490
didn't feel [ __ ] good I need to get I

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:08.630
need to get in the woods real quick and

00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:12.650
come back out dude this dude's like he

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:16.310
all right and I was like yeah why he's

00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:17.030
like what are you doing overtime

00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:18.530
checking out the creek he's like man

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:19.850
only I don't have time to even think

00:54:19.850 --> 00:54:22.610
about creeks I was like this is the

00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:24.890
thing I'm specifically working on I'm

00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:28.400
exploring my unconscious like micro

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.990
decisions that occur so usually some guy

00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.980
will be I don't even have time for

00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:34.700
creeks naturally is a ridiculous

00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:37.130
statement yeah naturally naturally I

00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:39.950
just go like okay I guess I'm weird for

00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:41.180
a sin by a creek and I'll be like

00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:43.040
whatever and I'll start walking and then

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:44.660
him literally split second I was like

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:45.980
what the [ __ ] do you have against creeks

00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:48.080
and then he was like no I'm saying like

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:50.390
I'm real busy right now I'm like okay so

00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:51.380
what the [ __ ] that have to do with

00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:53.120
creeks like what you know what I mean

00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.370
yeah so usually it'll just be like I

00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:57.440
guess I'm a [ __ ] weirdo if looking at

00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:58.790
creeks let's just go along with whatever

00:54:58.790 --> 00:55:00.140
the [ __ ] this guy thinks about the

00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:01.520
particular situation you know it was

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.020
just interesting for me so that's been

00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:05.270
my that's been my main focus of just

00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:07.340
busting out of unconscious patterns and

00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:09.290
the whole thing is to integrate that

00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:10.060
into your day

00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:12.040
the next day and so on and so forth nice

00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:14.800
so your bedtimes confront [ __ ]

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:17.380
about creeks pretty much or just like

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.200
you know if you do little things

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.040
unconsciously you're just down a creek

00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:23.200
down by the creek I'm chillin looking at

00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:25.300
the fish and it this is the whole point

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:26.440
of minnows in the creek and you're

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:27.730
feeling there's like four of them

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:30.740
squiggling around nice so it's like you

00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:32.220
[Music]

00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:34.720
you have these unconscious patterns of

00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:37.600
behavior yeah everyone has them and once

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:38.950
it's actually kind of fun it's kind of a

00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:40.210
harrowing experience when you start

00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:41.470
confronting these things cause it opens

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:43.720
up a weird start inhabiting a weird

00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:45.640
world when you start like reconstructing

00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:47.530
your weird things you just go to

00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:50.380
automatically it's pretty strange but uh

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:51.550
but yeah we had a conversation about

00:55:51.550 --> 00:55:53.350
that and a dude was just stressed out

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:55.900
about like going to school full time

00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:57.400
he's like I just you know I have oh and

00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:00.340
it's like okay well the Fox I have to do

00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:01.840
with me sit in my goddamn Creek do to

00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:04.170
get my [ __ ] [ __ ] back together

00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:06.910
I don't people got to be negative about

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:07.890
[ __ ] like that

00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:11.830
ya hear you man I hear you that the

00:56:11.830 --> 00:56:14.440
mushroom thing I think it brought me

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:16.330
back to when I took mushrooms and

00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:17.710
listened to the annihilation soundtrack

00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:20.200
yeah that's the world I'm in now that's

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.850
just life now I was just preparing I

00:56:21.850 --> 00:56:23.280
didn't even know it subconsciously

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:26.430
supposed to be like dude in my sub

00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:29.020
coming I knew now would you say that

00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:30.610
helps you at all having done that or is

00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:32.050
that just like a weird night you had did

00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:34.390
you get anything from that weird just

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:36.100
like a weird no I was kind of [ __ ]

00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:46.780
hammered - so he's got right now that's

00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:47.170
funny

Wrath where the the all the dudes in

00:59:01.449 --> 00:59:03.459
this town in Oklahoma they're like

00:59:03.459 --> 00:59:05.529
gathering and sitting in a circle all

00:59:05.529 --> 00:59:08.469
the man of the town go sit and talk and

00:59:08.469 --> 00:59:10.420
they're all they're all just just got

00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:11.859
bought off their lands by the banks

00:59:11.859 --> 00:59:13.989

00:59:13.989 --> 00:59:16.779
they're all [ __ ] and then today he

00:59:16.779 --> 00:59:18.339
describes the women standing in the

00:59:18.339 --> 00:59:20.019
doorways watching the men and like

00:59:20.019 --> 00:59:22.479
judging their faces and like women can

00:59:22.479 --> 00:59:25.089
tell whether or not their men are broken

00:59:25.089 --> 00:59:27.069
and they're like and then if the man

00:59:27.069 --> 00:59:30.279

00:59:30.279 --> 00:59:32.109
the women were like happy but if he came

00:59:32.109 --> 00:59:33.189
back like they could see if they were

00:59:33.189 --> 00:59:35.170
broken like the men the women stood in

00:59:35.170 --> 00:59:36.640
the doorway checking to see if the men

00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:37.030

he sad like no I'm pissed no sisters I'm

00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:51.400
going I'm gonna get motivated to do

00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:54.970
comedy somebody to go into comedy like

00:59:54.970 --> 00:59:56.680
I'm gonna [ __ ] everybody up hey

00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:58.750
everybody how are you are you guys doing

00:59:58.750 --> 00:59:59.110
okay

00:59:59.110 --> 01:00:02.110
any birthdays out there hey anybody

01:00:02.110 --> 01:00:04.390
celebrating an anniversary all right

01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:07.180
yeah well that's been tough with comedy

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:09.820
is trying I'm okay with talking about I

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:11.110
don't care talk about what's going on

01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:13.630
but like I usually onstage only talk

01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:14.980
about what I'm like thinking about it

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:16.480
like going that's it like that's the

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.220
only thing I can talk about yeah it's so

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:20.070
hard to get into a joke about like

01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:22.860
relationships while this is taking place

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:25.270
yeah I mean it's hard for me to do that

01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:27.670
you know your mind too can really hunker

01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:30.070
down on one thing so you get you get

01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:31.470
focused on something it's just like

01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:35.080
that's it yeah I can only focus on

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:36.700
something for like 14 minutes at a time

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:39.160
yeah I can focus on one thing for five

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:43.930
years know my days just like a flash of

01:00:43.930 --> 01:00:47.460
like dude obviously the [ __ ] wind

01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:50.740
that had a sick theory about the wind

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:53.170
yeah damn right dude it was all I was

01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:55.330
right about the world on one drive this

01:00:55.330 --> 01:00:57.640
is on the way to my [ __ ] uh this is

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.410
all the way to the hearing to the

01:00:59.410 --> 01:01:02.980
[ __ ] Inquisition I'm driving in the

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:04.990
lift having a [ __ ] blast through the

01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:06.490
wind's blowing on me I'm like man this

01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:09.340
is cool as [ __ ] and uh I've been reading

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:11.200
a lot of like alchemical kind of

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.270
literature so I'm I'm becoming a

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:14.830
religious slowly I'm slowly becoming

01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:16.840
religious because I'm reading a bunch of

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.570
like old kind of English title yeah I

01:01:19.570 --> 01:01:20.890
think this is the only thing that

01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:22.150
happened in this ordeal is you and me

01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:24.460
are just Catholic as [ __ ] now dude why

01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:26.200
I'm reading a book right now in the

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:28.150
Catholicism didn't do it the book I'm

01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:29.110
reading right now it's called the

01:01:29.110 --> 01:01:31.240
temptation of st. George no sorry the

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:32.950
temptation of st. Anthony yeah

01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:35.950
and it basically details the student

01:01:35.950 --> 01:01:37.600
flow bear was a temptation to somebody

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:42.210
lose their car keys which me oh he was

01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:45.430
he has to like it's from based on a

01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:47.200
picture like st. Anthony's just like a

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.670
hermit he's being tempted by the devil

01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:50.170
classic [ __ ] yeah

01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:52.090
Jesus scenario well he's the devil's

01:01:52.090 --> 01:01:53.260
problems and all the stuff and he's just

01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:55.210
chillin as a home heard that been there

01:01:55.210 --> 01:01:58.780
exactly exactly so the the but in the

01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:02.250
book flow bear spent his entire life of

01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:04.870
cataloging the thought of like every

01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:07.690
single sect of Christianity every single

01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:09.220
religion in the time of early

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:10.630
Christianity and how they intermingle

01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:12.160
before like became like we you know one

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.750
thing and other ones went by the wayside

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:16.240
but dude so I'm reading nothing but like

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:18.250
old English literature where basically

01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:19.840
if you're not religious you're a [ __ ]

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.820
dick they're just like what a it was

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:23.950
like you were a loser they're basically

01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:26.320
like dude like when if when that stuff

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:27.940
first started to come about with people

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:29.890
it would the book I'm reading is about

01:02:29.890 --> 01:02:31.780
like the French for evolution well it's

01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:33.460
like it takes place in Italy but like

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:34.690
they're dealing with the French coming

01:02:34.690 --> 01:02:36.100
down and the French were basically like

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.870
we can solve everything through science

01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:39.310
this is like hundreds of years ago mmm

01:02:39.310 --> 01:02:41.980
every was like dude shut up you [ __ ]

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:42.490
dork

01:02:42.490 --> 01:02:44.380
yeah like avi and this was a guy who's

01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:46.210
like an alchemist who's like obviously

01:02:46.210 --> 01:02:47.980
dude there's [ __ ] magic I'm an

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:49.300
herbalist I'm an alchemist you're

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:51.130
[ __ ] lame it's funny as [ __ ] but I'm

01:02:51.130 --> 01:02:53.680
driving in the lift and I'm like damn

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.540
dude I was thinking about the wind

01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:58.000
because we're pushing through there was

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.470
there's no wind present at all and the

01:02:59.470 --> 01:03:00.670
car goes and all of a sudden there's

01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:02.230
wind coming through my damn dude I'm

01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:03.640
pushing through the elements right now

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.530
yeah and I'm just creating wind that's

01:03:05.530 --> 01:03:06.910
when I got my theory of basically it's

01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:08.950
where does wind come from exactly where

01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:10.450
it's the earth spinning or it's falling

01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:14.980
down from outer space there was so much

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:16.240
like intelligence brought at the

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:19.300
beginning of that argument results in

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:22.120
big wind is just air from outer space or

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.280
the world spinning or again it's the

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.110
thing that I got really hung up on is

01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:28.900
that if there's no win if shame there's

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:30.790
no breeze in this room if I start

01:03:30.790 --> 01:03:32.530
running around or spinning you're gonna

01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:35.350
catch your source or me moving through

01:03:35.350 --> 01:03:36.820
something so there is an invisible

01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:38.980
matter that I'm physically pushing

01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:40.780
around when I move and you'll feel that

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:42.910
[ __ ] sick well yeah that's that's

01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:44.590
what's in the air what is that though

01:03:44.590 --> 01:03:47.620
just atoms but I can send them at I can

01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:49.660
literally like this you're feeling it

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:51.820
dude I'm sending [ __ ] that's over here

01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:55.320
and I'm thrown in a [ __ ] Bo

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:59.290
[Laughter]

01:03:59.290 --> 01:04:01.900
I can literally dude

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:04.240
send you a win but I can blast you with

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.549
wind that's so [ __ ] sick you like

01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:08.079
that I love that dude and then I was

01:04:08.079 --> 01:04:10.059
driving I was just like the whole point

01:04:10.059 --> 01:04:13.150
of conscious thought is to be able to to

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:15.970
deal with the Eternity that's literally

01:04:15.970 --> 01:04:18.789
the fruit of conscious thought and if

01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:20.230
you don't interact with that you're

01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:21.010
[ __ ] up

01:04:21.010 --> 01:04:23.470
now I'm religious as [ __ ] what do you

01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:24.789
think about the French coming down and

01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:25.990
being like we can solve everything with

01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:27.549
science [ __ ] ruined it doode they're

01:04:27.549 --> 01:04:29.140
you know like that jerk-off Sears you

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:30.690
know that that resulted in they got

01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:33.700
basically a Hitler type mm-hmm they got

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:36.190
Napoleon after that yeah that's that's

01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:37.990
what all those like young conquered

01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:39.730
Europe after all that like we can solve

01:04:39.730 --> 01:04:40.240
everything

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.819
yep science is the best and they pour

01:04:42.819 --> 01:04:46.059
all that crazy weird energy into just a

01:04:46.059 --> 01:04:48.180
personality or I'm saying those two

01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:52.150
definitely interact via Dostoevsky would

01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:53.799
disagree dude there's there's so many

01:04:53.799 --> 01:04:55.210
other people right and like dude you

01:04:55.210 --> 01:04:56.680
can't take away these rules because

01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:58.059
people are gonna start acting like total

01:04:58.059 --> 01:05:00.819
[ __ ] [ __ ] more so than before

01:05:00.819 --> 01:05:03.640
although I wonder if it's ever like I

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.710
don't think that ever goes away what's

01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:07.960
that just total mob mentality I've said

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.640
it before it says the mob mentality is

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.440
just YouTube comments now where it's

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:16.599

01:05:16.599 --> 01:05:18.849
dude and when you're not the subject

01:05:18.849 --> 01:05:23.319

that's a scary bunch but yeah man but

01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:04.510
that was my that was my thinking on the

01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:06.430
way on the way up I was like what if we

01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:08.230

Legos they invent Legos yeah it's kind

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:22.990
of [ __ ] that's kind of chill yeah I

01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:24.880
think they got Legos and like IKEA not

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:29.920
gonna pop building sort of tiny building

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:32.260
things sort of like that no one ever can

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:33.820
follow the directions I told you in my

01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:35.470
last year's Halloween costume is gonna

01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:38.800
be what's that Swedish carpenter have a

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:47.410
tool belt with just allen keys pretty

01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:49.780
good did you come up with it yeah wow

01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:51.730
yeah dude I think of cool [ __ ] all

01:07:51.730 --> 01:07:53.590
[ __ ] day when you're religious dude

01:07:53.590 --> 01:07:56.140
well then you're religious like me yeah

01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:58.300
God blesses you God blesses you with

01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:00.580
sick ass the whole point wait what

01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:03.000
religion are you leaning towards

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.140
Christian mysticism probably it's like

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:08.380
an old obscure Christian mystic set nice

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:09.839
yeah

01:08:09.839 --> 01:08:13.990
probably but yeah that's the that was my

01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:15.579
whole that was my insight on the way to

01:08:15.579 --> 01:08:16.810
school I was like damn dude

01:08:16.810 --> 01:08:19.330
wind wind first of all is it the fact

01:08:19.330 --> 01:08:20.830
that I can just move through space and

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:22.509
generate wind I'm like that's [ __ ]

01:08:22.509 --> 01:08:25.000
awesome yeah and again the whole point

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.520
of conscious thought is to interact with

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.699
the eternal that's the fruit of it

01:08:30.699 --> 01:08:32.710
that's that's what I yeah me personally

01:08:32.710 --> 01:08:34.929
that's what I say damn everything else

01:08:34.929 --> 01:08:36.699
is just too tangled [ __ ] vines dude

01:08:36.699 --> 01:08:38.739
and then it's like Boop oh that's nice

01:08:38.739 --> 01:08:48.960
that's a delicious berry nuts why yeah

01:08:50.670 --> 01:08:53.380
I'm telling you without it it's it's

01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:54.580
it's the worst because like we've

01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:56.830
completely disproved that whole line of

01:08:56.830 --> 01:08:59.020
thinking what's it's like we figured out

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:01.480
how to just be like totally okay with

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:03.759
everything and people were like take it

01:09:03.759 --> 01:09:04.120
away

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:08.589
I mean religion you mean yeah or some

01:09:08.589 --> 01:09:12.370
sort of thinking like that I mean you

01:09:12.370 --> 01:09:13.989
replace like obviously there was you

01:09:13.989 --> 01:09:15.339
know people were killing each other in

01:09:15.339 --> 01:09:17.500
the names religions what you can I

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.120
always like how would that happen now

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.589
I'm like oh I could see how that [ __ ]

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:22.750
that [ __ ] happened yeah people be like

01:09:22.750 --> 01:09:25.239
no I'm right it's like see how that's

01:09:25.239 --> 01:09:27.699
been literally been since day one with a

01:09:27.699 --> 01:09:30.370
mountain still going on them yeah still

01:09:30.370 --> 01:09:32.560
going with everybody yeah yeah no I'm

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:35.410
right no and it's but again I kill a

01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:37.179
bunch of people that live around you and

01:09:37.179 --> 01:09:39.069
I'm right not only I'm not only like I'm

01:09:39.069 --> 01:09:40.270
gonna kill bunch of people think I'm

01:09:40.270 --> 01:09:42.969
fully justified yeah you're starting to

01:09:42.969 --> 01:09:44.679
see that thinking kind of creep up dude

01:09:44.679 --> 01:09:50.560
people being like it's coming dude you

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:53.020
think I mean I don't I don't think it'll

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:55.630
get there but they're the same strings

01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:58.630
are being kind of pulled yeah they are

01:09:58.630 --> 01:10:00.820
the same strings that says the religious

01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:02.530
[ __ ] so but you could buttress yourself

01:10:02.530 --> 01:10:05.350
against it if you have some sort of

01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:07.360
deeper belief system than I live in a

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:09.670
cold def universe that doesn't care

01:10:09.670 --> 01:10:12.370
about me that's what we've taken it away

01:10:12.370 --> 01:10:14.320
and put it in that weave some for some

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:16.840
reason we're like yeah that's the one

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:20.830
it's like why it's a it's a terrifying

01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:22.579
[ __ ] thought

01:10:22.579 --> 01:10:25.250
what is that you did we just live in a

01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:27.050
cold def universe that is like

01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:32.300
completely I think that's true well no

01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:34.219
what's weird is you know I was reading

01:10:34.219 --> 01:10:37.429
the answers to Joe answers a job is my

01:10:37.429 --> 01:10:39.199
book I read while I take a dump it's a

01:10:39.199 --> 01:10:41.179
small little book big job yeah

01:10:41.179 --> 01:10:43.010
Joe you like job I'm going through some

01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:45.440
job [ __ ] bro answers a job it's good but

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:48.349
he basically he was talking about how

01:10:48.349 --> 01:10:50.750
you know we had like Zeus what we didn't

01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:52.340
have him but Zeus was like the Greek god

01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:55.579
who was basically like completely

01:10:55.579 --> 01:10:57.409
detached from human affairs for the most

01:10:57.409 --> 01:10:59.420
part Zeus was just in the sky like

01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:02.449
flexing his traps and be like come down

01:11:02.449 --> 01:11:04.190
late pipe occasion he would [ __ ] every

01:11:04.190 --> 01:11:05.329
now and again and everyone again II

01:11:05.329 --> 01:11:06.829
would like Chuck a thunderbolt people

01:11:06.829 --> 01:11:09.110
they [ __ ] you and that was the Greeks

01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:12.739
deity yeah and it was until the the

01:11:12.739 --> 01:11:14.809
judeo-christian God was the first guy to

01:11:14.809 --> 01:11:17.599
come and be like what are you guys doing

01:11:17.599 --> 01:11:19.730
and like was the first it's literally an

01:11:19.730 --> 01:11:22.790
erotic deity yeah who was came down was

01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:25.000
just like a total [ __ ] weirdo like

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.409
Zeus was just all-powerful like [ __ ] you

01:11:27.409 --> 01:11:29.150
dude I'm the [ __ ] man yeah and the

01:11:29.150 --> 01:11:31.639
Jewish the Hebrew God Yahweh was just

01:11:31.639 --> 01:11:33.980
kind of like you can't do this and came

01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:36.530
down there se-young puts forth that like

01:11:36.530 --> 01:11:40.610
it was a God who was like real weirdly

01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:42.500
intertwined with people and like it was

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:43.940
a completely imperfect and strange

01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:46.489
strange think about how people a

01:11:46.489 --> 01:11:48.530
people's collective mentality projected

01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:51.460
out and forced a Ford form their deities

01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:53.360
isn't it funny because Jewish people

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.460
tend to be neurotic and they came up

01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:58.699
with an erotic God yeah which is so

01:11:58.699 --> 01:12:01.070
[ __ ] weird yeah I just thought that

01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:02.989
was [ __ ] great people are yoked

01:12:02.989 --> 01:12:04.429
they're just yoked and they're just like

01:12:04.429 --> 01:12:06.139
good at [ __ ] Olympics and [ __ ] dude

01:12:06.139 --> 01:12:07.280
and they're like that's literally all

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.719
Zeus did he would just like walk around

01:12:08.719 --> 01:12:11.809
and like [ __ ] watch it discus [ __ ]

01:12:11.809 --> 01:12:12.409
yeah dude

01:12:12.409 --> 01:12:14.090
yes Zeus is cool but they also the

I'm human [ __ ] response I'll tell you

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.120
what dude I went out to that [ __ ]

01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:09.920
Creek and I was like I'm chilling as

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.660
soon as alright one guy's like hey you

01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:13.460
alright I'm like [ __ ] and I'm

01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:15.980
like yeah I think Thomas acquainted some

01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:17.660
reflection might create really I think

01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:18.860
one of the ways he proved God was

01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:21.110
something with that probably what I was

01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:22.430
unconsciously working on probably

01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:23.810
working on proving God yeah I mean you

01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:26.600
returned into religion I did I think he

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.560
might have been sitting down there with

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.450
you at that Creek I think so

01:15:29.450 --> 01:15:30.920
Aquinas might have been sitting [ __ ]

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:32.540
these [ __ ] to go back in there and

01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:34.790
shove it up their ass do you think

01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:37.760
Phil's Thomas Aquinas sure for [ __ ]

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:39.680
sure dude so I'm telling you man it's

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:43.610
like it's nice when you have an actual

01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:45.020
mission in life when you have a real

01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:46.670
mission in life it is a sweet pleasure

01:15:46.670 --> 01:15:49.670
that like the idea of just total ruin

01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:52.190
and destruction is like worth it totally

01:15:52.190 --> 01:15:53.990
worth it given and if your ping around

01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:56.480
in a little hamster cage it's like safe

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:59.000

some ladies tend to be a stepmom

01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:18.040
throwing up I got into so I started just

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.470
kind of like looking around a little bit

01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:23.680
and I got into this genre I never heard

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:27.570
about where it's it's black bbws

01:20:27.570 --> 01:20:30.490

that's basically been around for

01:31:47.179 --> 01:31:48.860
thousands of years and you're like one

01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:50.360
of the last male heir so you have to

01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:52.369

01:31:52.369 --> 01:31:54.949

01:31:54.949 --> 01:31:56.449
this before no it's a thirty year

01:31:56.449 --> 01:31:58.309

01:31:59.119 --> 01:32:02.119
thirty year apprenticeship and you have

01:32:02.119 --> 01:32:04.039
to basically with in order to be a druid

01:32:04.039 --> 01:32:06.530
in this this like realm of it you have

01:32:06.530 --> 01:32:09.079
to be able to like you like hold the

01:32:09.079 --> 01:32:11.420
civilization - you are like a capsule of

01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:13.429
the entire civilization you have to know

01:32:13.429 --> 01:32:16.320
what philosophy the history the math

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:18.929
farming techniques everything so like if

01:32:18.929 --> 01:32:21.630
there's a cataclysm you if you survive

01:32:21.630 --> 01:32:23.850
as a druid you can just reseed the whole

01:32:23.850 --> 01:32:26.100
civilization seems stupid [ __ ]

01:32:26.100 --> 01:32:27.239
awesome dude that's what they're sure

01:32:27.239 --> 01:32:29.730
you're writing it down right well they

01:32:29.730 --> 01:32:31.739
develop the a cheap Elsa agent Celts

01:32:31.739 --> 01:32:32.880
didn't really write much but this guy

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:34.530
did do some writing but a lot i write

01:32:34.530 --> 01:32:35.880
that because if the whole thing is like

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:37.469
if there's a cataclysmic event you have

01:32:37.469 --> 01:32:39.300
to restart it's more likely that he's

01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:41.760
just gonna [ __ ] die true well they

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:44.730
apparently he's a bad group there's a

01:32:44.730 --> 01:32:46.199
lot of the stuff that Celts that's why

01:32:46.199 --> 01:32:47.280
no one knows about him cuz they didn't

01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:48.540

01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:50.370
