00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.639
in the morning and then that's just

00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:36.240
resulted in pure horse piles for the

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.000
rest of the week oh my gosh

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.839
i've been walking around dropping all

00:14:39.839 --> 00:14:41.920
files all right so this ira if you drop

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.440
a pile in the kovind test excuse me sir

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.880
no i gotta drop a pile

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.880
pardon me i have to pile out like how

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.160
deep is your bowl cause i don't want to

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.480
breach it

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.600
i but yeah he was saying it mutates too

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.440
quick in this iranian doctor's opinion

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.959
the

00:15:00.959 --> 00:15:03.199
um because he was like i've had people

00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:04.560
tested with the antibodies they get

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:04.959
stick

00:15:04.959 --> 00:15:06.480
they still get sick because it does

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.240
mutate it's like the reason you get your

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.399
flu vaccine once a year is because it

00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:12.320
mutates slower and you need to redo it

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.519
every year something like that yeah i

00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:14.880
don't the [ __ ] going on

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.880
yeah but he was like an anti-vaxxer

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.000
covet tester it was a hell yeah it was a

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.360
real confusing day because then when i

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.720
got the antibodies there was like

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.839
a slight amount of this possible

00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:29.839
antibody that means i had it or like was

00:15:29.839 --> 00:15:31.440
in contact with it currently

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.040
yeah but it was enough that he jotted

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.560

very faint you should have peed on it

00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:45.600

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:44.640
crowded

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.720

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.200
execute them

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.799
but you can put them in a round them up

population

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.440
you know what you could do especially

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.279
i'm just saying like i love science so

00:29:37.279 --> 00:29:37.679
much

00:29:37.679 --> 00:29:39.679
that you know and i hate covert so much

00:29:39.679 --> 00:29:41.520
that i'm saying scientifically speaking

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.360
on purely the basis of like a love they

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.200
are dangerous for the spread of coco

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:45.760
exactly

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.919
you know pure you know again just love

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:49.279
the way science works what you could do

00:29:49.279 --> 00:29:49.520
is

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.000
dress as your homeless and just go

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.279

good now

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.279
you know we should definitely start not

00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:26.559
killing homeless people but just kind of

00:30:26.559 --> 00:30:28.080
putting them out of commission

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.080
you know if the elements take them out

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.679

so i'm doing my part stopping the spread

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.600
of coronavirus by hiring

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.600

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.880

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.160

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.160
story we were talking about um

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.240
we the whole we were talking about like

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.200
[ __ ]

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.560
now it's all coming back to me man we

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.200
came up with like a new [ __ ] slur

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.000
that's for everybody that everybody like

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.040
it's pretty tight yeah

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.160
but the um what was the slur oh [ __ ]

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.119
dude i can't i

00:40:01.119 --> 00:40:03.000
literally can't it's just the n-word

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.119
[Laughter]

00:40:05.119 --> 00:40:08.240
like it was uh oh never mind i literally

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.319
forgot what it was but the uh

00:40:10.319 --> 00:40:12.240
i was telling a story about how when

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.599
there was there was a dude at my job it

00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:14.880
was like 10 years ago

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.560
there's a guy he tried to like white

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.319
like have a racist conversation with me

00:40:18.319 --> 00:40:19.839
amongst like a bunch of like black union

00:40:19.839 --> 00:40:22.240
laborers and the reaction

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.800
is pretty tight the thing that i said

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.800
that i said was and i i think i did i

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.839
don't know if i did this on this

00:40:27.839 --> 00:40:29.040
occasion i think it happened a bunch of

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:29.680
times

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.480
but i remember saying what i said was i

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.200
was like

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.079
uh i was i called the one dude over i

00:40:36.079 --> 00:40:37.520
knew the black dude and i was like i was

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.079
like huh

00:40:38.079 --> 00:40:39.280
tell him what you just said and the guy

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.599
was like [ __ ] you dude [ __ ] you oh wow

00:40:41.599 --> 00:40:42.400
so they're like you're a [ __ ]

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.240
wrestler it was a [ __ ] movie the

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:44.960
rest of the stuff

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.640
exactly i know you're that's a [ __ ] up

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.000
move here is the problem

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.800
again yes here's the problem they uh so

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.240
i said that and i was like

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.760
and then i started going like in this

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.599
weird tailspin where i'm like am i just

00:40:55.599 --> 00:40:56.640
going back on this now

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:57.920
because then i started remembering i was

00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.280
like i remember that happening i

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.880
remember like angrily being like

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.640
my wife's black [ __ ] you and walking

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.720
away i was like 25 dude

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.720
so i was like because i remember

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.920
thinking like

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:10.800
i wasn't like i was i was like 25 dude i

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.240
was [ __ ] gay i wasn't down with

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:14.160
racism yet no

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.760
i wasn't like racism is pretty funny and

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.200
cool that's

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.800
funny the guy was genuinely like yeah he

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.640
was genuinely like an angry racist dude

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:21.680
but he uh

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.680
i remember what i was taking them back i

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.280
was trying to was like dude i had

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.960
back then i had just no sense of self so

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.400
i would like i would have

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.599
someone would present me with something

00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:31.760
like that and i would be like

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.280
if my wife finds out that would be more

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.640
uncomfortable than this but i also don't

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.920
want to kind of like be uncomfortable

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.200
towards this guy it was like yeah i

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.480
would just shuffle back and forth like

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.839
what's more uncomfortable and deal with

00:41:39.839 --> 00:41:40.960
things like that

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.640
so then i started being like you did the

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.800
most uncomfortable thing oh for sure 100

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:45.839
the most comfortable thing would have

00:41:45.839 --> 00:41:48.880
been oh okay thank you and then you

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.680
go oh that's pretty crazy what you said

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:52.880
skedaddle

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.480
so we got this and then i started being

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.040
like dude how many of my memories do i

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.880
do not do i not know like which are true

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.400
and which are false so i went down this

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.000
big rabbit hole and i was like

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.560
am i a [ __ ] liar dude it was just for

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.200
like

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.880
10 minutes like towards the end of it i

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.839
was just like oh no it was funny

00:42:09.839 --> 00:42:11.920
wait so did you actually do that did you

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:13.680
actually snitch on the guy

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.440
or do you do you misremember it i don't

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.480
remember i don't that's the whole

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:17.920
problem i don't remember if that was

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.359
true or if that was something i thought

00:42:19.359 --> 00:42:22.160
of or i do kind of remember being like

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.440
to the one because i was cool with the

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.520
one guy but it wasn't anything like it

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.800
was like it was a snitch like the guy

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:27.599
was like like

00:42:27.599 --> 00:42:29.040
they came over like what the [ __ ] did

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.720
you say about black people

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.079
yeah the guy was like huh and the dude

00:42:32.079 --> 00:42:33.920
was like and then i was like nothing and

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:34.560
then

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.480
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but the uh but

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.079
yeah that was i got like

00:42:38.079 --> 00:42:39.520
you're doing it more as a goof like you

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.040
were like why don't you tell him what

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:41.599
did you say

00:42:41.599 --> 00:42:43.119
what did he say well the time member

00:42:43.119 --> 00:42:44.880
write a theory that's like the theory

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.599
was like dude

00:42:45.599 --> 00:42:46.960
if you're going to do it do it bro go

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.680
all out and you know but it's not a very

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.400
that's not a cool theory that doesn't

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.520
hold up

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.599
no it was it was it was not like a

00:42:55.599 --> 00:42:57.119
that's the thing this whole thing always

00:42:57.119 --> 00:42:58.640
inspires like these what-ifs that just

00:42:58.640 --> 00:42:59.920
go into like the

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.920
most ridiculous territory i understand

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.440
but that was the the crux of the

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.240
situation

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:07.839
was false memories and then reporting

00:43:07.839 --> 00:43:09.200
false memories and being like

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.640
but then being like am i just doubling

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.079
back on this it was dude it was a

00:43:12.079 --> 00:43:13.599
[ __ ] it was an intense moment it's an

00:43:13.599 --> 00:43:15.040
intense experience you'll see me melting

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.760
down in black light just like oh [ __ ]

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.839

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.280
vaguely remember him coming up

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.560

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.720

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:13.680
they just come they get the pressure

00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.520
from their fat butt against the super

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:16.559
tight material

00:59:16.559 --> 00:59:18.160

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:19.920
