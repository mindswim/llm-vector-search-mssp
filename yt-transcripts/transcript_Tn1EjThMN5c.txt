00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:38.639
know

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:40.720
first we were just ramming heads and i

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:43.520

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.039

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:47.039
like

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:48.400
no light at the end of the tunnel and i

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.479
was just like you're so at one point i

00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:50.960
was just like

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.720
you're so [ __ ] mean oh [ __ ] yeah

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.400

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.319
like oh your pussy's freaking out and

00:07:58.319 --> 00:07:59.840

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.400
yeah she had a wild [ __ ] yeah i was

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:02.960
channeling

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.160
part of me i'm sorry i'm sorry for

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.199
saying that's always forgive me it's

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:06.400
like the basketball coach and last

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.759
chance you you know you gotta like you

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:09.199
charge him up but then that

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:10.800
runs out sometimes you gotta go i don't

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.400
know about that analogy that's a little

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.160
yeah you gotta go with the cry sorry

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.840
matt why don't you apologize to matt for

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.800
what you do no i think

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.800
he's liking me to a black preacher yeah

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.479
yeah sometimes you gotta like strong

00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:22.080
charge him up you gotta go after him but

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.919
then i don't wanna delve into this too

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:25.199
far but i do think you owe mad an

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:26.160
apology no i

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.400
just you said he had a mad wife and you

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.160
compared him to a coach in last chance

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.159
i'm saying when you you seem to be

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.800
getting on him about this

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.240
i'll tell you where my mind goes when

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.320
you make a joke like that i know but

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.360
that's you know that's

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.959
something you need to work okay i'm

00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:42.959
telling you what i'm telling you what

00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:44.959
i think that's exactly the answer to any

00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:46.480
relationships problem you have to become

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.480
a strong black christian man

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.720
if you just attack it from that angle

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.080
you can't lose

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.680
yeah you cannot lose how how so

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.040
just if you're getting to an argument

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.320
you just gotta be like god doesn't want

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.519
us doing this baby you gotta start

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:00.640
citing ezekiel

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.720
yeah yeah yeah all the dudes i used to

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.320
work with would definitely hit me they'd

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.920
be like well you know god says man

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.560
created

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.399
women out of man's ribs therefore and

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:09.839
i'd just be like [ __ ] yeah bro

00:09:09.839 --> 00:09:11.440
right they would brush they would bust

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.800
out on arguments and you know you have

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.839
to

00:09:13.839 --> 00:09:16.240
let us pray yeah exactly it's it's the

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.399
solution to all the problems dude

00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:19.839
you're just like girl dude god does not

00:09:19.839 --> 00:09:22.640

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:29.160
[Music]

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.560
this analogy i've never heard it before

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.480
so i was very interested in

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.160
you finishing it and saying that you

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.600

i definitely don't turn into a black

00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:44.000
christian yeah if i quoted the bible

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.600
around her she'd probably [ __ ] hook

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:45.920
me

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.959

she's a good woman she longs for this

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.000
for church dude so you just got to

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.560
tangle

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.040

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.760
i've seen how easy it handles it it's

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.360

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.720
that aggressive you gotta just because

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.480

yeah yeah more than likely okay yeah one

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.279
of these times yeah it takes 45 minutes

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:39.440
yeah but if you if you if you if you get

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.120
angry i've actually kind of i think

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.880
figured this out if you antagonize your

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.680
bae

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.920
and you just let you go look man like i

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.880
don't know what happened there but you

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.240
just let it go you don't try to be well

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:48.880
actually

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.720
that just extends it if you just go like

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.240
hey like not right now

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.880
45 minutes later sometimes they cool

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:55.600
down sometimes

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.360
they spend that 45 minutes coming up

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.710
with a way to drag you

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:06.170
[Laughter]

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.279
that he cares about yeah would she break

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:14.600
your things

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.040
[Laughter]

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:22.320
oh [ __ ] yeah no look just admit it

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.000
what are you trying to hide troops got

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.760
amassed along the border you know what i

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.079
mean

00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:27.600
it was like nothing nothing i don't

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.760
think ever got fully destroyed but there

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.200
was definitely like

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.680
let's find something that you care about

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.959
you walked in and she hit a hammer next

00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:36.240
to your toe

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.800
yeah next to the eye yeah oh yeah that

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.279
would be

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:42.399
that would be devastating yeah you're

00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:44.800
slapping oculus on they're just like

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.399
yeah if you leave a real if you leave

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:48.640
their dimension well it changes the

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.920
negotiation because then

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.360
you're not talking about the fight now

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.040
you're now i got it it's a hostage

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:53.920
situation

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.760
true and you got to be like okay now

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.440

they were

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:30.079
you did say nothing was fully broken so

00:12:30.079 --> 00:12:31.680
that means something was actually

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.279
i think he backpedaled pretty hard on

00:12:33.279 --> 00:12:35.680

don't immediately go to that right away

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.519

story

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.960

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.240
how this one she [ __ ] sent him a

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.039
bunch of paragraphs

00:24:13.039 --> 00:24:15.279
oh [ __ ] yeah and i said because i would

00:24:15.279 --> 00:24:17.360
always text her good morning

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.200

00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:33.840
in response

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.400
so she woke up hot and was like i'm

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.679
gonna fire these ten at him

00:24:47.679 --> 00:24:49.679

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.400
was like

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.000
that was meant for someone else you

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.440
[ __ ] yeah yeah that was my favorite

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.400
part i was walking through

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.000
right when that happened true to explain

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
like no actually was just having a jab

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:02.559
at you

00:25:02.559 --> 00:25:04.480
yeah but it's also like you know that's

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.080
just another way of getting me into a

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:06.720
fight yeah

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.480
true it's a strategy it's always a

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.880
strategy to draw you deeper into a

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.240
i think there's like an emotional thing

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.919
where there's like some people like that

00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:15.679
like build up release build up release

00:25:15.679 --> 00:25:17.200
and like when you start to like log jam

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.159
that with just being

00:25:18.159 --> 00:25:21.039
super chill yeah well a lot that's you

00:25:21.039 --> 00:25:21.840

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.400
want it like you know some people that's

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.200
how they

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.720
that's the only way they can say some

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.159
people were just talking about it yeah

00:25:28.159 --> 00:25:29.120

well that's you know i don't know yeah

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.720
in general

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.159
because a lot of times you know they're

00:25:34.159 --> 00:25:35.600
they're aware of it but it's hard to

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.080
control

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.520
you know i have the same [ __ ] where it's

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.039
powder

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:25.440
whoa boy that scares me you ever snored

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.240
it

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.600
no no no no can you snort it probably

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.760
i have no idea i don't think so no you'd

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.440
have to i think if you want to ingest

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:33.760
the

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.919
what i don't know because i think if you

00:26:35.919 --> 00:26:37.520
eat it you have to combine it with an

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.799
maoi

00:26:38.799 --> 00:26:40.559
a monoxidase inhibitor or whatever

00:26:40.559 --> 00:26:42.080
otherwise you'll just digest it when

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.080
they make ayahuasca the one root is the

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.400
synthesized dmt with the other one is

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.679
this mai

00:26:47.679 --> 00:26:49.120
somehow they found this weird compound

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.039
we read this exact wikipedia on the way

00:26:51.039 --> 00:26:52.720
out really yeah yeah cause i was telling

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.760
him that molly came from beehives

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.440
yeah he was asking for molly no it's not

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.440
true but i wanted to damn

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.039
it's like not i want him to keep that

00:27:01.039 --> 00:27:03.919
piece of information so that one day

00:27:03.919 --> 00:27:05.200
he'd be like i think it comes from

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.440
beehives it like it comes from like i

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.200
think essential oils or some [ __ ] it's

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:09.919
like it's like

00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:13.440
it comes out of like a relatively common

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.600
thing they just they just you know they

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.279
use that to synthesize a bunch there's a

00:27:17.279 --> 00:27:18.559
bunch of stuff it's honestly

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:20.320
the wikipedia art article itself was

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.679
words like that

00:27:21.679 --> 00:27:23.600
unreadable yeah yeah the first one you

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.520
said mono oxidase inhibitors

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.919
yeah the whole article was that it was

00:27:27.919 --> 00:27:28.960
frustrating

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.399
they're just like they were like a first

00:27:30.399 --> 00:27:32.240
generation of antidepressants

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.640
which was this molly was like guy was

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.440
trying to invent

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.960
something that stopped bleeding during

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.480
surgeries yeah he ended up just

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.320
inventing molly yeah

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.440
that's awesome and then i don't think

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.200
they even knew that it had like any

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.720
psychoactive properties until like

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.679
another 30 or

00:27:45.679 --> 00:27:47.600
the military got after the military was

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.200
like put this in an animal and see what

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:49.600
happens

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.960
yeah nice yeah lsd was similar some guy

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.640
was just like studying [ __ ] like er

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.760
got

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.360
old or some [ __ ] and he was just kind of

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.760
like got it i think he got it on there

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.080
just

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.960
on accident was just like

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.640
bees so how's the dmt treating you

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.120
i haven't had it in ever uh probably

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.240
about a year

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.760
i had how long you can clean off dmt

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.600
that long i've only smoked dmt like

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:14.640
three times

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.919
like two maybe three times i think

00:28:17.919 --> 00:28:20.640
yeah it was like two or three times um

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.399
yeah it sat at the house forever

00:28:22.399 --> 00:28:25.440
yeah it was just like a pile of dna yeah

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.679
you know ski hooked me up yeah that's

00:28:27.679 --> 00:28:29.120
why it was this is where it was from

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.960
from this man he came over the one that

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.080

i didn't know anything about it at all

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.159
so you just smoked it

00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:08.240

it's like nitrous it's just longer

00:29:34.159 --> 00:29:36.000
nitrous trip for me that's how it hit me

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.159
like you're just [ __ ] up it is fun but

00:29:38.159 --> 00:29:39.520
then like seven minutes later you're

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:39.840
like

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.000
okay now i just kind of have a headache

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.360

00:29:53.039 --> 00:29:54.240
that's how it kind of was

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:58.559
and it was just crazy dude's like

00:29:58.559 --> 00:30:00.240

yeah dude nitrous is pretty nuts it's

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.360
not like a humongous deal but it's like

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.000
yeah

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.440

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.000
things and you just go

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.360
where you get those big concert balloons

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.200

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.360
brain goes

you do custom work on like race cars and

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.720

we'd bring the parties and sell and we

00:31:09.919 --> 00:31:11.440
would make our money back within

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.960
10 minutes and have [ __ ]

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.600
three-quarters of a tank to ourselves

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.120
that's all you need what else you need

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.519
exactly three quarters

00:31:19.519 --> 00:31:21.440
dude i feel like nitrous is a philly

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.880
heavy thing it is

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.880
yeah because i i never i never even

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.240

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.240
yeah i remember one kid had a party in

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.279
high school and i was like scared of it

00:31:31.279 --> 00:31:33.039
or like a tank maybe it was just whip it

00:31:33.039 --> 00:31:34.480

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.760
that stuff

it's you're not missing much dude yeah

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.880
you feel like a [ __ ] ass i would well

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.480
like something you see at a concert when

houses like 27 and see them

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.720

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.240
first

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.720
time i hit the pipe it was like eating

00:48:40.079 --> 00:48:41.920

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.400
nasty stuff dude that was when people

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.599
were getting [ __ ] up from the weed

00:49:55.599 --> 00:49:57.359
vape pens because they were uh

00:49:57.359 --> 00:49:59.599
they were liquefying it was it's like

00:49:59.599 --> 00:50:01.520
you know you have hash oil which is like

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.040
you know like a waxy kind of substance

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.800
and then you would take like

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.640
coconut oil like dissolve it people are

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.319
just smoking

00:50:08.319 --> 00:50:10.400

00:50:13.599 --> 00:50:15.359
oldest you think you'll be

00:50:15.359 --> 00:50:18.400

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.640

00:50:34.079 --> 00:50:36.480
do that i don't know never yeah i think

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:37.839
i think it rules i think it's like

00:50:37.839 --> 00:50:38.160
you're

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.680
when you're like your 30s and 40s it's

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.520
like taking psychedelics when you're

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.040

they've done studies with cancer

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.319
patients it's actually alleviated

00:50:52.319 --> 00:50:53.440
depression in people with terminal

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:55.119
diabetes yeah yeah across the board but

00:50:55.119 --> 00:50:56.079
if you catch a bad one

00:50:56.079 --> 00:50:57.599
that's what i mean that's what i mean if

00:50:57.599 --> 00:50:59.520
you're sitting in your house

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.520
i mean this guy's taking looks the wrong

00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.280
way about not having a family

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.200
tossing some psychedelics in his old

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:09.040
empty apartment when he's 53. yeah

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:11.119
like i've let go of a lot of stuff in my

00:51:11.119 --> 00:51:12.800
30s where i'm like this is what it is

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.000

i have room to move here but there's

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.480
some fixed things that i've been like

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:21.040
yeah just me dude by the time you're 50

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.480

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.079
with your situation if you haven't

00:51:24.079 --> 00:51:25.520
a couple grams of mushrooms or at least

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:26.640
your problems that point it's not the

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.599
mushrooms it's you

00:51:27.599 --> 00:51:29.680

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:30.640
is you it's true

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:32.480
it's always you yeah which is a hard

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:33.920
pill as well yeah

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.599
hard pill to swallow yeah exactly i

00:51:35.599 --> 00:51:38.319

where i'm at

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.359
i think i'm saying there is definitely a

00:51:45.359 --> 00:51:47.200
good chance like if you're about to die

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.400

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.480
mushrooms that's gonna be like like you

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:52.079
can probably like visualize actually

00:51:52.079 --> 00:51:52.559
dying

00:51:52.559 --> 00:51:53.839
yeah but it might be a tough one of

00:51:53.839 --> 00:51:56.240
course it might be true but

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.000
the studies they've done have shown

00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.680
again you know they're not the hugest

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:00.800
sample sizes

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.319
very positive outcomes are they have

00:52:02.319 --> 00:52:03.440
life terminal pages but i feel like

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:04.720
those are people who probably haven't

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.559
taken mushrooms their whole life

00:52:06.559 --> 00:52:08.079
right yes i think they try to design the

00:52:08.079 --> 00:52:09.200
studies so they because they don't want

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:10.559
to have bias people who are like i love

00:52:10.559 --> 00:52:11.839
mushrooms they want to have like i think

00:52:11.839 --> 00:52:13.440
if you had never done mushrooms and you

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.440
took them at 50 or 60 you'd be like this

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.960
is great that's what i think they've

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.319
done the studies on yeah and especially

00:52:18.319 --> 00:52:18.640
too

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:20.400
there's a difference between taking like

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.839
two grams versus like

00:52:21.839 --> 00:52:24.720
five six seven oh yeah blindfold blast

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:24.960
off

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:26.800
what's the blindfold mean just means

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:27.839
you're not like you know if you take

00:52:27.839 --> 00:52:29.200
mushrooms you're just like whoa like the

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.079
walls look weird

00:52:30.079 --> 00:52:31.359
oh you mean you're literally wearing a

00:52:31.359 --> 00:52:33.119
blindfold yeah your eyes are closed for

00:52:33.119 --> 00:52:34.559
like four hours and you're going you're

00:52:34.559 --> 00:52:35.359
just completely

00:52:35.359 --> 00:52:37.680
it's internal so you're just like you

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:38.800
know just

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.640
seeing [ __ ] in your imagination and your

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:42.000
brain's just like yeah yeah

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.240
i kind of accidentally did that was in

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:45.359
that pitch black hotel

00:52:45.359 --> 00:52:48.480
yeah yeah sometimes dude it was fun it's

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.480
tight it was scary

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.079
it was very scary i did wake up

00:52:52.079 --> 00:52:53.520
different yeah dude

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:54.960
you probably increased your openness by

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:56.960
like four or five percent house

00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:59.119
yeah dude come on forward let's go baby

00:52:59.119 --> 00:53:00.559
i did psychedelics

00:53:00.559 --> 00:53:02.480
i'm woke that's all you got to do him

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.599
once and you're just

00:53:03.599 --> 00:53:05.200
your opinions are just incontestable for

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.880
the rest of your life that's why i love

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.000
drugs

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.559
i love taking drugs and being like i

00:53:10.559 --> 00:53:12.480
know so much now

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.480
and everyone's like what it's like i saw

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:16.079
things solid dude

00:53:16.079 --> 00:53:18.319
third eye is open yeah i'm excited it's

00:53:18.319 --> 00:53:20.160
gonna be a wacky month

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:21.760
when are you doing the dmt stuff

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.520
hopefully in the next couple weeks

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:26.000
and how are you doing it just there's a

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.599
volcano there's a type of not a volcano

00:53:27.599 --> 00:53:28.960
well maybe the volcano but there's also

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:30.240
a little thing like there's like it's

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.520
almost like a vaporizer

00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:33.119
that has a bubbler attachment that you

00:53:33.119 --> 00:53:34.559
can put like ice in there

00:53:34.559 --> 00:53:35.839
and it makes it so it doesn't taste so

00:53:35.839 --> 00:53:38.400
bad and it's like just cold the taste

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.559
the taste stays with you i remember that

00:53:40.559 --> 00:53:42.319
it does it's [ __ ] brutal

00:53:42.319 --> 00:53:43.680
when you smoke it just like putting on

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.000
top of wheat not like dmt right now

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.520

00:53:53.599 --> 00:53:56.480
like the dude from the royal tenon bombs

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:57.200
who

00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:00.960
own wilson remember oh now

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:02.720
he was doing it metallic taste what's

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:04.000
the taste was that what was masculine

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.280
yeah he's doing masculine

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:07.680
uh tastes like i'm excited i don't i

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.960
couldn't even describe it because i've

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:10.720
never tasted it it's not horrible but

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.240
it's just a taste it's

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:13.760
it's like a very distinct taste that

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:15.440
will you'll definitely

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:16.800
you know it stays with you for like a

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.559
day or two nothing nuts

00:54:18.559 --> 00:54:21.280
it's more the smell when you oh my god i

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:23.440
might hot rail it

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:26.559
yikes you know hot rails what is that no

00:54:26.559 --> 00:54:27.839
there's things that people do with meth

00:54:27.839 --> 00:54:29.359
where you smoke and snort it

00:54:29.359 --> 00:54:30.559
simultaneously

00:54:30.559 --> 00:54:31.920
it looks like a crazy like it looks like

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.359
a mickey mouse troll kind of thing where

00:54:33.359 --> 00:54:33.920
you like

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:36.319
you light it up and you go and snort the

00:54:36.319 --> 00:54:37.920
meth while you're inhaling the smoke

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:40.160
it's [ __ ] up whoa

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:42.799

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:46.559
the gta 5 yeah

00:54:46.559 --> 00:54:48.480

never need shrooms again

00:54:54.799 --> 00:54:56.400
i'm telling you it's true yeah you

00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.240
should definitely never do dmt

00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.880
yeah oh he'd be [ __ ] on a cliff

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.240
midsummer night dude

00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:04.720
immediately i've walked to the edge

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:06.319
before and i don't like what i've seen

00:55:06.319 --> 00:55:07.680
i've talked to people about it and

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:08.720
they've said it's like

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:11.280
one of the most it's like afterwards

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:12.640
it's very comfy you come back and you're

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:13.200
just like

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:15.520
[ __ ] yeah that was sweet yeah you just

00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:16.880
get catapulted out of your body into

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:17.839
another dimension

00:55:17.839 --> 00:55:19.440
yeah and then like things crash through

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.040
your body and like move around you and

00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:22.319
rearrange stuff and you come out being

00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:22.640
like

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.559
[ __ ] yeah dude it's awesome yeah yeah

00:55:24.559 --> 00:55:26.799
see i've like you just get high as hell

00:55:26.799 --> 00:55:28.240
you want to get high

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.680
dude it's a different dimension dude no

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:31.599
it's just getting it's just getting high

00:55:31.599 --> 00:55:33.599
that's cause you're a [ __ ] mechanical

00:55:33.599 --> 00:55:35.280
you know

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:38.160
i've kind of obliterated my senses on

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:39.839
mushrooms before and like

00:55:39.839 --> 00:55:41.440
trying to gather myself back together

00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:43.040
for like two hours is

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:46.839
a bummer yeah tough it's a bummer

00:55:46.839 --> 00:55:49.599
yeah oh mushrooms what

00:55:49.599 --> 00:55:51.920

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.240
like getting high

00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:55.599
i mean that's fine not getting high

00:55:55.599 --> 00:55:56.960
shane if that's what you like i'm not

00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:58.160
going to i think you should do what you

00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:58.480
want

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.319
yes i'm not going to judge your use of

00:56:00.319 --> 00:56:01.599
chemicals yeah

00:56:01.599 --> 00:56:03.359
i like getting high it's fun i like a

00:56:03.359 --> 00:56:05.040
gram or two grams of mushrooms

00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:07.119
feeling the vibes there's some nice

00:56:07.119 --> 00:56:08.400
visuals in the mix

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:11.920
yeah but know like what happened to my

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:12.640
memories

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:15.680
and where am i and yeah for sure

00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:18.319
what happened to that festival you just

00:56:18.319 --> 00:56:20.319
like things start just scrambling where

00:56:20.319 --> 00:56:21.040
you're just like

00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:22.079
i don't know i'm not talking about your

00:56:22.079 --> 00:56:23.359
experience what were you doing give me a

00:56:23.359 --> 00:56:25.200
story give me a funny story of you on

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.319
drugs

00:56:26.319 --> 00:56:27.920
we got to the festival and there was

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:29.520
like to open the festival there was like

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:30.240
a

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:33.839
uh a midnight show with this dude billy

00:56:33.839 --> 00:56:34.480
strings

00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:37.520
who just did rules yeah yeah yeah

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:40.160
and uh and he played for like four hours

00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:42.160
but the first thing we did was like

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:44.559
my my buddy's brother just gave me like

00:56:44.559 --> 00:56:46.559
a bunch of pills like mushroom like

00:56:46.559 --> 00:56:48.240
ground up pills

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:51.200
and i i just popped them all and i was

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.799
at the show just like

00:56:52.799 --> 00:56:54.640
having the best time but then just like

00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.799
i started not to know the difference

00:56:56.799 --> 00:56:58.480
between like

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.880
light and sound like the sensation was

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:02.160
like blending together

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:03.599
well it's really just like faster

00:57:03.599 --> 00:57:06.000
vibration but yeah whatever sure

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.040
yeah it's all that's literally the

00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:08.079
difference it's just the speed of the

00:57:08.079 --> 00:57:09.599
vibration but i think yeah

00:57:09.599 --> 00:57:11.839
once electromagnetic and the other ones

00:57:11.839 --> 00:57:13.440
sound light sound or just speed up the

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:14.240
vibration

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:17.839
same thing um you sure pretty positive

00:57:17.839 --> 00:57:21.040
um but anyway so then

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:24.000
yeah then i couldn't what do you say the

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.440
light the fat it vibrates faster and

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:26.960
creates heat and then like yeah

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:28.799
sound is just like a slower vibration

00:57:28.799 --> 00:57:30.640
than of what

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:32.880
i think sound is the air matter bro

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.240
matter

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:37.280
anyway uh yeah so then i was like trying

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.319
to stay in the show

00:57:38.319 --> 00:57:40.559
but like the i couldn't tell if i was

00:57:40.559 --> 00:57:41.599
still at the show

00:57:41.599 --> 00:57:43.680
you know what i mean like it was like i

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:46.000
don't i'm not being i can't recognize

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.680
anything anymore so then i would just

00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:48.720
have to like

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:51.280
like pull myself together find my way to

00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.559
the door

00:57:52.559 --> 00:57:55.599
get outside and like like i would take a

00:57:55.599 --> 00:57:56.000
walk

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.720
around i would i'd be furious at you

00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:00.079
you're the girl he's the [ __ ]

00:58:00.079 --> 00:58:02.240

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.359
sinister hippie dynamic out of it

01:00:19.359 --> 01:00:20.640

01:11:32.159 --> 01:11:33.199
drugs

01:11:33.199 --> 01:11:36.560
yeah you know yeah overall yeah less all

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:37.679
of it you don't need them

01:11:37.679 --> 01:11:40.400
yeah can dmt get that can probably get

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:42.239
cut with some pretty gnarly stuff right

01:11:42.239 --> 01:11:44.320
no i don't think so i mean there would

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:45.760
be really no incentive to do it because

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.480
it's not really

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.080
i mean you could cut anything you know

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.840
it's a chemical you could cut it yeah

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.360
but i don't think there's i don't know

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.719
if there's been any reports of like

01:11:52.719 --> 01:11:54.719
someone smoking dmt i mean like just

01:11:54.719 --> 01:11:56.800
like ripping speed yeah being up where

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.719
like fentanyls me

01:11:58.719 --> 01:12:00.400
yeah it could technically in theory like

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.239
where does it even [ __ ] come from

01:12:02.239 --> 01:12:04.719
so mexico buy a route no you just buy

01:12:04.719 --> 01:12:06.000
you can buy the route and make it

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:06.960
yourself

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:09.440
yeah you buy a root and you just [ __ ]

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.040
strip it with something like a solvent

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.159
and it strips it and the solvent

01:12:12.159 --> 01:12:13.120
evaporates and you're left with

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.239
crystalline

01:12:14.239 --> 01:12:15.520
it's actually fairly simple from what

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.440
i've heard get it get it going

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:19.040
how many plants do you think are roots

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:21.280
whatever that could have to make

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:23.120
that much that he left probably that's

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.400
what i was curious about

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.480
dude you buy a couple hundred bucks

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.719
worth of those roots you can produce

01:12:28.719 --> 01:12:30.640
supply bro yeah they said it's like

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.800
wikipedia article that like

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:36.000
the tiniest yield like we'll

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.920
give you just a [ __ ] ton of yeah you

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.360
need like 0.3

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.480
i don't even i mean i don't know what

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:41.760
the amount was they're just saying that

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.520
it's like you could just get a tiny bit

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:44.400
of

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.440
the like baseline chemical and you can

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:47.840
make

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:51.040
tons of dmt with it oh really yeah

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.360
fat yeah it was definitely not packing

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:54.800
right then it's pretty ubiquitous in

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:56.080
nature it's everywhere it's in grass and

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:56.960
[ __ ] so

01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:59.199
i was going like dq blizzard style dude

01:12:59.199 --> 01:13:00.239

out of it just try to stone her dad's

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:18.400
right afterwards

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:19.840
yeah i've heard i've been told that

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:21.040
we're going to be unsuccessful in this

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.480
but we're going to try oh dude

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.159
column told me such a funny [ __ ]

01:13:24.159 --> 01:13:25.679
story colin terrell yeah

01:13:25.679 --> 01:13:29.199
he took he he was taking dmt he was

01:13:29.199 --> 01:13:29.760
ripping it

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:31.760
awesome and he was like all right i'm

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.040
gonna because it was like trying to

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.560
remember a dream we always kind of

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:35.520
forget it

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.440
so he took it one time and i guess it

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.640
gave him

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.800
like the most intense sadness he's ever

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.800
had when he came out of it like he felt

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:44.480
like he had like lost a loved one

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:46.719
damn and just set up a video camera to

01:13:46.719 --> 01:13:48.480
try to report to it

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:50.719
stroking dmt coming out of it and just

01:13:50.719 --> 01:13:52.400
being like

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:55.520
it's like just sobbing for like 20

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:57.120
minutes into a camera

01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.520
yeah really yeah column [ __ ] the one

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:01.520
time i did i remember fighting that off

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.800
because you immediately go there like

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.560
[ __ ] this is gonna be bad and it's so

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.120
intense

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:07.199
i started immediately like no don't go

01:14:07.199 --> 01:14:08.560
there you [ __ ] yeah

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.080
and it's like and then you're like wait

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.679
a minute pump the brakes you know what

01:14:11.679 --> 01:14:12.960
you mean because it's constantly just

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:14.880
going down you're constantly just coming

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:15.840
off of it so it's like

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:18.320
oh but when it hits man see i found a

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:18.960
really good

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:21.600
song that i would just crank and it was

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:22.080
great

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.159
i had great what song was it it was

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:25.840
actually a uh

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:29.760
[ __ ] remix of the ignition breathe

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.480
i wish no breathe by pink floyd they put

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:34.239
like this hip-hop beat onto it and it

01:14:34.239 --> 01:14:36.800
just was perfect there's certain songs

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:38.719
here i put on something it was so stupid

01:14:38.719 --> 01:14:39.760
i was like no

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:42.000

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.679
on but no it was just like no it was

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:45.280
just a regular song but it just didn't

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.880
hit right you know what i mean and like

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.239
i felt myself

01:14:48.239 --> 01:14:50.800
and my mind going where i did not want

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:51.760
it to go

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.280
and then i put on that song again i was

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:56.239
like yes this is i love this stroke

01:14:56.239 --> 01:14:57.520
i want to go try out for the [ __ ]

01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:58.690
flyers

01:14:58.690 --> 01:15:00.480
[Laughter]

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:02.480
that's the best story ever man yeah just

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:04.239
being in the parking lot just slapping

01:15:04.239 --> 01:15:05.600
oh it was like seven in the morning it

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:08.320
wasn't even hockey

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:11.280
all night old [ __ ] weekend it was

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:14.000
like this was like two days in

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.239
wow yeah and i was down in my buddy's

01:15:16.239 --> 01:15:17.520
basement

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.920
and he was asleep he he hit the wall and

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:20.880
i was like [ __ ]

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:22.880
pulling yeah that's exactly dude i you

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.840
know

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.199
it's not for everybody some guys just

01:15:33.199 --> 01:15:35.040
don't one video was football too

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.560
but then i realized like i remember like

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.000
a couple days later those videos were

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.760
like still on my you know youtube search

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:40.880
and the one video was just like them

01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:41.679
being nice to

01:15:41.679 --> 01:15:43.040
kidding like some [ __ ] kid in the

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:44.400
park i was like i thought he made the

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:45.840
team

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:50.480
lied to him yes yeah so i did that

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:54.239
it was great i want to try dmt again

01:15:54.239 --> 01:15:56.400
though

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.000
no because i keep hearing about this

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.600
breakthrough and i can't call it that

01:15:59.600 --> 01:15:59.840
exactly

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.800
it's so [ __ ] gay

01:16:03.679 --> 01:16:05.440
open your third eye i was laughing

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.880
thinking about either you or con are

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.080
doing it and it's because you apparently

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:09.679
from what i've heard you're just like

01:16:09.679 --> 01:16:11.360
you're not there but you're you're like

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:12.640
your consciousness is flowing you can

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:14.480
like look this way like pov porn

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.080
yeah well there's more stuff that way

01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:17.280
but it's thinking either you guys being

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.440
like

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.600
i actually forget that's how long it's

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.280
been since uh since uh

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:30.159
we had that but i just ever since then

01:16:30.159 --> 01:16:31.440
when i heard like oh i thought that's

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:32.320
what you just did

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.679
and then lewis explained no you're

01:16:33.679 --> 01:16:35.280
supposed to [ __ ] smoke it to break

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.239
through and i was like

01:16:36.239 --> 01:16:38.719
first off gay second off i didn't do

01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:39.280
that

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:41.199
and he was like you would know and i was

01:16:41.199 --> 01:16:42.719
like all right cause i was pretty [ __ ]

01:16:42.719 --> 01:16:43.520
up i thought

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.960
that's all it did you know what i mean i

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:46.239
didn't know there was like another point

01:16:46.239 --> 01:16:47.760
to it well the weight the way my broskis

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:49.199
described it was basically you're

01:16:49.199 --> 01:16:50.239
sitting there

01:16:50.239 --> 01:16:51.360
and i don't know if you ever get sleep

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:53.520
paralysis but no

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:56.159
i'll never get it and it goes and you

01:16:56.159 --> 01:16:56.719
just go

01:16:56.719 --> 01:16:58.560
boom and you just yeah really you're

01:16:58.560 --> 01:16:59.760
like damn that's

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.120
out of your body and then into it

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.320
literally another dimension that's what

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:03.520
billy said yeah yeah

01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:05.520
and billy what do you is it just like

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:07.040
what do you see apparently

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.960
apparently it's it's indescribable it's

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:10.320
probably different for everyone too

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:10.719
right

01:17:10.719 --> 01:17:11.920
they they had a pretty similar

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:13.360
experience it's pretty indescribable but

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.560
it's pretty much like

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:15.920
shapes and colors that you can't put

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:17.840
into words and then like at one point

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:19.679
what they described is like it all

01:17:19.679 --> 01:17:21.120
just went like everything they were

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:22.880
seeing just came crashing down into them

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.480
and like went through them and then

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:25.760
next thing they're coming out of it and

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.760
they're like i just felt like so nice

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:28.800
yeah because you're gone then you come

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.960
back to your body and you're like oh

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:33.360
[ __ ] yeah dude yeah i forgot about this

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.040
yeah i wouldn't mind making another run

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:35.840
at it then

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:37.360
because i definitely need to get that

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.120
like i was [ __ ] up but i wasn't like

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:40.480
i was nervous about it i first saw him
