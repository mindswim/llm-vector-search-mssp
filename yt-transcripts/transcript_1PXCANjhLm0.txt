00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.280
down and my thumb just fully submerges

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.919
and [ __ ] just all the way down it's i'm

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:08.960
in a dark cause you want to turn on

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.960
light so i'm in a dark room and all i

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.960
can the only sense telling me my thumbs

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.520
and [ __ ] is my touch and i just go

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.840
you feel almost like the granules you

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.160
feel almost like on a grainy level yeah

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.479
just on my thumb and then it's like

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:25.199

00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:37.120
john velocity on that ball

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.240
that could have went over there it was

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.480
just a line drive the second but it was

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.519
don't get me wrong there were some

00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:43.360
cracks straight into the air the green

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.639
monster

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:45.759

00:15:45.759 --> 00:15:46.860
been made to scale the green

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.880

00:15:53.759 --> 00:15:56.000
hit to go away from the green yeah well

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.600

all the alphabet agencies are asking for

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.000
intelligence so him and his boys are

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.600
playing combat racquetball where it's

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.440
it's like as soon as the person hits the

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.279
ball becomes three people becomes two on

00:31:49.279 --> 00:31:51.039
one so like he hits the ball and the

00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:52.640
other two are trying to score on you and

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.399
then it just keeps going back and forth

00:31:54.399 --> 00:31:55.760
but then you were allowed to check

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.039
people into the boards these were like

00:31:57.039 --> 00:31:59.039
35 year old dudes playing racquetball

00:31:59.039 --> 00:32:01.120

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.520
from oh god what's it there was a

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.520
general who took it too far so this guy

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.320
claims remote viewing is legit but then

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.720
guys got two they got too far

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.240
this guy claims to have done live

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.680
demonstrations

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.160
for i forget how many people where he

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.400
found he helped garner information to

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.560
find missing children and he said he

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.000
found like it was in japan he said he

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:58.960
found

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.480
50 of the [ __ ] that must have blown

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.359
their minds bro

00:37:03.359 --> 00:37:04.320
crazy

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.960
but he says he goes at best he is

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.480
60 to 70

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.200
he can get good information on stuff

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.200
but the military was saying it's more of

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.240
like using those things to help people

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.320
problem-solve in an out-of-the-box way

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.839
so they were like you know can we just

00:37:19.839 --> 00:37:21.440
conjure up stuff about like what's this

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.119
where's this but he they said they had

00:37:23.119 --> 00:37:24.320
files where it'd be like they'd put a

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.240
manila envelope with a picture of a

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.359
building

00:37:27.359 --> 00:37:29.359
the guy's never seen and that was blind

00:37:29.359 --> 00:37:30.960
to the like the person doing the thing

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.320
yeah and they'd have to sit and sketch

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.599
things and afterwards they both opened

00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:35.200
it like what the [ __ ] but you know

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.560
obviously you know

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.119
you could be like squares i see a square

yeah like holy [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.359
so yeah it was but the military it was

00:37:43.359 --> 00:37:44.640

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.119
turned into a big argument thing below

00:51:43.119 --> 00:51:44.240
and i just deleted i was like i don't

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.680
want i don't like partisan art i don't

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.839
like quibbling i don't like that yeah

00:51:47.839 --> 00:51:49.040
but i had a funny joke i thought it was

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:51.839
a funny joke i was i i my direct quote

00:51:51.839 --> 00:51:52.960
was

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.720
uh what did i say

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.640
i was like i take solace in the fact

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:58.400
that all of the babies who are

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.559
neutralized through abortion won't have

00:52:00.559 --> 00:52:01.920
to live in a world where abortion is

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:04.400
slightly less accessible

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:06.160
well it was a fun joke that all the

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.760
unborn dead babies that were aborted

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:09.440
won't have to confront a a world where

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.520
like abortion oh yes yes yes i thought

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.599
it was a fun play on words it is fun but

00:52:13.599 --> 00:52:15.119
it seems actually more like a real

00:52:15.119 --> 00:52:19.040
actual point yeah which pretty good but

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:21.520
seems like a pretty serious tweet it was

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:22.640
i thought it was a fun i was like that's

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:24.079
a clever what i do on twitter right

00:52:24.079 --> 00:52:25.359
you're like

00:52:25.359 --> 00:52:28.480
i am smart as hell

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:29.920
this is what twitter is for me i go on

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.200
twitter and i go

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.720
why is everybody tweeting about the same

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.960
thing this is so stupid and i just go

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.119
here's my opinion i'm like

00:52:37.119 --> 00:52:38.960
yeah as if i'd ever weigh in on this

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.559
stupid nonsense and then my brain

00:52:40.559 --> 00:52:42.079
formulates something i'm like

00:52:42.079 --> 00:52:44.000
that might be the smartest thing ever

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.160
nobody's even said this nobody likes it

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.240
and i go god damn it no it's not i was

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.920
like this is going to really shake

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:52.400
things up and i send it and i go no no

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:54.319
it's just another yeah stupid tweet

00:52:54.319 --> 00:52:55.599
that's going down past people's

00:52:55.599 --> 00:52:58.240
timelines kavanaugh is fired up

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.240
cavs fired up i don't understand i don't

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.520
even know i thought i knew what roe v

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.040
wade is i don't even know so it means

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:04.800
like it's just a federal saying

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.200
abortions cool federal federally and now

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.880
every state

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:11.760
so the states could decide now

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:15.839
and abortion is we'd still federally

00:53:15.839 --> 00:53:18.720
it's time dude i have no idea it's time

00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:19.839
look i don't want to turn everything

00:53:19.839 --> 00:53:22.800
into a legalizing weed issue but

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.160
yeah i think if we can you know if

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.760
that's just a decision we're able to

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.520
just go hog wild and do whatever we want

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:28.559
right now

00:53:28.559 --> 00:53:30.240
dude if that's the decision that the

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.559
states can make i think

00:53:32.559 --> 00:53:34.079
pennsylvania can decide whether or not i

00:53:34.079 --> 00:53:35.680
can be kind of stoned every now and

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:37.599
again certainly

00:53:37.599 --> 00:53:39.440
fair enough that you'll hear that that's

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:40.960
you heard that first here dude guys

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:42.720
you're hearing all the best takes

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.400
well yeah dude that uh that's why you

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.000
listen i honestly that was one of those

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.520
things that was like

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:49.680
it's almost uncomfortable because you

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.280
see the dems winning and you're like

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:53.359
come on give the repubs one win they get

00:53:53.359 --> 00:53:55.760
a big win you go ho

00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.520
yeah it feels weird when the republicans

00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.040
win

00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.559
i don't think i like it as much as i

00:54:00.559 --> 00:54:01.760
thought i would

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.319
yeah i mean not it's it's just gay i

00:54:04.319 --> 00:54:06.319
don't feel like i don't like it well the

00:54:06.319 --> 00:54:08.800
whole issue yeah it's a deeply personal

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.319
issue well dude this is what makes me

00:54:10.319 --> 00:54:12.079
laugh every time everyone goes because

00:54:12.079 --> 00:54:13.200
you know it's the whole thing now is

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.960
like the state gets to decide rather

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.160
than the federal government and the

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:18.240
federal government was like no they bet

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.760
we should let states decide blah blah so

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:22.160
whatever but it's funny that

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.440
everyone always goes well you know who's

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:25.680
going to pay for this more the poor this

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.599
is going to affect the poor yeah sure

00:54:27.599 --> 00:54:29.839
yeah dumbass as does everything because

00:54:29.839 --> 00:54:32.559
that's what being poor is yeah so poor

00:54:32.559 --> 00:54:36.319
means giving our money to ukraine

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.319
you know locking everything down for

00:54:38.319 --> 00:54:40.240
covid dude you want to know who got

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:42.400
really [ __ ] by locking things down the

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.079
poor the poor they get that's what

00:54:44.079 --> 00:54:47.280
that's fundamentally what being poor is

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:48.720
stuff happens in the world and if you

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.640
have money you're like i'll hire this

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.319
i'll do this i'll have my house designed

00:54:52.319 --> 00:54:53.839
when you're poor you go

00:54:55.839 --> 00:54:57.839
good nappy that's what being boy every

00:54:57.839 --> 00:55:00.480
dude this is like top level rhetoric

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.400
rhetoric of like andrew yang came out

00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:03.920

yeah i desperately want to do that and

00:56:31.839 --> 00:56:33.920
i'm pissed off now because i'm poor this

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:36.079
is affecting me more because the state

00:56:36.079 --> 00:56:37.599
gets to decide

00:56:37.599 --> 00:56:40.000
what a stupid [ __ ] idea sorry and

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.839
yang i do like yang obviously i like

00:56:41.839 --> 00:56:43.200
where yang went i told you before when

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:45.440
yang you introduced yang i like yang you

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:47.440
were early on yeah i like the man the

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:50.799
yangatang dude yeah yeah

00:56:50.799 --> 00:56:53.599
the [ __ ] you know

00:56:53.599 --> 00:56:55.119
he's the man dude

00:56:55.119 --> 00:56:56.559
yeah a lot of people go again they're

00:56:56.559 --> 00:56:58.640
like dude [ __ ] yang dude he's [ __ ]

00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:59.920
he's

00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:01.520
i don't know i don't know [ __ ] i don't

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:03.040
know anything about this stuff i will

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.400
say he seems to be the only one that's

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.920
at least trying

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.920
to be like what's the issue how can we

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:09.599
talk about it he seems like the few

00:57:09.599 --> 00:57:11.040
people who is

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.640
genuine and we'll see i've got fooled

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.160
before so i think a lot of these

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:15.280
politicians are going to come out i'm

00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:16.880
not putting smile on yang's name but

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:18.319
there's a lot of younger people right

00:57:18.319 --> 00:57:20.240
now who want to see decentralization

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.520
which by the way is you know what's

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:22.960
happening but they want to see

00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:25.839
decentralization and i think yang points

00:57:25.839 --> 00:57:26.640
to

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.240
decentral a possibility of

00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:30.400
decentralization yeah

00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.000
so we found this out i don't know i

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.520
think i've said this before about

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.839
abortion [ __ ] me yank don't [ __ ] me

00:57:35.839 --> 00:57:36.799
uh

00:57:36.799 --> 00:57:38.559
mississippi is more liberal than [ __ ]

00:57:38.559 --> 00:57:40.960
france when it comes to i heard that

00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:42.240
it's like bro

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:44.880
real texas is like six or eight weeks

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:45.920
which is

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:47.760
that's a heartbeat six that's why that's

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:50.000
the name of the act heartbeat and a tail

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.319
but it does have a tail still has a tail

00:57:52.319 --> 00:57:55.040
tail you can kill things with tails

00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:56.640
okay fair enough obviously that's a good

00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.079
argument and this is this is where i

00:57:58.079 --> 00:57:59.839
come from if i was in texas to say that

00:57:59.839 --> 00:58:02.960
thing still got a tail it's a uh yes i

00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:04.880
believe it does senator yes it does

00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:06.480
still have a tail

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:07.920
say well then you can kill it am i right

00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.240
y'all they tell you

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:11.760
how big is this tail

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.359
how big are we talking

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.559
i'm you know

01:01:32.559 --> 01:01:35.760
it is a shame because it's like

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.839
i don't want to make people feel bad who

01:01:37.839 --> 01:01:39.760
had there's no bone in my body that

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.520
wants to shame a person who has had an

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.440
abortion i get it

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.960
maybe you had a girl approach me saying

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.640
she needed an abortion asked me for 600

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.920
bucks i hope to god she was just getting

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.720
600 bucks out yeah long time ago so i

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.559
get i get the pressure associated with

01:01:52.559 --> 01:01:54.480
it no judgment at all

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:56.160
i also understand that there's people

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:59.200
who are like there's a human a humanoid

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.520
creature with a heartbeat at six weeks

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.680
maybe we shouldn't kill it

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.160
i get that dude yeah no shame on either

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:08.000
side but it's like dude you have people

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.440
approaching that as if it's life or

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.119
death and then you have people and then

01:02:11.119 --> 01:02:13.599
but this is this is my most the sinister

01:02:13.599 --> 01:02:15.280
part of my mind is like

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:17.680
how much of this is not even about life

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.680
it's about political people winning out

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.039
against each other and i just go that's

01:02:21.039 --> 01:02:22.799
all it is jesus man it's like it's

01:02:22.799 --> 01:02:23.760
that's right that was the same i'm

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:24.799
getting the sick feeling i'm talking

01:02:24.799 --> 01:02:26.160
about the people protesting in the

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.079
street or the people online the facebook

01:02:28.079 --> 01:02:30.400
dad saying shut up [ __ ]

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.079

01:02:32.079 --> 01:02:34.079
politicians knocking [ __ ] hats off of

01:02:34.079 --> 01:02:35.520
ladies and gents

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.480

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.319
man i think about it i just go

01:02:40.319 --> 01:02:41.599
because then it's like

01:02:41.599 --> 01:02:43.680
this again this isn't the trash people i

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:45.119
start to think like

01:02:45.119 --> 01:02:47.119

01:02:47.119 --> 01:02:48.720

01:02:50.319 --> 01:02:52.160
the my career thing yeah

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.359
yeah there's a lot of that there's also

01:02:53.359 --> 01:02:54.400
a lot of

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.839
let's say

01:02:55.839 --> 01:02:57.920

that dude there's there's dudes who will

01:04:58.319 --> 01:04:59.440
just be like

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:00.799
the way out of it you go like this you

01:05:00.799 --> 01:05:02.799
knock a lady up and then you go

01:05:02.799 --> 01:05:04.640

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.400
i just our relationship's not working

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:07.680
and then you just that's the first line

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.599
of distance and then you go like you're

01:05:09.599 --> 01:05:10.559
really stressing me about this whole

01:05:10.559 --> 01:05:12.000
thing how about i just do weekends and

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:12.880

i'm going to support money when i can

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.280
you know that's that's a hell that's a

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.480
bad hell a lot of people haven't

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.559
experienced it i think here's how i feel

01:05:20.559 --> 01:05:22.720
about the whole thing but

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.960
i think there's a lot of people

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.880
going with it because me included i

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:28.960
would i can't sit around and be like you

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:31.119
better not get an abortion yeah it's

01:05:31.119 --> 01:05:33.200
like i might have to pull that trigger

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.280
if it if it came my way

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.640
you know what i mean you think you pull

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.640
the trade there certainly were times in

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.319
my life i would i don't know about right

01:05:40.319 --> 01:05:42.000
now that's true but there certainly was

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
if i was younger i'd be like

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.240
i'm living on [ __ ] cans of beans

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.160
right now for sure i don't look i'm

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.079
trying to do open mics i don't have to

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:51.920
move home to mommy and daddy to raise a

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:55.440
kid yeah um so yeah for sure who am i to

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.359
judge bro i no no no it's not that i

01:05:57.359 --> 01:05:58.799
know of course we're not judging anybody

01:05:58.799 --> 01:06:00.240
getting this i'm not i'm not putting

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.440
this on you either i'm saying this is

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.359
personally how i feel for sure for sure

01:06:03.359 --> 01:06:04.799
that's the [ __ ] that's what bothers me a

01:06:04.799 --> 01:06:06.319
lot is i think there's a lot a lot of

01:06:06.319 --> 01:06:07.839
these politicians coming out there being

01:06:07.839 --> 01:06:10.240
like well that's a human life you're

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.240
ruining it's like hey

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:13.599
you dumbass

01:06:13.599 --> 01:06:15.440
what would you do would you would you

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.039
get an abortion so you could become a

01:06:17.039 --> 01:06:18.799
south carolina senator

01:06:18.799 --> 01:06:20.880
i bet you would yeah but you've done a

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.640
lot worse to get where you are yeah

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.640
that's true that's very true and that's

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.640
my opinion that's the problem that this

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:27.760
is what this is where i like to give

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:30.240
opinions on record recorded into a

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.520
microphone i like doing that you should

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.440
do that yeah i mean the problem is we

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.359
should be continuously feeding thoughts

01:06:35.359 --> 01:06:36.880
into a thing that's like

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.400
okay that's cool that's but people will

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.000
see that and go yeah i'm gonna use that

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.839
to destroy you yeah i also changed my

01:06:41.839 --> 01:06:44.079
mind every [ __ ] two hours

01:06:44.079 --> 01:06:44.799
well

01:06:44.799 --> 01:06:47.200
yeah but the problem this is the thing i

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.520
again i could just be a [ __ ] dumbass

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:51.920
but it's like

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.520
it just sucks

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:54.880
that

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.880
like it is a human life

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:57.680
but

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.599
it's also like this is what i and again

01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:01.280
it's not the abortion thing it's like if

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:02.880
you want even outside of abortion like

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:03.920
if you want to have a kid you have to

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.839
have a job if you need to if you have to

01:07:05.839 --> 01:07:07.039
have a job you have to send your kid to

01:07:07.039 --> 01:07:08.160
a daycare

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:09.599
so you know

01:07:09.599 --> 01:07:11.039
