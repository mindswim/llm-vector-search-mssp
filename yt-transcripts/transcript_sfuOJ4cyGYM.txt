through facebook twitter instagram and

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.840
the main board over and over again in an

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.800

and what the [ __ ] happened because

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:55.279
that's a [ __ ] mayhem to think about

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:57.519
you can't have them together

00:08:57.519 --> 00:08:59.680
yeah it dude it would be instant dude

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.440
peeks over the stall as soon as a girl

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.040

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.440
like whoop right over yeah or just like

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.040
constant [ __ ] like little footsie

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.800
moves like that you couldn't do it no

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.080
cause i watched the peterson vice

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.519

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:13.760
no you didn't watch that no

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.360
so they they like did like a long

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.880
interview with peterson put out nine

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.800
minutes of it but they edited at the one

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.000
point

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.279
where they were like

00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:22.560
something about men and women working

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.080
together peterson was like well do you

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.920
think men and women can work together

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.519
the guy was like what do you mean yeah i

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:28.720
work with women he's like we've only

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.160
worked together for 40 years like do you

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.279
think we can actually work together

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:33.120
without sexually harassing each other

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.399
the guy was like

00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:36.160
of course we can i started thinking

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.279
about that like dude we really only i've

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:39.279
only worked together for 40 years dude

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:41.120
without [ __ ] sexually that's the

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.399
question do you think they can actually

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:44.000
work together without sexual harassment

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.519
i mean every single dude that you ask

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:46.959
that too is gonna be like i mean i work

00:09:46.959 --> 00:09:48.560
with women and i don't sexually assault

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.399
them it just harasses me it's basically

00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:52.000
the same thing sexual yeah you know what

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.360
i mean yes every single guy's gonna be

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.959
like i don't it's kind of like saying

exactly you probably i mean at least

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.360
maybe she was like doing laundry once it

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.560

no i didn't see jp on that yeah

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.399
what do you think of that you think he's

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:37.519
got a point you don't think men and

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:39.040
women could it's a good fight i mean it

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.920
was a an honest question the guy he was

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.279
like oh of course

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:46.560
i hate that it's like interviews

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.399
his whole thing was like

00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:49.440
and there's really i'm gonna see the

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.720
whole thing but it's only a nine minute

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.800
clip they put out but he was like right

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.240
now and he's like i'm only saying this

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.240
because right now apparently

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.920
[ __ ] what company is it

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.320
i don't it was a big company just just

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.160
say like

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.839
general motors or whatever or some

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:05.519
company like that it's like instituting

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:08.880
a no hug policy or no nbc within the the

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.560
company exactly within the company of

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.640
nbc they they're putting in a no hugging

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.680
policy

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.440
all right so peterson was like what

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.279
about you know what about a no makeup

00:11:17.279 --> 00:11:19.519
policy and the guy was like what are you

00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:20.640
talking about he's like the whole point

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.560
of makeup is they suggest sexual arousal

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.480
yeah of course red lips blush cheeks

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.760
yeah i don't like when my girlfriend's

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.120

00:38:09.599 --> 00:38:10.800
if you're in the if you're if you've

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.640

your [ __ ] getting your [ __ ]

00:38:13.839 --> 00:38:15.520
watching you getting penetrated by a

you're right there you're not yeah

00:38:19.119 --> 00:38:20.720

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.480
jobs and blow jobs same fight that's

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.680

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.839
there so you think in your head getting

00:38:25.839 --> 00:38:28.720

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.640
if a washcloth directly to the [ __ ]

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.079

bend bent over spreading your ass this

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.359

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.280
my first like sure it's just hygiene

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.880
because yeah there's better ways to go

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.800
about this than having someone else

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.560
clean your ass for you yes i don't think

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.359

00:38:53.359 --> 00:38:54.640
you're gonna walk through a car wash

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.960
dude just do it yourself

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.119

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.640
every shower i'll do it every shower

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.400
when do you do it though in the order of

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.760

00:45:46.319 --> 00:45:48.720
[ __ ] dirt who's come is it yeah the

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.400

though it's really funny to go from like

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.680

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.839
black people screaming oh you're talking

01:05:17.839 --> 01:05:19.119

01:05:19.119 --> 01:05:20.559
michael richards so he's up there

01:05:20.559 --> 01:05:22.559
screaming the n-word which is it it was

01:05:22.559 --> 01:05:24.720
so [ __ ] what's what's that show

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.720
people do for halloween where you

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:29.039
pretend to be another comedian oh that's

01:05:29.039 --> 01:05:30.960
hilarious yeah michael richards won't be

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.039
craver i yeah that would be hilarious in

01:05:33.039 --> 01:05:35.680
brooklyn oh my god i'd have to move i'd

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:36.880
have to

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:39.280
quit forever but that's dude you'd have

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.640
to just take a name yeah that's the

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.720
choppy sword michael richards that is

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.079
the old that's the suit but if you did

01:05:44.079 --> 01:05:45.200
that

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.640
what's that

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:48.799
trick trick or treat it's a play on

01:05:48.799 --> 01:05:50.799
trick or treat yeah yeah yeah hackaween

01:05:50.799 --> 01:05:51.599
or

01:05:51.599 --> 01:05:52.880
dude that would be like something like

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.400
some trick or treat or something i think

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.359
it has something to do with your chip

01:05:55.359 --> 01:05:56.400
but anyway if you didn't michael

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.799
richards goes on he's like we used to

01:05:58.799 --> 01:06:01.359
string you up from trees like [ __ ]

01:06:01.359 --> 01:06:04.079
damn crazy he it's crazy if you watch it

01:06:04.079 --> 01:06:04.960
again

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.039
it's [ __ ] nuts and then and then

01:06:07.039 --> 01:06:08.079
black people just said that's

01:06:08.079 --> 01:06:09.920
unnecessary well i mean they didn't say

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.200
it like that while they're walking out

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.280
like [ __ ] you you [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.119
that's not necessary you know that's

01:06:15.119 --> 01:06:17.680
good i agree it's unnecessary i'm making

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:19.119
fun of the fact that when they get in

01:06:19.119 --> 01:06:21.359
arguments like this they they repeat the

01:06:21.359 --> 01:06:23.520
same word over and over again yeah it's

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:26.000
a pretty consistent black trait yeah

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.240
that's just a that's a tough uh

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.240
that's a tough example

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.680
no i'm not criticized i know i don't

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:32.319
know

01:06:32.319 --> 01:06:34.319
it's just a funny any time it is an

01:06:34.319 --> 01:06:35.680
argument like this to go on the pull

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:37.680
stream while he's walking out

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:38.880
like while he's walking out of the club

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.640
he's screaming at the whole way out

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:42.799
that's our next day you had to say all

01:06:42.799 --> 01:06:44.000
right

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.319
he did it dude i agree he did it we're

01:06:46.319 --> 01:06:47.760
going in circles here i know it was just

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.280
so it's just the argument right now yeah

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:52.000
he didn't happen

01:06:53.039 --> 01:06:54.880
that's just so [ __ ] but uh so then

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.440
the very next video is jerry seinfeld's

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:58.880
on letterman

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.000
and they're like so your friends they

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.680
just replay they just replay the clip

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.359
and they didn't play the clip but he's

01:07:03.359 --> 01:07:06.799
like yeah uh michael called in he wants

01:07:06.799 --> 01:07:09.119
to he wants to apologize

01:07:09.119 --> 01:07:11.200
and they they show him he's sitting

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.960
there and he's like this has really got

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.480
me uh

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:16.000
really got me torn up and like the

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.520
audience starts laughing

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.559
because they didn't know how serious it

01:07:18.559 --> 01:07:19.599
was and they thought he was still

01:07:19.599 --> 01:07:21.520
kidding because this is like pretty much

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:24.240
pre-youtube pre-internet yeah not really

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.760
but it's not before every single person

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.119
has a smartphone and watching exactly

01:07:27.119 --> 01:07:29.599
yeah so the audience is laughing while

01:07:29.599 --> 01:07:31.200
he's trying to apologize for screaming

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.319
the n-word

01:07:32.319 --> 01:07:34.559
and then he's like this is not funny i

01:07:34.559 --> 01:07:36.240
would he's like i think i'm on the wrong

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:38.000
place if people are laughing

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.039
he's like there's something i need to

01:07:39.039 --> 01:07:40.799
work on obviously that's damaged deep

01:07:40.799 --> 01:07:42.799
down inside of me like he's like i'm

01:07:42.799 --> 01:07:44.559
really broken up about this the thing is

01:07:44.559 --> 01:07:46.240
i'm you're racist you were just taking

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.520

that's a good one to go back it's really

01:08:52.799 --> 01:08:54.239
cool that was i remember seeing that at

01:08:54.239 --> 01:08:55.759
the time being like whoa but then listen

01:08:55.759 --> 01:08:57.440
to that now it's just like at the time

01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:00.719
it was like whoa and now it's like whoa

01:09:00.719 --> 01:09:02.480
what the [ __ ] dude has he been in

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:04.560
anything lately i don't think no he did

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:07.359
like cars comedians getting coffee mel's

01:09:07.359 --> 01:09:09.120
is not even close to as bad as oh i know

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.920
that is anti-semitic oh no mel also

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.520
dropped them yeah people forget that was

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.679
a phone call

01:09:15.679 --> 01:09:17.759
that was a private phone call true

01:09:17.759 --> 01:09:19.120
that's a point i mean you've got a point

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:21.359
out there's a she leaked it [ __ ] that

01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:22.080
[ __ ]

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:23.600
yeah that i mean there is a difference

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.279
between that and proclaiming that once

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:26.880
as far as when it comes to white people

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.000
being mad at you because that's who

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.319
really matters in these situations

01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:31.600
that's the only person that matters is

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.480
these i mean that's like

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:37.199
to own that voicemail on like a flash

01:09:37.199 --> 01:09:39.040
drive that would be a full john wick

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.960
action movie with a briefcase i need

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.880
that briefcase now

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.480
yeah that's full [ __ ] like i might

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.319
actually get killed for this

01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:48.719
that's millions of dollars yeah dude

01:09:48.719 --> 01:09:50.319
you might kill someone for that if

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:51.520
someone gets a hold of me saying the

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.040
n-word i'm gonna kill them mel's back

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.480
you'd have to kill someone or you just

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.000
have to become mel gibson yeah yeah

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.600
we're just a [ __ ] champ you gotta put

01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:59.760
10 years in the penalty box dude

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.360
just go on vacation for two you to come

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.280
out and daddy's home part 10 you'll be

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:05.120
ready for it hell yeah like oh we got

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.040
the perfect guy for this remember that

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.880
[ __ ] idiot who said the n-word

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.080
he said

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:11.840
i think in that one he says he hopes she

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:14.480
gets raped by a pack yeah

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:17.120
n words hits the n words there yeah yeah

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:19.520
i remember that that's double doozy pack

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:22.400
of and rape oh it's triple dizzy yeah

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:25.280
pack of is what made me the most like

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:26.640
taken aback

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.880
yeah that's pretty tough pack of black

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:31.440
guys yeah just assume they [ __ ] just

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:33.440
ravenous dogs like they have like an

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.840
alpha beta set up they probably they

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.280
kind of do i mean that's essentially

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.679
what a gang is

01:10:39.679 --> 01:10:41.840
but there's better ways to say what he

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.600
was trying to get across well not all

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.280
black guys are in gang shane

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:46.800
uh every black guy i've ever met isn't

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:47.920
it i'm trying to get you back from

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.840
making me racist two episodes ago how

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.520
about you saying jungle fever that's not

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:52.719
racist that's very racist it's not

01:10:52.719 --> 01:10:54.320
racist you need to be it's part of

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:55.760
interracial culture stay out of my

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:56.960
culture

01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:58.480
we joke around a lot about this stuff

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.080
about [ __ ] like

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.320
who said we're edgy we're edgy yeah but

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:03.920
really when it comes to like you're in

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.600
an interracial relationship and you need

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:07.679
to understand that saying something like

pushed the doors of barnes and nobles

01:11:51.199 --> 01:11:53.040

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:56.320
assaulted a child before where

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:57.920

01:17:37.679 --> 01:17:39.120
million-dollar question no one can ask

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.199
and it's it is horrendous to think that

01:17:41.199 --> 01:17:43.199
if he had just fully gripped her up and

01:17:43.199 --> 01:17:44.800
all that's true and she just like

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:45.920
because the guy's absolutely like and

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:47.520
then i fell down and i threw up on

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:49.120
myself so did you guys say that that was

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:51.120
pretty [ __ ] crazy but dude he's i

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:53.280
mean maybe dude who knows she's he's a

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:54.400
big guy

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:55.760
he's grabbing you you're just like what

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.600
the [ __ ] going on then they're reading

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:00.000
your [ __ ] and then it's like

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.679
it's just a weird form of rape man when

01:18:01.679 --> 01:18:03.679
i hear rape i'm thinking like having i'm

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:05.440
thinking of prison well that's mountain

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:07.760
sex that's just that's just because you

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.960
are

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.960
uneducated and you're not trying to

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:13.199
educate yourself because you think that

01:18:13.199 --> 01:18:14.640
that's what rape is meant well i'm

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:15.920
trying to educate myself but i'm just

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:17.920
trying to think like try harder because

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:20.239
what you just said yeah

01:18:20.239 --> 01:18:22.640
it's disgusting it's yeah it's worse

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:24.480
than what you said about pit bulls i

01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:25.440

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:27.520

01:18:43.679 --> 01:18:45.600
he comes up to me now and nibbles my leg

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:46.960
that's funny get the [ __ ] off it's

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:49.120
annoying but my whole thing with that i

01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:51.520
i don't know i'm just saying i

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:54.400
it's a very odd scenario to be like

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.400
you knew this guy was kind of a creep or

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.640
whatever he took the meeting and the

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:00.560
same thing with it it's a similar theme

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:01.600
to where it's like well how am i ever

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.000
going to get ahead in this it's like

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.480
people can live i mean it's just like

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:08.480
you're talking like acting in hollywood

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:10.480
it's like it's a [ __ ] freakish

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:12.560
bizarro show what do you think of harvey

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:15.280
weinstein is like if he

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.760
was like kind of just like yeah it's i

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:19.520
thought i really liked her

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:21.600
like she let me eat her [ __ ] i thought

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.760
we were together well maybe he was like

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.040
yeah the date was going well i was

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.719
eating her [ __ ] and she threw up on me

01:19:26.719 --> 01:19:28.080
and then i didn't know what holy [ __ ]

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:29.840
she's sick and then you know 20 years

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:32.000
later it turns out i raped her dude

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.600
that's wild to think about it and think

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:35.199
of weinstein thinking he's like i'm a

01:19:35.199 --> 01:19:37.760
bit of a ladies man

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:39.440
2 000 people

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.360
that's the thing again you know me dude

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:42.640
that's the thing against him he has

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.560
millions of accusations so i mean he

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:46.080
definitely yeah my friend was saying

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:47.440
something interesting they're like dude

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:50.320
so harvey weinstein allegedly raped like

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:51.840
50 chicks

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.360
and it's coming out now after all these

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.199
points so he somehow suppressed all that

01:19:55.199 --> 01:19:57.440
information sure bill clinton had like

01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.600
three and that came up quick so it's

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:00.880
like how the [ __ ] did he suppress all

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:03.280
that information politics is different

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:06.320
for sure really yeah

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:08.159
but well here's enemies

01:20:08.159 --> 01:20:09.920
clinton has [ __ ] political enemies

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:11.600
somebody else you know wouldn't he i

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.120
maybe he settled out of court with him

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:15.120
also he settled though oh i know what

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:16.880
you're hitting that what i know what

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:18.719
you're hinting what am i hitting it

01:20:18.719 --> 01:20:20.000
you're talking about the protocols of

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.920
zion again no i'm [ __ ] not i'm trying

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:23.600
to get this into a jewish thing no i'm

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:25.440
not at all yeah i'm just saying he

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.040
suppressed this i'm not saying listen i

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:28.719
don't think that's my my question is is

01:20:28.719 --> 01:20:30.719
how he's part of the jewish hive dude

01:20:30.719 --> 01:20:32.560

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.239
message dude he's the jewish hive it

01:20:34.239 --> 01:20:35.600
could be i don't know

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:36.880

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:38.960
reading the bible dude and i was started

01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:40.239
reading it again today and it was just

01:20:40.239 --> 01:20:42.640
like your chosen people will dominate

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:44.159

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:57.040
higher iq's an average

01:20:58.480 --> 01:20:59.760
that doesn't mean but i read the bible

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:01.760

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.120
let harvey get away with a couple

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:15.520
50s too many 50s a little much i mean

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:17.040
that's a lot dude that's the thing when

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:18.560

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:20.640

case i'm gonna be like well

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:24.640
i don't know once you have 50 hazy cases

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:26.719
i'm like dude you're miscalculating

01:21:26.719 --> 01:21:28.719
something it's two two is the number

01:21:28.719 --> 01:21:30.800
it's like with [ __ ] big ben yeah with

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:33.040
roethlisberger first one two magic you

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.960
never know maybe someone's just got

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:36.560
drunk kobe could have gotten caught up

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:38.400
in this kobe

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.159
that was uh he was one though that was

01:21:40.159 --> 01:21:42.159
patrice o'neill's defense what he was

01:21:42.159 --> 01:21:43.360
like you don't rape a chick you need a

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:46.000
[ __ ] he's like sit down [ __ ]

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.199
do your little fingers and you're like

01:21:47.199 --> 01:21:48.640
yeah yeah yeah

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:50.560
but yeah man kobe could have got sweat

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:51.920
if everyone was like now he would have

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:53.520
been kobe would have been [ __ ] ob they

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.520
gave him due process and they were like

01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:57.199
out of it i think they gave her though

01:21:57.199 --> 01:21:58.480
the [ __ ] they're like she's got other

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.560
coming here he didn't rape her

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.560
yeah she got she was

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:04.800
also he just paid her

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:07.120
you got to pay at some point like yeah i

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.320
don't think that ever that never went to

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:11.679
trial or anything i think she

01:22:11.679 --> 01:22:13.679
found like other dudes coming here from

01:22:13.679 --> 01:22:16.159
like 48 hours before that's sick but

01:22:16.159 --> 01:22:17.440
yeah i don't think that's i guess you

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:18.560
can't get off on that but your honor

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.960
she's a [ __ ]

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:22.400
no you can't i remember hearing that

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.480
back then and being like well case

01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:26.000
closed innocent dude

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.600
but no there was something else to do we

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:30.560
should uh what get out of the rape

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:33.040
yeah this is getting like a weird turn

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:34.800
it's a weird term but if you blame the

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.480
jews for harvey weinstein i didn't blame

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:38.719
the [ __ ] juice that's i mean

01:22:38.719 --> 01:22:39.760
if you want to get any conspiracy

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:41.120
theories it's like you get all the

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:42.719
hollywood they're pushing the buttons on

01:22:42.719 --> 01:22:44.320
pedophiles now me too comes out of

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:45.600
nowhere that's what you want to get into

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:47.040
true that's

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:48.639
that is that's a weird conspiracy once

01:22:48.639 --> 01:22:51.040
the pedophilia stuff dude alex jones was

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:53.280
all over that he's like donald trump's

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.880
he's going to roll him up he's going to

01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:56.480
roll up all the pedophiles the

01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:58.880
psychedelic vampires in hollywood

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.560
yeah yeah and then uh it started to

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.080
happen and they were like no we've just

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:03.440
been raping women

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:06.239

eyes wide shuts all about

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:16.159
[ __ ] kids it's all about like

01:23:16.159 --> 01:23:17.760
sacrificing your child to like the

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.679
hollywood machine nice and that's what

01:23:19.679 --> 01:23:20.960
they they said the movie's all about

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:22.639
that who made that movie

01:23:22.639 --> 01:23:25.199

01:23:28.239 --> 01:23:29.440
edited

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:30.800
it wasn't weinstein

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.560
they said they made him edit out a lot

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:33.760
of it

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:35.440

01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:33.360

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.280

01:24:40.159 --> 01:24:41.840
talking he ate my [ __ ] and i blacked

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:43.679
out and it's like

01:24:43.679 --> 01:24:45.280
i but i again i'm not a girl i don't

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:46.880
have a [ __ ] i i don't i don't know what

01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:48.159
it's like

01:24:48.159 --> 01:24:49.840

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:51.600
that just came out of me i know i know

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:52.480
well

01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:54.000
well the problem is

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.320
you're not a girl and you do but the

01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:59.120
problem is you do understand

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:01.840
that men and women are not equal

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:02.560
no

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.400
so

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:06.000
right now we live in a society where

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.159
you've got to throw that out that piece

01:25:08.159 --> 01:25:09.760
of information where you know deep in

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:11.360
your heart and just logically that men

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:13.679
and women are not equal yeah

01:25:13.679 --> 01:25:15.440
so when it comes to a crime so if we've

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:17.120
eliminated that piece of information or

01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:18.400
cats and dogs

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.159
yeah if you eliminate that and now

01:25:20.159 --> 01:25:21.520
you're just looking at

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:23.360
person a and person b

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:24.400
person a

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:26.639
they're talking to person b then person

01:25:26.639 --> 01:25:29.679
a eats person b's [ __ ] person b blacks

01:25:29.679 --> 01:25:30.719
out

01:25:30.719 --> 01:25:32.560
it goes out of body whatever out of body

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.400
experience

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:36.480
doesn't resist or anything like that

01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:37.360
yeah

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.040
then they stop

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:41.040
it's like what was

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:42.400
well i mean and that's i think there's

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.480
no rape there but if you look at it like

01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:46.800
that's a big man if he did

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:48.320
a woman yeah you do know something you

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:50.400
can go i've like i've had a gun put to

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:52.159
my face before you do kind of go out of

01:25:52.159 --> 01:25:54.320
body to where you're just kind of like

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:56.719
calm and like watching stuff but like i

01:25:56.719 --> 01:25:58.080

01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.840
you know what i mean so like

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.360
that's where i just have to detach and

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:02.719
be like well hopefully everyone's

01:26:02.719 --> 01:26:04.719

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:26.000
