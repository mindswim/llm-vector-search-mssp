or anything funny no good comebacks just

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.800
for pure violence

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.240
they don't kick him out they just stand

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.840
around the table and eat his food and

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.440
who dad

revolutionary war soldiers dude yes and

00:08:31.599 --> 00:08:32.800
never stop you have to give them

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.800
quarters they will take quarters they

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.120
will sit down at your table and start

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.240
eating

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.839
that would be dude i'm telling you could

00:08:39.839 --> 00:08:41.839
do this and run a very tight ship yeah

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:43.360
and people they make yellow chill with

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.640
that like if they get caught with a

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.640
phone you [ __ ] step on it yeah i

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.800
wonder how much it would cost to

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.800
maybe rig up some type of pulley system

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.000
so if you did hit someone with a

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.040
hadouken they flew to the back of the

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.200
room you know or elevate levitated and

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.279
you force hold them

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:00.959
that's why i thought shut the [ __ ] dude

00:09:00.959 --> 00:09:03.440
that would be so sick

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.360
you should go to helium or wherever else

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.920
and come down like nine feet from the

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.040
ceiling on the cable

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.360
because you could rig yourself up like

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.120
if they start getting you mad you start

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.880
levitating

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.560
if you if you were all black and they

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.080
put you up in the ceiling and after the

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.920
feature like the host comes back out and

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.120
you can slowly descend from seven

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.880
you've been there the whole time you've

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.040
been

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.360
you could do this dude

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.600
how dedicated i would be i'd be so happy

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.560
what

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.240
would be so funny if they noticed me

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.480
during the video

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.040
during the feature set just on the roof

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.660
like a bat dude

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.160
[Laughter]

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.440
you'd have to trick out the lighting so

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.680
you can't

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:53.839
descend slowly

00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:54.880
yeah

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.760
true a true vampiric interest

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.440
[Laughter]

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.279
oh [ __ ] oh there's so much sick [ __ ] you

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:03.200
could do yeah if you got pulled out and

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.360
i was supposed to be levitating but i

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.519
was too heavy so my feet just dragged

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.320
you should be attached to pulley at all

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.240
times you have like your one leg lift

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.640
you should add like an aerial aspect to

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.399
your show yeah a little cirque du soleil

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:23.200
you could just occasionally like ride up

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.320
a curtain you could do this this

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.279
wouldn't be

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:27.040
dude you could do this you know be tight

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.320
is to run along the back wall at helium

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.880
crouching tiger out of nowhere

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.600
oh my god your tippy toes

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.120
dude that'd be so sick if you just

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.720
jumped and just [ __ ] levitated and

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.480
came down and never acknowledged it

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.320
just back to the show

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.680
i mean how much were you talking to get

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.399
a little crouching tiger action

00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:49.920
probably not that much because i was

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.120
like shut up dad you just [ __ ] ran

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.519

on your dad or get shot in the head

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.680
[Laughter]

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.880

you combine pulley and flute

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.240
you start playing and elevated

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.440
you can genuinely save yourself the

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.959
trouble of developing material with just

00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:49.120

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.160
i was like how'd he die and he was like

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.079
i don't know but it was sudden i was

00:12:20.079 --> 00:12:21.200
like

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.040
that sucks and he goes i pray it was

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.519
suicide now that was a typo he meant to

00:12:25.519 --> 00:12:28.639
say pray it wasn't [ __ ]

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:30.240
but then i was like i was thinking about

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.440
it and it's like

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.800
i hope it was

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.639
yeah you know what i mean one of the

00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:37.680
[ __ ] wasn't going well

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.959
yeah true i hope he [ __ ] had a bad

00:12:40.959 --> 00:12:44.079
time it was like i'm done

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.519
you're saying like rather than being hit

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:47.040
by a bus or something yeah i hope he

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.959
didn't have like a good family

00:12:48.959 --> 00:12:51.040

what do you mean you're saying like you

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.399

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:08.240
started to turn around and he died

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.200

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.200
died suddenly right

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.040
your instinct shouldn't be to be like oh

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.959
i hope he didn't kill himself i hope it

00:13:16.959 --> 00:13:18.880

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.639
a freak accident it's like no dude i

they're headless in hell you have to

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.360
chop their head off so they're in hell

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.600

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.079
kingdom of heaven

00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:15.920

what are you talking give me an act what

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.240

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.440
for you to

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.199
desecrate there but you know

00:14:35.199 --> 00:14:37.040
court like cut them up send them into

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.639
different parts of the world

00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:40.880
like wallace yeah

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.399

front of me and i killed them back i'd

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.240
probably keep killing them once they're

00:17:45.919 --> 00:17:48.000
together and got putin that's a big

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.280
that's come on

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.799

00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:52.000
economically you think we have like

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.760

kind of

00:18:13.039 --> 00:18:14.480
the backs you're basically indigenous

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.620
that's how it works

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.960
[Laughter]

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.280

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.880
of a pale face that got adopted by the

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.039
tribe true because i got backs but i

00:18:29.039 --> 00:18:30.799

returned from baseball

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.919

he's gonna come back dude dude he might

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.200
just be a permanent fixture

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.039
probably he might have to come back and

00:19:41.039 --> 00:19:43.280
order his son because he will no one's i

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.200

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.640
instagram chris what do you think the

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.480
demos have done with this country the

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.200
dems yeah what have they done how do you

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.600
think they've done handling this

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.919
you know i think that they did okay

00:19:57.919 --> 00:19:59.280
my girlfriend made pancakes i think they

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.120
did okay the other day yeah and i

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.360
cleaned it up so i have [ __ ]

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.880
pancake batter all over this it looks

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.799
like there's just jizz

00:20:06.799 --> 00:20:08.559
this is just a cheese hoodie all right

00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:11.120
what are the differences

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.480
right now we need to think about

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.000
pancakes it doesn't have a lot of

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.760
[ __ ] chips all over me when's the

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.400
last time you had pancakes

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.320
homemade from scratch i make himself

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.559
they made him long phenomenal too long

00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:24.640
would you biscuit no she made like she

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.039
got the [ __ ] to make them yeah eggs

00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:29.200
butter yeah oh how do you make i have no

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.280
idea i wasn't in there sugar i have no

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.799
idea what she did to make them what is

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:35.200
in bisquick probably i don't know

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.480
they're kind of all the [ __ ] they can

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.080
trigger it's all like you wouldn't make

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.679
it but they just make it from scratch

00:20:39.679 --> 00:20:41.600
kind of tastes slightly better than

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.320
bisquick but really oh yeah fluffier

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.080
yeah you actually have eggs

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.120

00:22:59.039 --> 00:23:00.880
they're like it's not a big deal but

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.320
also it could be

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.440

get boosted dude i just saw a commercial

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.480
they're running new york commercials if

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.320

worst thing i've ever seen in my life

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.240

clear out tmz yeah all right this is

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.760
bordering on uh what calling on

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.000
it's like i'm just with a woman i know

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.679
she's hot and then it just kind of

00:27:29.679 --> 00:27:31.360
morphs to like three different people

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.720
yeah

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.960
some of them are your dad sometimes it's

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.480
your buddy from high school giving you a

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.559
head

00:27:38.559 --> 00:27:40.559
and you're confused about this yeah your

00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:43.520
defenses completely go offline dude

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.039
it is an interesting power dynamic that

00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:46.559
he was sucking your dick and he was

00:27:46.559 --> 00:27:48.960
giving me

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.559
he's in my car now we were parked in the

00:27:54.559 --> 00:27:57.919
trinity high school parking lot

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:11.679
[Laughter]

00:28:11.679 --> 00:28:13.600
dreams are like prison dude it's not gay

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.279
it's not at all you do what you have to

00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:17.279
do in dreams you're trapped in there

00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:18.880
dude the ego goes completely offline

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.240
it's not your fault

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.640

00:28:33.679 --> 00:28:35.600
like ancient apparatuses to work out

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.279
complex things yes getting head off your

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:39.440
friend is just symbolic

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.880
it's a collective unconscious

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.480

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.000
of all the options

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.360

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.960
the gay stream i've ever had and i woke

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.760

i'm not a queer gardener what's the gay

00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:48.480
thing you've ever done in a dream

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.880

you just that's actually you probably

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.320
were achieving psychological wholeness

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.600
at that point maybe rebirth through

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.760
wholeness uh yeah i didn't feel anything

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.159

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.480
from somebody that throws it backwards

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.840

homosexual dream encounter is coming for

00:31:19.279 --> 00:31:21.440
all of us yeah i mean yeah that's what

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.679
the mayans talked about

00:31:23.679 --> 00:31:26.720
this is 2012.

00:31:26.799 --> 00:31:29.279
that's about when it happened when it is

00:31:29.279 --> 00:31:30.880
probably when the mayans predicted it

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.120
mine was slightly mine was deeper into

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:34.159
20

00:31:34.159 --> 00:31:36.080
20 like 16. might even right when barack

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.840
obama got elected i was like oh no

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.120
that's okay

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.360
you're thinking trump trump fired you up

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.279
2016 when trump came in oh is that why

00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:44.880
you moved out from living with us no i

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.159
would you had a gay dream and you're

00:31:46.159 --> 00:31:48.240
like i gotta get a wife

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.880
and i shrugged it off quickly

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.320
i did shrug it off but i remember this

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.679
is the first time i've ever told anybody

00:31:53.679 --> 00:31:54.720
about it

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.840
i think you told me i think i heard

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.279
about oh really i told you this all

00:31:57.279 --> 00:31:59.279
right good you can find it here

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:00.880
good i'm glad i let that secret out to

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.720
somebody yeah that thing was burning a

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:03.679
hole

00:32:03.679 --> 00:32:06.399
in my soul for years sigmund freud and

00:32:06.399 --> 00:32:08.159
his boys all accepted the fact they had

00:32:08.159 --> 00:32:10.159
unconscious homosexual urges and they

00:32:10.159 --> 00:32:11.440
would write each other letters being

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.519
like i don't know i think my unconscious

00:32:13.519 --> 00:32:14.960
homosexual urges have been like

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.399
affecting our relationship and they'd be

00:32:16.399 --> 00:32:18.080
like oh it's totally cool dude i think

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.159
i'm kind of gay for you unconscious

00:32:20.159 --> 00:32:21.279
everything i hear about like they're

00:32:21.279 --> 00:32:23.200
having a different experience i don't

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.960
like any everything i hear about sigmund

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.039
freud it bothers me yeah it's a lot of

00:32:27.039 --> 00:32:28.480
people every single time someone's like

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.559
yeah he also said you want to just eat

00:32:30.559 --> 00:32:32.080
your mom's [ __ ] it's like all right

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:32.880
dude

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.960
why don't you [ __ ] chill apparently

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.720
though he bit back a lot of his stuff

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.640
cause he had come to the conclusion that

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.600
women

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.960
were hysterical because they were

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.039
getting molested

00:32:43.039 --> 00:32:45.679
and it also happened i think his sister

00:32:45.679 --> 00:32:47.519
it's true it also ha it happened that

00:32:47.519 --> 00:32:49.200
his sister was hysterical and his dad

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.880
was a powerful man

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.320
and then he had to start then he started

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.279
being like

00:32:53.279 --> 00:32:54.240
that's when a lot of the weird

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.559
mythological stuff kind of popped up

00:32:56.559 --> 00:32:58.000
so apparently he put his finger on a

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.679
button he's like women were just bugging

00:32:59.679 --> 00:33:02.399
out yeah everyone was being [ __ ]

00:33:02.399 --> 00:33:04.640
bad dads dude all these step dads

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.559
everyone's being naughty real dads

00:33:06.559 --> 00:33:08.399
a lot of people and then all these women

00:33:08.399 --> 00:33:09.600
are freaking out i was like why are we

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.200
having this weird public health crisis

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.720
where women are just like spazzing and

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.640
being like i can't get up

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.000
and he talked to like thousands of them

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.440
they're like yeah i think that's just

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.279
more of the

00:33:19.279 --> 00:33:20.960
just women things well you think it's

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.440
[ __ ] i don't know that still happens

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.039
i mean yeah there's a lady will lay down

00:33:25.039 --> 00:33:27.200
be like i can't do anything they do

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.039
while out yeah i feel like it's

00:33:29.039 --> 00:33:31.600
affecting dogs they're adopting a lot of

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.600
dogs in cities

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.279
and i've run into the most amount of

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:37.360
nervous dogs

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.880
ever in my life i thought women should

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.039
not own dogs by themselves i'm fully

00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:42.480
with you on that yeah they don't walk

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.880
them know that some do some do yeah a

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.640
lot of women just

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.799
but they they transfer their fears yeah

00:33:48.799 --> 00:33:50.399
they talk to them

00:33:50.399 --> 00:33:52.640
yeah yeah the whole dog mom phenomenon

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.279
needs to stop immediately yeah

00:33:55.279 --> 00:33:56.880
dogs are for guys

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.200
man's best friend dude yes

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:02.880
women cats yes it's i mean come on but

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.159
yeah dude

00:34:04.159 --> 00:34:06.399
yeah women i've i've seen women can lock

00:34:06.399 --> 00:34:08.960
their dogs up for hours dude well i just

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.480
feel like they go out get drinks with

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.280
their girls like oh i forgot my dogs

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.040
i tied them to the radiators yeah dude

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.639
they'll cat they'll crate their dogs for

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:18.960
like a day i see i feel like just dogs

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.800
aren't city people

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.079
you know what i'm seeing dogs should not

00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:24.079
be in the city humans should barely be

00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:26.159
in this yeah true but i know but see

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:28.560
humans keep adopting dogs in the city

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.839
yeah it bothers me especially when they

00:34:29.839 --> 00:34:32.000
get big dogs yeah especially in new york

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.520
it's a bad this is not a dog this is the

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.599
least dog city yeah

00:34:35.599 --> 00:34:38.000
and it's just like these dogs are not

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.119
they're not getting what they want but

but the city stuff is dogs aren't

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.320

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.320

it's awesome

00:37:18.079 --> 00:37:19.599
the machine's like rotating it and

00:37:19.599 --> 00:37:21.520
cutting it itself big blades you know

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.040
they're huge blades there's certain

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.240
types of light you're not allowed to use

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.680
in a sawmill because it creates the

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.880
illusion that the

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.880
the blade's standing still

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.400
really

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.960
arc lighting i believe wow can't use arc

a smell in propane pretty much yeah you

00:37:41.599 --> 00:37:42.880

00:53:13.839 --> 00:53:15.359
there's a change good move

00:53:15.359 --> 00:53:17.680

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:20.800
yes it's the men's club

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.880

depiction of this what's it it's

00:54:04.559 --> 00:54:06.319
probably historically more accurate

00:54:06.319 --> 00:54:08.640
perhaps he punches genuinely went

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.160
through greater lengths than they

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.760
demonstrate in the bible to he was like

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.200

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:35.920
come for him if he didn't [ __ ]

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.160
exactly manage this situation exactly

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.240
yes yes he was in a real tight spot

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.599
didn't he get killed though didn't punch

00:54:41.599 --> 00:54:43.119
his pilot eventually didn't he get

00:54:43.119 --> 00:54:44.720
executed sure

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:45.839
i think he got executed i think they

00:54:45.839 --> 00:54:48.160
called him back and [ __ ]

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:51.200

himself i don't know yeah he hung

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:54.240
himself exactly do you think that's more

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:56.160
than [ __ ] you think he did it

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.280
maybe

00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.520
that's a good theory

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:00.960
he was framed

00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.799

telling them he's like i'm just sexually

00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:57.040
awakening you you got to start separate

00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:58.319
the yard from the artist and the only

00:59:58.319 --> 01:00:00.079
way to do that is to never look up the

01:00:00.079 --> 01:00:01.920
artist you can't do this [ __ ] this to

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.119
