00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.159
storm true yeah couples massages are

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.000

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.080
relaxation any time my loved one's in

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.239

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.560
big sneaker guys so

something soft to walk in the spine

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.720
i want to start getting sketchers i'm at

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.319
the point now i think it's time these

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.160
are close when in terms of the ultras

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.000
are close but sketchers everywhere every

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.880
distance people i

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.440
this is a sneaker you gotta run to a

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.840
well 30 miles away and you'll still be

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.440
your knees will be

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.680
perfect condition i mean the wheelies

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.680

about [ __ ] anymore

they'll start digging into what they

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.879

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:18.160
muscle yeah get off you just you've

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.240
never felt anything that's

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.000
i'll tell you it's probably a [ __ ]

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.160
knot dude i've been going to that pt the

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.240
last couple months it's the hardest pain

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.479
i've ever felt in my life yeah

00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:30.240
literally screaming he's destroying

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.640
actual muscle tissue no it's scar it's

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.279
muscle scarring it just builds up

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:37.120
out there cupping or something i have a

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.640
problem with my left shoulder

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.560
and i thought it was a rotator tear and

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.159
i went in there and he was telling me

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.399
this situation where like a lot of these

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:46.880
doctors that throw like a cortisone shot

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.240
into muscles

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.720
they're only temporarily uh fixing the

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.399
issue and the true issue is that there's

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:54.480
nodding around the tendons that go

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.240
around the rotator cuff underneath the

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.240
shoulder blade he said it do it's due to

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.760
either like a certain

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.600
uh sitting i think i got just like

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.240
leaning on the bar

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.620
that you come here often

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.560
[Laughter]

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.640
yeah and i do have a seat at a bar so

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.200
like i'm usually like in one position

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.399
but uh

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:16.640
it could be from anything but one one

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.640
ball builds up it's not getting blood

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.640
flow it restricts the blood flow and

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.920
then it feels like a nerves being

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.360
pinched yeah and then you also have the

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.080
bursa underneath that the ball joint

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.080
yeah so it's constant pain at a certain

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.800
angle this angle is fine this angle palm

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.800
up is fine but if i go here that's my

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.040
that's my limitation before extreme pain

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.880
dying i lay on this [ __ ] pad i think

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.880
you're gonna die i lay on this pad

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.760
and this dude calmly talks to me and i

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.640
know

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.959
you can hear in a voice when they're

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:46.720
about to inflict pain on you yeah

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.000
because they start asking about things

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.519
that i know they don't give a [ __ ] about

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:51.040
you know what i mean like housework yeah

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.040
yeah how's things been i don't know you

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.800
like that dude i know what you're about

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.200
to do and then he starts putting his

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.760
[ __ ] elbow in a spot and it is

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.000
dude

00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:05.519
i feel like i i feel like i could handle

00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:08.000
myself in a fight yeah you forget what

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.079
real pain is and then you go for 20

00:10:10.079 --> 00:10:11.360
years without getting punched in the

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.519
face and you're like yeah you look at

00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:15.440
situations like i got this

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.760
until something simple like this happens

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.640
and your your level of pain

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.600
is just so beyond what your reality is

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.000
where i was screaming oh literally

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.680
screaming and i have to like i'd slide

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.760
off of his elbow and i'm like dude you

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.360
got to give me a break i'm like i'm

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.680
losing my breath well how could he be

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.519
still using an elbow

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:36.720
because that's what it takes to get the

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.440
knot

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.440
there's no other instrumentation there

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.680
is that we i got the thera gun

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.920
irritation laser now that's monitored

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.760
technology this is on street

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.360
chris [ __ ] elbow

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.279
he's got no like well yeah they should

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:50.640
just have a thing that they strapped to

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.160
your shoulder and you just have it off

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.000
he's gonna find too much this thing is

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.760
like yeah this thing is like he can give

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.519
the pressure where he needs it

00:10:57.519 --> 00:10:59.279
you know that's the art of it yeah dude

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:00.880
there should be there should be like uh

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.040
like a sonogram type thing that finds

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.920
knots right that's what you're saying

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.360
yeah imagine if you were blind and you

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.360
were looking for a quarter

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.440
that's how he is looking for a knot like

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.800
he feels something goes i got it and

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.320
then he goes you feel that i was like

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.519
yeah of course i feel it he's like do

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:17.279
you hear it in your brain

00:11:17.279 --> 00:11:20.480
because you can hear a crunch goes

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.800
yeah and then after a while it just goes

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.720
how long does it take to get worked out

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.320
it's a hour session 200 a pop nice and

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.519
i'd like to go

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:31.040
more often but i'm like that's a lot of

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.640
[ __ ] money yeah yeah and then you

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.320
gotta wait two two months so you gotta

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.760
do you gotta do a lot of simple

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.000
exercises yeah he handed me a pvc pipe

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.399
and he's like welcome to the heaviest

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:42.000
pole that you'll ever feel in your life

and just lift this up two inches over my

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.640
head for like 10 seconds of pop and it's

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.399
like the most excruciating pain yeah

00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:52.160

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.240
object oh dude

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.000
dude in high school and i was watching

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.680
dragon ball z on a regular basis and

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.680
just listening to bruce lee like

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.160
watching bruce lee documentaries i do i

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.760
swear to god i would sit in the bathroom

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.600
of the lights off for hours and try to

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.600
like

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.480
no i swear to god that's how he made it

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.839
yeah well you just sit there and you

00:15:25.839 --> 00:15:27.920
like you channel all your energy

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.839
into it and you're just well essentially

00:15:29.839 --> 00:15:30.800
like you said

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.480
i could feel it i swear to god i can

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.720
feel it if dude if you do grounding if

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.240
you put your bare feet on the ground

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.279
your feet vibrate i swear to god yeah

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:40.959
your feet start to vibrate there's an

00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:42.480
electromagnetic field all over the

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.680
ground you have it on your body and they

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.199
interact there's a field of

00:15:45.199 --> 00:15:46.639
electromagnet like a weak electric

00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:48.079
signal that surrounds your body that's

00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:50.160
that's a scientific fact yeah i was just

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.839
watching the uh that's how it's been

00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:52.959
franklin

00:15:52.959 --> 00:15:55.440
i believe it ben frankel documentary

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.120
explains how he found electricity and

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.759
just saw like the the hairs of a rope

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:01.839
next to the key go off because there's a

00:16:01.839 --> 00:16:04.000
constant electric electricity

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.240
momentum in the sky really yeah

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.320
electricity is freaky dude it's nice

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.600
it's nice shit's [ __ ] it's no dragon

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.600
ball z though do you i mean it's close

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.839
what what's that

00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:15.839
ben franklin on an old wooden toilet

00:16:15.839 --> 00:16:17.120
like dude

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.560
just getting a ball together did you

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.320

jesus and mary uh yeah we did the baby

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.079
how was joseph's dude

00:16:28.079 --> 00:16:30.000
you'd be a good joseph that's a big up

did you guys do the may procession when

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.480
you'd pick like one eighth grade girl

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.480
and she'd walk down no yeah

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.880
a little weird

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.880
but it was way more boring because you

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.240
were just like we didn't throw her off a

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.000
cliff but i select the hottest eighth

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.680
grader and they would play mary and then

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.880
you'd have a may procession where like

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.240
you'd pretend she was married and you'd

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.079
all like walk behind her you walked

00:16:56.079 --> 00:16:59.360
along some like shitty asphalt path yeah

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.360
like behind the seminary and the [ __ ]

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.199
nunnery whatever and then next to a

00:17:03.199 --> 00:17:04.720
graveyard and we'd just be following

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.160

historical representation of like tj as

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.280
best we could yeah without the slave

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.480
ownership yeah yeah everything yeah yeah

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.320
yeah we skipped a few parts

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.600
in the chapters

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.160
yeah look with great men you you got to

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.000
skip a few chapters otherwise you can

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.559
lose the plot true you know kind of i

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:14.480
know that sounds like it's biting its

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.480
own tail but it's true

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.000
if you focus on too much of some of the

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.520
bad stuff they did you can lose sight of

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.960
it i'm looking forward to like the

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.600

everybody yeah it was fun people would

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.799
go out on stage and i would hold their

00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:18.240
stuff and they would try to walk out

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.679
they would get like

00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:22.400
like stop stop

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.760
you're trying to creep out to see how

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.960
far we could make it without people

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.980
seeing it

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.520
[Laughter]

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.640
because we're wearing all black that was

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.919
the point of it yeah so it's like all

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.520
right let's see if this stuff holds up

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.880
yeah just kind of creep on a stage and

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.200
look out and like see someone like oh i

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.080
was i was a stage hand because my uh my

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.360
girlfriend

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.880
was in a play was in joseph in the

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.960
amazing technical or dreamcoat really

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.880
yeah it was at the local church it was a

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:45.760
play

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.919
and uh i want to hang out with her so i

00:19:47.919 --> 00:19:49.840
just became a stagehand just to watch

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.960
her make sure she doesn't cheat on me

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.200
yeah it was well yeah not even splitting

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.400
the pb and j on my watch

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.760

on fire and threw power max cans in it

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.159
what's power paramax is just this like

00:20:46.159 --> 00:20:49.200
like condensed fuel cells jesus

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.360
dude

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.640

to a mattress store in steinway ah dude

00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:40.399
i feel like there are

00:34:40.399 --> 00:34:41.599
drug fronts

00:34:41.599 --> 00:34:43.440
yeah it's got to be easy to smuggle

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.040
drugs with mattresses

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.280
mattresses are made of mexico yeah yeah

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.599
and the prices are exhausting

00:34:49.599 --> 00:34:51.359
oh yeah no one's buying them it's like a

00:34:51.359 --> 00:34:53.200
piano like you only buy it once every

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.760
[ __ ] 5-10 years yeah it's bizarre

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.359
mattress stores and then like they're

00:34:57.359 --> 00:34:59.760
always like a 50 off too so it's like

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:03.560
yeah no i don't

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.760
like everything has to go and you pass

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.040
that store like three years later

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.079
visiting your parents you're like

00:35:08.079 --> 00:35:10.240
everything has to go it's like hey i

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.160
think the markup on mattresses is insane

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.079
though it's like super high from what i

00:35:14.079 --> 00:35:16.720
heard more than booze uh i don't know

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.200
you talking about like retail booths wow

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.880
like 600 percent yeah that's what i

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.320
thought it was like yeah cause that's

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.400
what a keg is like 80 bucks and then

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.000
yeah what is it three and a half cases

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.160
per keg yeah then it's like five bucks

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.520
yeah it's insane i just did this math on

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.400
the way up here

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.800
what keg math yeah the markup on alcohol

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.400
how much money you make oh yeah that's

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.359
crazy you're trying to figure out how

00:35:35.359 --> 00:35:36.720
much comedy club owners make i'm like

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.240

making all their money off the [ __ ]

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.680
yeah there's a boost you get them

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.040
drunken yeah yeah that's why there's a

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.119
two drinks like it's like eight dollars

00:35:49.119 --> 00:35:51.520

liquor they're buying these things that

00:36:02.079 --> 00:36:04.880
cost of a bulk cost probably the five

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.560

yeah let's let's dead lift 70 cases of

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.320
beer well deadlifting is dangerous

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.079
because you get it you can lift a lot

00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:45.520
and you get a taste of being able to be

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:46.800
in there be like

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.160
like pull it up so it's hard i was

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.680
stacking them last year i stacked them

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.520
up pretty heavy yeah [ __ ] my backup oh

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.560
my god i'm yeah 45s on the size

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:56.240
that's fine that's it yeah but if you

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.760
get the bouncy plates they look like

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.839
it's more so i like that too yeah the

00:36:59.839 --> 00:37:01.680
rubber plates rubber plates yeah they're

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.839
like that thicker it's like [ __ ] yeah i

00:37:03.839 --> 00:37:06.079
hate when people drop weight though

00:37:06.079 --> 00:37:08.560
would you slam it yes do you slam it i i

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.320
don't slam it as hard as i can

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.560
yes i don't get the full bounce back you

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.760
don't bounce it back up to your hands

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.359
but i'll drop it if i'm doing it i'll

00:37:15.359 --> 00:37:17.920
let go i don't know i think i think

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.760
my mind if you have to drop it

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.680
you shouldn't it's too much i'm a lunk

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.359
dude [ __ ] it

00:37:23.359 --> 00:37:24.640
do you know the best the best part about

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.359
ferg's workouts there's uh it's a very

00:37:27.359 --> 00:37:29.520
thin ceiling so they won't allow you to

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.520
drop like if you're dead lifting and

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.760
you're on your final rep yeah

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.359
you have to slowly place it down as you

00:37:35.359 --> 00:37:36.880
should i agree with you yeah yeah yeah

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.720
my issue is splashing the pot you earned

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.720
that dude you're [ __ ] you last one

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.320
i agree i also agree with you you're

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.240
giving up halfway through a wrap i'm

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.920
done you gotta bring it back

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.280
you're really done you gotta do an extra

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.800
one just so i can drink it's like a dude

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.640
benching and then slamming against the

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.680
iron

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.040
application of bringing something down

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.079
to the ground once you're up here you're

00:37:54.079 --> 00:37:55.280
done with it you're dropping because

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.680
when you start it's on the ground yep

00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.960
right you lift it up that's the

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.599
objective okay okay then to fully finish

00:38:01.599 --> 00:38:04.079
you need to get back down the earth

00:38:04.079 --> 00:38:05.119
that's not true

00:38:05.119 --> 00:38:07.359

00:38:07.359 --> 00:38:09.440

00:41:06.319 --> 00:41:09.440
come over to the tv and been like really

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.599
true that's impressive

00:41:11.599 --> 00:41:13.920
instead he just like went upstairs you

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.119
know what i mean which means he was

00:41:15.119 --> 00:41:18.240
clearly a shot yeah taking it

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.720
that happened once when uh he brought a

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.480
bunch of glass we had broken a bunch of

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.359
glasses for most of my life my dad got a

00:41:25.359 --> 00:41:29.200
20 28 pack or 30 pack of new york jets

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.280
glasses from a gas station

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.240
that was

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.880
that was all

00:41:46.079 --> 00:41:48.319
merry christmas darling until until i

00:41:48.319 --> 00:41:49.920
remember in high school it was early

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.280
high school maybe my freshman year we

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.040
got down to about two

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:55.359
because just they just broke yeah

00:41:55.359 --> 00:41:57.200
and so we bought all new glasses and i

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.520
hated the design of them and i was like

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:02.160
uh i was like dad how do you feel about

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.440
these glasses

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.560
and he was like how do you feel about

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.119
your shoes

00:42:07.119 --> 00:42:09.280
i just got new sneakers it was the

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:12.640
meanest thing no that rules dude

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.560
your dad bullies you then you're on your

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.960
[ __ ]

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.760
was he working with it was a jets class

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.920
it had like the old dress glasses there

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.160
well no they were they were

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.760
big heavy

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:29.119
glasses with like it was like a glass

00:42:29.119 --> 00:42:31.599
that's a big glass but holds no liquid i

00:42:31.599 --> 00:42:33.599
don't know if you've ever yeah so i hate

00:42:33.599 --> 00:42:35.760
those it's a heavy bottom yeah like

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.680
there was like this thick a glass at the

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.119
bottom and it was just it was like a

00:42:39.119 --> 00:42:41.040
shot glass that was as big as a pint

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.160
yeah

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.880
well you broke

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:57.760
do you think your mom had anything in

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.599
the glasses no no no

00:42:59.599 --> 00:43:00.800
no no

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.280
no he came home and he was like i did it

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:06.240
oh no yeah and i was like these are bad

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.000
oh he can't right

00:43:23.839 --> 00:43:25.200
this isn't like mcdonald's this is the

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.800
real deal you're all dug in like damn

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.079
dad's [ __ ] knows everything about

00:43:28.079 --> 00:43:29.359
food

00:43:29.359 --> 00:43:31.119
everybody in january like dude this is

00:43:31.119 --> 00:43:32.400
awesome yeah

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.079
we got it once and then my brothers

00:43:34.079 --> 00:43:35.520
called it boston mortgage because it was

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.319
so expensive

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.680
like once a year all of our glasses in

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.560
in the in the drawers were were old like

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:45.839
anytime you went to an eagles game or

00:43:45.839 --> 00:43:47.839
philly's game all 32-ounce plastic cups

00:43:47.839 --> 00:43:50.079
with designs on the side yeah yeah never

00:43:50.079 --> 00:43:53.359
got glass never got past but that was

00:43:53.359 --> 00:43:55.280
our day-to-day [ __ ] around cups like the

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.480
uh

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.800
like the ninjas like these boys yeah

00:43:58.800 --> 00:43:59.920
yeah this is how you consume you

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.599
consuming large glass

00:44:01.599 --> 00:44:04.319
or large plastic containers that you

00:44:04.319 --> 00:44:05.520
feel terrible

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:06.880
instead of drinking out of the brita

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.040
tommy fills up this giant thing and he

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:11.599
puts ice in your tap yeah nice yeah did

00:44:11.599 --> 00:44:13.599
you ever get into solarizing water

00:44:13.599 --> 00:44:15.119
i recently just got into this you leave

00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:16.640
water out in the sun

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:19.200
it charges it up really yeah do dragon

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.240
balls eating me right now i swear i'm

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.200
i was sitting there with my water

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.640
recently and i'd always like hold it in

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.920
the water for the sun for a little bit

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.680
like dude this has to like give my water

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.680
properties and i looked i finally looked

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.040
it up and it's a whole thing no i think

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.720
they use it to purify water the sunlight

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.319
purifies water you need to take your

00:44:34.319 --> 00:44:37.359
shoes off

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.920
you're electrified right now it's

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.560
pumping it full of radiation dude yeah

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.480
the sun the sun you can't make vitamin d

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:45.680
without the sun in your body you just

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:48.720
set it in front of a nuclear

00:44:48.839 --> 00:44:51.359
reactor this has this is this is

00:44:51.359 --> 00:44:53.280
millions don't touch it billions of

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.640
years of evolution have created the

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.560
perfect filter you know you know why

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:57.520
it's green

00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:58.880
yeah it's black chlorophyll to block

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.440
dude what the [ __ ]

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.359
what do you think a sweatshirt scream

00:45:03.359 --> 00:45:04.880
man this guy's [ __ ] he's all cool

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:06.319
filled out yeah that's why if you're if

00:45:06.319 --> 00:45:08.960
you're no because this is the least uh

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.280
uh this this wavelength has the least

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.960
amount of energy in it the red the blue

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.560
and the yellow that's why you want to

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:15.760
charge it that's what you want to stream

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.119
because it's taking all the red dudes

00:45:17.119 --> 00:45:18.400
yeah dude that's why if you're ever

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.760
growing plants and you need to work on

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.200
them with light and you don't want to

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.400
actually put light on them you have to

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.839
do a green light that way it doesn't the

00:45:23.839 --> 00:45:25.040
plant plant doesn't feel like it's

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.040
getting light i like you can still see

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.079
like this you don't want to interrupt

00:45:28.079 --> 00:45:29.200
like a light cycle of like indoor

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.599
tomatoes

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.960
pretty cool so i've heard that you know

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.400
this is what children play should be

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.920
that's you know what i mean for

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:42.960
following one leaf oh yeah but dude

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.880
solarizing water it charges it up

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:46.720
according to one's charges a lot of

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.480
dudes from india are all over this yeah

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.839
see that's how you know it's no i'm

00:45:49.839 --> 00:45:52.079
showing you dude here's the thing water

00:45:52.079 --> 00:45:53.920
this can contain if this can hold energy

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:55.920
from the sun why couldn't water

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.680
why can't water hold energy from the sun

00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:00.160
because it doesn't have what this has

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.839
what is that this is this is a this is a

00:46:01.839 --> 00:46:04.319
biological it doesn't have cells water

00:46:04.319 --> 00:46:06.400
doesn't have cells this yeah the water

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.480
can't break it down it doesn't have to

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.599
break it down

00:46:09.599 --> 00:46:11.760
it stores energy water stores energy

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.520
look it up it chemically alters water

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.119
when you put in the sunlight but i feel

00:46:15.119 --> 00:46:16.480
like it's got to be for the worst right

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.240
it's probably splitting atoms in there

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.520
that's good for you dude this does sound

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:22.880
like dragon ball z technology

00:46:26.319 --> 00:46:27.920
i'm sorry i did it's so fun too you

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:29.280
charge your water up i charge my water

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.920
by leaving the windowsill and charge it

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.319
like oh my water's charged my wife's

00:46:34.319 --> 00:46:36.800
disappointed

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.520
you got to drink it in like three days

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.200
though because you heat it up it heats

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.640
up you put it outside give it like a

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.200
full second hot water has more energy

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:46.240
than

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.520
you tell me dude what's going on with

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:48.800
those particles they're moving well

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.480
that's what i'm saying if the cold water

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.079
that you can it's also bad for other

00:46:52.079 --> 00:46:54.000
things that you need to contain

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.960
in terms of like what not just raw

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:59.520
minerals if that's natural spring water

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:01.359
it's bad for other ingredients if you're

00:47:01.359 --> 00:47:03.280
adding like you can't power up anything

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.200
but water of course not yeah you want a

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.319
power water you shouldn't be drinking

00:47:06.319 --> 00:47:08.240
anything about water

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:11.119
shut up man what are you talking about

00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:12.720
so wait hold on you would put that

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:15.680
capped in the backyard during the summer

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.440
you let it sit there for six hours and

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:18.800
then you take it in you let you have a

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.079
couple days you let it like chill for a

00:47:20.079 --> 00:47:21.359
couple of hours and you just sit pull it

00:47:21.359 --> 00:47:22.960
how come nobody's doing this nobody has

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.040
power people are doing oh they are yeah

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.880
people are so it's a whole thing i i

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.800
intuitively was like i would leave it in

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.000
the sun for a little bit i'm like damn

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.280
dude this is probably energizing my

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.880
water and finally i was like i should

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.400
look that up it's a whole thing solarize

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.240
whole companies not even companies it's

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.359
just a thing you can do yourself they

00:47:37.359 --> 00:47:38.400
even say too

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.319
that's why you should use blue bottles

00:47:40.319 --> 00:47:42.240
is this just this is probably just a

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.720
water mogul going what about the old

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.400
cases that weren't picked up behind the

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.760
wheels they're centuries old it's a

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.520
century it's aerobatic whatever however

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.119
you say

00:47:51.119 --> 00:47:51.839
it's a thing that medicine

00:47:51.839 --> 00:47:53.599
around forever yeah charge it the

00:47:53.599 --> 00:47:55.200
hawaiians do it with deep dark blue

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.079
water

00:47:56.079 --> 00:47:57.680
in india they do it as well then you can

00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:59.040
get into the whole thing of like you can

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:00.800
put it with a certain color spectrum and

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.559
they claim i haven't haven't looked into

00:48:02.559 --> 00:48:04.319
this so far they say the different color

00:48:04.319 --> 00:48:06.559
bottle also so what about like boiling

00:48:06.559 --> 00:48:09.440
off regular stream water to get rid of

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.839
bacteria it's not the sun dude

00:48:11.839 --> 00:48:13.520
you're just heating it up and boiling so

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.920
the sun is providing the sun evaporates

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.160
the sun's providing energy for your if

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.920
you put if the sun hits you you create

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.200
vitamin d what do you think it does to

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.040
water

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.640
i just take a pillow

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.559
every day yeah but dude that's that's

00:48:26.559 --> 00:48:28.400
right i wonder how much sunlight water

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.800
absorbs or does it reflect it

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.640
it absorbs i'm telling you i from what

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.480
i've read again i'm not fully done my

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.400
research none of us are high and this is

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.720
why i'm telling you this reminds me of

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.200
this one how to energize water mantra by

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.440
sagadoros

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:45.599
i didn't see that i didn't see that one

00:48:45.599 --> 00:48:46.720
i didn't really talk beautiful that's

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.960
the first

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:02.240
water too if you want to put some

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.079
crystals in it you can't i don't i

00:49:04.079 --> 00:49:05.599
haven't researched that yet i drank

00:49:05.599 --> 00:49:08.000
super oxygenated water once really i was

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.520
at i was at hockey campus increases the

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:12.240
oxygen level when you put it in the sun

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:13.200
i believe

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.400
what the [ __ ] do you think i'm saying

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:17.359
how many times

00:49:18.559 --> 00:49:20.559
and super oxygenating and i feel like

00:49:20.559 --> 00:49:23.200
are different things

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:27.119
[Laughter]

00:49:27.119 --> 00:49:29.200
i was at goalie camp in toronto and it

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.040
was like eight hours a day

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:34.559
of [ __ ] there's a sentence

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.760
just goalies

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.839
who shot the shot

00:49:39.839 --> 00:49:42.319
hardcore canadians dude and i was not

00:49:42.319 --> 00:49:45.680
good i went up there for like an extreme

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:48.079
it was like a two-week training thing

00:49:48.079 --> 00:49:50.960
i like it was insane these guys were

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.280
every goalie i was playing with like was

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:54.800

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:15.119
no i just thought it would help i

00:50:15.119 --> 00:50:16.960
started chugging super oxygenated water

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.680
immediately had to [ __ ] my [ __ ]

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:22.480
brains out like like hardcore i'm about

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.520
to explode diarrhea yeah and i had to

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.200
sprint i don't know if you've ever tried

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.520

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:30.319
dude

00:50:30.319 --> 00:50:35.200
it's impossible to get out of magic dude

00:50:35.359 --> 00:50:37.920
like oh it was it was hell i literally

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.079
almost [ __ ] my whole you almost [ __ ]

00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:41.440
yourself at goalie cam

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.440
it was yeah it was it was you got your

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.040
pads off

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.800
no i had to shove my leg because you

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.319
have you had your goalie pads on while

00:50:48.319 --> 00:50:50.880
taking a [ __ ] yes

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:53.440
dude it takes an abomination it takes 10

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.960
minutes to get out of goa

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:57.440
it takes 20 minutes like it's long

00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.760
lacing up and like getting it

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:00.880
it wasn't just

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.400
i'm holding up my chest protector and

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:05.839
trying to shut down my pants just

00:51:05.839 --> 00:51:08.319
meanwhile

00:51:10.559 --> 00:51:12.240
yeah we lost 20 nothing did you ever

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.599
[ __ ] with the oxygen bar at the

00:51:13.599 --> 00:51:16.800
boardwalk no they had that oh dude when

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.160
i was younger they they had this thing

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:19.520
where you go to the boardwalk and they

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:21.119
had like an oxygen bar you could breathe

00:51:21.119 --> 00:51:22.319
pure oxygen they told you it was

00:51:22.319 --> 00:51:23.680
supposed to like make you kind of high

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.200
yeah so people go up there and just be

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:25.920
like

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:28.640
hit the o2 and just be like

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.720
there's a company now that has uh

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.680
oxygenated water that's like killing it

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.520
like every you know a few years there's

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.359
like a beverage company that just

00:51:37.359 --> 00:51:39.440
destroys the whole industry yeah and

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.599
it's like a o2 company which is all

00:51:41.599 --> 00:51:43.280
water that's like double or triple the

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.839
oxygen really of a daily dosage or

00:51:45.839 --> 00:51:47.040
whatever

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:48.960
the pros are drinking it and [ __ ] i

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.400
don't know what it's called like breathe

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.000
oxygen on the sidelines apparently that

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.160
doesn't help

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.680
what to get do you want to get into your

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.520
bloodstream or something but you're like

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:00.800
your blood can only hold so much oxygen

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.240
yeah but if you're deprived of it from

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:04.319
this no but if you're if you're like at

00:52:04.319 --> 00:52:06.720
sea level you're observing everything

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.800
you're absorbing the massive like the

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.960
the most oxygen you possibly can so if

00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:12.720
you're getting extra oxygen you're like

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:14.160
it doesn't even get into yeah that's

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:15.599
what belly breathing is good for because

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:16.559
when you breathe in through your

00:52:16.559 --> 00:52:17.680
diaphragm

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.440
when you release the key balls get going

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.720
dude exactly you got to breathe into

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.680
your diaphragm because when you don't

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:22.800
breathe into your breathing for your

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.400
diaphragm it's like a pump when you

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:26.400
release it it pushes all the stale air

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.839
out of your lungs and you can absorb

00:52:27.839 --> 00:52:29.839
more show me how to do it let's talk

00:52:29.839 --> 00:52:31.440
more just put your hand on your one hand

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.680
on your belly one hand on your uh chest

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.520
and you breathe

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.720
you want the hand on your belly to

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.160
expand before the hand on your chest if

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:39.839
your hand on your chest expands first

00:52:39.839 --> 00:52:41.440
typically happens with smokers yeah you

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:42.880
ever do yoga

00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:43.680
no

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.119
this is diaphragmatic breathing usually

00:52:45.119 --> 00:52:46.800
most people breathe they go and breathe

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.000
into their chest

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:48.960
up here

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.160
right there i see that chest rising

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:51.200
supposed to go right now i did the

00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:52.480
opposite because i wanted to see what i

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:54.160
was doing wrong you see that you got to

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:57.119
extend the belly and then feel the chest

00:52:57.119 --> 00:52:58.800
and that's your diamond grab the belly

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.839
and then the chest

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.400
and you let you you when you let go of

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.240
your belly you can even have to exhale

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:07.440
if you go

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.040
and just let go of your stomach who's

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:11.280
got that naturally pushes the air out

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:12.640
i got the headphones on i'm hearing a

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:13.760
lot of

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:15.680
acceptance i'm hearing all those oh i

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:17.280
got one i got a nasty one i think you

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.559
guys all got

00:53:18.559 --> 00:53:20.319
it

00:53:20.319 --> 00:53:22.800
toronto buggies mine got uh

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.800
i've opened mine back up

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:27.200
goalie

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:28.880
mine used to be more clothes i've opened

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.000
it up

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.760
do you have a truly demonstration yeah

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.359
bro mine was like yeah

00:53:33.359 --> 00:53:34.800
it was eighty percent blocked dude this

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.079
thing was [ __ ] up how did you open it

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:37.599
up again it's i don't i gotta go get the

00:53:37.599 --> 00:53:38.960
test but i can actually i could not

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:40.160
before i would go

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:41.920
i gotta go yeah you couldn't do anything

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.280
now goes

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:44.880
that's nice i got like i probably got

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:46.720
myself up to thirty percent yeah are you

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:49.200
gonna get it uh eventually all i do is i

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:50.240
just go like this every now and again

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.079
and push it in as hard as i can oh my

00:53:52.079 --> 00:53:53.280
god

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.200
that's not what you do yeah over time

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.720
i'm getting more i'm reclaiming more and

00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.240
more of the deviation dude it's coming

00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.240
back you should use a q-tip

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:02.400
that's not a bad idea q-tip you can

00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:03.920
really get up in there i like to give i

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:05.200
give it some pressure and get it

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.599
deviated septum is not old boogers

00:54:07.599 --> 00:54:10.559
you gotta get your [ __ ]

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.160
every night and you just breathe in

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.160
through your nose over time that would

00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:28.559
die yeah i would die immediately

when i i pinched a nerve because i was

00:55:05.359 --> 00:55:08.559
looking through tinder too much

00:55:08.799 --> 00:55:10.720
is this like tommy's bored [ __ ]

00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:12.319
shoulder no because i would literally

00:55:12.319 --> 00:55:14.400
just lay at night just on my left

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:16.319
shoulder and just swipe

00:55:16.319 --> 00:55:17.839
yeah and i would do that looking for the

00:55:17.839 --> 00:55:19.520
one yeah yeah and then sometimes i have

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.799
to switch hands because this one gets

00:55:20.799 --> 00:55:22.079
tired from holding it having your arm

00:55:22.079 --> 00:55:24.880

what do you mean

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:34.760
i mean what's the average swipe time

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:40.160

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:17.119
average

00:56:17.119 --> 00:56:19.839
the length of time

00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:53.280
you're a dick if you're doing that not

00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.400

i think they're like this guy

00:58:00.559 --> 00:58:02.319

00:58:02.319 --> 00:58:03.520

what's your profile what were your

00:58:07.119 --> 00:58:08.640

00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:11.040
my what like the tagline yeah mine was

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.119
uh i'm a goalie that [ __ ] himself once

00:58:13.119 --> 00:58:15.440
in canada

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:16.960
toronto goalie

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:18.559
i usually have burns with the passion of

00:58:18.559 --> 00:58:20.880
a thousand latino love betrayed latino

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:22.720
lovers or something it was pretty good

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:23.680
it worked

00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.119
really well yeah i brought the passion

00:58:25.119 --> 00:58:26.960
of a thousand betrayed latino lovers or

00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:29.040
something yeah yeah i always worried

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.960
about like getting like two

00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:32.960
too unique or too funny yeah because

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.559
then they're just like this guy's too

00:58:34.559 --> 00:58:37.920
much yeah i did i am a new york yankee

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.680
that's just the worst thing possible

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:42.400
yeah that is that's that is worse than

00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:43.760
trying to do it because every time you

00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:45.440
come back every time you come back to it

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:47.040
if you have anything like that you

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.640
thought was funny at the time it just it

00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:49.920
just feels like you're wearing the same

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:51.599
t-shirt with a joke on it for [ __ ]

00:58:51.599 --> 00:58:53.359
ten days yeah yeah it's like going back

00:58:53.359 --> 00:58:55.200
to watching a joke you told five years

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:57.119
ago you're like jesus what was i doing

00:58:57.119 --> 00:58:59.839
nah i was pretty determined to get [ __ ]

00:58:59.839 --> 00:59:02.799
any means necessary i would uh

00:59:02.799 --> 00:59:04.240
i think we talked about this once where

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.680
it's like they were you're supposed to

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:07.440
say something clever when you first that

00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:09.599
sucks that's how i would i just

00:59:09.599 --> 00:59:11.760
hit him with a hand nothing no gifts and

00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:13.839
it's like yeah how are you yeah you

00:59:13.839 --> 00:59:16.640
should hang out right now yeah yeah

00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:19.040
immediately

00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:25.119
it's all about sex it's all about your

00:59:25.119 --> 00:59:27.520
your bodily fluids your animalistic

00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:29.760
behaviors where are you are you close

00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:30.960
let's [ __ ]

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:33.359
separate ways yeah the problem is with

00:59:33.359 --> 00:59:35.760
straight people it's like i gotta come

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.920
up with this clever little poem

00:59:41.599 --> 00:59:44.319
not a murderer and i think so yeah

00:59:44.319 --> 00:59:45.839
true that's also the problem with men

00:59:45.839 --> 00:59:47.440
yeah yeah you got to tell me if you're

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.119

and prove that you're not a murderer

yeah in two so they they do like very

00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.799
challenging

01:00:00.799 --> 01:00:02.640

it is refreshing though like there's

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:44.559
there's a certain element of our

01:05:44.559 --> 01:05:46.240

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.599

routine yeah when you go out of that

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.039
routine if you're going to a show or you

these beautiful people or beautiful

01:06:11.599 --> 01:06:14.799

01:06:14.799 --> 01:06:17.599
desire to like create you're like i want

01:06:17.599 --> 01:06:18.799
to do something

01:06:18.799 --> 01:06:20.079

01:06:20.079 --> 01:06:21.520
these elements and then you see these

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.880

01:07:00.319 --> 01:07:01.359

be like my wife left me yeah

01:07:05.359 --> 01:07:07.520
i'm the father of jesus who's whose wife

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:10.000
cheated on me yeah and she's denying

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.440
christ yeah

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:14.160
accidentally impregnated apparently yeah

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.920
yeah i feel like he gets older or it

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.520
gets easier to like

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:19.599
get [ __ ] with the older you get

01:07:19.599 --> 01:07:20.559
there

01:07:20.559 --> 01:07:22.400
fine love i should say yeah but if

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:24.160
you're trying to just get posted like

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.440
there is as long as you don't completely

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.200
fall apart i feel like it gets easier

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.119
there's an inverse bell curve with

01:07:29.119 --> 01:07:30.960
attraction from younger women to older

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.760
men but also your care

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:36.079
and to the ease of pus yeah

01:07:36.079 --> 01:07:37.440
kind of bizarre that's something i like

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:39.599
that wasn't true

01:07:39.599 --> 01:07:41.359
i wasn't like my 17 year old self i was

01:07:41.359 --> 01:07:42.480
like i'm at the height of my [ __ ]

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:44.000
getting powers and it's like no you're

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.160
you are you're just a little guy yeah

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.799
dude you're like trash can of of [ __ ]

01:07:48.799 --> 01:07:50.559
explosives all night you have no idea

01:07:50.559 --> 01:07:52.160
what you're doing yeah it's crazy that

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.280
was something i was kind of delighted to

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.799
learn as i got older i'm like oh nice

01:07:54.799 --> 01:07:56.240
thank god for being like dude the rules

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.160
for dudes mid-thirties is when you know

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:00.319
who you are you know what kind of woman

01:08:00.319 --> 01:08:02.400
you're willing to investigate women

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.559
assume that that's the case i'm not even

01:08:04.559 --> 01:08:06.079
talking about the woman yeah i'm saying

01:08:06.079 --> 01:08:08.160
you know who you are because people have

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.520
said that to me like older guys are like

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.720
so much more mature i'm like yeah

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.319
no i'm saying you know i watched i took

01:08:14.319 --> 01:08:16.400
mushrooms and watched dragon ball z

01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:17.920
yeah yeah yeah

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.319
yeah yeah but you could do it like like

01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:22.480
i was you know it's just how i i saw my

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:24.400
unwind yeah it's more about being so

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.080
mature it's more about the investment

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.120
than you like

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:30.880
man true you know you can't fight it

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:32.239
the investment of your own time meaning

01:08:32.239 --> 01:08:33.120
like

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.520
what you're willing to go through to get

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:38.159
laid whether that's one specific girl or

01:08:38.159 --> 01:08:41.440
one specific opportunity like you just

01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:43.839
you get older and going like that i know

01:08:43.839 --> 01:08:45.440
i've been through that i know what that

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.279
person is maybe you're right maybe

01:08:47.279 --> 01:08:49.199
you're wrong but i'm not gonna invest in

01:08:49.199 --> 01:08:50.880
that so then you start getting into your

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.719
comfort areas where it's like i like you

01:08:52.719 --> 01:08:55.759
get better at crowd work

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.080
i like this bar i like this bartender i

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.400
like the [ __ ] discomfort because it

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:02.080
it settles the anxieties of everything

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.359
else you're going through and then when

01:09:03.359 --> 01:09:04.799
you get thrown in a situation you start

01:09:04.799 --> 01:09:06.719
to like oh i've been

01:09:06.719 --> 01:09:08.719
i've been hitting [ __ ] balls you know

01:09:08.719 --> 01:09:10.480
i've been warming up for this i know

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:12.159
exactly what i've been through if you

01:09:12.159 --> 01:09:13.520
don't have a lot of experience if you

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.880
don't have a lot of relationships you

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.960
can't every woman you meet you're like i

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.000
was in love

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000

01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:34.560
the weekend night thing came in then i

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.560
was like oh this is the power of like

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:37.839
ponying up at a bar because he already

01:09:37.839 --> 01:09:39.679

01:09:47.839 --> 01:09:49.679
thing to like be a regular at a bar and

01:09:49.679 --> 01:09:51.600

yeah well yeah yeah yeah it's like

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.920
waiting once every two months that

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:14.159

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.520
mingling with with the youth

york there's also a lot of bars that

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.360
turn the music up yeah so then you just

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:03.120
elevate your voice yeah it's like what

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:05.440
you're just making this harder to talk

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.679
yeah nobody needs the music

01:11:07.679 --> 01:11:11.360
nobody's dancing nobody dances nobody's

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:11.760
you go grinding at

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:14.880
a girl grind on her

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:18.800

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.520
imagination beats the imagination beats

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:39.679
are the best they're good i gotta say

01:13:39.679 --> 01:13:41.600
even when i'm jerking off and watching

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.040
porn it's

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:44.880
somewhere between fifteen sixty percent

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.400
imagination anyway

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:47.840
what

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.199
yeah

01:13:49.199 --> 01:13:51.280
wow

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:52.800
because i have to believe that it's

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:56.000
something that i could pull off

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.800
so emotionally distraught

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.400
you know what i mean like i have to

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:03.520
imagine like i i so the porn sets the

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.360
scene but you have to finish this i plot

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:07.679
a route to maybe getting that

01:14:07.679 --> 01:14:09.760
getting that scene yes so like that

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:11.440
actually happening to me i like think

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.199
about someone that everybody has to

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:16.159
maybe do that with if i just you know

01:14:16.159 --> 01:14:18.400
if i hey hey the right person

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.400
he's got to be realistic yeah he's got

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.400
to find the right check to grind on yeah

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.320
and then fill the body like bring that

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:25.520
