where skeleton I loved I loved just

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.270

like would you like to go up into the

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:39.120

done with a girl the most I've done with

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.500
this girl is getting kissed on the main

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.200
stage here's a bit oh that happened here

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.970
yeah because you said that what you had

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:58.380
never kissed anybody here it's been a

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.000
long time part of ding dong showdown

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.760
verse oh he did it yeah that's fun yeah

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:07.620

dick level up my eyeball I'm sorry it's

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:19.650
a big pan a lot of thought a lot of

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.070
people up here today ah so Quinn tell us

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:24.750
something wild about you that we don't

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.789
know that would be entertaining to us

00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:29.250
all like the last guy he can't come

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.740
he just keeps [ __ ] until the woman

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.679
starts crying yeah

00:27:33.679 --> 00:27:37.470
till there's fire so well what's

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:38.700
something about you that we'd find

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.090
interesting uh not a lot clearly that's

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:44.730
why I'm a virgin no I don't think that's

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:46.890
true so what's an average day in the

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:48.900
life like what time do you wake up I

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.559
usually run 9 9 9 a.m. and then what you

00:27:52.559 --> 00:27:55.950
get off your bunk bed and then what

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:57.810
and then your grandma makes you back

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:00.000
yeah you do your chores of the halfway

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:07.530
house no I look for work I look for

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:10.650
photography work you just start looking

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:12.570
for photography work yeah with what

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:17.280
binoculars I have a zoom lens I don't

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.190
need binoculars how do you look for

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:21.660
photography where you say go outside

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.780
it's a screaming like photos get your

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:31.050
fresh photos I use Craigslist oh Christ

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:34.140
yeah it would probably lose the

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:35.370
suggestion would probably be more

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:36.810
effective to be quite honest

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:39.990
have you taken tasteful nudes ever no

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:41.910
have you ever tried to do that like just

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:43.890
convince young girls to come over he has

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:47.280
what's the move do that you [ __ ] you got

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.030

Epstein's ass now for those of you that

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:52.680
just listen to the podcast which is

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.859
believe it or not the the great majority

00:35:55.859 --> 00:35:59.670
of consumers of this show clearly I hope

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:00.749
that you've caught on to the fact that

00:36:00.749 --> 00:36:03.349
Kerry Miller is a beautiful girl right

00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:06.029
yeah but even the video people can't see

00:36:06.029 --> 00:36:12.859
her ass I don't know what to tell you

00:36:12.859 --> 00:36:14.999
but it's just like it's more than that

00:36:14.999 --> 00:36:21.450
though it's like sure sure she happens

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:25.319
to have a fantastic ass but like I mean

00:36:25.319 --> 00:36:26.789
you gotta look past that if you want to

00:36:26.789 --> 00:36:30.569
be with somebody let me just let me just

00:36:30.569 --> 00:36:33.359
take a moment to talk to whoever is

00:36:33.359 --> 00:36:35.819
writing a blog about this as they're

00:36:35.819 --> 00:36:39.450
listening that it was Carrie who brought

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:41.880
up that she gets hit on at the beginning

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:44.819
of her set the first half of her set was

00:36:44.819 --> 00:36:47.160
about that so that's why I feel I can

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.259
completely rationalize doing this to a

00:36:49.259 --> 00:36:51.150
human being pulled out of the bucket

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:53.099
go ahead Bill Clinton yeah have you ever

00:36:53.099 --> 00:36:57.749
been to an island before Carrie do you

00:36:57.749 --> 00:36:59.579
get hit on a lot is that a common thing

00:36:59.579 --> 00:37:01.170
you get a lot of like cat calls and

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:04.430
things like that I would say no like

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:07.319
other than this guy back here and

00:37:07.319 --> 00:37:11.009
everybody on the stage like how often

00:37:11.009 --> 00:37:15.299
does that happen you have a boyfriend

00:37:15.299 --> 00:37:19.319

00:37:19.319 --> 00:37:23.180

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:28.060
you have really cute feet oh my god now

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:31.890

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:34.210
Jesus Christ

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:37.360

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:50.380

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:53.020

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.750
comedy no don't

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:06.609
rapist

00:55:06.609 --> 00:55:09.910
he's from Einstein that's what I thought

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:12.670

00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:18.160

y'all that's 60 seconds so I got to keep

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:38.119
it short I've been thinking about some

01:04:38.119 --> 01:04:39.950
[ __ ] it's completely random I thought

01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:42.470
about it over there but kids now have it

01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:46.190
way too easy to jack off I'm serious

01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:48.289
because when I was a kid I liked to jack

01:04:48.289 --> 01:04:52.270
off but you got to wait tools HBO or

01:04:52.270 --> 01:04:55.339
Cinemax got too late and your parents

01:04:55.339 --> 01:04:57.829
were asleep and you had to get lucky and

01:04:57.829 --> 01:05:00.349
it was soft porn now kids can pull out

01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:02.329
their [ __ ] phone and then just Jack

01:05:02.329 --> 01:05:04.359
the [ __ ] off that's not fair

01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:08.359
it's not I had to earn that [ __ ] I grew

01:05:08.359 --> 01:05:10.299
up with dial-up I'm not that old but

01:05:10.299 --> 01:05:12.559
goddamn you could just plot your phone

01:05:12.559 --> 01:05:16.910
and Jack off and the thing is when I was

01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:19.670
a kid my mom didn't have that much money

01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:22.970
so wasn't my mom's house I only had BT

01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:25.819
on cut oh yeah

01:05:25.819 --> 01:05:27.200
the real [ __ ] laugh they're like haha

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.589
everybody else had too much money but

01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:33.170
y'all knew about BT uncut the worst part

01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:34.460
about that is you're jacking off

01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:37.760
commercial break comes on and they like

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:39.980
to play gospel on certain nights so next

01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:41.750
thing you know you're sitting here with

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:42.980
your dick in your hand jacking off to

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:45.319

you there now you're known for your

01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:59.980
incredible comedy style of just

01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:02.530
blatantly lying about absolutely

01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:05.080
everything a lot of other people come

01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:07.150
the truth is comedy and this and that

01:19:07.150 --> 01:19:09.460
but you seem to be sort of the exception

01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:10.120
