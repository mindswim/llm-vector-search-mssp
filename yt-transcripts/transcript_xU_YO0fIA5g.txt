a book [ __ ] it's madness of crowds by

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:22.970
Douglas Mary it's written by a gay guys

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.530
kinda like a political he talks about

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:25.610
like politically correct stuff but

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:27.170
there's this one thing he's talking

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.200
about gay sex and how as a gay guy

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.480
there's like I forget what the context

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.490
of it but he was like as a man you kind

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.980
of fall into a woman like you like fall

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.600
into union with her and he was like gay

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.130
this is like a gay writer explained it

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.680
like this as a gay guy you fall through

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.290
it's it's such a because as a guy you're

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:46.460
having sex with a woman you're

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.690
penetrating her and you don't know what

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.670
penetrations like and as a woman Jesus

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:50.870
getting penetrated she doesn't know what

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:52.520
it's like to penetrate a person as a gay

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.210
guy damn it smells

00:10:54.210 --> 00:11:00.430
[Laughter]

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.959
as a gay guy you know while you're

00:11:02.959 --> 00:11:04.130
having sex with someone what it's like

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.920
to be penetrated and to penetrate oh man

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.870
so it's like an act of perfect you

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:10.339
descend he was basically saying like as

00:11:10.339 --> 00:11:12.529
a gay man when you enter another man you

00:11:12.529 --> 00:11:14.420

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:48.490
Fritos and a machine you carry away the

Shore like hung out with you so many

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.850
times I had no idea you were freak

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:41.559
we talked about sex before we do talk

00:19:41.559 --> 00:19:43.330
about sex I see the reason to hang out

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.460
dude I don't know you almost have that

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.169
thing that's like almost like O'Connor

00:19:47.169 --> 00:19:47.470
and

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:49.179
Herbies where it's like it's such like a

00:19:49.179 --> 00:19:51.820
it's like talking to a serial killer

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:54.309
like where it's just like all been

00:19:54.309 --> 00:19:55.960
calculated talking about posed it's

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.450
funny this yes I was I was very

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.150
conscious of my breathing willows

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:05.760
playing with her vibrator and a

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:11.830
deposition pointed the [ __ ] 1996 my

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:15.720
father did hang up a sex swing interface

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:19.230
on a [ __ ] to eat and related note I'm

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:23.260
somebody who no longer is at my job

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.090
emailed a co-worker to say Mike should

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.590
watch what he's posting on Facebook

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:27.640
because it would be a shame if

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.130
administrators got ahold of this and the

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:31.690
thing the screenshot he sent was in

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.130
regards to me eating my wife's [ __ ]

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:34.690
because I eat her [ __ ] when they were

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:36.100
the stuffy nose and I said I felt like I

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:40.090
was literally drowning in [ __ ] then I

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:41.169
was like you know [ __ ] I would love to

00:20:41.169 --> 00:20:42.640
get called an HR to talk about eating

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.760
[ __ ] obvi so it's your wife yeah yeah

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.130
so within the bounds of marriage yeah

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.750
but this person was clearly out of their

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.190
[ __ ] mind so in his mind it was just

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.530
like I got him we gotta [ __ ] this dude

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.480
up yeah he's pretty bad put his name out

00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:00.309
to the dogs guys what have I done

00:21:00.309 --> 00:21:03.220
friended him on Facebook because I had

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.500
to feel like when he when he did that he

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.390
sent that to a co-worker and when the

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.100
co-worker sent me this I immediately

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.720
unfriended him because I it's gonna be

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.490
just he's gonna line them up and then

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:13.539
he's gonna present him when like he

00:21:13.539 --> 00:21:16.360
really gets pissed off yeah cuz I had no

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.470
other communication with him being that

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:18.520
he wasn't at my job anymore

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.250
and fortunately that's been the end of

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:22.750
it although he's been emailing her some

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.030
pretty threatening [ __ ] to who just this

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.830
or this guy who left and actually like

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:28.030
it got to the point where like he was

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.320
threatening suicide so she had to call

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.789
authorities to like get them to go over

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:32.860
to check on him like this is a deeply

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.210
disturbed person he's not only

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:35.200
threatening to kill himself but is

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.210
threatening to to turn over my [ __ ]

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:45.730
files someone presented HR all of your

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:47.919
social media it would be the funniest

00:21:47.919 --> 00:21:50.590
[ __ ] that's crazy that's leaking into

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:52.780
regular well I mean I don't know dude

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.159
they're all gonna join makes more sense

00:21:54.159 --> 00:21:55.809
for normal people get fired for [ __ ]

00:21:55.809 --> 00:21:57.720
like that then for like a comedy job

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.039
that's what we want to know like I just

00:22:00.039 --> 00:22:01.300
started thinking like it's kind of weird

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.160
like now everybody's social media is

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.930
being scrutinized like that because

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:07.060
that's the new yes I get wherever you'll

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.920
work but that's the move of the weak

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.510
person this is like these are

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:12.010
generations of people who have gone

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.340
without any consequences for anything so

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.510
you guys like us that if somebody has a

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:17.860
problem we'll confront them about it

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.060
whereas like these kind of people there

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.430
they don't have that within them so just

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:22.810
like I just got to get them and this is

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:24.430
the way to get them oh remember I had

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:26.140
that co-worker that did that to me while

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:26.860
we work together

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.590
he found like all right so when Delco

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.690
almost took off I was like I did like an

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:32.860
interview with like my neighborhood

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.800
newspaper yeah and it was like I thought

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.240
it would be cute because like I grew up

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.190
there and it was like yeah cool talk to

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:42.010
a guy in a coffee shop and I was had a

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:45.430
really bad job at the time and while I

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:46.810
was talking to this dude I was just like

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:48.100
look I just hope this [ __ ] thing

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.900
takes off so I could spike a football

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.150
through my boss's desk and just leave by

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:53.890
[ __ ] rope around if a helicopter

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:57.760
through his window and then like Delco

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.290
didn't take off and I got laid off from

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.960
my job and like a year and a half later

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:05.200
I had to get a real job again and while

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.220
I was there

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.520
this dude [ __ ] my gonna say his name

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.780
he like found this shitty newspaper

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.240
clipping and he was like you'd shame if

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.580
our manager saw this and he copied

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.020
everyone in our department except the

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.020
manager and I replied all and called him

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.720
a [ __ ] I was like yeah this kind of

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.840
[ __ ] will get you [ __ ] up dude and he

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.450
dropped it after that but I was like

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.820
don't don't don't drink our boss into

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.050
saying I'm gonna throw a football

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:36.400
through his desk what the [ __ ] wrong

view all caps it then it's evidence

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.500

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.810

and he would always he would always talk

00:24:29.539 --> 00:24:31.549
about when he was back in college and I

00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:33.020
think he went to which ones Gators

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.900
Florida yeah yeah and he would always

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.299
talk about it like it was like five

00:24:38.299 --> 00:24:42.020
years ago he was like 39 and he lived in

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:45.980
the dorms at Florida in his early

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.380
thirties and like had like pictures with

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.240
people and it was like you could see in

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.520
every single pace picture every face in

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.289
a picture with him was like a young

00:24:54.289 --> 00:24:55.460
person like what the [ __ ] his hat why

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.350
why is this guy here he went to college

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:59.270
at 30 and stay in the dorm yeah dude

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:04.190
he's actually the reason why spray to

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:06.830
the Redskins job when they yeah when he

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:09.470
got hired I cuz I went back and found

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:10.909
this everyone that get hired at my job

00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:12.559
it was like three interesting things

00:25:12.559 --> 00:25:14.090
about you one of his interesting things

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:16.250
was like every year I do a road trip to

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:18.679
Florida and last year I almost made it

00:25:18.679 --> 00:25:19.880
without going to the bathroom and I

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.010
think this year I'm gonna make it wow

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.260
that's pretty [ __ ] up Jesus does he go

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.270
by him if he's not going by himself cuz

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.340
last person ever to drive with goes by

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.250
himself and yeah he I guess he came

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:32.690
close to pissing his pants on the way to

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:35.179
Florida and you know an entire company

00:25:35.179 --> 00:25:37.010
that about himself he dropped out you

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.299
know I think at the basis of all the

00:25:38.299 --> 00:25:43.730
people like this rang the bell people

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:45.200
like this they're just completely

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.240
unremarkable and it kills them that

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.620
somebody is a reflection of what they

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.750
want to be and and every time that

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.600
they're reminded of that they got to end

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.700
it and right now it's just so easy to do

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.140
that yeah that's funny that you said

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.850
like it's an unremarkable person because

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.090
if you look at him he has almost no

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:03.530
physical features he looks like when you

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:06.130
ask a kid to make a person on a play-doh

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:09.220
smooth and unshaven

[ __ ] you out I've been awesome

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.580
it was a year later I was so drunk I

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:58.840
started like doing like twirls in the

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:03.430
dance a little intimidated because

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:05.260
because he sent you a picture it was

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:06.670
giant dick and then you displayed your

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:11.620
dance moves true shitty drunk salsa

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:12.730
dancing it was like one of those like

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:17.680
Spanish song gasoline it came on you're

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:20.410
stopping the art that's the advantage of

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:21.850
regular dick dude you were out there

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:24.460
whole [ __ ] personality this dude just

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:32.680
stand in the corner was a big bird was

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.950
probably dancing to hold about to the

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:37.210
dance or he's like no idea there's no

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:38.620
plan beat when you have a thick bird

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:39.700
that's the problem

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.170
that's accounting for everything he's a

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:44.530
dancer he's a social no I'm going fat we

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:46.120
fight you know I'm going for the bird

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.130
got two hands I'm gonna L gonna [ __ ] him

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:50.110
ring that Bell dude you have to send

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:51.670
multiple pictures of all the [ __ ] you're

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:52.990
good at you're like a human Swiss Army

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:59.470
knife a small she was at your [ __ ]

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:04.570
butthole man I'm gonna tell you what the

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:09.340
movies here alright he's he's gay go

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:11.320
College superstar which means he's got a

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.820
mom who does nothing all day but sit

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.440
home while his dad works and financing

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.480
and you know bankrolls the whole whole

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.399
thing so this was her identity forever

00:34:18.399 --> 00:34:20.409
so now she's got nothing because now

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:21.610
he's probably made the leap in the

00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:23.169
finance so she has nothing left but to

00:34:23.169 --> 00:34:24.730
put on Villanova sweatshirts every day

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:26.560
and then when nobody's around she gets

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.820
super sad and puts on that you are so

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.310
come on her mom his mom so now that was

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:32.950
the perfect because you can't be you

00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:34.960
can't be a 300-pound Italian woman and

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.800
not own a new your sweater and you are

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.480
personality fits her now because now

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.179
she's not the toast of the town anymore

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:44.140
she's feeling pretty bad about herself

00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:48.399
so now is the time for Matt McCusker to

00:34:48.399 --> 00:34:50.919
send her a text saying hey mrs. nerdy

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:39.069
[ __ ] money so I was just like

00:36:39.069 --> 00:36:41.079
whatever dude yeah I don't really harbor

00:36:41.079 --> 00:36:42.549
resentment that much I really don't

00:36:42.549 --> 00:36:44.619
think mine I don't think I feel that way

00:36:44.619 --> 00:36:48.339
if I saw that kid mm-hmm I don't think

00:36:48.339 --> 00:36:51.010
oh I know I know that one I know someone

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:52.750
I'll beat the [ __ ] out of if I saw him

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:55.390
how far back in your past is it it's

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:58.530
probably like seven six years

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:00.760
that's my guy Renee Bob that's not that

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.970
far

00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:05.560
took a bunch of my I'm gonna [ __ ]

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:06.910
if I saw that kid I would [ __ ] kill

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:08.320
would you know if you saw him or was it

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.570
someone like a stranger it's pretty much

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:11.830
a stranger but I kind of had this head

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:13.750
kind of his face built like burned into

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:15.910
my head yeah what about you Mike what's

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:17.910
your answer

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:19.870
actually today it would be the guy that

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:23.670
was talking [ __ ] to you on Twitter yeah

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:27.700
it's a rolodex of people who do you say

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:28.930
because you know what I I'm like man I

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:30.520
try not to harbor hate my heart you know

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.930
what I mean I don't let them occupy my

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:33.760
mind Basin notes I don't do that either

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.980
but I constantly find myself imagining

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.240
like like right now I'm having a problem

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.770
in my school or like I hate everyone

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:40.840
no that's imagining some dude who like

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.460
pushes his way out of the annoying girls

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.870
and it's like you all [ __ ] you up and I

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:46.620
just beat the [ __ ] out of that dude yes

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:48.550
constantly I fantasize about beating up

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:50.320
imaginary people yeah it's a good one I

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.090
think the more I get beat up in training

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:53.410
the less I think about that kind of

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:54.880
stuff like when I was in training and I

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.470
was like lifting weights it was a lot

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:58.390
easy like I'd be under the squat bar and

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:01.000
I would think of a comic who's actually

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.890
still a friend of mine we were never

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:05.020
enemies but I thought about him like

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:07.390
acting like I wasn't funny and that

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:08.860
would get me through like super heavy

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:10.540
squats like you think I'm [ __ ] not

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:15.790
dude all lift weights right now oh I'll

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:16.960
tell you later just because it would

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.630
just be mean for me to like but yeah

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:21.460
I've never been enemies with them yeah

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:22.780
it was just someone who was like if this

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:24.310
dude acted like that that would be so

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:28.660
[ __ ] corny norm norm tossing out his

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:34.930
on site yeah yeah how do you sleep at

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:36.370
night like I would just be thinking

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:39.310
about that hours on end like that is the

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:41.470
coolest [ __ ] thing Norman I was like

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:45.180
yes on site I'll [ __ ] up your enemy dude

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:47.140
that's the coolest [ __ ] thing I've

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:48.280
ever heard in my life

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.400
yeah I was pretty funny have you talked

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:55.570
to him yeah I think people should start

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:58.300
ignoring you know yeah yeah [ __ ]

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.790
dude you know I mean I watched his know

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:03.730
named his morning clip he has that video

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:05.770
online of him doing poetry this is like

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:08.770
too easy I can't be if I you know in

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:10.690
some sort of self-defense situation did

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:13.120
need to yeah result you know resort to

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.040
violence what have you I like I did a

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.370
few envisioned with with if I really

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:19.119
haven't but

00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:21.039
I've seen him you know I would be able

00:39:21.039 --> 00:39:23.230
to be toying with him yeah I like

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:27.069
fighting a lady you see yeah

00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:28.660
it's like a little tiny like did you see

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.980
him on like the street poetry video

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:33.309
thing I didn't watch that video oh my

00:39:33.309 --> 00:39:35.289
god there's a dude that delivers like a

00:39:35.289 --> 00:39:37.900
great you know just [ __ ] just Street

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.970
Ryan's dude and he's [ __ ] passionate

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.279
and killing it and then he comes in

00:39:41.279 --> 00:39:44.829
second and he's like my mother she was

00:39:44.829 --> 00:39:47.589
not she was pretty good but it was still

00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:49.059
not the best it could have been better

00:39:49.059 --> 00:39:50.470
and he's like trying to tell this like

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:53.769
poem about like not making up problems

00:39:53.769 --> 00:39:56.079
in his life yes having a rich mother

00:39:56.079 --> 00:39:59.710
[ __ ] awful and that like just

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:01.119
watching him and you can see in his face

00:40:01.119 --> 00:40:02.349
or he's like this isn't as good as the

00:40:02.349 --> 00:40:07.109
first guy gratifying to watch the whole

00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:13.329
Mike Wright yeah situation it would be

00:40:13.329 --> 00:40:17.829
weird I would be because of how unfair

00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:19.660
would be yeah I'd be laughing I don't

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:21.279
like a fun fight I don't think I told

00:40:21.279 --> 00:40:22.660
you I think I had texted you guys about

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.339
this but like a couple days after

00:40:24.339 --> 00:40:25.809
everything popped off one of the

00:40:25.809 --> 00:40:28.319
ringleaders that was tagging journalists

00:40:28.319 --> 00:40:30.730
on Facebook I said when I see you I'm

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:33.880
gonna break a jaw and roughly three days

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:37.029
later I got an email from a mutual

00:40:37.029 --> 00:40:39.039
friend of me and this person said hey

00:40:39.039 --> 00:40:39.849

00:40:39.849 --> 00:40:41.589

00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:42.910
going and then he's like listen I gotta

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:44.019
get to this he's like this might be the

00:40:44.019 --> 00:40:45.249
most uncomfortable call I've ever had to

00:40:45.249 --> 00:40:46.059
make

00:40:46.059 --> 00:40:48.279

you're really going to beat him up

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:55.329
maybe then if you have to go to that

00:40:55.329 --> 00:40:57.999
that far you probably shouldn't talk all

00:40:57.999 --> 00:41:00.999

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:01.410
uncomfortable but the crazy and you

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:02.790
actually mentioned this before like I

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:05.130
think I think it was just a time to be

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:07.230
like you know here's my moment but also

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:08.730
like you mentioned this Tim and that

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:10.380
like in their world people that have

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.900
never had conference confrontations take

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:16.080
an aggressive word as assault yeah you

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.310
know in their mind it's like I was

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:18.570
assaulted even though I might have said

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:20.490
just like some innocuous comment busting

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:22.230
balls where it's like you know this

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:23.310
culture they don't know how to bust

00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:24.900
balls they don't get it like if somebody

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.610
says something mean about your hair yeah

00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:28.320
you say the same thing back about them

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.000
having [ __ ] fat tits or something

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.470
like that you know it never occurs to

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:33.360
them they just go home and they'll just

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.220
write poetry on it was assaulted

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:37.650
yes yeah I think that's what shocks a

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:39.030
lot of these people like they move to a

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:40.530
city right

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:43.820
and they're like who I'm gonna this

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.860
you know metropolitan culture it's gonna

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:47.630
be great and then they meet people who

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:49.490
grew up in like the shitty parts of that

00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:51.260
city where it was just like a [ __ ]

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:54.200
violent dogpile entire lives and it's

00:43:54.200 --> 00:44:00.410
like hey what's up [ __ ] no shopping

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:02.720
and people were gonna have high-minded

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.140
ideas dude you [ __ ] came here we

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.490
already lived here and we were [ __ ]

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:11.210
[ __ ] we're not saying we're good and

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:12.410
this is how people will should be but

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:13.940
like you showed up and this is the

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:16.580
people you ran into don't act like like

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:18.260
you have I don't know maybe they do have

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:19.730
a better way of being but like they

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:22.310
don't know it's [ __ ] up about it you you

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:24.440
need things to keep you in check going

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:25.790
back to like the on site question there

00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:26.870
was one guy that was my own sight

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:28.790
forever but within the past 10 years I

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:32.060
reconciled like I got I got I got socked

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.130
by a 16 year old when I was 13 and I

00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:35.960
harbored resentment for years but the

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:37.430
reason why I got socked is cause like I

00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:39.170
went away with the family they were kind

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:40.250
enough to take me on vacation to the

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:42.170
Poconos and during the two-week trip

00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:43.610
that dad beat the [ __ ] out of the mom

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:45.620
and as soon as I got back I couldn't

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.630
wait to blab about him unloading on this

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:49.730
chick and I did and I thought it was

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:51.170
cool because I was saying something that

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:53.420
people were paying attention to yeah but

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:55.730
then this kid was like you can't do that

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:57.590
and as soon as he socked me I hit the

00:44:57.590 --> 00:44:58.580
ground he said you shouldn't said

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:01.190
anything and instantly I knew what it

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:10.790
meant no it was just a neighbor I don't

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:12.320
I don't know how to describe it but like

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.930
you know in a conflict it was like

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:16.490
amorphous and you could get stalked by

00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:17.990
anybody yeah like it had to be the

00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:19.460
person you had a problem with like

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:21.200
someone was just gonna sock you just to

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.850
remind you that socking was it was like

00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:24.320
an Amazon delivery they knock at your

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.090
door I just get punched I got punched by

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:27.500
a stranger on the bus when I was in high

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:30.020
school I didn't take two buses septa

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.850
buses to get to high school and on one

00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:32.420
of them

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:35.450
someone nudged me into a grown man and I

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:38.480
was like 14 at the time and this dude as

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.070
he was stepping off the bus turn around

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:41.510
and punched me in the face as the doors

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:43.340
were closing and I had to stand well

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:44.900
first of all all right getting punched

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.790
in the face not cool right but then I

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:48.350
had to stand there in front of the rest

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:49.790
of the people that took the bus that

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:51.590
went to my school as the kid who just

00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:53.220
got [ __ ] sock

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.900
about it but Tim devil's advocate here

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:57.030
like everybody on that on that bus

00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:58.500
likely had resentment because I

00:45:58.500 --> 00:45:59.700
guarantee you there was a 300-pound

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.050
woman blasting a little wing from her

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:02.910
phone and ecaps hot fries at seven

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:04.410
o'clock in the morning yeah that all

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:08.550
shifted to me yeah and I thought about

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:11.010
that dude every day number one he was so

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:13.859
big that and at the time I wasn't and if

00:46:13.859 --> 00:46:16.410
I like had a chance to fight him back I

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:18.330
would have gotten beaten up terribly

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:21.030
yeah so the doors saved me doors close

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:23.099
he's a [ __ ] [ __ ] dude like a fig I'll

00:46:23.099 --> 00:46:24.690
never see him again obviously but now

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:27.990
I'm done I stalked you I [ __ ] thank

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:29.130
you thank you

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:31.080
I think about that like dude anyone can

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:32.790
get punched everyone's so [ __ ]

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:34.619
punchable I think about that all the

00:46:34.619 --> 00:46:36.840
time it keeps me I'm [ __ ] six to do

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:38.700
200 pounds it's like I could just

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:40.020
[ __ ] walk into stores and take

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.670
whatever I want dude that one thing

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:43.410
about I just think about my [ __ ]

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:45.060
comeuppance from that beautiful stranger

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:47.369
on the boss well actually a homeless guy

00:46:47.369 --> 00:47:00.690
punched him in the face one time oh I

00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:02.130
wouldn't even see you coming I was I

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:03.450
would told this on a farewell but I was

00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:05.730
born in a street and as dude I was on a

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:07.589
was talking on the phone and the student

00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:09.089
just came out of like nowhere and

00:47:09.089 --> 00:47:12.540
punched me in the face and then uh like

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:14.760
I stayed on my feet and then he tried to

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.380
like tackle me and we went over the hood

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:19.310
of a cab into the street and I was like

00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:22.109
22 and training jiu-jitsu every day at

00:47:22.109 --> 00:47:24.540
this point so like I sprawl out I get my

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:26.250
legs behind me I throw him down into the

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:27.690
ground I get him on his back and then I

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:29.460
did a kind of an unorthodox move from

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:31.200
this position but I can warn him which

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.730
means I basically just took his arm I

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:35.040
bent it behind him until he's like his

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.890
shoulder didn't exist anymore and then

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:50.099
like I was just good I was just gonna

00:47:50.099 --> 00:47:51.810
sit on him I was just gonna have him

00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:54.480
mount until like I could like get a cop

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:56.160
on the phone or something but then he

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.290
kept punching me from his back on the

00:47:58.290 --> 00:48:00.540
ground which I [ __ ] respect that's so

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:02.640
sick and then I had to like I had to

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.230
restrain him first I didn't I was

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:05.790
conscious that if I punch it he was

00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:07.050
clearly homeless by the way

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:08.520
he was deadly on PCP because I was a lot

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:10.560
bigger than he felt super strong and I

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.240
thought about if I punched him in the

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:16.350
face and cut my hands on his mouth my

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:17.730
[ __ ] wife was pregnant with our first

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:19.140
kid at the time I thought I was

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:20.460
definitely crying when I called her on

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:21.840
the phone because I was so scared and

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:23.190
worried yeah but it was already over I

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:25.650
won a [ __ ] off-duty cop came out of a

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:27.030
pizza place like held the dude's legs

00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:28.500
until you know some of the handcuffs

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:30.210
came and that was when I realized there

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:31.770
was like 30 people just watching me

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:33.630

00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:26.010

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:30.000
