Title: Ep 317- Barndog
Description: Brendan Krick joins the D.A.W.G.Z. for a rather lengthy chat. We did this via zoom due to Matt coming into contact with a person who is Covid+ (got tested doesn't have it) and so we brought in the Coward Hour's own, Brendan Krick. Topics include: Black Israelites, Shane and Brendan's early party days, The Midway Airport Battle of WW2, and much much more.

yeah the less anti-semitic

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.559

all my sources were

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.680

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.360
me

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.240
he might be mr glass dude that would

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.079
make sense dude wow that's crazy i just

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:06.559
did that

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:09.439
i have all those crazy accidents bro he

00:17:09.439 --> 00:17:11.039
might be mr glass and trump is

00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:12.559
definitely unbreakable

00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:14.799
i was thinking about it because my i was

00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:16.079
talking to a lady and she was like it's

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:16.959
going to be a

00:17:16.959 --> 00:17:18.640
train wreck and i was like yeah but

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.640
somehow he keeps

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.079
he's the only one that keeps surviving

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.760
these train wrecks he keeps like

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.120
you know and then i was thinking the

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.440
unbreakable analogy you just had i was

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.480
thinking i i

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.400
confused mr glass was unbreakable i

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.919
thought biden was it did he know mr

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:35.280
glass is uh

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.679
samuel l just samuel l just keeps

00:17:37.679 --> 00:17:38.480
getting hurt

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.559
he's a frail black nerd he was like me

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:42.400
walking in the sheets

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.600
mr glass yeah that was mr glass it was

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.320
just walking i'm exploding did you know

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.480
urkel's not in the first four episodes

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.280
of family matters

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.840
whoa luckily did the shuttle driver tell

00:18:13.679 --> 00:18:14.400
dominated

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.000
i think he was a writer i think they

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.280
weren't pulling well and then they'd

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:17.760
just like

00:22:38.559 --> 00:22:40.320
complete mental breakdowns

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.679

00:22:46.159 --> 00:22:46.960
asylum that

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.880
the five bedroom house if you if someone

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.240
were to walk around if a doctor were to

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.360
assess everybody they could have been

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.200
like all right nobody goes outside

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.720
i'd look like a security guard i was

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.400
just sitting in that living room day and

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.000
in the back

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.520
and like things only went downhill

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.840
you and woods interactions when no one

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.120

going and you know

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.320

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.080
treachery and betrayal

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.559
the breaking the mug and then later

00:25:52.559 --> 00:25:53.200
confessing

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.480
i believe it was the three of us in the

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.760
kitchen when he confessed to you that he

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.960
had actually

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.640
he had originally reported that the mug

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.279
was an accident

00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:03.120
and then he confessed to the fact that

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.880
he broke it on purpose

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.480
i think he like swatted it off the

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.559
counter with a broom

00:26:08.559 --> 00:26:11.279
if i recall

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.279

00:26:15.279 --> 00:26:18.240
new one which he promised to

00:28:52.559 --> 00:28:55.760
actresses uh yeah that'll keep you out

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:56.159
there

00:28:56.159 --> 00:28:58.559
all their bits are about like a racist

00:28:58.559 --> 00:29:00.240
part they had to read for in this

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.679
audition

00:29:01.679 --> 00:29:05.200
that rules are they are they like going

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:05.679
full

00:29:05.679 --> 00:29:07.120
mo are they like saying the n-word and

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.520
stuff are they just going kind of like

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.880
that would be funny if one of them was

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.840
in a tarantino movie

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.760
they're like look at this tape of me

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.799
auditioning for the hateful eight

00:29:18.799 --> 00:29:22.240
yeah okay look tarantino you know a lot

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.360
of n-words

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.520
and i usually you know you know me i

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.640
usually don't mind them

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.000
but man even i had to like stop watching

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.200
the hateful eight i was like

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.000
they're just doing it on purpose that

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.840
whole movie was a play where they

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.039
screamed the n word

00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:40.000
was it real it makes the movie sucks and

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.880
it's literally it's set up like a play

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.200
i don't know it's bad and it's just

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.320
n-words dude

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.480
really so it's like the it's like the

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.360
n-word

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.960
it's like instead of hamilton it's just

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.840
people saying the n-word instead of like

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.000
yes hamilton was like we're gonna rap

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.440
the whole time quentin tarantino's like

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.720
how about a play where i get to say the

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.080
n-word as much as i want

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.679
finally yeah wasn't enough

00:30:03.679 --> 00:30:05.120
i want to see the hate plate where he

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:09.840
plays all the parts like eddie murphy

00:30:11.279 --> 00:30:13.440
never seen it now i'm not gonna watch it

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.480
it's it's

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.279
it's not very good i actually do like it

00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:17.679
but

00:30:17.679 --> 00:30:19.679
shane's summary of course you do very

00:30:19.679 --> 00:30:22.080
accurate

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.720
dude do you have a safe in your room i

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.840
was well i

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.200
i almost bought a gun so i had to get

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.640
to safe first well i i went i bought the

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.279
gun

00:30:33.279 --> 00:30:34.960
and then i bought the safe and then i

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.360
realized oh i'm a crazy person i

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.720
shouldn't own a gun

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.159
so then i had to argue with the gun

00:30:40.159 --> 00:30:42.080
store to take it back because they they

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:42.799
don't want it

00:30:42.799 --> 00:30:45.520
like once you buy it wow there's no

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.039
refunds and i'm like

00:30:47.039 --> 00:30:49.760
dude i'm gonna kill myself and i'm like

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:50.320

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.720
mentally ill i am a danger to myself and

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.440
others

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.440
please give me my five hundred dollars

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.679
back

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.519
they were trying to get me to keep the

00:30:59.519 --> 00:31:02.320
gun they're like look it's funny

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.320
funny to get [ __ ] buyer's remorse

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.360
into being like

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.000
i might shoot up a [ __ ] building dude

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.120
i gotta get rid of this thing

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.360
like now that i'm thinking about it i

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.600
need that 500 bucks or i might shoot up

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:19.039
a mall should give you a trial period

00:31:19.039 --> 00:31:20.000
with a gun to see

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.480
you know if you just make sure you don't

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.840
go and shoot a building up

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.840
well they give you the the in california

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.679
they have a 10-day cool off period where

00:31:27.679 --> 00:31:28.720
like you buy it and then you have to

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.039
come back and pick it up in 10 days

00:31:31.039 --> 00:31:34.159
uh you know it'll like i guess basically

00:31:34.159 --> 00:31:35.519
so that you'll have 10 days to be like

00:31:35.519 --> 00:31:37.440
you know what i will not kill my wife

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.720
[Laughter]

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.840
thanks governor newsome um but

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.840
i i think like i'm all for that but you

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.679
should also be able to call off the deal

00:31:45.679 --> 00:31:46.000
after

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.440
10 days as the consumer yeah i mean i

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.159
feel like

00:31:50.159 --> 00:31:52.480
it's a done deal for them if they decide

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.159
that i have priors or whatever they can

00:31:54.159 --> 00:31:55.519
take it away

00:31:55.519 --> 00:31:58.240
that's [ __ ] to me true you should

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.279
have walked in there high

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:02.159
with your gun on you

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.840
yeah that would be fun go back and i'm

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.519
like pointing the gun at them trying to

00:32:07.519 --> 00:32:09.360
reverse rob them

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.120
take this gun for me or i'll kill you

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.880
they'll shoot you instantly they

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.440
oh all people at a gun store do is sit

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.120
and daydream about people trying to come

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.000
in and shoot them so

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.840
they have like the gun store near my

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.039

yeah for sure yeah this place there were

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.600
like more than one guy working there

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:20.880

could have sold it

00:33:33.279 --> 00:33:34.880
that usually gun stores will sell your

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.559
gun for you and take a small piece

00:33:36.559 --> 00:33:38.320

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.760
wear a chris kyle's shirt at a gun range

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.960

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.560
would have been no good then

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:18.079
someone somebody would have been

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:21.200
nobody would have gotten it yeah drums

every right to like hate them

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.040
anyway what were they up to there's some

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.560
sick [ __ ] moments dude

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.560
this was a moment that got like this got

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.640
me pumped and i couldn't sleep

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.200
there was a scene there's a part uh at

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.480
the battle of

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.520
i think it was at midway it's this at

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.960
the battle midway this is after pearl

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:05.520
harbor

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.560
this is in chicago yes

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.839
see i seen the ice monsters saw the

00:36:10.839 --> 00:36:13.520
museum monsters of the midway

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:17.040
saw the museum in midway airport

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.000
of what uh i just saw uh airplanes in

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.359
the midway airport and it said something

00:36:21.359 --> 00:36:22.640
about a battle so i i've

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.240
i'm so wait wait do you think the battle

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.160
midway took place in chicago

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.960
that's what i'm referring to you think

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.800
there was an air battle between us and

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.680
the japanese over the skies of chicago

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.119
i don't know i didn't really dwell on

00:36:35.119 --> 00:36:36.560
the actual exhibit i just saw an

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.680
airplane i was like damn they had a

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.280
battle here this is [ __ ] insane

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.839
that's so sick that's amazing matt

00:36:41.839 --> 00:36:43.520
literally like look at a piece

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:45.520
look at something like that be like i

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:46.880
have the information from that

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.480
i'm gonna keep it moving i'm gonna hold

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.160
on to that

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.599
that's how i was so what where did they

00:36:51.599 --> 00:36:54.000
fight that no midway's in between

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.760
asia and north america in the in the

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.960
middle of the pacific that's why it's

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:57.839
called midway

00:36:57.839 --> 00:36:59.839
oh so they named that after midway

00:36:59.839 --> 00:37:00.960
airport after

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.920
that perhaps but they also chicago i

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.440
think is called something about midway

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.720
because i think

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.320
the chicago bears defense was called the

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.400
monsters of the midway so

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.920
chicago being called midway would make

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.920
some sense damn so they

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.160
they just took the midway war stuff and

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.839
we're like oh midway airport

00:37:17.839 --> 00:37:19.200
check this out there's like an exhibit

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.880
in the midway airport about midway war

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.000
stuff and i was like

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.440
maybe this place was like a naval base

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.880
yeah or like an air force base or

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:25.520
something

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.960
that makes sense before it became a

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.839
southwest hub

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:34.560
or became a delta you know

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:38.000
premium lounge um

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.920
but no there was a part where these so

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.680
that we were [ __ ] bombing their

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.880
aircraft carriers because that was a

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.160
goal you had to [ __ ] up the other ones

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.119
aircraft carriers yeah

00:37:45.119 --> 00:37:46.800
and we were [ __ ] up we sucked we

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.400
weren't getting any of them and then

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.839
finally our dive bombers came out of

00:37:49.839 --> 00:37:52.000
nowhere and the japanese were like

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.280
oh [ __ ] we're in trouble now and we

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.800
[ __ ] them up we absolutely destroyed

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.320
them but one of the pilots said like

00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.760
there was so much revenge

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.760
in the american pilots like that they

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.040
were like crying

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.520
out of how much they hated who they were

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.720
bombing

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.800
damn they were like this is for the

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.040
arizona that was a ship that got

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.560
destroyed at pearl harbor like they

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.320
hated them that much like the dudes dr

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.720
the dive bombers had tears running down

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.520
their eyes

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.880
from how much they hated the japanese

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.760
that they were bombing yeah yeah it

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.119
wasn't like oh man

00:38:25.119 --> 00:38:27.680
you know those guys down there huh

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:28.320
what's that

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.680
then you just get cancelled by your

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.400
granddaughter yeah yeah

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.079
yeah there wasn't like this level of

00:38:34.079 --> 00:38:36.560
like man those are guys down there doing

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.240
their job i'm just doing mine no it was

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.359
literally like

00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:41.119
tears streaming like holding a thing

00:38:41.119 --> 00:38:43.440
like [ __ ] this is for what you

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.880
did

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.200
pretty sick got me fired up dude pearl

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.400
harvey's [ __ ]

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.359
buzz right there what oh i'll probably

00:38:51.359 --> 00:38:53.440
never feel anything that great

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.960
like hating someone and then killing

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.640
them no that really

00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:00.079
yeah flying a [ __ ] dive bomber over a

00:39:00.079 --> 00:39:01.200
aircraft carrier

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.400
straight out of the sky and hitting it

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:04.800
and

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.320
seeing it because those things just

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.920
fully exploded

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.920
people they were dumb they had wooden

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.839
decks aircraft carriers back then had

00:39:11.839 --> 00:39:13.119
wooden decks

00:39:13.119 --> 00:39:16.000
and just covered in fuel from loading

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:16.960
planes and [ __ ]

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.040
jesus so they'd get hit with like one

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.680
bomb and everyone would die

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.560
like 700 people would be on the ship two

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.560
of my uncles lost their their fingertips

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:29.440
on aircraft carriers they're in the navy

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.599
what like the 80s yeah just like they

00:39:31.599 --> 00:39:33.280

seven years time

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:35.920
right in peace time yeah right around

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.520
the 70s it was peace time

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.880

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.640
both of them have they like on aircraft

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.240

00:39:43.599 --> 00:39:45.680
different aircraft carriers i think yeah

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.440

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.520
mccusker

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.119
they need to send out a task force to

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.920
just getting an asian accent out of a

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:26.640

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:41.679
the build-up to the debate we need to

01:12:41.679 --> 01:12:42.960
get hyped

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:44.800
but we should probably not record it

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.719
because i'm probably gonna say some very

01:12:46.719 --> 01:12:50.000
pro-trump things in this

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.159
i've said it on stage a couple times i'm

01:12:52.159 --> 01:12:54.080
literally a six pack away from

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:56.640
liking donald trump makes sense and on

01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.760
game day it's game day right now

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.440
get a little tailgate i tried to explain

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.880
that to my mother-in-law because they

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.480
were just they were discouraged to hear

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.080
that my parents rocked like the trump

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:06.560
flag

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.400
outside their house and so my

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.920
mother-in-law who's black heard that was

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:11.520
like kind of bummed and i tried to tell

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.040
her i'm like dude if you were a 60 year

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.800
old white dude you'd love trump too

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:16.080
and she just looked at me like nah and

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:18.560
i'm like you just would

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:19.920
if you're a six-year-old white dude who

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.679
wasn't born like rich

01:13:21.679 --> 01:13:23.760
you automatically love trump it's not

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.199
their fault

01:13:25.199 --> 01:13:26.719

01:13:26.719 --> 01:13:28.719

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.360
true it's about all the stuff i talked

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:41.440
about before about how uh social media

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:42.719
companies can like

01:13:42.719 --> 01:13:44.080
take your information take your

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:46.080
interests pull you in with people

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.400
like your same age demographics who also

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.600
look at the same kinds of things and

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:50.960
then predict your behavior

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.320
to the point where they can put the

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.480
right ads up before like if you're like

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:56.159
doing certain things online looking at

01:13:56.159 --> 01:13:57.520
certain stuff over the course of time

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.880
they're like oh typically when he's in

01:13:58.880 --> 01:13:59.600
this pattern

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.400
he buys this thing at this time and then

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:03.520
they sell the

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.440
which ad pops up on your screen based on

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.640
your previous behavior

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:07.840
and then try to nudge you into the

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:09.280
behavior of buying and they sell that

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:10.320
little time slot

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.480
but dude the boomers got crushed by like

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:14.239
online advertisements we talked about it

01:14:14.239 --> 01:14:15.440
before how they have like

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.320

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.080

butter falcon last you see the peanut

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.520
butter falcons give her [ __ ]

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:39.440
[ __ ] rules dude dude how about that

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:41.520
dude how about that plotline dude

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:43.360
of just like dumping a [ __ ] guy in a

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:45.440
nursing home that was [ __ ] dark i was

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:47.360
watching that like

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.520
you can hear that and he's jacked and he

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:50.800
breaks out

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.320
dude they kept talking about how strong

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.159
he watched this the peanut butter

01:16:54.159 --> 01:16:55.280
fountain oh it's awesome

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:58.800
they play heavily in [ __ ] tropes

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:03.760
of being like dude you're strong as [ __ ]

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:05.600
true and i've seen guys with like down

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:08.800
syndrome like in boxing and

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:11.520
they're not that strong actually really

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:12.159
uh

01:17:12.159 --> 01:17:14.960
well i bet i imagine it depends on how

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.640
severe

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:20.080
diseases that guy i've seen some

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:22.880
that were pretty gnarly if you're only

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.159
mildly [ __ ]

01:17:24.159 --> 01:17:26.000
i think if you're mildly i think if

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.760
you're mildly you can be jacked

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.360
but i think when it gets very severe

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.360
you're just it's very you know well that

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:32.159
guy

01:17:32.159 --> 01:17:33.920
there's a point where you start getting

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:35.199
more strong again

01:17:35.199 --> 01:17:36.960
like if you're like the most [ __ ]

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:39.920
guy ever yeah

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:42.880
do you think it works like if somebody's

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.400
more [ __ ] than you you feel your

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:46.080
strength decline and you're like

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:47.920
huh there's a highlander in the midst

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:49.760
yeah yeah they they automatically switch

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:52.560
order in the line

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:57.199
guys this is crap dude you open matt

01:17:57.199 --> 01:17:58.239
what you opened with
