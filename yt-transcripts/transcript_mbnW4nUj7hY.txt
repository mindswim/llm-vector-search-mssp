Desperado Rough Rider no you don't want

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.619
NADA nobody would have predicted that I

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.580
and Dr fauci would be so prominent in

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.060
you know really kind of evil theories

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.039
about you know did we create the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.660
pandemic are we trying to profit from

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.759
her I hope it goes away I hope it

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.520
doesn't hold back your mask wearing or

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.040
seeking out vaccines

[Music]

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.000
because there were a lot of thoughts and

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.619
prayers headed your way a lot of T's and

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.240
peas I felt them could you feel the peas

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.759
oh yeah don't feel the t's definitely

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.579
felt the T felt the peas more sure I

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.100
mean they're pretty similar now you

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.720
you've had some theories going this is

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.180
your first bout with the vet hopefully

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.220
my last hopefully your final because it

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.659
is not a laughing matter

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.360
it sucked it stunk I mean it was pretty

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.979
funny the fact that I got tagged I was

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.840
like were you like were you laying there

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.899
like I wish I took the vaccine no I

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.799
didn't know although I did uh

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.140
I could see the first night that I got

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.299
it like because I got that I couldn't

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.560
really breathe I couldn't take a full

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.320
breath for like four days so I was like

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.399
I could see how people go to the

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.200
hospital from this [ __ ] for sure because

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.939
it was the only thing kept me doing it

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.119
was just my Foolish Pride

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.220
Bros

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.239
I'll die before I go to the hospital

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.099
with him you'd be gay wait weren't we

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.780
just saying that on stage yes we were

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.459
just laughing about it dude dude I was

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.959
at healing and we were like yo if you go

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.120
to the hospital you're [ __ ] gay Matt

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.920
was laying in bed like I should go to

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.420
the hospital I was laying in bed being

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.160
like I can't get a full breath I can't

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.260
go to the hospital luckily I taught

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.879
myself how to belly breathe not too long

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.739
ago so that's the only that that kind of

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.300
that saved your life that eases the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.640
lungs several I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.019
cutting up please this is your ordeal

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.280
but I have a lot of questions yeah

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.900
because you I don't mean to put you on

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.300
the spot now go ahead but you have a lot

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.580
of you have a lot of medical theories of

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.080
your own they did you put any to

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.940
practice

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.599
um

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.099
I mean I tested the power of prayer

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.140
obviously it worked power prayer did get

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.120
you power prayer [ __ ] works but the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.800
kind of well hey dude so what happened

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.480
was I said to several our fathers for

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.800
you and one Hail Mary did you really

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.060
think the Hail Mary is probably Hail

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.440
Mary carried me through Hail Mary is

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.540
what you pray in times of desperation oh

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.060
yeah that's the Hail Mary no I was uh

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.040
the thing that I so here's this is a

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.800
good test I the night I started feeling

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.040
really shitty I took a like a

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.900
ridiculously scorching bath yes you

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.280
would have had that theory I have a

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.440
thermometer too yeah so I like I filled

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.480
it up to 105. let it cool a little bit

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.459
so I probably stepped in like a 104 103

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.300
bath

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.260
dude I skyrocketed my fever I was so

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.180
[ __ ] up so I was already feverish and

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.680
I was like let me I'm gonna I'm gonna

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.900
break this fever down right now be done

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.519
with this whole mess so just for the

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.220
list so for the listener if you do feel

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.140
like you have code or early on says

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.319
maybe a hot bath dude doesn't help dude

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.780
I spiked my fever got out of bed I was

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.700

fee I haven't had a fever in forever and

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.840

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.800
inflame your brain tissue

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.139
because I dude I had to [ __ ] I had a

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.020

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.500
was the one thing thank God I was able

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.120
to do being like

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.940
that I I didn't freak out I just like I

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.500
just have to go with this and time will

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.540
kind of take this away so I would let

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.040
you and I start ramping myself up like

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.600
but if I can't breathe What If Britney

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.759
gets what she did by the way I'm like

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.680
we're going back and forth and then I

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.639
would just go

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:03.960
hey dude what's going to happen is

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.460
what's going to happen and dude I would

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.199
feel all the tension leave my body and I

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.820
would just lay there and just be like

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.360
well I'll just chill yeah if I if I get

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.340

the one you got oh dude it was bad now

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.000
what you should do is what I do which is

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.100
take vitamin D I take supplements I took

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.380
vitamin D you're obviously not taking it

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.880
dude so you gotta see the brain

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.080
inflammation probably came from your

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.860
lack of vitamin D so what I do Matt Matt

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.780

was on the road just that was another

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:44.819
thing too and I would stand up my brain

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:46.979
I could feel my pulse in my brain and it

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:49.080
would go and like I would kind of like

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.580
go in and out of it like I'd feel myself

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.199
kind of going offline a little bit not

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:54.060

light-headed in little like waves of

00:07:59.099 --> 00:08:01.160

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.900
until after like three days isn't that

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:13.919
weird that's because they need us to

00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:16.020
work again yeah as soon as the Democrats

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.400
are responsible for the economy they're

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.319
like actually you don't have to stay in

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:21.599
bed for 10 days yeah well my thing my

00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:23.520
thing with this is like all right so

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.460
we you know you're able to isolate this

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.039
Spike protein to make the you know

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:31.199
um vaccine or Gene some people call it

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:34.080
gene therapy whatever you can make it

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.120
you can isolate the thing to make a

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.399
vaccine your name you're like oh this

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:41.159
one's Omicron this one's [ __ ] Delta

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.740

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.660
the window of transmissibility is after

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.240

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.139
that's all and I just laid there I

00:14:22.139 --> 00:14:23.459

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.579
about star and I was like I didn't know

00:14:26.579 --> 00:14:28.500
people knew this much about this the

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.940
whole time of back and forth it's being

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.740
like out there that guy's all [ __ ]

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.660

awesome it was just gonna be like well

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.920
you know they could derive tests from a

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.360
sweet potato and they're like do you

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.680
think they could drive tests from pig

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.579
pig cholesterol I was like

00:14:46.579 --> 00:14:49.260
I was like there's a whole sector of

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.820
just male bonding I'm missing out on

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.500
dude yeah being jacked and taking roids

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.579

00:14:53.579 --> 00:14:55.440
guy's on [ __ ] gear or just knowing

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.839

this documentary in the smashing machine

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.380

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.660
the Early Pride days two wrestlers who

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.779

got a little Flair to him a little

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.339
attitude Mark the hammer just

00:15:32.339 --> 00:15:34.860

beating like Captain Crunch by himself

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.199
me like this is what it's all about just

00:16:58.199 --> 00:17:00.420
dude you know truthfully that kind of is

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.699
what it's all about it is dude it is get

00:17:02.699 --> 00:17:04.319
sitting down and rewarding yourself with

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:06.539

that's Champion stuff Mark the hammer

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.419
dude it's so funny yeah because he it

00:17:15.419 --> 00:17:16.980
was there was nothing glamorous about

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.319
his life he would just go take fights

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:21.419
get the [ __ ] kicked out of him sometimes

00:17:21.419 --> 00:17:23.280
he would win and like he would just come

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.020
home and just munch [ __ ] he would go

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.939
get like five G's in Tokyo and just come

00:17:26.939 --> 00:17:29.400
home and Munch cereal and just be like I

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.460
did it dude I'm the best the roids must

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.500
feel good I will I think the one we're

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.500
talking about is marker marker smashing

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.000
machine Mark Coleman kind of had his

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.679
head on a bit more straight but he was

00:17:40.679 --> 00:17:42.600
also crazy yeah smashing machine was

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.280
like shooting up [ __ ] like

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.620
painkillers his name his nickname was

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.600
the smashing machine yeah he was pretty

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.760
nasty too all they did was single leg

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.140
take down and then they would just get

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.120
on top of you and just start bulldogging

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.100
and killing you it was before like Jiu

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.020
Jitsu and [ __ ] was really that big so

00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.280
yeah and it's funny watching them

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.080
because they they stay in as the UFC

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.280
comes up and they're just old school

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.900
dude they're old dogs yeah like fighting

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.039
against the guys that knew how to fight

00:18:05.039 --> 00:18:06.539
yeah and then you watch them fight and

00:18:06.539 --> 00:18:07.919
do they beat the [ __ ] out of that

00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:09.360
happens to dudes and it's sad to watch

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.400
it's tough but Coleman holds it down he

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.780
got some he got some belts that was like

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.380
watching uh Iceman Chuck Liddell yeah

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.000
they tossed him in the ring with Rampage

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.160
and it was like Chuck's just an old

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.340
tough guy that's like Rampage just he

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.799
murdered him yeah oh yeah he's a

00:18:25.799 --> 00:18:28.080
stronger blacker tough guy this is gonna

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.480
be bad he's gonna wail on this one

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.400
though like chocolate knows don't

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.500
obviously jungle is tough yeah but like

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.780
he was like what white guys thought was

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.860
tough in like the early 2000s

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:43.160
it was like a mohawk like

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.780
he ran into one Jack black dude that

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.299
would howl

00:18:47.299 --> 00:18:50.100
that's terrifying it was sad watching

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.419
these guys get older and they were like

00:18:51.419 --> 00:18:52.799
this is all I can do and they'd have to

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:54.600
go take flights and just get like way

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.039
more brain damage they get knocked out

00:18:56.039 --> 00:18:58.500
at like a Convention Center like a

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.179
community college oh yeah dude no they

00:19:00.179 --> 00:19:01.799
were doing they were on like UFC and

00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:03.360

a Russian guy I think he was Russian or

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.860
like Ukrainian Igor vo chance I think I

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.000

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.520
like Izod button-up eyes his gear was so

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.260
[ __ ] sick yeah I like the European

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.600

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.039
the Eastern European he was nasty as

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.679
team that bust open one of the teams he

00:19:31.679 --> 00:19:32.640

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.620
doing some real team stuff oh yeah

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.140
Eastern European Special Forces Jesus

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.400
Christ they were probably committing

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.340
some serious atrocities

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.160

this that entire shopping center is

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.500
filled with nothing but [ __ ] water

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.440
heads every dude that every [ __ ]

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.539
person that worked there was a simpleton

00:20:30.539 --> 00:20:33.179

the only ones within there's no tables

00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:50.159
no one's even outside yeah so we're

00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:51.299
sitting out there for like 10 minutes

00:20:51.299 --> 00:20:53.340

realize that no one else knows what the

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.960
[ __ ] you're talking about so you're like

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.339
you know the Will Smith book back when

00:39:14.339 --> 00:39:16.619

the internet is great that was fun

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.820
you're getting hit with sports questions

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:35.400

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.800
would win this or that thing it's like

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.180
that was them being they asked us who

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:41.460
would win a polar bear a great white and

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:43.020
you and me were both a great white but

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:44.820
then they just talked for Bears they

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.079
talked about bears for like five years

00:39:46.079 --> 00:39:47.460
that's a great way bro yeah you boys

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.079
love bears you want to talk Bears you

00:39:49.079 --> 00:39:50.280
guys want to talk and I get it I like

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.560
Bears I side with the the grizzly versus

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.599
the silverback gorilla and a lot of

00:39:54.599 --> 00:39:56.040
people disagree with me

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.680
yeah I like a big Grizzly that's pretty

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.960
that's fair bigger do you go with versus

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.180
Silverback yeah Silverback apparently is

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:06.119
the Smart answer is it really I only got

00:40:06.119 --> 00:40:08.760
the thumbs but those big Grizzly paws

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.160
yeah it's true wow that's a tough that's

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.540
a tough one this is a tough one it's a

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:13.740
tough call that's way harder than

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.540
[ __ ] polar bear shark

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.520
yeah that's to actually take some

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.500
thinking I did a shark would just Ram a

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.359
[ __ ] pull him around underwater polar

00:40:21.359 --> 00:40:23.819
bears are slow swimmers I don't think

00:40:23.819 --> 00:40:25.200
they are no they're not as fast as a

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.819
shark compared obviously not as fast as

00:40:26.819 --> 00:40:28.500
a shark that's what I'm saying they

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.420
didn't talk about the width of the pool

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.520
that's what they didn't include it was

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.560
what eight feet deep is seven feet deep

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.960
seven feet dude a shark's on a [ __ ]

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.119
smash that actually probably doesn't

00:40:39.119 --> 00:40:41.099
hurt the shark

00:40:41.099 --> 00:40:42.780
there's nowhere for the polar bear to

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:44.640
move out of the way really he's getting

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:48.240
it's there's polar bear polar bear can't

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.520
yeah it can only it can tread water or

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.020
Swim and a shark's gonna swim circles

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:55.500
around it literally dude yeah damn it so

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:56.940

five boxes down the steps I want to take

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.780

being able to breathe stinks but luckily

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:31.440
I have plenty of experience with panic

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.859
attacks so like I'm ahead I was like I

00:52:34.859 --> 00:52:36.540
could distinguish between what was panic

00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:38.220
and what was genuine sickness I had

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:39.599
something I had something that when I

00:52:39.599 --> 00:52:40.920
was coming in and out of that Starbucks

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:43.859
after the Cheesecake Factory I had an

00:52:43.859 --> 00:52:46.079
intense tightness to my chest did you

00:52:46.079 --> 00:52:47.700
really and I had it from before from the

00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:48.780
tarmac

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:51.900
's in there I had an intense like I

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:53.520
think something's bad it's stressed dude

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.460
stress will kill you bro chest tightness

00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:58.680
stress will [ __ ] kill you yeah it's

00:52:58.680 --> 00:52:59.880
that's the

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:02.099
number one quest of learning how to just

00:53:02.099 --> 00:53:03.540
kind of ebb and flow with these kind of

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:04.920
things without stressing yourself into

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.319
Oblivion because dude it's so easy you

00:53:07.319 --> 00:53:08.880
can fully let it all go and it like

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.740
everything just works out itself there's

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:13.559
no need to be like I think every time

00:53:13.559 --> 00:53:15.059
like something doesn't go my way I'll

00:53:15.059 --> 00:53:16.500
just go

00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:18.960

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.460
bag or anything something like that oh

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:21.839

too late true

01:03:49.619 --> 01:03:51.240

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.440

then on Saturdays Fridays and Saturdays

01:04:12.059 --> 01:04:13.680

so that I could be one of the few

01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:27.900
salesmen that gets off on Saturday which

01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:30.240

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.420
