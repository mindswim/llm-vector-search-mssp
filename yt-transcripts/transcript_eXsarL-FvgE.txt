00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.240
but the book no i might have read the

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.759
book twice through at this point the

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:23.280
reason that's missing pages is because

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.039
what i would do is go to equinox and i

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:26.720
would go to the steam room and i would

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.919
want to read the book in the steam room

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:29.039
so i would tear it because i don't want

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:31.039
to ruin the book so i would tear the

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:33.039
pages out of the book and go to the

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:34.880
steam room with the pages that i

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.080
wouldn't care about getting wet in the

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.840
steam room so if you go through this

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.960
book you're like holy [ __ ] there's a

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.800
bunch of pages missing but that's why

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.919
good thing you didn't bring that book

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:43.120
into the steamer if you bring that book

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.919
into the gym locker room that's a signal

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:47.520
that's it that's like tapping your foot

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.120
under the stall

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.759
yeah now fun fact costco i don't i'm

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:53.599
pretty sure this is true this book is

00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:55.840
not allowed in prisons

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.160
yeah that is also sorry contraband

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.440
because it uh inspires prisoners to like

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.000
start uprisings or like joint like start

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.319
gangs and [ __ ] it empowers prisoners so

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.599
they took yes they took it out of

00:08:07.599 --> 00:08:09.599
prisons yeah they don't they do not want

00:08:09.599 --> 00:08:12.800
prisoners to be empowered

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.160
yeah they don't want them to know about

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.599
power

00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:17.440
yeah you got to give them like [ __ ]

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.960
just all just all books that are going

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.400
to make them not aggressive it's not

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.919
even about like you forget aggressive

00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:23.360
it's like it's about what to do with

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.280
that aggression you know because if you

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.879
you take this book you could apply it to

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:28.720
anything mccusker watch you'll say we're

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.520
going to go over these laws right now

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.879
let me get right to anything you can

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:33.039
pick any industry and i feel bad because

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.240
you're going to miss the first 24 of

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.360
these laws i almost wish we would have

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.560
started from the beginning with you but

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.580
you know i could probably guess them

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.650
[Laughter]

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:52.540
[Laughter]

00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:54.720
on i know this stuff come on i know it

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.080
no like the back of my hand before

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.760
number 13 quitters never women you know

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.279
these i dude everything's negotiation

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:03.040
um okay so shannon where are we at we're

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.640
at low number 25. ladies and gentlemen

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.399
without further ado it's the 48 loss of

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:10.480
white power law 25 never tear pages out

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.399
of this book

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:14.440
25

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.360
re-create yourself do not accept the

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.320
roles that society foists on you

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.160
recreate yourself by forging a new

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.560
identity one that commands attention and

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.200
never bores the audience be the master

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.800
of your own image rather than letting

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.360
others define it for you

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.360
incorporate dramatic devices into your

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.600
public gestures and actions your power

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.000
will be enhanced and your character will

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.440
seem larger

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.200
than life

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.839

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.410
right there it's a powerful dude

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:58.320
[Laughter]

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.240
yeah man that's a good one

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.399

classic madonna

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.240

that was in the past six months that is

00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:26.399
actually true i should say shannon

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:28.240
recreated herself as a [ __ ] hottie

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.279
because shannon was getting to be a

00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:31.279
little bit of a fatty for a little while

00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:32.880
and then she recreated herself and then

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.480
everyone was like holy [ __ ] this [ __ ]

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.600

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.680
a good way yeah yeah it's not it's

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.519
pretty healthy i'd say probably like

00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:55.120
once a day and it's it's like how it

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.120
should be i feel like

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.680
you're fired

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.839
and by how it should be i mean smells

00:13:01.839 --> 00:13:04.560
like roses and is glitter

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.959
yeah

00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:08.720
it's actually it's actually liquid that

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.680
comes out of your vagina

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.399
that's kind of funny

00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:16.800
shannon would you uh

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.440

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.399
kids in high school that were this is a

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:55.839
sign of power and height like high

00:13:55.839 --> 00:13:57.199
school power

00:13:57.199 --> 00:13:59.440

some confidence that kid is you know

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.920
my friend james saccone would just

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.120
[ __ ] let him rip he'd be in the

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.320
hallway and he'd be some cute chick and

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.760
he'd be like hey what's up and you'd

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.519
fart at her and she'd giggle and he'd

00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:13.680
laugh and he'd [ __ ] and i'm like

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.920
that's like that's like crazy to me that

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.920
was a crazy [ __ ] thing for him to do

all right hold on that sentence i'm

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.439
going to need a couple minutes to break

00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:20.880
down

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.199
paragon paragon sports that's a place to

sell sneakers

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.720

civility civilized efficiency i know

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.200
what that means paragon is the word

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.799
that's a problem in that sentence for me

00:17:32.799 --> 00:17:35.120
shannon a paragon that's like a shining

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.720

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.360
of civility and a this is a hard one for

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.240
me

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.679
this is a hard one for me i am not

00:17:51.679 --> 00:17:53.440
civilized or efficient those are two

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.919
things that people would not describe bs

00:17:55.919 --> 00:17:57.760
your hands are never soiled by mistakes

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.320
and nasty deeds maintain such a spotless

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.320
appearance by using others as scapegoats

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.240
and cats pause to disguise your

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.799
involvement

00:18:06.799 --> 00:18:08.160
this is great

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.679
this is a great law so here's the thing

00:18:09.679 --> 00:18:11.760
i apply this one all the time okay

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.720
so

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.160
where shannon remember the other law

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.600
where i take credit for the things you

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.240
do yes

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.919
it's also this is like the opposite end

00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:22.000
of that law

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.679
where it's like when things get [ __ ]

00:18:23.679 --> 00:18:25.919
up i'm like stop me that's where blame

00:18:25.919 --> 00:18:27.679
shannon came from william shannon is

00:18:27.679 --> 00:18:29.600
actually we have a segment on the show a

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.240
drop on this show which highlights this

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.760
law

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.080
the blame shannon law

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.880
how long did i write it in the book

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.080
the blame shannon law

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.150
yeah you want to seem

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:45.840
[Music]

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.200
you want to seem like you have your [ __ ]

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.640
together at all times

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.720
simple as that you want to seem like

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.160
you're [ __ ] and this is this is what

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.600
happens it's it's

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.679
we watch this happen in society right

00:18:55.679 --> 00:18:58.400
because everyone only posts

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.919
all the good [ __ ] they have going on

00:18:59.919 --> 00:19:01.360
everything on social media it's all the

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.880
[ __ ] awards they have it's all the

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.880
[ __ ] great meals that they're cooking

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.320
the dates they're going on the cool

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.600
[ __ ] places they're visiting

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.520
that right there

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.640
is

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.280
just sort of symbolic of how the

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.679
instinct work human instinct works

00:19:17.679 --> 00:19:19.440
we want to show

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.760
that we have [ __ ] going on and then to

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.600
be honest with you it's a reason why

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.440
people are [ __ ] more depressed now

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.799
because it seems like everyone has their

00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:28.480
[ __ ] together and then when you're alone

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.760
by yourself you're like [ __ ] dude i've

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.000
got nothing together and everyone else

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.440
has a [ __ ] together but it's all just

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.280
[ __ ] everyone is just applying the

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.400

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.640
all my mistakes

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.640
it's not very powerful no it's the most

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.240
powerful thing you can do

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.280

what do you mean

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.640
just the way like daffy duck would just

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.880
be bold like that that to me sounds like

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.320
the way daffy would just [ __ ]

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.880
everyone all the time but that's kind of

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.039
you you have your opinion before you

00:27:55.039 --> 00:27:57.120
know it and then you stick to it i work

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.640
it out backwards usually what i'll do is

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.559
i will make a statement and then i will

00:28:00.559 --> 00:28:01.840
say all right i'm going to defend that

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.760
statement to the death and then i will

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.840
work it backwards and hopefully logic

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.000
will connect along the way a lot of the

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
times it doesn't but then when they call

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.520
you on it you just [ __ ] threaten to

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.279
fight them yeah by then you're so mad

00:28:13.279 --> 00:28:14.640
that it doesn't matter who's wrong and

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.840
who's right yeah dude you just pound

then you eventually just hit the buzzer

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.640
and let him in and hope that he doesn't

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.640
hurt everybody in your building

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.960
that's just the way new york works

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.240
real that's our real estate agents get

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.600
in they just buzz everybody every

00:31:36.399 --> 00:31:38.080
i had a great scam to do i was like you

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.240
can uh

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.600
you can just go put up like fake

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.679
craigslist ads for apartments like he's

00:31:43.679 --> 00:31:44.880
gonna find oh you just find an apartment

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.279
that's like uh listed right like going

00:31:47.279 --> 00:31:48.960
craigslist mine department louis did is

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.039
get into that building and then set up

00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:52.799
your own ad and have somebody show up

00:31:52.799 --> 00:31:53.840
and have them put a deposit in the

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:55.679
apartment and just [ __ ] dip out i

00:31:55.679 --> 00:31:57.200
think people do that for real honestly i

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.000
know well number 29.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
that's not a bad idea though to see the

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.519
place not leave

00:32:03.519 --> 00:32:04.480
and then you're in how would you get

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.760
back in the park oh you need the keys or

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.360
do you like hiding in the usually the

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.120
the not usually a lot of the time the

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.919
apartments uh doors are open

00:32:11.919 --> 00:32:13.440
so real estate agents they can't [ __ ]

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.960
get keys from her it's a pain in the ass

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.120
so they get in the front door the actual

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.120
empty apartment is open

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.240
um so you gotta get to the front door

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.679
i know that i heard somebody do this

00:32:23.679 --> 00:32:25.679
before but i made this scam up because i

00:32:25.679 --> 00:32:27.600
used to sell real estate

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.799
and i remember thinking about it i was

00:32:28.799 --> 00:32:30.080
like the amount of deposit they take

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.679
like 500 cash from so many people

00:32:31.679 --> 00:32:33.360
because they want the apartment

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.519
and that's that you just disappear they

00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:37.679
have no idea who you [ __ ] are

00:32:37.679 --> 00:32:40.159
so that's a good idea yeah i'm not bad

00:32:40.159 --> 00:32:42.880
lord over 29 shannon and the point i was

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.240
making was you want a man to be a little

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.919
bit more aggressive than be a [ __ ] okay

00:32:45.919 --> 00:32:47.840
maybe i was speaking a little bit crazy

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.799
yes i agree with that

00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:53.440
uh law number 29

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.640
plan all the way to the end

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.120
the ending is everything plan all the

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.519
way to it take into account all the

00:33:01.519 --> 00:33:03.760
possible consequences obstacles and

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.440
twists of fortune that might reverse

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.120
your hard work and give

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.640

need her to kind of speed it up

00:34:03.919 --> 00:34:07.200
but i remember when when i just when my

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.079
son was born i remember i said

00:34:10.079 --> 00:34:12.399
i was like i i want to by the time my

00:34:12.399 --> 00:34:14.480
son has like memories which i sort of

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.960
mentally set at the age of four i was

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.399
like four years old when i started

00:34:18.399 --> 00:34:20.720
really having memories like i remember

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.079
things that happened when i was four not

00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:23.520
everything but i i could sort of

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.320
remember back then yeah

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.240
yeah exactly and i remember just sort of

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.440
saying to myself i was like by the time

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:34.399
my son is four years old i want to be

00:34:34.399 --> 00:34:36.320
somewhat successful i want to be i want

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.280
to have a certain amount of money in the

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.720
bank i want to have a certain amount of

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.079
things going on i have a nice apartment

00:34:40.079 --> 00:34:41.200
i want to have

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.720
you know and

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:43.760
it's

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.399
you know my son was four and this goal

00:34:46.399 --> 00:34:48.000
you know obviously i hit it like you

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.720
know it but it was

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.720
the point of it is it was like i was

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.119
completely in control of that

00:34:55.119 --> 00:34:56.960
that that it wasn't it was sort of

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.400
arbitrary like i just said oh by the

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.400
time he's four what if it was three that

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.920
i thought the memories were you know i'm

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.520
saying what if it was five

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.000
it was a completely within my control i

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
decided that so

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.160
i the lesson that i took from that it's

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.320
just like yeah i can i have complete

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.160
control of all these things these goals

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.480
are within our control with it at least

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.000
something like that it wasn't anything i

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.200
didn't say i wanted a [ __ ] billion

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.280
dollars but even goals like that are

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.040
within our control you know i'm saying

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.200
they are just steps there is just a path

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:28.400
there and i sort of look at that example

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.640
and it encouraged me it annoys me

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.920
because i go [ __ ] i should have really

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.320
just moved that goal post way further i

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.760
should have just i should have wanted

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.560
more or made it a bigger goal um and i

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.079
but also i learned from it because now

00:35:40.079 --> 00:35:42.160
i'm applying that and i'm going like no

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.480
no i have to be very specific i have if

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.040
i have if i have a very specific goal

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.160
i need to

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.320
i mean i'm don't as specific as possible

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.760
you know i'm saying the [ __ ] day that

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.520
you want to get it go through the beats

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.200
go for the past visualize all that [ __ ]

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.440
it sounds so stupid all that [ __ ] is

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.440
[ __ ] dumb i know

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.280
until you believe it and then you start

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.720
putting one foot in front of the other

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.400
because you're [ __ ] motivated and

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.480
you're the best version of you right so

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.000
it's only dumb if you don't believe it

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.320
right it's only dumb if you

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.160
go oh yeah it's [ __ ] stupid uh the

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.480
only only a [ __ ] guy who works at 18

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.560
t would [ __ ] yeah that you're right

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.079
it probably [ __ ] like that won't work

00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:20.320
for you but then you go oh no i can set

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.400
a goal something very specific and then

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.599
i can put one foot in from the other the

00:36:23.599 --> 00:36:25.280
other foot then i can see that i can go

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.880
there i can go there and go there and

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.800
you're like holy [ __ ] i just did all

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.320
that because i had the [ __ ] mental

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.240
capacity to do it and i was motivated to

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:34.240
do it so it's just it's whatever it is

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.920
in you it may be a you might have a

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.599
[ __ ] troll dog that you leave on your

00:36:37.599 --> 00:36:38.960
[ __ ] desk that makes you feel like

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.079
you're lucky you might have a lucky

00:36:40.079 --> 00:36:41.359
number and you wear a [ __ ] jersey

00:36:41.359 --> 00:36:42.640
when that you're wearing that number you

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.800
feel like a million bucks whatever it is

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.720
none of this shit's real none of it's

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.920
magic

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.680
it's you it's what's tapping whatever

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.520
taps into your own [ __ ] thing and i

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.240
really do believe that you know the

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.000
whole play it's just goal setting am i

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.280
that's the way that i interpret law 29

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.280
yeah get too [ __ ] i think setting

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.760
goals is great but if everybody blamed

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.680
all their problems on everybody else

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.280
while doing that

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.640
everyone just constantly undermine each

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.760
other so

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.040
set your goals

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.640
this book is like if you make a mistake

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.359
blame it on someone yeah

00:37:15.359 --> 00:37:16.320
i don't think they're saying that

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.280
they're saying

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.720
here's what they're saying that other

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:19.839
law

00:37:19.839 --> 00:37:21.280
they're saying that

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.040
set yourself up to be the person that's

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.240
always right

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.800
because if you're trying to look this it

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.359
sounds stupid right i know but this is

00:37:29.359 --> 00:37:30.960
this [ __ ] game right so let's just

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.880
apply it to one area in life like let's

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.040
just say you're working at a job right

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.359
you have your day job

00:37:37.359 --> 00:37:40.560
yeah apply that you know if you are

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.040
you know a you know if you are

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:45.119
coming to the table with things

00:37:45.119 --> 00:37:46.560
make sure you're constantly setting

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.160
yourself up to be the person that is

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.000
efficient the person that's correct the

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.240
person that has the [ __ ] right ideas

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.000
and if you can figure out a way to when

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.760
the when your ideas aren't the ones that

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.280
are flying

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.560
to where you don't have to take the

00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.520
brunt

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.200
well you're gonna probably get further

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.560
along i don't think that that's a bad

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:03.839
thing i'm not saying that that's not

00:38:03.839 --> 00:38:06.320
blaming other people for your mistakes

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.560
that's just playing a game a certain way

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.240
well you just want scapegoat which is

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.000
directly blaming somebody for your

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.359
mistakes

00:38:13.359 --> 00:38:15.599
um

00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:17.760
they did i am a big fan of goal setting

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.040
though i like that goals if you're not

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.839
setting goals dude you're spinning

00:38:21.839 --> 00:38:23.040
you're bullshitting

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.400
you're running a race without a finish

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.400
line baby with that bro heard that bro

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.599
heard that

00:38:27.599 --> 00:38:29.040
uh all right let's go to the next one

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.320
you're playing yourself you don't say

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.320
goals

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.520
law number 30 make your accomplishments

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.240
seem effortless your actions must seem

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.480
natural and executed with ease all the

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.960
toil and practice that go into them and

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.960
also all the clever tricks must be

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.599
concealed when you act act effortlessly

00:38:49.599 --> 00:38:51.520
as if you could do much more avoid the

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.960
temptation of revealing how hard you

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.440
work it only raises questions teach no

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:58.079
one your tricks or they will be used

00:38:58.079 --> 00:39:01.520
against you um

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.200
yeah i this is one that i have to work

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.800
on um

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.960
i'm a fan of hard work

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.960
i'm proud of working hard

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:12.160
i'm proud of like [ __ ] you know i

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.720
talent in my opinion i don't it's weird

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.720
i don't respect talent

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.240
i wonder why exactly

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.580
chime in cox actually

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.040
[Laughter]

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.440
just who the [ __ ] respects michael

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.839
jordan is all of his natural talent you

00:39:27.839 --> 00:39:29.200
don't respect the [ __ ]

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.440
basketball is a bad bad example because

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.280
i can use mma like i don't like jon

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.440
jones right because he's the most

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.440
[ __ ] talented athlete in the world

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.880
it's just been handed to him and he's

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.240
kind of a dick and he's just sort of

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.200
like

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.560
but then there's guys like michael

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:45.040
bisping who just [ __ ] had to hustle

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:46.960
and work and [ __ ] just bite down on

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.960
his mouthpiece and [ __ ]

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.280
will his way to that title it was it was

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.520
such a crazy journey and guys like that

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.440
are the ones that i've always had so

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.280
much more respect for as like you know

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.480
from like almost like a sports

00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.680
perspective

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.200
um

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.599
so yeah i have a hard time

00:40:03.599 --> 00:40:05.599
like i'm proud if i put a lot of [ __ ]

00:40:05.599 --> 00:40:06.800
work into something i'm proud of that

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.599
but

00:40:07.599 --> 00:40:09.200
that's some basic bad [ __ ] that's what

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.400
they're saying really

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.800
they're like a [ __ ] unpowerful

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.760
insecure [ __ ] who needs to be patted

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.680
on the back for his hard work

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.599
needs to prove it needs to show his work

00:40:19.599 --> 00:40:22.720
constantly whereas the [ __ ] guy who

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.520
is truly powerful and truly [ __ ] a

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:26.880
leader

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.960
it's just like it's a yeah this is

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.760
nothing this is this this is this is

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.760
you know so i get it i just don't apply

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.760
it as much as i should wasn't it funny

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.119
though his whole

00:40:37.119 --> 00:40:39.280
like law is to build like a a weird

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.400
vague cult like following

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.800
could it be argued that his book is a

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.319
weird vague cult like following

00:40:48.319 --> 00:40:50.000
yeah yeah it's just the same as when

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.400
people read like pickup artist books and

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.560
they're kind of seduced by the guy that

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.119
wrote it hmm although lewis you're

00:40:57.119 --> 00:40:58.640
that's actually true louis there's

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.240
studies where they uh

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.319
they study innate talent versus people

00:41:02.319 --> 00:41:03.920
who aren't as innately talent but put in

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.000
the work and the people who put in

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.359
people who put in the work who aren't as

00:41:07.359 --> 00:41:09.680
originally talented tend to do better in

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.839
long like long-term studies

00:41:11.839 --> 00:41:13.839
innate talent only gets you so far yeah

00:41:13.839 --> 00:41:15.920
for the most part for the most part i

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.680
would say i need to study people who are

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.760
like in all areas like mute people that

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.119
nate musical gifts people who didn't

00:41:21.119 --> 00:41:22.319
have it who had to work for it to be

00:41:22.319 --> 00:41:24.160
honest with you i would probably guess

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.599
more often than not people that have

00:41:25.599 --> 00:41:27.280
innate abilities

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:30.000
probably don't explore them um

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.640
as often as people that don't right um

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.359
it's almost like

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.000
i mean yeah like the whatever it is like

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.839
if it comes easy for you it's that's why

00:41:41.839 --> 00:41:43.359
hot chicks don't really need to ever be

00:41:43.359 --> 00:41:44.240
funny

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.680
you know what i'm saying it's like they

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.880
just don't you know hot chicks are

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.020
hilarious

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:51.630
[Laughter]

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.400

00:41:56.319 --> 00:41:58.720
yeah dude i'm just saying it's hilarious

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.319
like yeah it's

00:42:00.319 --> 00:42:02.500
no i know you've ever seen tick-tock

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:06.079
[Laughter]

concentrated likability right laughter

00:43:31.839 --> 00:43:33.599
is concentrated like i believe that's

00:43:33.599 --> 00:43:35.920
why even like even a lot of like people

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.200

it's just sort of like they make you

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.040
laugh and that feeling whatever

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.480
endorphins are released while you're

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.520
laughing

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.200

know that hodge chick has never

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.560
she's just never needed to be a part of

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.800
that interaction because that likability

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.640
it never needed to be concentrated or

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.880
bottled because she's a hot chick and

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.680
everyone likes her immediately so you

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.760
never need it you never need to [ __ ]

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.520

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.079
laws of power dude that would be the

00:44:28.079 --> 00:44:29.920
most powerful thing you can do all right

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.599

00:44:43.599 --> 00:44:45.359
addressing how these apply to the white

00:44:45.359 --> 00:44:46.720
race and how they could further the

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:49.040
white race we should be doing that more

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.800
and i and i don't feel like we've taken

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.480

um all right lord number 32 shannon

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.680
play to people's fantasies

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.680
the truth is often avoided because it's

00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:54.079
ugly and unpleasant never appealed to

00:53:54.079 --> 00:53:56.000
truth and reality unless you are

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.079
prepared to the anger that comes from

00:53:58.079 --> 00:53:59.760
disenchantment

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:01.760
life is so harsh and distressing that

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:03.520
people who can manufacture romance or

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:06.400
conjure up fantasy are like oasis in the

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:11.680

the masses

00:54:21.839 --> 00:54:23.680

um well i think that's the thing i think

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.799
that they were just more honest about

01:08:20.799 --> 01:08:22.799
dicks back then right so i grew up with

01:08:22.799 --> 01:08:24.400
a complex i grew up thinking that i had

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.719
a [ __ ] small deck

01:08:26.719 --> 01:08:28.159

01:08:28.159 --> 01:08:31.600

it is just not

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:44.560
but then what you find out is like oh no

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:46.080
we don't we

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.400
we're only exposed a huge dick our whole

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:51.120
[ __ ] childhood and adolescence we're

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.560
never exposed

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:55.040
to average and small dicks

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.920
so we see porn or we see our friends who

01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.279
have the confidence to pull out their

01:08:59.279 --> 01:09:01.040
huge massive dicks

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.359

complex every [ __ ] time i see a dick

01:09:05.679 --> 01:09:07.520

i show up late a lot to things here's

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:22.880
the thing i think being being late is a

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.560
powerful ass move dude my mom taught me

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:25.920
that very early

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.920
in life she she taught me the phrase

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:30.000
fashionably late

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.280
because she always be running labor [ __ ]

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:32.159
she was like no i'm gonna let him

01:13:32.159 --> 01:13:33.440
fashionably late

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.880
and then i was like oh i kind of get it

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.400
and i do this a lot because there's

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:37.760
something about when you're late to

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:39.840
something and people are waiting for you

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.239
it sends a subconscious psychological

01:13:42.239 --> 01:13:43.280
message

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:45.440
deep into them you're saying i'm the

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:48.159
[ __ ] show [ __ ] whoa zach

01:13:48.159 --> 01:13:49.120
you are

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.040
a psychological message that says i

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.880
don't respect you

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:55.360
holy [ __ ] [ __ ] this is this is mining

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:58.080
zach's exact argument

01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.920
shannon a racist through zach's mind

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.760
somehow

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:04.880
shannon men and black me

01:14:06.719 --> 01:14:08.159
but it's true

01:14:08.159 --> 01:14:10.080
it's subcon and you shouldn't be late

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.600
but you know it doesn't let everyone

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.760
know like hey just so you know time

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.520
starts when i [ __ ] get here i am the

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:17.199
club yeah but there's a difference

01:14:17.199 --> 01:14:18.719
there's like being late just going

01:14:18.719 --> 01:14:21.199
somewhere and being late to a podcast

01:14:21.199 --> 01:14:23.280
that you're doing from your couch

01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:26.080
i am the clock

01:14:26.159 --> 01:14:27.679
one letter off

01:14:27.679 --> 01:14:30.719
he's not late you're just early bro

01:14:30.719 --> 01:14:32.239
yeah stop being such a goody two-shoes

01:14:32.239 --> 01:14:33.679
[ __ ] being all early trying to go

01:14:33.679 --> 01:14:35.679
extra credit that's not powerful

01:14:35.679 --> 01:14:37.120
powerful people don't do extra credit

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:39.120
dude powerful people [ __ ] turning the

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:43.280
paper uh right at the last minute

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:44.800
i don't know zack i don't know how i

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:47.030
feel about that i'm in the middle

01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:48.640
[Laughter]

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:50.159
zach's going all extra credit on me

01:14:50.159 --> 01:14:52.480
right now

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:54.320
um hold on do we have one more luck

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:56.800
shannon

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.560
yep one more this is great but you don't

01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:59.760
need to read the book you could just

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.040
listen to this series and you'll

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:03.440
completely understand the book

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:05.360
it's a better version of it this is like

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:06.640
the audio version look you get the

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:08.000
entire audio version of the book in like

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.520
five five and a half hours

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:11.840
so

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:16.159
okay

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:20.000
oh i just got drunk that was a sip

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.719
disdain things you cannot have

01:15:22.719 --> 01:15:25.440
ignoring them as the best revenge this

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:29.520
is really written by a seven-year-old

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:39.320
it's what happened with me nicole arbour

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:43.360
[ __ ] by acknowledging a penny problem

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:46.000
you give it existence and credibility

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.760
the more attention you pay to an enemy

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.080
the stronger you make him a small

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:52.320
mistake is often made worse and more

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.239
visible when you try to fix it it is

01:15:54.239 --> 01:15:56.480
sometimes best to leave things alone if

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.480
there is something you want but cannot

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:00.640
have show contempt for it the less

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:03.600
interest you reveal the more superior

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:06.840
you see

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:08.880
yeah

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.640

01:16:28.719 --> 01:16:29.600
soul

every person that i know that has had a

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:32.640
comedy central show and development in

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:33.920
the past three years you wanna know the

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:35.520
conversation that they have behind

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:37.520
closed doors yeah they're miserable they

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:39.120

one you know i'm saying like

01:16:44.239 --> 01:16:46.480
that is the tone

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.080
and then every person that i know that

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:49.920
is doing their own [ __ ] and creating

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:51.600
their own podcasts creating their own

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:52.880
youtube channel

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:55.280
all these guys are [ __ ] you know

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:57.360
just loving what they're doing and then

01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:58.800
they're figuring out the path to the

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:00.800
money so it's going to connect right

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.880
it'll eventually it's like guys like tim

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:05.360
dillon um [ __ ] uh

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.199
kyle donegan um

01:17:07.199 --> 01:17:08.480
these guys who are like these really

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:10.239
[ __ ] manchester podcasts obviously but

01:17:10.239 --> 01:17:11.520
these guys that are doing their own

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:14.320
[ __ ] thing putting out content and

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:16.880
they are enjoying it loving it and

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.880
they're connecting the dots and figuring

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.719
out how to get the money and then when

01:17:20.719 --> 01:17:21.920
it's all said and done they're gonna be

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:23.040
their own boss they're gonna have their

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.080
own fan base they're gonna have their

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:25.360
own money they have control of their own

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.920
product that is what it's supposed to be

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:29.760
so it's

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:31.840
this quarantine and this whole [ __ ]

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.360
virus it really sucks for a lot of

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:34.239
people

01:17:34.239 --> 01:17:36.560
you know who doesn't suck for it doesn't

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.239
suck for people that are really

01:17:38.239 --> 01:17:40.080
innovative that are self-starters that

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.480
work for themselves because those people

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.239
are always going to figure out a way to

01:17:44.239 --> 01:17:45.679
to find themselves to figure out a way

01:17:45.679 --> 01:17:49.199
to find that path so you know i this is

01:17:49.199 --> 01:17:50.400
what we're trying to do right now what

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.840
we're trying to do with gas digital you

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.520
know you know

01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:55.600
obviously we can't go do stand-up comedy

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.600
shows but we can [ __ ] create more

01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.520
podcasts we can create this new cartoon

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:02.080
we can [ __ ] try to do various

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:03.520
different things we have we're having

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:06.239
new weekly meetings now with the

01:18:06.239 --> 01:18:08.400
producers on the team just going over

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.480
different unique ideas trying to think

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:12.080
outside of the box doing things that

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:15.040
nobody's ever done before so

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:16.719
simple as that you gotta [ __ ] adapt

01:18:16.719 --> 01:18:19.440
baby boys

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:21.840
i don't even know what that was we were

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:25.280
just talking about distinction

01:18:26.719 --> 01:18:28.640
yeah so

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.560
yeah i mean whatever

01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:32.560
ignoring his best friend whatever

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:33.840

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:35.840
much

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:36.960
i don't really give a [ __ ] about that

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:38.239
law you can scrape that one from the

01:18:38.239 --> 01:18:39.679
book they should have called the 47 laws

01:18:39.679 --> 01:18:41.840
of power

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:44.800
