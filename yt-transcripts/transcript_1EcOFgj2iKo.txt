when like trump was like taking office

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.519
he like went into like the back of like

00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:32.800
the white house like whatever like by

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.399
like the private gardens and like lit up

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:36.640
a blunt and was like smoking a blunt

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.640
like talking about like how like you

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.240
know like what if it's over and all this

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.920
stuff and then told

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.600
my friend because my friend was there i

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.880
got invited

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.320
because they had it was like this whole

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.560
process interview process thing but my

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.680
friend said that um he also said that

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.000
in in like the presidency like what he

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.760
learned in eight years is that he when

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.200
you become the president of the united

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.040
states you get to the middle of the

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.440
government he said so he said there's a

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.680
binder with like 5 000 pages he was like

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.320
i'm privy to 2 500 of them the other

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.600
half of it

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.399
presidents we don't have he said so i'm

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:11.839
literally at mid-level government he

00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:12.880
said so if you want to ask me about

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.240
aliens if you want to ask me about outer

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.600
space if you want to ask me about those

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.600
things i genuinely

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.240
know what the public knows he's like i i

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.480
do not and he said on furthermore he

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.720
said even like public policy and things

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.519
that are happening i say certain things

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:29.519
that i need to say but

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:31.600
i am not in control of everything he

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.000
said these are myths that that like the

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.279
you know has pushed forward and i was

00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:37.920
like wow dude [ __ ] wow yeah that

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.839
makes sense though yeah like if

00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:41.760
if trump had

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.200
knowledge of aliens he would have said

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.480
it right away a hundred percent he

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.920
wouldn't say

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.720
i don't know yeah because yeah then he

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.720
would say i don't know i mean he was

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.160
pushing it for a little bit i thought

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.279
yeah that was like he was like we're

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.880
gonna figure it out as soon as i get in

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.000
there like one of his that kind of got

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.440
me well you know what you might get to

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.600
the bottom of this yeah it might be one

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.800
of those things there is a part of me i

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.160
know this is deep conspiracy stuff but

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.680
there is a part of me that genuinely

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.320
believes that like high high-ranking

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.279
politicians get forced to have a kid or

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:12.720
do something crazy and they have it on

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.480
film and compromise and that's how and

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.320
that's how they keep them because i mean

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.079
how else would it make sense like just

00:12:18.079 --> 00:12:19.519
like if i had all the secrets of the

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:21.120
world and then i was done like why

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.639
wouldn't i just write a book like on my

00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:24.000
deathbed about it like i would just

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.920
spill all the secrets but nobody ever

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.399
does because it must there must be like

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:30.880
insane consequences if you do that oh

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.720
yeah i think epstein created a whole

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.480
workflow they're still doing epstein i

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.839
think biden's gonna put out a coloring

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:37.279
book

00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:38.639
right at the end he's going to draw

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:40.959
something [ __ ] up hilarious yeah

00:12:40.959 --> 00:12:42.720
he just draws he draws like antarctica

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.079
and then just a big swastika on it

00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:48.800
no one knows what this means yeah dude

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.240
oh dude here's the thing with terry

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.880
crews terry crews just said on shower

it was great i mean young hot girls have

00:22:42.159 --> 00:22:44.240
they're just they have no

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.039
sense of danger no dude like they just

00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:48.400
she would literally wait for a train

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.159
every she'll get back from work she

00:22:50.159 --> 00:22:52.240
worked at a restaurant she would walk

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.159
home at 3am no dude

00:22:54.159 --> 00:22:55.520
this is what keeps me up at night bro

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.559
like even though like my oldest

00:22:56.559 --> 00:22:58.480
daughter's only six and my baby is like

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.720
seven eight weeks old like i still don't

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.159
i literally sometimes wake up in the

00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:03.760
middle of night and just think about how

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.840
many near-death experiences both my

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.760
daughter's gonna have to overcome just

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.440
to make to their 21st birthday like how

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.360
many times like i'll be asleep in my bed

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.200
thinking like oh my both my daughters

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.799
are home safe and they're not they're

00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:15.840
out at three o'clock in the morning

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.520
they're live hit by a bus i'm like yo

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.919
what the so i i can't like deal with it

00:23:19.919 --> 00:23:21.280
sometimes i'm like

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.360
holy [ __ ] you know like what am i gonna

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.520
do but like her mom is tough as [ __ ]

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.600
like jazz vin is tough as [ __ ] so i'm

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.240
like maybe like to deter guys because

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.600
jasmine always told me she's like yo the

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.760
tattoo on my tit kept me safe she was

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.440
like because guys knew like yo if i'm a

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.559
porter you can go with a tattoo on my

00:23:36.559 --> 00:23:38.240
tent i probably got a razor blade on me

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.000
so maybe i should get tattoo tits for

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.840
both my daughters to keep them safe what

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.919

what is this a plane carrying biden's

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.320
press corps was about to take off then

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.960
the cicadas swarmed cicadas

john cicadas i i um

00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:19.039
i i uh

00:28:19.039 --> 00:28:21.120
i genuinely the thing that scares me

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.039
about this type of bug stuff is remember

00:28:23.039 --> 00:28:25.360
that article we read pimp about like the

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.679
the mosquitoes that they were gonna make

00:28:27.679 --> 00:28:29.520
like in factories did you read about

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.600
that yeah and it's like if that happens

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.919
if we're going that route then it's like

00:28:33.919 --> 00:28:35.600
you know the burnt the the black man

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.799
made the right choice yeah yeah because

00:28:36.799 --> 00:28:38.240
that's just gonna that's gonna get out

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.320
of control i think the black man might

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.080
have made by the way name this episode

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.480

that's the name of this episode it has

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.159
to be the black man that's fine i'll

00:29:32.799 --> 00:29:34.240
back to this terry what is terry crews

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.600
even so pretty much people are saying

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.159
because can we say got molested by a guy

00:29:38.159 --> 00:29:40.720
yeah is that possible yeah if you're

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.240
terry crews though

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.279
yeah you're trying to do it he was in

00:29:43.279 --> 00:29:44.640
hollywood dude dudes are grabbing his

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.480
dongs and stuff no no i know that that's

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.399
uncomfortable and that sucks but like do

00:29:48.399 --> 00:29:49.919
you think it's the same like if a guy

00:29:49.919 --> 00:29:51.760
grabbed my dick like well i don't care i

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.200
grabbed your dick last night yeah i know

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.640
i pictured it

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.480
i put it on my instagram i just posted

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.159
it yeah no i'm not [ __ ] on terry

00:29:58.159 --> 00:29:59.919
crews but i'm just like you know so

00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:01.840
anyway the conspiracy theory is uh

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.399
ashton kutcher came out don't shower

00:30:04.399 --> 00:30:05.679
they're saying that rich people are

00:30:05.679 --> 00:30:07.760
starting to churn up that there's going

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.440
to be a water shortage and people should

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.960
shower less

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.720
interesting

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.159
interesting

00:30:14.159 --> 00:30:16.240
that makes sense now see that makes

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.559
sense on why because it's very weird all

00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:21.200
of a sudden out of nowhere nobody's

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.120
showering out of nowhere they're

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.440
promoting it they're all showering

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.640
yeah

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.000
if you ain't sweating you don't need to

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.240
shower no dude my i smell

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.799
i smell brutal yeah but okay but maybe

00:30:32.799 --> 00:30:33.919
i'm not sweating but i definitely have

00:30:33.919 --> 00:30:35.200
come in my belly button am i not

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.039
supposed to shower dude i jerk off it to

00:30:37.039 --> 00:30:39.679
my belly button all day every day

00:30:39.679 --> 00:30:41.840
should i not my shirt my all my shirts

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.440
are going to stick to my belly button

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.600
absolutely yeah dude this is crazy when

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.880
you jerk off you'd like to rip it to

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.679
your belly button what do you do

00:30:49.679 --> 00:30:51.600
small blobs of human brain grow in a

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.520
dish have been coaxed into forming

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.679
rudimentary eyes which respond to light

00:30:55.679 --> 00:30:57.120
by sending signals to the rest of the

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.600
brain tissue so you're saying that pippy

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.919
these people put brain cells in a petri

00:31:01.919 --> 00:31:03.360
dish you just threw some brain in a dish

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.200
and it grew eyes

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.279
[ __ ]

00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:09.600
dude i don't know what that means

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.679
and it already can see could you imagine

00:31:11.679 --> 00:31:13.120
being like ray charles and hearing i'm

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.279
like what the [ __ ] dude you just put a

00:31:15.279 --> 00:31:16.799
brain in a petri dish you can see i

00:31:16.799 --> 00:31:18.399
can't see anything i love that we just

00:31:18.399 --> 00:31:19.760
figured that out what the [ __ ] is the

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.919
human brain well i think pimp and i've

00:31:21.919 --> 00:31:23.120
talked about this many times on the

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.200
podcast we genuinely think like whatever

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.000
we

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.320
find out now like this is this is they

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.080
did that 30 years ago you know what i

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.640
mean like the robots that we see now or

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.080
these things that are like oh my god

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.559
this just happened like the elites it's

00:31:36.559 --> 00:31:38.640
like technology they've had for years so

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.720
whatever we know now is 30 years in the

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.640
past that's what i that's what people i

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.720
don't know i have no proof or frame of

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.480
reference as to why i believe that it

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.399
just sounds good to say it on a podcast

00:31:48.399 --> 00:31:50.000
well when you were high on edibles you

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.840
said that we're iphones but i think

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.080
we're actually vhs players in the robots

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.919
or the iphones like we're on our way out

00:31:55.919 --> 00:31:56.799
here

00:31:56.799 --> 00:31:59.279
let me even comedy right which is an art

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:01.840
form and you say oh humans robots can

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.760
never do it but they absolutely could

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.000
like if they like like that song call me

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.760
maybe that was a song that was

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.159
engineered in a lab it basically took

00:32:10.159 --> 00:32:12.000
what humans respond to why can't you do

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.840
that with jokes just take words that

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.080
humans respond to and do that and it's

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.320
like if that if robots start to kill

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.760
we're done

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.519
dude i genuinely think mark norman was

00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:23.120
made by the government

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.679
i think i think i think he's the first

00:32:25.679 --> 00:32:26.960
one and like he's just out there and

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.960
he's a test he could be and he's doing

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.159
great what's the deal with robot comedy

00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:33.760
do they really have this already

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.000
apparently it's like it's probably still

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.960
[ __ ] crowd it's not no dude robots

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.320
can't do stand-up

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.480
you need to see if the robot could bomb

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.600
yeah

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.679
how yeah and then get nervous yeah and

00:32:45.679 --> 00:32:47.120
embarrassed and embarrassed yeah that's

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.880
what you want to see what a waste of a

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:52.480
robot a robot that gets embarrassed

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.919
that's the robot i would buy just a

war like world war ii or something like

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.960
that and then they came home with like

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.560
all their limbs do you think their wives

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.760
were like did you even fight in the war

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.960

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.399
like do you think they got shamed for

00:34:56.399 --> 00:34:58.079
having all four limbs when they came

00:34:58.079 --> 00:35:00.160
back like really i wonder if like how

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.880
many guys got divorced like years after

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.160
they came back from world war ii because

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.400
they didn't get hurt and they

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.839
yeah i think they had some guilt hundred

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:09.680
percent like survivors guilt a lot of

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.440
i'm sure that costs a lot of marriages

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.520
yeah yeah i think it is correct yeah no

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.640

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.480
big thing my grandfather fought in world

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.560

00:36:17.119 --> 00:36:19.119
his ass chief was like he was like blood

00:36:19.119 --> 00:36:20.320
all running down his leg and he pulled

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.920
down his pants and his ass cheek was

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.680
just hanging off and he said he said i

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.760
literally he said at that time like

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.359
because like you know it's wartime that

00:36:27.359 --> 00:36:29.200
he just went like went on his stomach

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.560
and they just started stitching him up

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.000
like they stitched up his ass he said

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.839
and he was back working like the next

00:36:33.839 --> 00:36:35.599
morning oh my god just with a stitched

00:36:35.599 --> 00:36:37.839
up ass cheek

00:36:37.839 --> 00:36:40.079
my 13 year old sister keeps calling me

00:36:40.079 --> 00:36:42.000
um anxious that they're gonna draft

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.280
women now

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.680
really yeah apparently it's a thing well

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.280
they should do it i mean if if we're

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.880
really about equality

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.560
if you want to talk it

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.560
yeah live it bro you gotta live it yeah

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.320
yeah because bill byrne like all his

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.400
bits about like yeah you you know you're

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.000
the you know women have it easier

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.119
because like they don't you know they're

00:36:59.119 --> 00:37:00.800
the ones who go on the titan get off the

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.400
titanic first they don't have to go to

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.920
war there's some truth to that so if you

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.000
want true equality then i think women

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.960
need to get drafted but not my daughters

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.960
not my kids send them over dude i

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.079
actually should send them because you

00:37:12.079 --> 00:37:14.000
know what that will prepare them that'll

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.520
prepare them to walk down kensington

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.440

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.040
to haunt me yeah yeah i was like yelling

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.720
on the on the podcast like six weeks ago

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.160

absolutely sell them but don't say it

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.640
all the time i think that they're

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.160
definitely right about like every single

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.520

china thing yeah like it's really just

00:43:09.839 --> 00:43:11.599
like one of her interviews on vice and

00:43:11.599 --> 00:43:13.760

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:25.599
here's because here's the thing

00:43:25.599 --> 00:43:27.760
obviously it's like big news the taliban

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.760
is saying though that they're like yo

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.920

that they're shooting women in the head

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.400
for not wearing their head scarves but i

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.640
don't believe either group it's like i

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.319
don't believe the media i think they're

00:43:44.319 --> 00:43:46.160
trying to you know make the taliban out

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.640

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:56.880
feel like we're just a couple years away

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.960
from the talib us needing the taliban to

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:01.520
like straighten [ __ ] out over here like

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.560
i think it's i think after biden it's it

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:06.160
goes aoc and then after that's the

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.000
taliban i think that i think i think

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.839
it's the taliban 2032. it did

00:47:11.839 --> 00:47:12.880
they are

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.720
it is funny it's funny to pretend

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:15.680
they're

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.599
not evil it's funny to be like ah

00:47:17.599 --> 00:47:20.000
taliban's having fun like getting the

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.240
bumper cars going what if the taliban is

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.599
cute

00:47:23.599 --> 00:47:25.040
what if that's who it's been from day

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.720
one well remember last week we read they

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.160
took over clubhouse they were running

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.599
the clubhouse

00:47:29.599 --> 00:47:31.280
taliban is like you could go on social

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.040
media right now and follow the taliban

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.200
like legally it's uh it's one of those

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.880
things man where it's scary but i kind

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.400
of think like again i don't know i've

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.240
known i know nothing about public policy

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:41.920
or what's going on or if we're all just

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:44.000
pawns in this game but it seems like the

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.400
taliban should just let anybody wants to

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.280
leave leave and then we're out and then

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.640
let them do what they need to do and

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:52.720
then there's no more problems like why

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.720
would if we just backed away if the

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.640
united states are fine you deal with it

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.319
and whatever you want to you know make

00:47:58.319 --> 00:48:00.160
women dress cover their face and head to

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.200
toe like

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.119
there'll be no be like you figure it out

00:48:03.119 --> 00:48:05.040
on your side of the world whatever i

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.720
kind of feel like wouldn't that at least

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.000
somewhat

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.559
lead to a drop in terrorism because why

00:48:10.559 --> 00:48:12.240
would they if we're not intervening i

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.760
think there kind of already has been a

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.200
drop in terrorism well that's because of

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.960
co i mean i guess covert but it seems

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.240
like it's gonna people say it's gonna

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.400
come back now i read an article the

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.079
other day that said taliban's in control

00:48:22.079 --> 00:48:25.359
now the um tsa security is like the

00:48:25.359 --> 00:48:27.280
weakest it's ever been like it's it's

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.440
brewing for another 911.

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.960
but i don't know i don't know how about

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.319
some good news

00:48:32.319 --> 00:48:34.559
what's the good news i don't know oh um

00:48:34.559 --> 00:48:37.200
um the good news is drunk woman and the

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.720
woman in the new york city

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.319
now that the taliban is back the boys on

00:48:40.319 --> 00:48:41.839
kensington ave are gonna they're gonna

00:48:41.839 --> 00:48:43.680
run out of some some supply dude that

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:46.079
was all of our [ __ ] opium seriously

00:48:46.079 --> 00:48:49.599
it was 90 95 of europe's opium came from

00:48:49.599 --> 00:48:51.760
afghanistan really yes and now we're not

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:53.440
going to get that and guess who was

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.119
controlling that

00:48:55.119 --> 00:48:56.160
the

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.720
old u.s event the united states yeah bro

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.240
you can look at i mean the stats on that

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.520
are [ __ ] crazy taliban actually

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.800
uh i

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.240
i don't know what year was they

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.839
controlled the opium fields the poppy

00:49:07.839 --> 00:49:09.839
fields and they said no we're not doing

00:49:09.839 --> 00:49:10.720
this

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.640
right and then the u.s took over and it

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.640
just because even even the taliban was

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.880
like this is bad for you yeah they they

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.559
did but then i guess there was like a

00:49:18.559 --> 00:49:20.720
catch-22 where like if the u.s

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.400
destroyed the fields the farmers would

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.760
just join

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.640
isis

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:26.640
or taliban yeah yeah and then if you

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:28.559
like it was it was just a [ __ ] up yeah

00:49:28.559 --> 00:49:29.520
i think

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.400
production

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.880
skyrocketed under the u.s it feels like

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.559
the lessons here now are just like just

00:49:34.559 --> 00:49:36.720
we'll stay on our side like jesus i kind

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.559
of feel like jesus probably gets mad at

00:49:38.559 --> 00:49:40.000
the us all the time he's like i put the

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000
atlantic ocean in between you and

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.920
everybody else so you wouldn't deal with

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:45.200
it but why are you going across and

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.200
dealing with it it's like the whole dude

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.119
you keep talking about building a wall i

00:49:49.119 --> 00:49:50.800
gave you a wall it's called the atlantic

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:52.800
ocean now stop it

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.160
you know like

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.880
that's what it feels like um taliban vow

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.319
to ban heroin but can they survive

00:49:58.319 --> 00:50:00.319

00:50:00.319 --> 00:50:02.640
literally that's that's their that's

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:04.880
their that's what leads their gdp you

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.720
could change taliban to a bunch of my

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:08.720

one of my closest friends is is a doctor

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.000
it's like i'll just do heroin with you

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.599
and if something happens like just

00:51:47.599 --> 00:51:49.040
fix it yeah have you seen people get

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.400

have yeah but you can od on heroin when

00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.520
you get hit with the narcan you'd sit up

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:00.000
and you're like holy [ __ ] so literally

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.599
you there's no way to die of a heroin

00:52:01.599 --> 00:52:03.520
overdose if you have narcan next to you

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.119
i'm sure there's a way but yeah it

00:52:05.119 --> 00:52:07.280
revives you so do heroin addicts kind of

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:08.960
get trying to get their hands on narcan

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.880
just in case no but there's a there's a

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.400
pretty serious debate about whether or

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:13.280
not

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.200

everybody's got to cover it up and put

00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:33.680

00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:38.559
imagine the taliban gets the vaccine

00:56:38.559 --> 00:56:40.799
roll out like better than like canada

00:56:40.799 --> 00:56:42.400
like like they just start rolling that

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.720
[ __ ] out immediately wait so who is this

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:45.839
girl the taliban was never going to

00:56:45.839 --> 00:56:47.359
share power this is vice is this lisa

00:56:47.359 --> 00:56:48.640
ling something

00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:50.240
vice send some lady to go interview the

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.599
taliban i think this is one of the

00:56:51.599 --> 00:56:53.440
taliban can they stop sending [ __ ]

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:54.880
ladies to interview these guys yeah like

00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:58.240
just they hate them they hate women like

00:56:58.240 --> 00:56:59.760
well i don't i don't think they hate

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:00.559
them

00:57:00.559 --> 00:57:02.960
no they just don't want them they just

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.040
they just don't they view them totally i

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:06.559
don't i don't know if hate

they just view themselves

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.680
because in order for them to hate them

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:11.280
they would have to have the views that

00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:12.400
they're equal

00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.480

don't even think it's hate they're just

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.920
like no that's what women do right does

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:19.520
that like they're objects they're just

00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:21.520
like placeholder could you imagine that

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.440
they don't i bet they would

00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:26.319
i bet they wouldn't say their object

00:57:26.319 --> 00:57:27.680

damn all these dudes the person's age

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.680

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.280
she's over aged she's tried legally as

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.880
an adult bro it literally looks like

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.799
they're they're in like a losing team's

01:00:48.799 --> 01:00:50.400
locker room oh god they're there she's

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.520

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.880
like

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.359
just like [ __ ] dude

01:00:57.359 --> 01:01:00.319
oh god whatever they permit dude that

01:01:00.319 --> 01:01:01.599
but see like it's interesting because

01:01:01.599 --> 01:01:03.920
like this when you look at the taliban

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.599
and this like you look kind of getting

01:01:05.599 --> 01:01:07.520
like a look back into history because

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.440
this is how they've been for like

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.280
thousands like a thousand years ago it

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.440
was the same rules so it's like kind of

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.599
like you look this is like present day

01:01:15.599 --> 01:01:17.280
history when you the way these people

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:18.960
think they're they haven't evolved at

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.799
all from like a thousand years ago like

01:01:20.799 --> 01:01:22.400
sharia law has been

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.520
they just they're just doing the same

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.880
[ __ ] whatever they're broke don't fix it

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.720
dude yeah

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.079
how long have they been being attacked

01:01:28.079 --> 01:01:29.599
because i know russia [ __ ] them up

01:01:29.599 --> 01:01:33.839
back it's all for oil all for oil dude

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.280
no

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.720
i don't think

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.400
i don't know how much of it was for oil

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.160
initially then

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:42.240
but they certainly target afghanistan

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.920
like i know that they have i don't think

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.240
it's coincidental that afghanistan is

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.760
like the enemy and they have an oil

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:51.119
field british were there pre-oil

01:01:51.119 --> 01:01:52.799
because they were trying to keep the

01:01:52.799 --> 01:01:55.280
russian empire out of india and

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.039
afghanistan's above her

01:01:57.039 --> 01:01:59.039
got it it's always been kind of a buffer

01:01:59.039 --> 01:02:01.119
zone that that's just proxy wars because

01:02:01.119 --> 01:02:03.200
so then how do we fix like how does it i

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:04.480
think the only way is just everybody

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.680
leaves and just let them do what they

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.599
want to do right like we don't intervene

01:02:07.599 --> 01:02:09.440
with north korea or china's got

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.039
provinces all over where they're taking

01:02:11.039 --> 01:02:12.960
muslim people and shaving their heads

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.319
and doing all these things the united

01:02:14.319 --> 01:02:15.280
states doesn't even think about

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.880
intervening with that so why do we

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.319
intervene here it's very annoying that

01:02:18.319 --> 01:02:21.520
people pretend this is we america goes

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.920
into places for humanitarian efforts

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.319
yeah we don't no be in africa yeah we'd

01:02:26.319 --> 01:02:27.839
be doing all types of things yeah so

01:02:27.839 --> 01:02:29.920
then why do we go like what is it it's

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.839
got to be oil go ahead check those

01:02:31.839 --> 01:02:34.000
[ __ ] opium numbers again yeah you

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.359
think that's what it is i think that had

01:02:35.359 --> 01:02:37.359
a lot i think once we got it was a money

01:02:37.359 --> 01:02:39.200
grab for defense contracts and all that

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.599

01:02:41.599 --> 01:02:42.319
like

01:02:42.319 --> 01:02:44.079
yeah that's all it was they got there

01:02:44.079 --> 01:02:45.359
they're like we can make a ton of money

01:02:45.359 --> 01:02:47.839
here let's stay as long as we want right

01:02:47.839 --> 01:02:49.280
we're not really doing anything these

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.960
people don't want what we're trying to

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:54.000
